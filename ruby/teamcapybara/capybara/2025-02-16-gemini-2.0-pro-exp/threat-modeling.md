# Threat Model Analysis for teamcapybara/capybara

## Threat: [Accidental Production Modification](./threats/accidental_production_modification.md)

*   **Threat:**  Accidental Production Modification

    *   **Description:** A developer or tester misconfigures Capybara (e.g., `Capybara.app_host`) to point to the production environment instead of the intended testing or staging environment.  They then execute tests that include actions like creating, updating, or deleting data. This is a direct result of how Capybara is *used*, not an underlying application vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  Data loss, data corruption, service disruption, and potential reputational damage in the production environment. Unauthorized changes to live data.
    *   **Capybara Component Affected:**  The `Capybara.app_host` configuration setting (or the equivalent mechanism for specifying the target URL) and any methods that interact with the application, such as `visit`, `click_button`, `fill_in`, etc. The core issue is misconfiguration, but these functions are the *means* of interaction.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Environment Configuration:** Use distinct and clearly named environment variables (e.g., `RAILS_ENV`, `CAPYBARA_APP_HOST`) to differentiate between testing, staging, and production. *Never* hardcode the production URL in test code.
        *   **Pre-Flight Checks:** Implement checks within the test setup (e.g., `before(:all)` blocks) to verify the target URL or environment variables *before* any tests are executed. Abort the test run if the environment is incorrect.
        *   **Restricted Test Accounts:** Use separate, dedicated user accounts for testing with limited privileges. These accounts should not have access to modify critical production data.
        *   **Confirmation Prompts/Dry Runs:** For particularly sensitive actions (e.g., deleting data), consider adding confirmation prompts or a "dry run" mode to the test code.
        *   **CI/CD Pipeline Safeguards:** Configure the CI/CD pipeline to enforce environment separation and prevent deployments of test code to production.

## Threat: [Hardcoded Secrets in Test Code](./threats/hardcoded_secrets_in_test_code.md)

*   **Threat:**  Hardcoded Secrets in Test Code

    *   **Description:** A developer hardcodes sensitive information (passwords, API keys, database credentials) directly into Capybara test scripts. These scripts are then committed to a version control system. This is a direct threat because the test code *itself* contains the vulnerability, and Capybara is the tool used to interact with the application using those secrets.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the application, databases, or other services. Compromise of the application and its data.
    *   **Capybara Component Affected:** Any Capybara methods that interact with form fields or other input elements where sensitive data might be entered (e.g., `fill_in`, `choose`, `select`). The issue is the *presence* of secrets in the test code, not a specific function, but these functions are how the secrets are *used*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to store sensitive data. Access these variables within the test code (e.g., `ENV['TEST_PASSWORD']`).
        *   **Secure Configuration Management:** Use a dedicated configuration management system (e.g., a secrets manager) to store and retrieve sensitive data.
        *   **Secrets Scanning:** Implement secrets scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline to detect and prevent the commit of hardcoded secrets.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews to check for hardcoded secrets in test code.
        *   **.gitignore:** Ensure that any files containing sensitive data (e.g., local configuration files) are added to the `.gitignore` file.

## Threat: [Test-Induced Denial of Service (DoS) *[If misconfigured to run against production]*](./threats/test-induced_denial_of_service__dos___if_misconfigured_to_run_against_production_.md)

*   **Threat:** Test-Induced Denial of Service (DoS) *[If misconfigured to run against production]*

    *   **Description:** While primarily a risk in the test environment, if Capybara is misconfigured to run against production (as in the "Accidental Production Modification" threat), poorly designed tests that make excessive requests can cause a DoS. This makes it a *direct* threat of Capybara's misconfiguration and use.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, and potential resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, database connections) on the *production* server.
    *   **Capybara Component Affected:** Any Capybara methods that interact with the application, particularly those used within loops or repeated calls (e.g., `visit`, `click_link`, `find`). The issue is the *pattern* of use combined with incorrect configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if against production)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **All mitigations from "Accidental Production Modification" apply.** This is crucial to prevent this scenario.
        *   **Realistic Test Scenarios:** Design tests to mimic realistic user behavior, including appropriate delays and pauses.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Even in Testing):** Implement rate limiting or throttling, even in the test environment, as a good practice.
        *   **Avoid Unnecessary Loops:** Carefully review test code for unnecessary loops or repeated actions.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor application performance during test execution.

## Threat: [Bypassing Security Controls (Indirectly) *[High due to potential for misuse]*](./threats/bypassing_security_controls__indirectly___high_due_to_potential_for_misuse_.md)

*   **Threat:** Bypassing Security Controls (Indirectly) *[High due to potential for misuse]*

    *   **Description:** Developers use Capybara to directly manipulate the application's state (e.g., setting session cookies, modifying internal state) bypassing normal security controls. While this is done within the *test*, the techniques used could be copied into production code, creating a vulnerability. This is a *direct* threat because it involves the *misuse* of Capybara's capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** If these testing techniques are inadvertently or maliciously used in production code, it could allow attackers to bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access, or manipulate data.
    *   **Capybara Component Affected:** Capybara methods that allow direct manipulation of the browser's state, such as `execute_script` (for executing arbitrary JavaScript), `page.driver.browser.manage.add_cookie` (for setting cookies directly), or methods interacting with hidden form fields or internal APIs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Test Realistic User Flows:** Focus on testing the application through the UI, as a real user would. Avoid "backdoor" methods.
        *   **Code Separation:** Maintain a clear separation between test code and production code. Avoid sharing code or techniques.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Thorough code reviews to ensure test code is not influencing production code insecurely.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Test accounts should have minimal privileges.
