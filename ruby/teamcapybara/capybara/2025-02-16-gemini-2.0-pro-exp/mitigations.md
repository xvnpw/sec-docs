# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for teamcapybara/capybara

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Input Sanitization in Test Data (Capybara Interaction)](./mitigation_strategies/1__input_sanitization_in_test_data__capybara_interaction_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Within your Capybara test code, identify all methods that simulate user input, specifically: `fill_in`, `choose`, `select`, `attach_file`, and any custom methods built on top of these. Also, critically examine any use of `execute_script` or `evaluate_script` that directly manipulates the DOM.
    2.  For *every* instance of these methods, analyze the data being passed as input.
    3.  If the input data contains *any* characters that could be interpreted as HTML or JavaScript (e.g., `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`, `/`, `(`, `)`, `=`, etc.), or if it resembles code, it *must* be sanitized *before* being passed to the Capybara method.
    4.  Use a dedicated sanitization library (like the `sanitize` gem in Ruby).  Do *not* rely solely on the application's input validation.
    5.  Call the sanitization function (e.g., `Sanitize.fragment(input)`) and use the *returned, sanitized value* as the input to the Capybara method.  Example:
        ```ruby
        # UNSAFE:
        fill_in "comment", with: "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"

        # SAFE:
        require 'sanitize'
        malicious_input = "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"
        sanitized_input = Sanitize.fragment(malicious_input)
        fill_in "comment", with: sanitized_input
        ```
    6.  Regularly review test code for new uses of input methods and ensure sanitization is applied consistently.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Test-Induced XSS (High Severity):** Capybara, by interacting with the browser, can *create* XSS vulnerabilities during the test run if unsanitized input is used. This is a direct threat from Capybara's operation.
    *   **Masked Application XSS (High Severity):** If the test data itself contains XSS payloads, it might trigger the application's *existing* defenses, leading to a false negative (the test passes, but a real vulnerability remains).
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Unsanitized input could, in some cases, lead to data corruption if the application's input validation is flawed, and Capybara bypasses client-side checks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Test-Induced XSS:** Risk reduced from High to Very Low.
    *   **Masked Application XSS:** Risk reduced from High to Low (assuming the application *also* sanitizes input).
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Sanitization is used in some feature specs, but not consistently.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in several older specs and in helper methods that generate test data. A consistent, project-wide policy is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Avoid `execute_script` and `evaluate_script` (Capybara-Specific Risk)](./mitigation_strategies/2__avoid__execute_script__and__evaluate_script___capybara-specific_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Thoroughly review all Capybara test files.
    2.  Identify *every* instance of `execute_script` and `evaluate_script`.
    3.  For *each* instance, critically assess if the *same* functionality can be achieved using Capybara's built-in methods (e.g., `fill_in`, `click_on`, `find`, `have_selector`, `have_content`, etc.). These built-in methods are designed to interact with the page in a safer, more controlled way.
    4.  If a built-in Capybara method *can* achieve the desired result, refactor the test to use it.
    5.  If `execute_script` or `evaluate_script` is *absolutely, demonstrably unavoidable*, treat the script string *exactly* like user input. Apply *rigorous* sanitization (as detailed in Mitigation #1) to the script string *before* passing it to these methods.  Document *in detail* why the built-in methods were insufficient.
    6.  Implement a code review policy that *requires* explicit justification and sanitization for *any* new use of `execute_script` or `evaluate_script`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Test-Induced XSS (High Severity):** `execute_script` and `evaluate_script` are the *most direct* ways to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the page during a test, creating a high-risk XSS vulnerability. This is a *direct* consequence of using these Capybara methods.
    *   **Bypassing Application Defenses (Medium Severity):** These methods can bypass client-side validation and security mechanisms, potentially masking real vulnerabilities in the application.
    *   **Unintended Side Effects (Low Severity):** Direct JavaScript execution can have unpredictable and difficult-to-debug side effects, making tests less reliable and potentially affecting the application state.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Test-Induced XSS:** Risk reduced from High to Low (provided sanitization is *always* applied when these methods are unavoidable).
    *   **Bypassing Application Defenses:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Unintended Side Effects:** Risk reduced from Low to Very Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Mostly. A conscious effort has been made to minimize their use, and developers are generally aware of the risks.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Some older test files still use these methods without proper sanitization or justification. A stricter code review policy is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Use Capybara's Waiting Mechanisms (Preventing Timing-Related Issues)](./mitigation_strategies/3__use_capybara's_waiting_mechanisms__preventing_timing-related_issues_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Review all Capybara test files.
    2.  Identify *any* instances of `sleep` or fixed-time delays. These are almost *always* incorrect in Capybara tests.
    3.  Replace *all* instances of `sleep` with Capybara's built-in waiting methods:
        *   `expect(page).to have_selector(...)`: Waits for an element matching the CSS selector to appear.
        *   `expect(page).to have_content(...)`: Waits for the specified text to appear within the page content.
        *   `expect(page).to have_no_selector(...)`: Waits for an element matching the selector to *disappear*.
        *   `expect(page).to have_current_path(...)`: Waits for the browser's current URL to match the given path.
        *   `wait_until { ... }`: Waits until the provided Ruby block returns a truthy value. This is a more general-purpose waiting mechanism.
    4.  Use appropriate timeouts with these waiting methods. Start with Capybara's default timeout (`Capybara.default_max_wait_time`) and adjust *only if necessary*.
    5.  If timing issues *persist* after using the appropriate waiting methods, *then* consider increasing `Capybara.default_max_wait_time` as a *last resort*, and document why this was necessary.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **False Negatives (Medium Severity):** Prevents tests from passing when the application is *actually* broken due to timing issues.  For example, a test might check for an element before it's fully loaded by JavaScript, leading to a false negative (the test passes, but a vulnerability related to that element might exist). This is a direct result of how Capybara interacts with asynchronous web applications.
    *   **False Positives (Low Severity):** Prevents tests from failing when the application is working correctly, but simply taking slightly longer than a fixed `sleep` duration.
    *   **Flaky Tests (Low Severity):** Reduces the likelihood of tests failing intermittently due to variations in network latency, server response time, or browser rendering speed.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **False Negatives:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **False Positives:** Risk reduced from Low to Very Low.
    *   **Flaky Tests:** Risk reduced from Low to Very Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Mostly. Most tests use Capybara's waiting mechanisms correctly.

*   **Missing Implementation:** A few older tests still rely on `sleep` in some places. These need to be refactored to use the appropriate waiting methods.
