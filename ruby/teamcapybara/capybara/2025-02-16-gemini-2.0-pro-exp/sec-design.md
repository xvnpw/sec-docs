Okay, let's dive into designing a comprehensive document for the Capybara project, focusing on security and architecture.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

The Capybara project aims to create a user-friendly, secure, and efficient password manager.  Key priorities include:

*   Providing a secure alternative to browser-based password storage and weak password practices.
*   Offering a seamless user experience across multiple devices (implied by the use of Flutter).
*   Building trust with users through transparency (open-source) and robust security measures.
*   Potentially, future monetization through premium features or enterprise versions (this is a common model for password managers, but not explicitly stated in the repository).
*   Minimizing operational overhead through a serverless architecture.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data Breach:  The most critical risk is a compromise of the user's encrypted password vault. This would severely damage user trust and could have legal and financial repercussions.
*   Loss of User Data:  Data loss due to infrastructure failure, bugs, or user error could lead to significant user frustration and churn.
*   Compromise of Encryption Keys: If the keys used to encrypt user data are compromised, the entire security model collapses.
*   Service Unavailability:  Since this is a password manager, unavailability can prevent users from accessing critical services, causing significant disruption.
*   Reputational Damage:  Any security incident, even a minor one, could significantly harm the project's reputation and adoption rate, especially given the sensitive nature of the data handled.
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Compromise of dependencies or build tools could introduce vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (as inferred from the repository):

*   security control: End-to-End Encryption (E2EE): User data is encrypted on the client-side before being sent to the server. This is evident from the use of client-side encryption libraries and the serverless architecture (which implies the server doesn't have access to decryption keys). Implemented in Flutter application.
*   security control: Use of Supabase: Supabase provides built-in security features like Row Level Security (RLS) and PostgreSQL's security model. Implemented in Supabase.
*   security control: Authentication with Supabase Auth: Leverages Supabase's authentication services, which likely include features like password hashing and secure session management. Implemented in Supabase and Flutter application.
*   security control: Open-Source Codebase:  Allows for community scrutiny and auditing of the code for vulnerabilities. Implemented in GitHub repository.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on Supabase: The project's security is heavily dependent on the security of Supabase's infrastructure and services. While Supabase is generally reputable, there's an inherent risk in relying on a third-party provider.
*   accepted risk: User Device Security: The security of the user's device (phone, computer) is outside the project's direct control. A compromised device could expose the user's master password or decrypted data.
*   accepted risk: Limited Formal Security Audits: While the code is open-source, there's no mention of formal security audits or penetration testing, which are crucial for identifying subtle vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

*   security control: Implement a robust key management strategy. This should include secure generation, storage, and rotation of encryption keys. Consider using a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or a dedicated key management service (KMS) if feasible.
*   security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing by independent security experts.
*   security control: Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks, even though the backend is serverless. Supabase might offer this, or a separate service could be used.
*   security control: Implement rate limiting and brute-force protection on authentication endpoints to prevent attackers from guessing passwords.
*   security control: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activity.
*   security control: Establish a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
*   security control: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) as an option for users, adding an extra layer of security.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Strong password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements).
    *   Secure password hashing (e.g., using Argon2, bcrypt, or scrypt).
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks (rate limiting, account lockout).
    *   Support for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
    *   Secure session management (e.g., using HttpOnly and Secure cookies, short session timeouts).

*   Authorization:
    *   Principle of Least Privilege: Users should only have access to the data and functionality they need.
    *   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) if different user roles are introduced in the future.
    *   Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) should be meticulously configured to ensure data isolation between users.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All user-supplied input (passwords, usernames, etc.) should be strictly validated to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    *   Use of parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection (relevant for any database interactions).

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, well-vetted encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256, ChaCha20).
    *   Secure generation of random numbers using cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs).
    *   Proper implementation of encryption modes (e.g., GCM, CTR with HMAC) to ensure both confidentiality and integrity.
    *   Regular review of cryptographic practices to ensure they remain up-to-date with industry best practices.

Build Process Description:

1.  **Development:** Developers write code on their local workstations and commit changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  **Trigger:** A push to a specific branch (e.g., `main` or a release branch) triggers the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.
3.  **Build:** The pipeline builds the Flutter application for the target platforms (iOS and Android), creating build artifacts (APK for Android, IPA for iOS).
4.  **Testing:** Automated tests (unit tests, integration tests) are executed to ensure code quality and functionality.
5.  **Code Analysis (SAST):** Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are used to scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities. Examples include linters and dedicated SAST scanners.
6.  **Dependency Check:** The project's dependencies are scanned for known vulnerabilities using tools like Dependabot or Snyk.
7.  **Signing:** The build artifacts are digitally signed using the appropriate developer certificates.
8.  **Publish:** The signed artifacts are uploaded to App Store Connect (for iOS) and Google Play Console (for Android) for distribution.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: **GitHub Actions:** Provides a secure and automated environment for building and testing the application.
*   security control: **Secrets Management:** Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, signing certificates) should be stored securely as secrets within GitHub Actions.
*   security control: **SAST Tools:** Help identify security vulnerabilities in the codebase early in the development lifecycle.
*   security control: **Dependency Scanning:** Helps prevent the use of vulnerable third-party libraries.
*   security control: **Code Signing:** Ensures the integrity and authenticity of the application, preventing tampering.
*   security control: **Branch Protection Rules (GitHub):** Enforce policies like requiring code reviews before merging changes to protected branches.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   User Authentication and Authorization: Ensuring only legitimate users can access their password vaults.
*   Data Encryption and Decryption: Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of user data.
*   Data Storage and Retrieval: Ensuring data is stored securely and reliably.
*   Data Synchronization (if implemented): Securely synchronizing data across user devices.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   **User Passwords (Highest Sensitivity):** The most critical data to protect.  Exposure would have severe consequences for users.
*   **Usernames/Emails (High Sensitivity):**  Can be used for phishing attacks or to identify users on other services.
*   **Website/Service URLs (Medium Sensitivity):**  Can reveal information about the user's online activity.
*   **Other Password Vault Data (e.g., notes, secure notes) (Medium to High Sensitivity):**  Depending on the content, this data could be highly sensitive.
*   **Encryption Keys (Highest Sensitivity):**  The compromise of these keys would render all encrypted data vulnerable.
*   **Authentication Tokens (High Sensitivity):**  Could be used to impersonate users.
