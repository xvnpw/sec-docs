## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Gain unauthorized access or manipulate application data/state by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Capybara testing framework.

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* Compromise Application via Capybara Exploitation
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Capybara Itself **[CRITICAL]**
        * **Exploit JavaScript Handling Vulnerabilities** **[CRITICAL]**
            * **Malicious JavaScript Injection via Capybara Actions** **[CRITICAL]**
    * **Abuse Capybara's Interaction with the Application** **[CRITICAL]**
        * **Bypass Client-Side Security Checks** **[CRITICAL]**
            * **Interacting with Disabled or Hidden Elements**
            * **Manipulating Form Submissions Directly** **[CRITICAL]**
    * **Leverage Insecure Test Environment or Practices** **[CRITICAL]**
        * **Expose Sensitive Information in Test Data** **[CRITICAL]**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Exploit JavaScript Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]**

* **Malicious JavaScript Injection via Capybara Actions [CRITICAL]**
    * Description: Using Capybara's JavaScript execution capabilities (e.g., `execute_script`) to inject and run malicious JavaScript within the application under test during a test run.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Low

**2. Abuse Capybara's Interaction with the Application [CRITICAL]**

* **Bypass Client-Side Security Checks [CRITICAL]**
    * Interacting with Disabled or Hidden Elements
        * Description: Using Capybara to interact with elements that are intentionally disabled or hidden from regular user interaction (e.g., via CSS or JavaScript) to bypass client-side validation or access restricted functionalities.
        * Likelihood: High
        * Impact: Medium
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Low
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * **Manipulating Form Submissions Directly [CRITICAL]**
        * Description: Using Capybara to directly manipulate form data and submit it without going through the intended user interface flow, potentially bypassing client-side validation or logic.
        * Likelihood: High
        * Impact: Medium
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Low
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium

**3. Leverage Insecure Test Environment or Practices [CRITICAL]**

* **Expose Sensitive Information in Test Data [CRITICAL]**
    * Description: Sensitive credentials, API keys, or other confidential information are used directly within Capybara test scenarios or fixtures and could be inadvertently exposed (e.g., through error logs, version control).
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Low
