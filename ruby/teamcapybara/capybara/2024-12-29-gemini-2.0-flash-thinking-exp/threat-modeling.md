### High and Critical Capybara-Specific Threats

Here's a list of high and critical security threats that directly involve the Capybara testing library:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Selector Injection in Test Code
    *   **Description:** An attacker who gains access to the test codebase could inject malicious CSS or XPath selectors into Capybara tests. These selectors could be crafted to target unintended elements on the page *through Capybara's element selection mechanisms*, potentially triggering actions like submitting forms with malicious data, clicking on hidden administrative buttons, or navigating to unintended URLs *via Capybara's interaction methods*.
    *   **Impact:** If the test environment interacts with real systems or databases, this could lead to data corruption, unauthorized modifications, or denial of service *orchestrated by Capybara's actions*. In less critical environments, it could lead to misleading test results or wasted resources.
    *   **Affected Capybara Component:** Capybara Selectors (e.g., `find`, `all`, CSS, XPath methods), Capybara Actions (e.g., `click_on`, `fill_in`, `visit`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rigorous code review processes for test code, specifically focusing on the construction and usage of Capybara selectors.
        *   Use parameterized selectors or escaping mechanisms to prevent injection vulnerabilities within Capybara selector usage.
        *   Employ static analysis tools to detect potentially malicious or insecure selector patterns in test code.
        *   Restrict access to the test codebase and infrastructure.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information through Test Logs
    *   **Description:** Capybara interactions and test output might inadvertently log sensitive data, such as user credentials, API keys, or personally identifiable information, that are used during testing. This occurs because *Capybara logs the interactions it performs*, which can include sensitive data present in the application's UI or data submitted through forms. An attacker gaining access to these logs could retrieve this sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of user accounts, access to internal systems, or violation of privacy regulations due to information logged by Capybara.
    *   **Affected Capybara Component:** Capybara Logging (implicitly through driver interactions and test output captured by Capybara).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Capybara and the underlying driver (e.g., Selenium) to redact sensitive information from logs generated during Capybara interactions.
        *   Implement secure log management practices, including access controls, encryption at rest, and secure transmission of logs containing Capybara output.
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly in tests that Capybara interacts with; use environment variables or secure vault solutions.
        *   Regularly review test logs for accidental exposure of sensitive data through Capybara's logging.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities in Capybara or its Drivers
    *   **Description:** Capybara relies on various dependencies (e.g., Selenium, Rack::Test). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited if not properly managed and updated. An attacker could potentially leverage these vulnerabilities if they have access to the test environment or if the vulnerabilities are exposed during test execution *through Capybara's use of these dependencies*.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service within the test environment *via vulnerabilities in Capybara's dependencies*.
    *   **Affected Capybara Component:** Capybara Dependencies (and the underlying driver implementations that Capybara utilizes).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Capybara and its dependencies to the latest versions.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., Bundler Audit for Ruby) to identify and address known vulnerabilities in Capybara's dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Capybara and its dependencies.
