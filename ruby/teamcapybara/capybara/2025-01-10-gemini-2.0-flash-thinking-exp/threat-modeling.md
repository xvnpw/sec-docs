# Threat Model Analysis for teamcapybara/capybara

## Threat: [Malicious JavaScript Injection via `execute_script`](./threats/malicious_javascript_injection_via__execute_script_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who can modify test code could inject malicious JavaScript code through Capybara's `execute_script` method. This script would then be executed within the context of the application under test, potentially leading to actions like data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modifications, defacement of the application, or triggering vulnerabilities within the application's JavaScript code.
    *   **Affected Capybara Component:** `Capybara::Session#execute_script`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes for all test code changes.
        *   Enforce strong access controls for development environments and code repositories.
        *   Regularly scan test code for potential malicious injections.
        *   Avoid constructing JavaScript strings dynamically within `execute_script` based on external input.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerable Capybara Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerable_capybara_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Capybara relies on various Ruby gems. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially exploit them if the application's test environment is targeted.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service in the test environment.
    *   **Affected Capybara Component:** Dependencies managed by Bundler or other package managers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Capybara and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., `bundle audit`) to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Capybara and its dependencies.
