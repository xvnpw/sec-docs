# Attack Surface Analysis for teamcapybara/capybara

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Test Credentials and Data](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_test_credentials_and_data.md)

**Description:** Test scenarios often require the creation and use of specific user accounts or sensitive data. If these credentials or data are not properly managed, they can be exposed.

**How Capybara Contributes:** Test scripts written with Capybara might directly include or generate these credentials and data, making them part of the codebase or test execution logs.

**Example:** A Capybara test script directly defines a username and password for a test user, and this script is stored in a publicly accessible repository.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or the ability to impersonate test users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store test credentials and sensitive data securely (e.g., using environment variables, dedicated secrets management tools).
* Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in Capybara test scripts.
* Implement access controls for test code repositories and testing environments.
* Regularly review and rotate test credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Attacks via Programmatic Input](./attack_surfaces/injection_attacks_via_programmatic_input.md)

**Description:** Capybara's ability to programmatically input data into form fields can be exploited for injection attacks if test data is not carefully handled.

**How Capybara Contributes:** Test scripts might inadvertently introduce malicious scripts (XSS) or commands (e.g., SQL injection if interacting with the database in tests) through the data it inputs.

**Example:** A Capybara test script inputs a string containing a `<script>` tag into a text field, which could be rendered on the page, leading to an XSS vulnerability.

**Impact:** Execution of malicious scripts in the user's browser (XSS) or unauthorized database access (SQL injection if applicable in the test context).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sanitize or escape any potentially malicious data used in test inputs.
* Focus tests on verifying the application's output encoding and input validation.
* Avoid direct database interactions in Capybara tests where possible; use application interfaces.

## Attack Surface: [Risks Associated with Running Tests in Production (Anti-Pattern)](./attack_surfaces/risks_associated_with_running_tests_in_production__anti-pattern_.md)

**Description:** Running Capybara tests against a production environment is a significant security risk.

**How Capybara Contributes:** Capybara's actions in a production environment can lead to unintended data modification, deletion, or exposure.

**Example:** A Capybara test script accidentally deletes critical data in the production database.

**Impact:** Data loss, service disruption, and potential legal repercussions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Absolutely avoid running Capybara tests against production environments.**
* Implement strict environment separation and access controls.
* Clearly differentiate testing and production environments.
