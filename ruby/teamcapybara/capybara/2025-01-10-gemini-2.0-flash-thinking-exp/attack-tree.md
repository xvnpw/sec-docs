## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Arbitrary Code Execution or Data Breach (Root Goal)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_arbitrary_code_execution_or_data_breach__root_goal_.md)

**Description:** The ultimate objective of an attacker targeting the application. Success means gaining unauthorized control or access to sensitive data.
**Why Critical:** Represents the highest level of impact. All other nodes and paths ultimately aim to achieve this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Capybara's Interaction Capabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_capybara's_interaction_capabilities.md)

**Description:**  A broad category encompassing attacks that leverage Capybara's ability to interact with web elements, forms, and JavaScript.
**Why Critical:**  Capybara's core functionality provides numerous attack vectors if not handled securely. Successful exploitation here can lead to direct application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Crafted Selectors Leading to Unintended Actions](./attack_tree_paths/crafted_selectors_leading_to_unintended_actions.md)

**Description:** Attackers craft malicious CSS or XPath selectors that, due to application logic flaws or poorly written selectors, target unintended elements, leading to actions the attacker desires.
**Breakdown:**
* Trigger Administrative Functions Unintentionally:  Using crafted selectors to click buttons or interact with elements that perform administrative tasks without proper authorization.
* Modify Sensitive Data Through Incorrect Element Targeting: Using crafted selectors to target and modify data fields that should not be accessible or modifiable in the current context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Administrative Functions Unintentionally](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_administrative_functions_unintentionally.md)

Using crafted selectors to click buttons or interact with elements that perform administrative tasks without proper authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Sensitive Data Through Incorrect Element Targeting](./attack_tree_paths/modify_sensitive_data_through_incorrect_element_targeting.md)

Using crafted selectors to target and modify data fields that should not be accessible or modifiable in the current context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Capybara's Action Methods](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_capybara's_action_methods.md)

**Description:** Focuses on attacks that abuse Capybara's methods for interacting with forms and triggering actions within the application.
**Why Critical:**  Improperly secured forms and action handling are common vulnerabilities, making this a significant attack surface.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Form Submissions Beyond Intended Scope](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_form_submissions_beyond_intended_scope.md)

**Description:** Attackers use Capybara to add extra fields or modify existing form fields beyond what is intended by the application's design, potentially bypassing validation or injecting malicious data.
**Breakdown:**
* Add Extra Fields or Modify Existing Fields Not Intended: Using Capybara's form manipulation methods to inject unexpected data into the application's processing logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Add Extra Fields or Modify Existing Fields Not Intended](./attack_tree_paths/add_extra_fields_or_modify_existing_fields_not_intended.md)

Using Capybara's form manipulation methods to inject unexpected data into the application's processing logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Capybara's JavaScript Interaction](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_capybara's_javascript_interaction.md)

**Description:** Highlights the risks associated with Capybara's ability to execute JavaScript code within the application's context.
**Why Critical:** JavaScript execution provides powerful capabilities that can be abused for client-side attacks (like XSS) or to manipulate application state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious JavaScript via Capybara](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_javascript_via_capybara.md)

**Description:** Attackers leverage Capybara's `execute_script` or similar functions, using attacker-controlled input, to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the user's browser.
**Breakdown:**
* Leverage `execute_script` or similar functions with attacker-controlled input:  Exploiting scenarios where test scripts or automation logic dynamically construct JavaScript code using untrusted input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage `execute_script` or similar functions with attacker-controlled input](./attack_tree_paths/leverage__execute_script__or_similar_functions_with_attacker-controlled_input.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Capybara's File Upload Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_capybara's_file_upload_handling.md)

**Description:** Attackers abuse Capybara's file upload capabilities to bypass security restrictions or overwrite critical files.
**Breakdown:**
* Bypass File Type Restrictions: Manipulating HTTP headers or file content during the upload process to circumvent client-side file type checks and upload malicious files.
* Overwrite Existing Files: Exploiting predictable file naming conventions or a lack of overwrite protection to replace legitimate files with malicious ones.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass File Type Restrictions](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_file_type_restrictions.md)

Manipulating HTTP headers or file content during the upload process to circumvent client-side file type checks and upload malicious files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Indirect Exploitation via Capybara's Role in Tests/Automation](./attack_tree_paths/indirect_exploitation_via_capybara's_role_in_testsautomation.md)

**Description:**  Focuses on attacks that leverage Capybara's presence in the development and testing environment to compromise the application indirectly.
**Why Critical:** Compromising the development pipeline can have severe consequences, potentially leading to the injection of vulnerabilities into the production application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Development/Testing Environment](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_developmenttesting_environment.md)

**Description:** Gaining unauthorized access to the systems and resources used for developing and testing the application.
**Why Critical:** A compromised development environment can be used to inject malicious code, steal sensitive data, or as a stepping stone to attack the production environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Tests](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_tests.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the development environment and modify Capybara test scripts to include malicious code that executes during test runs.
**Breakdown:**
* Modify tests to execute malicious actions during test runs:  Altering test code to perform actions like creating backdoor accounts, exfiltrating data, or modifying application logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate Sensitive Data from Test Environment](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_sensitive_data_from_test_environment.md)

**Description:** Attackers use Capybara test scripts to access and extract sensitive information (like credentials or API keys) that is present in the testing environment.
**Breakdown:**
* Access credentials or other sensitive data used in testing: Writing test code that reads environment variables, configuration files, or database contents to steal sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access credentials or other sensitive data used in testing](./attack_tree_paths/access_credentials_or_other_sensitive_data_used_in_testing.md)
