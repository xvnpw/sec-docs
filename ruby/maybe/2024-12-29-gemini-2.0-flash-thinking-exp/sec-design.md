### 6. Data Flow

The following describes the typical data flow for several key user interactions within the Maybe Finance application:

*   **User Login:**
    1. The user submits their login credentials (username/email and password) through the User Interface (Web Browser or Mobile App).
    2. The User Interface sends the credentials to the API Gateway over a secure HTTPS connection.
    3. The API Gateway routes the request to the Authentication Service.
    4. The Authentication Service retrieves the user's stored credentials from the User Data Database.
    5. The Authentication Service verifies the provided password against the stored hash.
    6. Upon successful authentication, the Authentication Service generates a secure access token (e.g., JWT) and returns it to the API Gateway.
    7. The API Gateway returns the access token to the User Interface.
    8. Subsequent requests from the User Interface to other backend services include this access token in the authorization header for authentication and authorization.

*   **Fetching Transactions from a Financial Institution:**
    1. The user initiates the process of connecting to a financial institution through the User Interface.
    2. The User Interface sends a request to the API Gateway, including details of the financial institution.
    3. The API Gateway authenticates the request using the provided access token and routes it to the Aggregation Service.
    4. The Aggregation Service retrieves the user's securely stored credentials or tokens for the specified financial institution from the User Data Database.
    5. The Aggregation Service authenticates with the External Financial Institution API using the retrieved credentials.
    6. The External Financial Institution API returns transaction data to the Aggregation Service.
    7. The Aggregation Service normalizes and transforms the received data into a consistent internal format.
    8. The Aggregation Service publishes the processed transaction data to the Message Queue.
    9. The Transaction Service consumes the messages from the Message Queue.
    10. The Transaction Service stores the transaction data in the Transaction Data Database.
    11. The Transaction Service may trigger the Notification Service to send a notification to the user about new transactions.

*   **Viewing Transaction History:**
    1. The user requests to view their transaction history through the User Interface.
    2. The User Interface sends a request to the API Gateway, including the user's access token.
    3. The API Gateway authenticates the request and routes it to the Transaction Service.
    4. The Transaction Service queries the Transaction Data Database to retrieve the relevant transaction data for the user.
    5. The Transaction Service returns the transaction data to the API Gateway.
    6. The API Gateway sends the transaction data back to the User Interface for display.

### 7. Security Considerations (Detailed)

This section outlines key security considerations for the Maybe Finance application, providing a foundation for threat modeling activities.

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password requirements (length, complexity, character types) during user registration and password changes.
    *   **Secure Password Storage:** Store user passwords using strong, one-way hashing algorithms (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt) with unique salts for each user.
    *   **Robust Access Token Management:** Utilize secure and industry-standard access token mechanisms (e.g., JWT with short expiration times) to authorize access to protected resources. Implement token refresh mechanisms securely.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to control access to specific functionalities and data based on user roles.
    *   **Protection Against Brute-Force Attacks:** Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks on login endpoints.
    *   **Credential Stuffing Prevention:** Employ techniques to detect and mitigate credential stuffing attacks.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Offer and encourage users to enable MFA (e.g., TOTP, SMS verification) for an added layer of security.
    *   **Secure Session Management:** Implement secure session management practices to prevent session hijacking.

*   **Data Security:**
    *   **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest in both the User Data and Transaction Data databases using appropriate encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
    *   **Encryption in Transit:** Enforce HTTPS (TLS/SSL) for all communication between the client and the server, and between internal services, to protect data in transit.
    *   **Secure Storage of API Keys and Secrets:** Store API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive secrets securely using dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager). Avoid storing secrets in code or configuration files.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Vulnerability Scanning:** Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scans (both static and dynamic analysis) to identify and address potential security weaknesses.
    *   **Data Minimization:** Collect and store only the necessary data required for the application's functionality.
    *   **Data Anonymization and Pseudonymization:** Consider anonymizing or pseudonymizing sensitive data where appropriate, especially for analytical purposes.

*   **API Security:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on all API endpoints to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    *   **Output Encoding:** Encode output data properly to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and abuse.
    *   **Proper Error Handling:** Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
    *   **Secure API Design:** Follow secure API design principles (e.g., OWASP API Security Top 10).
    *   **Authentication and Authorization for All Endpoints:** Ensure all API endpoints require proper authentication and authorization.

*   **Third-Party Integrations:**
    *   **Secure Handling of User Credentials:** Implement secure mechanisms for handling user credentials required for connecting to external financial institutions, such as using secure credential storage and retrieval practices.
    *   **Careful Evaluation of Third-Party APIs:** Thoroughly evaluate the security posture and reputation of third-party APIs before integration.
    *   **Least Privilege Principle:** Grant only the necessary permissions to third-party integrations.
    *   **Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms:** Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms for dealing with failures or security issues in third-party APIs.
