# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Puppet project aims to provide an infrastructure-as-code solution for automating the provisioning, configuration, and management of IT infrastructure. The primary business priorities and goals that Puppet addresses are:

- Infrastructure Automation: Automating repetitive and manual tasks related to infrastructure management, reducing operational overhead and human error.
- Configuration Management: Ensuring consistent and desired state configurations across all managed systems, improving system reliability and compliance.
- Scalability and Efficiency: Enabling organizations to manage infrastructure at scale efficiently, supporting business growth and agility.
- Compliance and Auditability: Providing a traceable and auditable system for infrastructure changes, facilitating compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies.
- Reduced Downtime: Minimizing configuration drift and ensuring consistent system states, leading to reduced downtime and improved service availability.

Key business risks associated with these priorities and goals include:

- Misconfiguration Risk: Incorrect or unintended configurations deployed through Puppet could lead to system outages, performance degradation, or security vulnerabilities across the managed infrastructure.
- Security Vulnerability Risk: Vulnerabilities in the Puppet software itself or in the managed configurations could be exploited to compromise the managed infrastructure.
- Compliance Violation Risk: Failure to properly configure and manage systems using Puppet could result in non-compliance with industry regulations or internal security policies, leading to legal and financial repercussions.
- Operational Disruption Risk: Issues with the Puppet infrastructure (e.g., Puppet Server downtime) could disrupt infrastructure management operations and impact the ability to deploy critical updates or respond to incidents.
- Data Breach Risk: Exposure of sensitive configuration data managed by Puppet (e.g., credentials, secrets) could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.

Build Process Description:

The Puppet project build process typically involves the following steps, focusing on security controls:

1. Developer Workstation: Developers write code, including Puppet modules and core Puppet components, on their local workstations. Security controls: Secure coding practices, workstation security hardening, and code review before committing.
2. Version Control System (GitHub): Code is committed to a version control system, such as GitHub. Security controls: Access control to the repository, branch protection rules, code review process enforced through pull requests.
3. CI/CD System (GitHub Actions): A CI/CD system, like GitHub Actions, is triggered upon code changes in the repository. Security controls: Secure CI/CD pipeline configuration, access control to CI/CD system, and audit logging.
4. Build Process: The CI/CD system executes the build process, which includes:
    - Code Linting: Automated linters check the code for style and potential errors. Security controls: Automated code quality checks to identify potential security issues and coding flaws.
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST): SAST tools analyze the source code for security vulnerabilities. Security controls: Early detection of potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
    - Dependency Scanning: Tools scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Security controls: Identification of vulnerable dependencies to ensure supply chain security.
5. Automated Testing: Automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and security tests, are executed. Security controls: Verification of code functionality and security properties through automated testing.
6. Build Artifacts: If tests pass, build artifacts are created, such as packages (RPM, DEB) for Puppet Server and Agent, and Puppet modules. Security controls: Artifact signing to ensure integrity and authenticity.
7. Artifact Repositories: Build artifacts are published to artifact repositories, such as the Puppet Forge for modules and internal repositories for Puppet packages. Security controls: Access control to artifact repositories, secure artifact storage, and vulnerability scanning of published artifacts.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes protected by Puppet:

- Infrastructure Provisioning: Automating the creation and setup of new infrastructure resources.
- Configuration Management: Ensuring consistent and desired configurations across all managed systems.
- Application Deployment: Deploying and configuring applications on managed infrastructure.
- Compliance Enforcement: Enforcing security and compliance policies across the IT environment.
- Incident Response: Facilitating rapid and consistent remediation of security incidents through automated configuration changes.

Data being protected and its sensitivity:

- Configuration Data: Puppet manages sensitive configuration data, including:
  - Credentials (passwords, API keys, certificates) used for system access and authentication. Sensitivity: High. Exposure could lead to unauthorized access and system compromise.
  - Network Configurations (firewall rules, routing tables). Sensitivity: High. Misconfiguration or exposure could disrupt network operations or create security vulnerabilities.
  - Application Configurations. Sensitivity: Medium to High, depending on the application and data it handles. Misconfiguration could lead to application vulnerabilities or data breaches.
- System Inventory Data: PuppetDB stores information about managed nodes, including hardware and software inventory, and configuration status. Sensitivity: Medium. Exposure could provide attackers with information about the IT environment.
- Audit Logs: Puppet generates audit logs of configuration changes and user activities. Sensitivity: Medium. Logs are important for security monitoring and incident investigation.
