# Threat Model Analysis for puppetlabs/puppet

## Threat: [Master Compromise via Malicious Certificate Request](./threats/master_compromise_via_malicious_certificate_request.md)

*   **Threat:** Master Compromise via Malicious Certificate Request

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious certificate signing request (CSR) that, when signed by the Puppet CA, grants the attacker elevated privileges or allows them to impersonate a legitimate node.  This exploits vulnerabilities in the CSR parsing or signing process *within the Puppet Master itself*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the Puppet infrastructure; ability to deploy malicious configurations to all managed nodes; data exfiltration.
    *   **Affected Component:** Puppet Master (CA, certificate handling logic *specifically*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict CSR Validation:** Implement robust validation of *all* CSRs before signing.  This includes checks on the requested hostname, extensions, and other attributes, going beyond simple hostname matching.  Specifically target Puppet's CSR handling.
        *   **Manual CSR Approval:** Require manual approval for all CSRs, especially for nodes with sensitive roles.
        *   **Automated CSR Analysis:** Use tools to automatically analyze CSRs for suspicious patterns or anomalies, focusing on Puppet-specific attributes.
        *   **Short-Lived Certificates:** Use short-lived certificates to limit the impact of a compromised certificate.
        *   **Certificate Revocation:** Have a well-defined and tested process for revoking compromised certificates.

## Threat: [Code Injection in Custom Facts](./threats/code_injection_in_custom_facts.md)

*   **Threat:** Code Injection in Custom Facts

    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a system and modifies a *Puppet custom fact* (written in Ruby, shell, or another language supported *by Facter*) to execute arbitrary code when the fact is evaluated by the *Puppet agent*. This leverages the fact execution mechanism *within Puppet*.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code on the Puppet agent with the agent's privileges (often root); potential for lateral movement; data exfiltration.
    *   **Affected Component:** Puppet Agent (Facter, custom fact execution *specifically*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Fact Development:** Follow secure coding practices when developing custom facts *for Puppet*. Avoid using `eval` or similar constructs. Sanitize all input *within the context of Facter*.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Puppet agent with the minimum necessary privileges.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Monitor the integrity of custom fact files to detect unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Code Review:** Review all custom fact code for security vulnerabilities, focusing on how they interact with Facter.
        *   **Sandboxing (if feasible):** Explore options for sandboxing the execution of custom facts *within the Puppet agent* to limit their impact.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Module Installation from Forge (Typosquatting)](./threats/unauthorized_module_installation_from_forge__typosquatting_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Module Installation from Forge (Typosquatting)

    *   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious *Puppet module* to the Puppet Forge with a name similar to a popular, legitimate module. An administrator unknowingly installs the malicious module *using Puppet's module tooling*.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code on managed nodes via the malicious *Puppet module*; data exfiltration; system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Puppet Master (module installation via `puppet module install`), Puppet Agent (module execution).  This is a direct threat because it involves Puppet's module management system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Module Selection:** Double-check the module name, author, and download count before installing a module from the Puppet Forge *using Puppet tools*.
        *   **Module Verification:** Verify the checksum of downloaded modules against the checksum provided by the Puppet Forge *before installation with Puppet*.
        *   **Code Review:** Review the code of third-party *Puppet modules* before deploying them.
        *   **Internal Module Repository:** Use an internal module repository to host trusted *Puppet modules* and prevent accidental installation from the public Forge.
        *   **Module Signing (if supported):** Use *Puppet's* module signing capabilities to verify authenticity.

## Threat: [Hiera Data Leakage via Unencrypted Puppet Transport](./threats/hiera_data_leakage_via_unencrypted_puppet_transport.md)

*   **Threat:** Hiera Data Leakage via Unencrypted Puppet Transport

    *   **Description:** *Hiera data*, which may contain sensitive information, is transmitted between the Puppet Master and agents in plain text *over Puppet's communication channel*. An attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack to intercept this *Puppet-specific* traffic.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information (passwords, API keys, etc.) stored *within Hiera*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Puppet Master (Hiera data serving), Puppet Agent (Hiera data retrieval), *Puppet's communication channel*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **TLS Encryption:** Ensure that *all communication between the Puppet Master and agents* is encrypted using TLS. This is a *core Puppet configuration* requirement.
        *   **Hiera-Eyaml (or similar):** Encrypt sensitive data *within Hiera itself* using `hiera-eyaml` or a comparable solution. This protects data even if the *Puppet transport* is compromised or Hiera files are accessed directly.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate *Puppet traffic* on a secure network segment.

## Threat: [`Exec` Resource Abuse (within Puppet)](./threats/_exec__resource_abuse__within_puppet_.md)

*   **Threat:** `Exec` Resource Abuse (within Puppet)

    *   **Description:** An attacker leverages the *Puppet `exec` resource* to run arbitrary commands on a managed node.  This is a direct Puppet threat because it involves the misuse of a core Puppet resource type. The vulnerability arises when the `command` attribute is constructed using untrusted input without proper sanitization *within a Puppet manifest*.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the target node, potentially with elevated privileges, *initiated by Puppet*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Puppet Agent (`exec` resource *specifically*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid `exec` When Possible:** Use more specific *Puppet resource types* (e.g., `package`, `service`, `file`) whenever possible.
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** If you *must* use `exec` *within Puppet*, thoroughly validate and sanitize all input used to construct the command. Use whitelisting.
        *   **Parameterization:** Use the `onlyif`, `unless`, `creates`, and `path` attributes of the *Puppet `exec` resource* to limit its execution.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run `exec` commands *within Puppet* with the minimum necessary privileges.
