## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Puppet Server](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_puppet_server.md)

*   **Exploit Puppet Server Vulnerabilities***
    *   **CVE-XXXX (Specific, known vulns)***:
        *   **Description:** Exploiting publicly known and documented vulnerabilities in the Puppet Server software (e.g., Puppet Server, PuppetDB).
        *   **Mitigation:** Regularly apply security patches and updates. Use vulnerability scanners. Subscribe to security advisories.
    *   **Weak Authentication/Authorization***:
        *   **Description:** Gaining access to the Puppet Server due to weak passwords, default credentials, or insufficient access controls.
        *   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong, unique passwords. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA). Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Regularly audit user accounts and permissions.
*    **Compromise Puppet Agent (Initial Access)***
    *   **Exploit Agent Vulnerabilities***
        *   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Puppet Agent software running on managed nodes. This could allow an attacker to gain initial access to a node.
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep Puppet Agent software up-to-date. Regularly scan for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Legitimate Puppet Features](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_legitimate_puppet_features.md)

*   **Hiera Data Poisoning***
    *   **Modify Hiera data to inject malicious commands***:
        *   **Description:**  Altering data within Hiera (Puppet's key-value configuration data store) to include malicious commands or configurations that will be executed by Puppet.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Implement strict access controls on Hiera data sources (e.g., Git repositories, databases). Validate and sanitize all Hiera data. Use version control and audit trails.
    *   **Gain access to Hiera data source (e.g., Git)***:
        *   **Description:**  Obtaining unauthorized access to the repository or system where Hiera data is stored, enabling modification of the data.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Secure the Hiera data source with strong authentication and authorization. Monitor access logs. Use network segmentation to isolate the data source.
*   **Abuse `template` or `inline_template` Functions**
    *   **Inject malicious code into templates**:        *   **Description:**  Inserting malicious code into Puppet templates, which will be executed when the template is rendered.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Treat templates as code. Validate and sanitize all input to templates. Avoid using user-supplied input directly in templates. Use a template linter.
*   **Abuse External Command Execution (e.g., `exec`)***
    *   **Craft `exec` resources with malicious commands***:
        *   **Description:**  Creating Puppet `exec` resources that execute arbitrary, attacker-controlled commands on the managed node.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Avoid using `exec` with untrusted input. If `exec` is necessary, strictly validate and sanitize the command and its arguments. Use a whitelist of allowed commands and arguments. Prefer built-in Puppet resource types over `exec` whenever possible.
