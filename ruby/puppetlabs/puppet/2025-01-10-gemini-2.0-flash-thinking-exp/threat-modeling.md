# Threat Model Analysis for puppetlabs/puppet

## Threat: [Compromised Puppet Master](./threats/compromised_puppet_master.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Puppet Master
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Puppet Master server, potentially through exploiting vulnerabilities in the Puppet Server application itself, its dependencies, or by compromising credentials used to access the master. They might then modify configurations, inject malicious code into modules via the Puppet API or filesystem, or exfiltrate sensitive data managed by Puppet.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the configuration of all managed nodes, leading to widespread malware deployment, data breaches, service disruption across the infrastructure, and potential credential theft.
    *   **Affected Component:** Puppet Master (specifically the Puppet Server application, its API, file serving mechanisms, and potentially the underlying operating system in the context of running Puppet services).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls (RBAC) within Puppet and on the underlying system.
        *   Regularly patch the Puppet Server application and its dependencies.
        *   Harden the Puppet Master server according to security best practices for Puppet deployments.
        *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) focused on Puppet Master activity.
        *   Use strong, unique passwords and multi-factor authentication for accessing the Puppet Master and its administrative interfaces.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest on the Puppet Master, including module code and Hiera data.

## Threat: [Malicious Puppet Module Injection](./threats/malicious_puppet_module_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Puppet Module Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to the Puppet code repository or the module path on the Puppet Master injects a malicious module or modifies an existing one. This could be done through direct filesystem access, exploiting vulnerabilities in the Puppet code management tools (like r10k or Code Manager), or by compromising developer credentials. The malicious module could contain Puppet code designed to execute arbitrary commands on managed nodes, steal data through Puppet resources, or disrupt services managed by Puppet.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of managed nodes as Puppet applies the malicious configurations, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruptions, and the establishment of persistent backdoors managed through Puppet.
    *   **Affected Component:** Puppet Modules (specifically the module code, resource types, and functions executed by the Puppet Agent).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls and code review processes for Puppet module development and deployment, including the use of pull requests and approvals.
        *   Utilize module signing and verification mechanisms within Puppet to ensure module integrity.
        *   Regularly scan Puppet code for vulnerabilities and malicious patterns using static analysis tools integrated with Puppet workflows.
        *   Restrict write access to the Puppet module path on the Puppet Master to authorized personnel and systems only.
        *   Consider using a private module repository with granular access controls and audit logging.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Agent-Master Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_agent-master_communication.md)

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Agent-Master Communication
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between a Puppet Agent and the Puppet Master. This could happen on the network level. They might then attempt to modify the catalog being sent to the agent by manipulating the data stream, inject malicious resources into the catalog, or eavesdrop on sensitive information exchanged during the communication, such as node facts or resource declarations.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromised node configurations as malicious catalogs are applied, potential deployment of arbitrary code on targeted agents via manipulated resources, and exposure of sensitive configuration data that could aid further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Puppet Agent (the communication client), Puppet Master API (the communication server and catalog compilation process), and the underlying network transport used by Puppet.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS for all communication between Puppet Agents and the Puppet Master, ensuring proper certificate validation.
        *   Implement robust certificate management and rotation processes for both Puppet Master and Agents.
        *   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication of agents by verifying the agent's certificate on the master.
        *   Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and unexpected communication patterns between agents and the master.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Hiera Data](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_hiera_data.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Hiera Data
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Hiera data sources (e.g., YAML or JSON files) directly on the Puppet Master's filesystem or through vulnerabilities in systems integrating with Hiera. This data is used by Puppet to parameterize configurations and often contains sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or environment-specific configurations intended for use by Puppet.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials and configuration details that are directly used by Puppet to manage systems, which can be used to compromise those systems or gain unauthorized access to resources managed by Puppet.
    *   **Affected Component:** Hiera (specifically the data sources, the lookup mechanisms within Puppet, and the storage of Hiera data).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls on Hiera data sources at the filesystem level on the Puppet Master.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data within Hiera using tools like `eyaml` or secure secrets management integrations specifically designed for use with Puppet (e.g., HashiCorp Vault integration).
        *   Avoid storing highly sensitive secrets directly in plain text within Hiera; use indirection or secure lookup mechanisms.
        *   Regularly audit access to Hiera data and the systems where it is stored.
