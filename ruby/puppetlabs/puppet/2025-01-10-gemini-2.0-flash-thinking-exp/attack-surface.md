# Attack Surface Analysis for puppetlabs/puppet

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access to Puppet Master API](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access_to_puppet_master_api.md)

*   **Description:**  The Puppet Master API, used for tasks like retrieving node data or triggering catalog compilations, is accessible without proper authentication.
    *   **How Puppet Contributes:** Puppet's architecture includes a central API for management. If this API isn't secured, it becomes a direct entry point.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could query the API to discover all managed nodes and their configurations or trigger a catalog compilation with malicious parameters.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive infrastructure information, potential for unauthorized configuration changes on managed nodes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., certificate-based authentication).
        *   Enforce authorization policies to restrict API access based on roles and responsibilities.
        *   Regularly review and update API access configurations.
        *   Disable or restrict access to unnecessary API endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via Puppet Code (Manifests, Modules)](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_puppet_code__manifests__modules_.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious or compromised Puppet code is executed on the Puppet Master or Agents, leading to arbitrary command execution.
    *   **How Puppet Contributes:** Puppet's core functionality involves executing code (Puppet DSL, Ruby in custom resources/functions) on managed systems.
    *   **Example:** A compromised Puppet module contains a custom resource that executes a shell command to download and run a malicious script on all managed nodes.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of managed nodes, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rigorous code review processes for all Puppet code.
        *   Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in Puppet code.
        *   Enforce strict module signing and verification to prevent the use of untrusted modules.
        *   Limit the use of shell commands within Puppet code; prefer built-in resources or idempotent custom resources.
        *   Practice the principle of least privilege when writing custom resources and functions.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Puppet Server Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_puppet_server_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws exist in the third-party libraries and components that Puppet Server relies on.
    *   **How Puppet Contributes:** Puppet Server is a complex application built on various open-source components. Vulnerabilities in these components can directly impact Puppet Server's security.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in the Jetty web server (used by Puppet Server) allows for remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the Puppet Master server, potentially leading to control over the entire managed infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Puppet Server and its dependencies to the latest versions.
        *   Implement a vulnerability scanning process for Puppet Server and its underlying operating system.
        *   Follow security best practices for the operating system hosting Puppet Server.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Master-Agent Communication](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_master-agent_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and potentially modifies communication between the Puppet Master and Agents.
    *   **How Puppet Contributes:** Puppet relies on network communication between the Master and Agents to distribute and apply configurations.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the network intercepts communication and injects malicious configuration data, causing Agents to execute unwanted commands.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized configuration changes on managed nodes, potential for malware deployment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS encryption for all communication between the Puppet Master and Agents.
        *   Use certificate-based authentication to ensure the identity of both the Master and Agents.
        *   Implement network segmentation to limit the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Modules from Puppet Forge or Internal Repositories](./attack_surfaces/malicious_modules_from_puppet_forge_or_internal_repositories.md)

*   **Description:**  Puppet modules, whether from the public Forge or internal repositories, contain malicious code or vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Puppet Contributes:** Puppet's modular architecture encourages the use of external modules, introducing a dependency on their security.
    *   **Example:** A seemingly benign module contains a hidden backdoor that allows an attacker to gain remote access to managed nodes.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of managed nodes, data breaches, introduction of vulnerabilities into the infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and review all Puppet modules before use, regardless of the source.
        *   Utilize private module repositories with access controls and auditing.
        *   Implement module signing and verification mechanisms.
        *   Regularly scan modules for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Minimize the number of external modules used and prefer well-maintained and reputable sources.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation via Puppet Agent](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation_via_puppet_agent.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Puppet code or custom resources allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges on a managed node.
    *   **How Puppet Contributes:** Puppet Agents often run with elevated privileges (e.g., root) to manage system configurations.
    *   **Example:** A flaw in a custom resource allows a local user to execute arbitrary commands as root.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the compromised node.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when writing custom resources and functions.
        *   Carefully review the permissions and user context under which Puppet resources are executed.
        *   Implement security auditing on managed nodes to detect suspicious activity.
