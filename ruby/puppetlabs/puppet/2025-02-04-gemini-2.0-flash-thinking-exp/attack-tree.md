```

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Puppet Infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_puppet_infrastructure.md)

Description:  This is the overarching critical node. Success here means the attacker has control over some part of the Puppet ecosystem, allowing them to manipulate configurations and potentially compromise managed applications.
Why Critical:  Puppet is the central configuration management tool. Compromise here has widespread impact across all managed systems and applications.
Mitigation Focus: Implement robust security across the entire Puppet infrastructure, including Master, Agents, and code repositories.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Puppet Master Server](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_puppet_master_server.md)

Description: The Puppet Master is the brain of the operation. Compromising it grants the attacker the ability to control configurations pushed to all agents.
Why Critical:  Full control over configuration management. Can lead to immediate and widespread application compromise, data breaches, and service disruption.
Mitigation Focus: Hardening Puppet Master server, patching, strong access controls, network segmentation, intrusion detection, and insider threat prevention.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Puppet Code/Configuration (Manifests, Modules)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_puppet_codeconfiguration__manifests__modules_.md)

Description:  Malicious or vulnerable code within Puppet manifests and modules is directly executed on managed nodes.
Why Critical:  Direct path to application compromise. Malicious code can be deployed at scale, affecting many systems simultaneously.
Mitigation Focus: Secure coding practices, code review, input validation in manifests, module security and trust, secrets management, version control, and static analysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insider Threat/Malicious Administrator](./attack_tree_paths/insider_threatmalicious_administrator.md)

Description: A malicious administrator with access to the Puppet Master can intentionally compromise the system.
Why Critical:  Bypasses many security controls. Insider knowledge allows for stealthy and impactful attacks.
Mitigation Focus: Strong vetting processes, principle of least privilege, separation of duties, audit trails, behavioral monitoring, and incident response planning for insider threats.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insider Threat/Malicious Developer](./attack_tree_paths/insider_threatmalicious_developer.md)

Description: A malicious developer with access to Puppet code repositories can introduce backdoors or vulnerabilities into manifests and modules.
Why Critical:  Malicious code can be deployed at scale through normal Puppet workflows. Difficult to detect through standard security measures.
Mitigation Focus: Secure code development lifecycle, code review, access controls to code repositories, module integrity checks, and behavioral analysis of Puppet deployments.

Why High-Risk:  Password reuse is common. Breached credential lists are readily available.
Likelihood: Medium (depends on password reuse).
Impact: Critical (full Puppet Master compromise).
Effort: Low.

Detection Difficulty: Medium (login monitoring, anomaly detection).
Mitigation: Enforce strong, unique passwords. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA). Monitor for suspicious login attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Phishing/Social Engineering for Puppet Master Admin Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/phishingsocial_engineering_for_puppet_master_admin_credentials.md)

Attack Vector: Tricking administrators into revealing their Puppet Master credentials through phishing emails or social engineering tactics.
Why High-Risk:  Social engineering can be effective against even technically skilled individuals.
Likelihood: Medium (depends on security awareness training effectiveness).
Impact: Critical (full Puppet Master compromise).
Effort: Low to Medium.
Skill Level: Low to Medium.
Detection Difficulty: Medium (user reporting, email security).
Mitigation: Security awareness training, phishing simulations, email security solutions, and strong password policies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Web UI Vulnerabilities of Puppet Master](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_web_ui_vulnerabilities_of_puppet_master.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting web application vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection) in the Puppet Master's web interface (if exposed).
Why High-Risk:  Web UI vulnerabilities are common. Can lead to session hijacking, privilege escalation, or direct system compromise.
Likelihood: Medium (depends on web UI security testing).
Impact: Critical (potentially full Puppet Master compromise).
Effort: Low to Medium.
Skill Level: Medium.
Detection Difficulty: Medium (WAF, web server logs).
Mitigation: Secure coding practices for web UI, regular security testing (DAST, SAST), Web Application Firewall (WAF), and input validation.

Attack Vector: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system running the Puppet Master server.
Why High-Risk:  OS vulnerabilities are common. Compromising the OS directly compromises the Puppet Master.
Likelihood: Medium (depends on OS patching cadence).
Impact: Critical (full Puppet Master compromise).
Effort: Medium (exploits may be public).
Skill Level: Medium.
Detection Difficulty: Medium (IDS/IPS, logs).
Mitigation: Rigorous OS patching, system hardening, vulnerability scanning, and intrusion detection.

Attack Vector: Exploiting network misconfigurations or vulnerabilities (exposed ports, weak firewall rules) to gain unauthorized access to the Puppet Master.
Why High-Risk:  Network misconfigurations are common. Direct network access can bypass other security layers.
Likelihood: Medium (depends on network security practices).
Impact: Critical (access to Puppet Master, potential full compromise).
Effort: Low to Medium.
Skill Level: Medium.
Detection Difficulty: Medium (network monitoring, firewall logs).
Mitigation: Network segmentation, strict firewall rules, regular network security audits, and intrusion detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Puppet Agent](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities__cves__in_puppet_agent.md)
