- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Puppet Server should authenticate agents connecting to it.
    - Requirement: Users accessing Puppet Server web UI or CLI should be authenticated.
    - Requirement: Mechanisms for secure authentication should be configurable and support strong authentication methods.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions within Puppet Server.
    - Requirement: Agents should be authorized to perform actions on managed nodes based on defined policies.
    - Requirement: Access to sensitive configuration data and secrets should be restricted based on authorization policies.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All inputs to Puppet Server and Agents, including configuration data and API requests, must be validated to prevent injection attacks.
    - Requirement: Configuration language (Puppet DSL) should be designed to minimize risks of insecure configurations.
    - Requirement: Validate data received from external systems and data sources.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Protect sensitive data at rest and in transit using encryption.
    - Requirement: Securely manage cryptographic keys used for encryption and authentication.

    style F fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

- Build Process:
  - Developer commits code changes to the Code Repository (GitHub).
  - CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions) is triggered on code changes.
  - CI/CD Pipeline performs the following steps:
    - Build Artifacts: Compiles and packages the Puppet project into distributable artifacts (e.g., packages, modules).
    - Security Scans: Runs automated security scans, including:
      - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
      - Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies.
      - Linters to enforce code quality and style guidelines, which can indirectly improve security.
    - Artifact Repository: Publishes the build artifacts to an artifact repository (e.g., package registry, GitHub Packages).
  - Deployment Environments consume build artifacts from the Artifact Repository for deployment.

- Build Security Controls:
  - security control: Secure Code Repository (GitHub) with access controls and audit logging.
  - security control: Automated CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions) to ensure consistent and repeatable builds.
  - security control: Security Scanning (SAST, SCA, Linters) integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to identify and address vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
  - security control: Artifact Repository (Package Registry) with access controls to protect build artifacts from unauthorized access and modification.
  - security control: Supply chain security measures to verify the integrity and authenticity of dependencies used in the build process.
  - security control: Code signing of build artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity.
  - security control: Build environment hardening to minimize the risk of build system compromise.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Infrastructure Provisioning: Automating the setup and configuration of new infrastructure components.
  - Configuration Management: Ensuring consistent and compliant configurations across the infrastructure.
  - Application Deployment: Automating the deployment of applications and services to the infrastructure.
  - Compliance Enforcement: Enforcing security and compliance policies through automated configurations.
  - Incident Remediation: Automating the response to and remediation of infrastructure incidents.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Configuration Data:
    - Sensitivity: High. Configuration data may contain sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, and security policies. Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are critical.
  - Audit Logs:
    - Sensitivity: Medium. Audit logs contain information about system activities and user actions, important for security monitoring and compliance. Integrity and Availability are important.
  - System State Data:
    - Sensitivity: Medium. System state data reflects the current configuration and status of the infrastructure. Integrity and Availability are important for operational visibility.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific compliance requirements for the target infrastructure (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2)?
  - What are the organization's specific security policies and standards that need to be enforced by Puppet?
  - What are the preferred authentication and authorization mechanisms for users and agents?
  - What are the specific deployment environments (on-premises, cloud, hybrid) and their security characteristics?
  - What existing security monitoring and incident response capabilities are in place that Puppet needs to integrate with?
  - What is the organization's risk appetite regarding open source software and supply chain security?

- Assumptions:
  - The organization prioritizes security and compliance for its IT infrastructure.
  - The organization has a need for automated infrastructure management and configuration.
  - The organization is using or planning to use cloud infrastructure (at least partially).
  - The organization has a development and operations team responsible for managing the infrastructure and applications.
  - Standard security best practices are expected to be implemented for the Puppet project and its deployment.
