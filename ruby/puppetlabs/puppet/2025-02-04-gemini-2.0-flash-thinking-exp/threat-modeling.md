# Threat Model Analysis for puppetlabs/puppet

## Threat: [Puppet Master Compromise](./threats/puppet_master_compromise.md)

*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Puppet Master server, potentially by exploiting software vulnerabilities, weak credentials, or social engineering. Once compromised, the attacker can manipulate configurations, access sensitive data, and control all managed nodes. They could push malicious manifests, steal secrets, or disrupt services across the entire infrastructure managed by this Puppet Master.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over managed infrastructure, potential data breaches, widespread service disruption, and loss of system integrity.
    *   **Affected Puppet Component:** Puppet Master Server
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly patch and update Puppet Master and its dependencies.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for Puppet Master access.
        *   Harden the Puppet Master operating system and infrastructure.
        *   Use network segmentation to isolate the Puppet Master.
        *   Implement Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS).
        *   Regularly audit Puppet Master logs and configurations.

## Threat: [Malicious Manifest/Module Injection](./threats/malicious_manifestmodule_injection.md)

*   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into Puppet manifests or modules. This could be achieved by compromising the code repository, exploiting vulnerabilities in the module management system, or through insider threats. The malicious code is then distributed to managed nodes during Puppet runs, potentially leading to system compromise or data theft.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of malicious configurations to managed nodes, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or system compromise across affected nodes.
    *   **Affected Puppet Component:** Puppet Manifests, Puppet Modules, Code Repository
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access control and code review for Puppet code.
        *   Use version control and track changes to Puppet code.
        *   Utilize code scanning and linting tools for Puppet code.
        *   Implement a robust module management strategy, including verifying module sources and using private repositories.
        *   Regularly audit Puppet code repositories for unauthorized changes.

## Threat: [Secrets Exposure in Puppet Code](./threats/secrets_exposure_in_puppet_code.md)

*   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Description:** Developers or operators unintentionally or intentionally store sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or certificates directly within Puppet manifests, modules, or Hiera data. This code might be committed to version control or accessible to unauthorized users, leading to credential theft.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to systems and data protected by those credentials.
    *   **Affected Puppet Component:** Puppet Manifests, Puppet Modules, Hiera Data
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding secrets in Puppet code.
        *   Use secure secret management solutions integrated with Puppet (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Puppet's encrypted data types, external secret backends).
        *   Implement code scanning tools to detect secrets in Puppet code.
        *   Educate developers on secure secrets management practices.

## Threat: [Puppet Code Execution Vulnerabilities](./threats/puppet_code_execution_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Puppet language, runtime, or core libraries could be discovered and exploited. An attacker could craft malicious Puppet code or data that, when processed by the Puppet Master or Agent, leads to arbitrary code execution on the Puppet infrastructure itself.
    *   **Impact:** System compromise of the Puppet Master or Agent, potentially leading to full control over the Puppet infrastructure and managed nodes.
    *   **Affected Puppet Component:** Puppet Language, Puppet Runtime, Puppet Core Libraries
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly patch and update Puppet software to address known vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow security best practices for Puppet development and deployment.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization in custom Puppet code where applicable, though this is generally less relevant for configuration management code than application code.
        *   Stay informed about Puppet security advisories and best practices.
