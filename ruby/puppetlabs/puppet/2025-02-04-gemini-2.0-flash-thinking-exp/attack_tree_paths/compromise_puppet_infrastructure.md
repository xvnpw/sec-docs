    * **Steal sensitive data:** Access secrets stored in Puppet code or configuration data (e.g., passwords, API keys).
    * **Disrupt operations:**  Cause widespread outages by deploying faulty configurations or shutting down the Puppet Master.
    * **Pivot to managed nodes:** Use the Master as a launchpad to further compromise managed agents and applications.
**Potential Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploiting vulnerabilities in Puppet Server software:**  Unpatched vulnerabilities in the Puppet Server application itself or its dependencies (e.g., Ruby, Java, web server).
    * **Operating System vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system of the Puppet Master server (e.g., Linux, Windows).
    * **Web Server vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the web server hosting Puppet Server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
