# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for activerecord-hackery/ransack

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Parameter Filtering and Whitelisting](./mitigation_strategies/strict_parameter_filtering_and_whitelisting.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Parameter Filtering and Whitelisting of Ransack Search Attributes.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all models and attributes used in Ransack searches.**  List all models and their attributes that are currently searchable or intended to be searchable via Ransack in your application.
    2.  **Define a whitelist of allowed search attributes for each model within your controllers or form objects.** For each model, create an explicit list of attributes that are safe and intended for public search *via Ransack*. This list should only include attributes necessary for search functionality and avoid exposing sensitive data or internal application logic through Ransack.
    3.  **Implement strong parameters in controllers to filter Ransack parameters.** In your controllers that handle Ransack searches, use Rails' strong parameters to filter incoming parameters specifically for Ransack. Permit only the whitelisted attributes and *explicitly allowed Ransack search predicates* (e.g., `_cont`, `_eq`, `_gt`) for these whitelisted attributes.
    4.  **Sanitize and validate user input passed to Ransack.** Even with whitelisting, sanitize and validate user input *before* it is passed to `Ransack.search`. This can include type casting parameters to expected types (e.g., integers, dates) and checking for malicious characters within the allowed search terms.
    5.  **Avoid dynamic attribute access when building Ransack queries.** Ensure that your code does not dynamically construct attribute names for Ransack searching based on raw user input. Always use predefined, safe attribute names and map user input to these names before using them in Ransack.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Mass Assignment Vulnerability via Ransack (High Severity):** Attackers could manipulate Ransack search parameters to indirectly update model attributes they are not intended to modify, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions through unintended parameter usage in Ransack.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Searchable Attributes (Medium Severity):**  Exposing internal attribute names or allowing search on sensitive attributes through Ransack could reveal information about your data model and application structure to attackers via the search interface.
    *   **Unexpected Application Behavior due to Malformed Ransack Queries (Medium Severity):**  Maliciously crafted Ransack parameters could trigger unexpected application behavior or errors if not properly filtered and validated before being processed by Ransack.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Mass Assignment Vulnerability via Ransack:** **High Risk Reduction.** Whitelisting Ransack attributes effectively prevents attackers from manipulating search parameters to indirectly modify unintended attributes through Ransack.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Searchable Attributes:** **Medium Risk Reduction.**  Reduces the surface area for information leakage through Ransack by limiting searchable attributes to only necessary and safe ones.
    *   **Unexpected Application Behavior due to Malformed Ransack Queries:** **Medium Risk Reduction.**  Filtering and validation of Ransack parameters help prevent unexpected errors and application crashes caused by malicious input processed by Ransack.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially implemented in `app/controllers/search_controller.rb`.** Strong parameters are used to permit the top-level `q` parameter for Ransack, but explicit attribute whitelisting *specifically for Ransack* and predicate control is not fully defined and enforced.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Explicit attribute whitelisting for Ransack searches is missing for all searchable models.**  Needs to be implemented in controllers or form objects handling Ransack searches, specifically defining what attributes are safe to search via Ransack.
    *   **Input sanitization and validation are not consistently applied to search parameters *before* they are used by Ransack.**  Needs to be reviewed and implemented across all search functionalities using Ransack.
    *   **Explicitly whitelisting allowed Ransack predicates (e.g., `_cont`, `_eq`) for each attribute is missing.**  This would further restrict the types of searches allowed on each attribute via Ransack.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Handling of Custom Predicates and Search Logic](./mitigation_strategies/careful_handling_of_custom_predicates_and_search_logic.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Implementation and Review of Ransack Custom Predicates and Search Logic.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize the use of custom predicates in Ransack.**  Whenever possible, utilize Ransack's built-in predicates and ActiveRecord's query interface to construct search queries. Avoid creating custom predicates in Ransack unless absolutely necessary for complex search logic that cannot be achieved with standard Ransack features.
    2.  **Thoroughly review custom predicate code for Ransack.** If custom predicates are required in Ransack, conduct a rigorous security review of the code. Pay close attention to how user input is incorporated into the predicate logic *within Ransack*, especially if raw SQL is involved in the custom predicate.
    3.  **Prefer ActiveRecord query interface within Ransack custom predicates.**  When implementing custom predicates for Ransack, leverage ActiveRecord's query interface (e.g., `where`, `joins`, `sanitize_sql_array`) instead of writing raw SQL strings directly *within the custom predicate logic*. This helps benefit from ActiveRecord's built-in sanitization and protection against SQL injection within Ransack's custom predicates.
    4.  **Parameterize SQL queries in Ransack custom predicates if raw SQL is unavoidable.** If raw SQL is unavoidable in Ransack custom predicates, always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities *within the custom predicate*. Never concatenate user input directly into SQL strings inside Ransack custom predicates.
    5.  **Unit test Ransack custom predicates extensively.**  Write comprehensive unit tests for all Ransack custom predicates, including tests that specifically attempt to inject malicious SQL or unexpected input *through the custom predicate* to ensure they are secure and function as intended within the Ransack context.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection via Ransack Custom Predicates (High Severity):**  Carelessly implemented custom predicates in Ransack, especially those using raw SQL, can introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database *through the search functionality provided by Ransack*.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues due to Flawed Ransack Logic (Medium Severity):**  Flawed custom predicate logic within Ransack could lead to incorrect search results or unintended data modifications if the logic is not thoroughly tested and validated in the context of Ransack searches.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection via Ransack Custom Predicates:** **High Risk Reduction.**  Using ActiveRecord's query interface and parameterized queries within Ransack custom predicates effectively eliminates the risk of SQL injection in those predicates.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues due to Flawed Ransack Logic:** **Medium Risk Reduction.**  Thorough code review and unit testing of Ransack custom predicates help ensure the correctness and reliability of the search logic, reducing the risk of data integrity issues arising from Ransack searches.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **No custom predicates are currently implemented in the project's Ransack usage.**  Standard Ransack predicates are used throughout the application.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Establish secure coding guidelines specifically for Ransack custom predicates.**  If custom predicates are to be implemented in Ransack in the future, guidelines and code review processes should be established to ensure secure implementation within the Ransack framework.
    *   **Implement static code analysis tools to detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities specifically within Ransack custom predicates.**  Tools can help automatically identify potential risks in custom predicate code used in Ransack.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Query Complexity Limits for Ransack Searches](./mitigation_strategies/implement_query_complexity_limits_for_ransack_searches.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Ransack Query Complexity Limits.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set database query timeouts to limit the execution time of Ransack queries.** Configure database connection settings to include query timeouts. This will automatically terminate long-running queries initiated by Ransack, preventing them from consuming database resources indefinitely due to overly complex searches.
    2.  **Limit the number of conditions in a single Ransack query.**  Implement logic to restrict the number of search conditions (e.g., `q[name_cont]=...&q[email_cont]=...`) that can be included in a single Ransack query. This can be done by validating the number of parameters within the `q` parameter *before* passing it to `Ransack.search`.
    3.  **Limit nested conditions and association depth in Ransack queries.** If your application uses nested conditions or searches across deep associations via Ransack, consider limiting the depth of nesting or the number of associated models that can be included in a single Ransack query to prevent overly complex and resource-intensive searches.
    4.  **Monitor query performance of Ransack queries and identify resource-intensive searches.**  Implement monitoring to track database query performance specifically for queries generated by Ransack and identify searches that are consuming excessive resources. Investigate and optimize or restrict overly complex Ransack queries.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion via Complex Ransack Queries (High Severity):** Attackers could craft extremely complex or resource-intensive search queries using Ransack features to overload the database and application server, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users *through the search functionality*.
    *   **Slow Application Performance due to Complex Ransack Queries (Medium Severity):**  Complex Ransack queries can significantly slow down application performance, even if not leading to a full DoS, impacting user experience.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion via Complex Ransack Queries:** **High Risk Reduction.** Query timeouts and limits on Ransack query complexity directly prevent resource exhaustion caused by excessively complex or long-running searches initiated through Ransack.
    *   **Slow Application Performance due to Complex Ransack Queries:** **Medium Risk Reduction.** Ransack query limits improve application responsiveness and prevent performance degradation caused by complex searches initiated via Ransack.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Database query timeouts are configured in `database.yml` with a timeout of 5 seconds, which indirectly limits Ransack query execution time.**

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Limits on the number of search conditions in a single Ransack query are not implemented.**  There is no restriction on how many search parameters a user can submit *to Ransack*.
    *   **Limits on nested conditions or association depth in Ransack queries are not implemented.**  Complex nested searches via Ransack could still potentially be resource-intensive.
    *   **Query performance monitoring specifically for Ransack queries is not implemented.**  General database monitoring is in place, but not specifically tailored to identify and analyze performance issues related to Ransack queries.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Ransack Gem](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_ransack_gem.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Regular Ransack Gem Updates and Security Patch Management.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor for updates to the `ransack` gem.**  Regularly check for new versions of the `ransack` gem.
    2.  **Subscribe to security advisories specifically for Ransack.**  Stay informed about security vulnerabilities reported specifically for the `ransack` gem through security mailing lists, vulnerability databases, and gem advisory services relevant to Ruby on Rails gems.
    3.  **Apply Ransack updates promptly.**  When new versions or security patches for `ransack` are released, apply them to your application as quickly as possible, after testing in a staging environment to ensure compatibility and stability with your Ransack usage.
    4.  **Automate Ransack dependency updates using tools like Dependabot or similar.**  Utilize automated dependency update tools to streamline the process of checking for and applying updates specifically for the `ransack` gem.
    5.  **Perform regression testing after Ransack updates, focusing on search functionality.**  After updating the `ransack` gem, run thorough regression tests, *specifically focusing on search functionality that utilizes Ransack*, to ensure that the updates have not introduced any regressions or broken existing search features.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Ransack (High Severity):**  Outdated versions of the `ransack` gem may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to compromise the application *through the search functionality provided by Ransack*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Ransack:** **High Risk Reduction.**  Regular updates and patching of the `ransack` gem directly address known vulnerabilities within Ransack, significantly reducing the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities in the search feature.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Dependabot is configured for the project and automatically creates pull requests for dependency updates, including `ransack`.**
    *   **Regular dependency updates are performed as part of the development cycle, which includes updating `ransack` when updates are available.**

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Formal security vulnerability monitoring specifically for Ransack is not in place.**  General Rails security advisories are monitored, but specific Ransack advisories might be missed. Dedicated monitoring for Ransack vulnerabilities would be beneficial.
    *   **Automated regression testing specifically focused on search functionality *after Ransack updates* is not implemented.**  General regression tests are run, but targeted tests for search functionality after Ransack updates would provide more focused assurance.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authorization Checks Before Ransack Queries](./mitigation_strategies/authorization_checks_before_ransack_queries.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Enforce Robust Authorization *Before* Executing Ransack Queries.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement a dedicated authorization framework (e.g., Pundit, CanCanCan) for your application.**  Use a robust authorization framework to manage user permissions and access control throughout the application, including controlling access to data that will be searched using Ransack.
    2.  **Do not rely on Ransack parameters for authorization decisions.**  Never use Ransack parameters as the sole or primary mechanism for controlling access to data or actions. Ransack is for querying *authorized data*, not for authorization itself.
    3.  **Filter authorized data *before* passing it to `Ransack.search`.**  Ensure that the dataset being searched by Ransack is *already filtered* to only include data that the current user is authorized to access. Perform authorization checks using your authorization framework *before* constructing and executing the Ransack query.
    4.  **Enforce authorization checks at the controller level *before* initiating Ransack searches.**  Implement authorization checks in controllers to control access to search actions and ensure that users are authorized to search the data they are attempting to query using Ransack.
    5.  **Test authorization rules thoroughly in conjunction with Ransack searches.**  Write comprehensive tests to verify that authorization rules are correctly implemented and that users can only access data they are permitted to access *through search queries using Ransack*, regardless of how they construct their search parameters.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Authorization Bypass via Ransack Search Manipulation (High Severity):**  If authorization is mistakenly based on Ransack parameters or not performed *before* Ransack queries, attackers could manipulate search parameters to bypass intended access controls and access or modify unauthorized data *through the search interface*.
    *   **Data Breaches due to Unauthorized Access via Search (High Severity):**  Authorization bypass through Ransack search manipulation can lead to data breaches if attackers gain access to sensitive data they should not be able to access via search.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Authorization Bypass via Ransack Search Manipulation:** **High Risk Reduction.**  Implementing a dedicated authorization framework and ensuring authorization is performed *before* Ransack queries are executed effectively prevents authorization bypass vulnerabilities related to search.
    *   **Data Breaches due to Unauthorized Access via Search:** **High Risk Reduction.**  Robust authorization enforced before Ransack queries significantly reduces the risk of data breaches caused by unauthorized access to data through search functionality.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Pundit is implemented as the authorization framework in the project.**
    *   **Authorization checks are generally enforced in controllers using Pundit policies, often *before* data is passed to views for rendering, but the explicit check *before* Ransack query execution needs verification.**

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Review all Ransack search implementations to *explicitly ensure* authorization is performed using Pundit (or similar) *before* Ransack queries are executed.**  Verify that authorization logic consistently filters the dataset *before* it is passed to `Ransack.search` and is not inadvertently relying on Ransack parameters for authorization.
    *   **Specific tests for authorization *in conjunction with Ransack searches* should be enhanced.**  Ensure tests specifically cover scenarios where users attempt to access unauthorized data through various search queries using Ransack, verifying that authorization is correctly applied *before* the search is executed.
