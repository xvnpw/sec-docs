## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection via Raw SQL Predicates [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_via_raw_sql_predicates__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector exploits the ability to use raw SQL within Ransack predicates. If user input is not properly sanitized before being incorporated into these raw SQL snippets, attackers can inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. While developers are generally aware of SQL injection risks, the use of raw SQL predicates can sometimes be overlooked or implemented insecurely.
*   **Impact:** High. Successful SQL injection can lead to full database compromise, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete any data.
*   **Effort:** Medium. Crafting effective SQL injection attacks requires some knowledge of SQL and database structures.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Depends on the effectiveness of logging and monitoring systems in capturing malicious SQL queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Modification via Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities (Indirect) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/data_modification_via_mass_assignment_vulnerabilities__indirect___critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** While Ransack itself doesn't directly modify data, it can expose model attributes through search parameters. If the application's controller logic doesn't properly protect against mass assignment vulnerabilities, attackers can leverage Ransack parameters to modify sensitive data.
*   **Likelihood:** Low/Medium. Depends heavily on the application's controller implementation and how strictly mass assignment is controlled.
*   **Impact:** Medium/High. Successful exploitation can lead to data corruption, privilege escalation (e.g., modifying user roles), or other unauthorized modifications.
*   **Effort:** Low/Medium. Identifying exploitable attributes might require some reconnaissance, but crafting the malicious request is generally straightforward.
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Malicious updates might resemble legitimate updates, making detection challenging without careful monitoring of data changes and request parameters.

## Attack Tree Path: [Configuration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/configuration_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This category encompasses vulnerabilities arising from improper configuration of the Ransack gem.
    *   **Insecure Default Settings:** Relying on default Ransack configurations without hardening can expose a wider attack surface than necessary.
    *   **Improper Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** Failure to properly sanitize or validate Ransack parameters, or having overly permissive allowlists, can enable various other attacks.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High. Configuration errors are common oversights in development.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High. Increases the attack surface and can directly enable more severe vulnerabilities like SQL injection or mass assignment.
*   **Effort:** Low (for the attacker). These vulnerabilities often exist due to a lack of proper configuration rather than requiring active exploitation.
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner (for exploitation). Once a configuration vulnerability is identified, exploiting it can be relatively easy.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium. Security scans and code reviews can often identify misconfigurations. However, detecting active exploitation might depend on the specific attack vector enabled by the misconfiguration.

        *   **Improper Whitelisting/Blacklisting:**
            *   **Description:** The application fails to adequately sanitize or validate user-supplied Ransack parameters, or it allows an overly broad set of attributes and predicates to be used in search queries.
            *   **Likelihood:** High. Input validation is a common area of weakness in web applications.
            *   **Impact:** Medium/High. This can directly lead to SQL injection, information disclosure, or other attacks by allowing malicious input to reach the database or application logic.
            *   **Effort:** Low. Attackers can easily attempt various payloads if input validation is weak.
            *   **Skill Level:** Beginner.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low/Medium. Depends on the logging of request parameters and the ability to identify malicious patterns.
