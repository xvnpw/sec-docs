# Attack Surface Analysis for activerecord-hackery/ransack

## Attack Surface: [Direct Parameter Manipulation via `q` Parameter](./attack_surfaces/direct_parameter_manipulation_via__q__parameter.md)

**Description:** Attackers can directly manipulate the `q` parameter in the URL to specify search criteria.

**How Ransack Contributes:** Ransack uses the `q` parameter to define search attributes, predicates, and values, making it the primary entry point for manipulating search logic.

**Example:** `/?q[name_contains]=evil&q[email_ends_with]=attacker.com`

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strong Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all values within the `q` parameter to ensure they conform to expected data types and formats.
*   **Whitelist Allowed Attributes and Predicates:** Define a strict whitelist of attributes and predicates that are allowed for searching. Reject any requests using attributes or predicates outside this whitelist.
*   **Implement Proper Authorization:** Ensure that authorization checks are in place to prevent users from accessing data they are not permitted to see, regardless of the search criteria.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Predicates and Search Conditions](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_predicates_and_search_conditions.md)

**Description:** Attackers can exploit the various predicates offered by Ransack to craft malicious search queries.

**How Ransack Contributes:** Ransack provides a wide range of predicates (e.g., `_contains`, `_starts_with`, `_gteq`) that, if not handled carefully, can be misused to extract unintended data.

**Example:** `/?q[description_matches]=.*sensitive_data.*` (attempting to extract sensitive data using a broad `LIKE` clause).

**Impact:** Information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Careful Selection of Allowed Predicates:** Limit the available predicates to only those necessary for the application's functionality.
*   **Contextual Escaping of Search Results:** Ensure that any data retrieved through Ransack and displayed to users is properly escaped to prevent unintended interpretation.
*   **Implement Rate Limiting:** While primarily for DoS, it can indirectly help mitigate rapid data extraction attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Nested Attributes and Associations](./attack_surfaces/nested_attributes_and_associations.md)

**Description:** Ransack allows searching through associated models, potentially exposing sensitive data in related tables.

**How Ransack Contributes:** Ransack's syntax for accessing associated attributes (e.g., `q[user_email_contains]`) directly enables querying across model relationships.

**Example:** `/?q[user_email_contains]=sensitive` (potentially accessing email addresses through the `user` association without proper authorization).

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to data in associated models, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Enforce Authorization at the Association Level:** Implement robust authorization checks to ensure users can only access data in associated models they are permitted to view.
*   **Carefully Consider Which Associations are Searchable:** Limit the ability to search through associations to only those that are absolutely necessary.
*   **Use Scopes and Abilities:** Leverage model scopes and authorization libraries (like CanCanCan or Pundit) to control access to associated data.
