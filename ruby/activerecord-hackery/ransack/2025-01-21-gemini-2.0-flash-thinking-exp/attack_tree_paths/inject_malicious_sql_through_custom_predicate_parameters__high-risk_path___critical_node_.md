This document provides a deep analysis of the attack tree path "Inject malicious SQL through custom predicate parameters" within an application utilizing the `ransack` gem (https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack). This path has been identified as a **HIGH-RISK PATH** and a **CRITICAL NODE**, requiring immediate attention and mitigation.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanics, potential impact, and mitigation strategies associated with the identified SQL injection vulnerability stemming from the use of custom predicate parameters in the `ransack` gem. This includes:

* **Understanding the vulnerability:**  Delving into how malicious SQL can be injected through custom predicates.
* **Identifying potential attack vectors:**  Pinpointing the specific areas in the application where this vulnerability could be exploited.
* **Assessing the potential impact:**  Evaluating the consequences of a successful attack.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject malicious SQL through custom predicate parameters

#### 4.1 Understanding the Vulnerability

The `ransack` gem provides a powerful way to build dynamic search forms based on model attributes. It allows developers to define custom predicates, which extend the default search functionality. The vulnerability arises when user-supplied data, intended for use within these custom predicates, is not properly sanitized or escaped before being incorporated into the generated SQL query.

**How Custom Predicates Work (Simplified):**

1. Developers define a custom predicate (e.g., `my_custom_search`).
2. This predicate is associated with a block of code that generates a SQL `WHERE` clause.
3. User input from the search form is passed as parameters to this block.
4. If the developer directly interpolates this user input into the SQL string without proper sanitization, it creates an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Example of Vulnerable Code (Illustrative):**

```ruby
Ransack.configure do |config|
  config.add_predicate 'custom_name_search',
    arel_predicate: 'matches',
    formatter: proc { |v| "%#{v}%" },
    validator: proc { |v| v.present? }
end

# ... in a controller or model ...
def custom_name_search(scope, params)
  name = params[:q]['custom_name_search']
  if name.present?
    scope.where("users.name LIKE '%#{name}%'") # VULNERABLE: Direct interpolation
  else
    scope
  end
end
```

In this simplified example, if a user provides the input `%' OR 1=1 --`, the resulting SQL query would become:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE users.name LIKE '%%' OR 1=1 -- %';
```

This malicious input bypasses the intended search logic and could potentially return all users or execute other harmful SQL commands.

#### 4.2 Attack Vectors

The primary attack vector is through the search form where the custom predicate is exposed. An attacker can manipulate the input fields associated with the custom predicate to inject malicious SQL.

**Specific Attack Scenarios:**

* **Direct SQL Injection:**  Injecting SQL keywords and operators directly into the input field to alter the query's logic (e.g., `'; DROP TABLE users; --`).
* **Union-Based Injection:**  Using `UNION` clauses to retrieve data from other tables in the database.
* **Blind SQL Injection:**  Using techniques to infer information about the database structure and data even without direct output (e.g., using `SLEEP()` or conditional queries).

The severity of the vulnerability depends on the privileges of the database user used by the application. If the application connects to the database with administrative privileges, the impact can be catastrophic.

#### 4.3 Potential Impact

A successful SQL injection attack through custom predicate parameters can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data, including user credentials, personal information, and business secrets.
* **Data Manipulation:**  Modification or deletion of critical data, leading to data corruption and loss of integrity.
* **Privilege Escalation:**  Gaining access to higher-level accounts or functionalities within the application.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Overloading the database server or executing resource-intensive queries to disrupt application availability.
* **Code Execution (in some cases):**  Depending on the database system and configuration, it might be possible to execute arbitrary code on the database server.

Given the potential for complete database compromise, this attack path is rightly classified as **HIGH-RISK** and a **CRITICAL NODE**.

#### 4.4 Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate this vulnerability, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the **most effective** way to prevent SQL injection. Instead of directly interpolating user input into the SQL string, use placeholders that are then bound to the input values. This ensures that the input is treated as data, not executable code.

   **Example of Secure Code using Parameterized Queries:**

   ```ruby
   def custom_name_search(scope, params)
     name = params[:q]['custom_name_search']
     if name.present?
       scope.where("users.name LIKE ?", "%#{name}%")
     else
       scope
     end
   end
   ```

* **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  While parameterized queries are the primary defense, sanitizing and validating user input provides an additional layer of security. This involves:
    * **Whitelisting:**  Defining allowed characters and patterns for input fields.
    * **Escaping:**  Converting potentially harmful characters into a safe format.
    * **Data Type Validation:**  Ensuring that the input matches the expected data type.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its functions. Avoid using database accounts with administrative privileges.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct periodic security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including SQL injection flaws.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Implement a WAF to detect and block malicious requests, including those attempting SQL injection.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  While not directly preventing SQL injection, CSP can help mitigate the impact of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which can sometimes be used in conjunction with SQL injection.

* **Secure Coding Practices:**  Educate developers on secure coding principles and best practices for preventing SQL injection.

* **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep the `ransack` gem and other dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches.

#### 4.5 Specific Considerations for Ransack

When using custom predicates with `ransack`, developers must be extremely cautious about how user input is handled within the predicate's logic.

* **Avoid direct string interpolation:**  Never directly embed user input into SQL strings within custom predicate blocks.
* **Utilize Arel:**  `ransack` is built on top of Arel, a SQL abstraction library. Leverage Arel's methods for building SQL queries programmatically, which inherently provides protection against SQL injection.

   **Example of Secure Custom Predicate using Arel:**

   ```ruby
   Ransack.configure do |config|
     config.add_predicate 'custom_name_search',
       arel_predicate: 'matches',
       formatter: proc { |v| "%#{v}%" },
       type: :string # Specify the data type
   end

   # ... Ransack will handle the parameterization based on the type
   ```

* **Carefully review and test custom predicate logic:**  Thoroughly examine the code within custom predicate blocks to ensure that user input is handled securely.

### 5. Conclusion

The ability to inject malicious SQL through custom predicate parameters in `ransack` represents a significant security risk. The potential impact of a successful attack is severe, ranging from data breaches to complete database compromise.

It is imperative that the development team prioritizes the mitigation of this vulnerability by implementing robust security measures, primarily focusing on the use of parameterized queries and avoiding direct string interpolation of user input within custom predicate logic. Regular security audits and adherence to secure coding practices are also crucial for preventing similar vulnerabilities in the future.

This deep analysis provides a foundation for understanding the risks and implementing effective solutions. Immediate action is required to address this **HIGH-RISK** and **CRITICAL** vulnerability.
