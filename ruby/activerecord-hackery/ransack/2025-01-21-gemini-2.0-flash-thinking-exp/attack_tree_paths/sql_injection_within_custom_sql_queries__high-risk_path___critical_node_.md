### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: SQL Injection within custom SQL queries *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** [CRITICAL NODE]

**Understanding the Vulnerability:**

The Ransack gem provides powerful search capabilities for ActiveRecord models in Ruby on Rails applications. While it offers a convenient way to build complex search queries based on model attributes, it also allows developers to define custom searchers that can execute raw SQL queries. This flexibility, if not handled carefully, can introduce significant security risks, particularly SQL injection vulnerabilities.

The core issue arises when developers directly embed user-supplied input into these custom SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. If an attacker can control parts of the SQL query being executed, they can inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the database.

**Technical Explanation:**

Ransack allows defining custom searchers using the `ransacker` method within a model. These custom searchers can accept a block that defines the SQL to be executed. Consider the following example:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  ransacker :custom_search do |parent|
    Arel.sql("LOWER(name) LIKE '%#{params[:q][:custom_search].downcase}%'")
  end
end
```

In this example, the `custom_search` ransacker directly interpolates the value from `params[:q][:custom_search]` into the SQL query. If an attacker provides a malicious input like `%' OR 1=1 -- `, the resulting SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE (LOWER(name) LIKE '%%' OR 1=1 -- %')
```

The injected `OR 1=1 --` clause will cause the query to return all rows in the `users` table, bypassing the intended search logic. More sophisticated attacks could involve data exfiltration, modification, or even command execution depending on the database permissions and the application's architecture.

**Attack Vector:**

1. **Identify Input Points:** The attacker identifies input fields or parameters that are used in conjunction with the custom SQL search functionality. This could be a search bar, a filter option, or any other user-controlled input that influences the `params` hash.
2. **Craft Malicious Input:** The attacker crafts a malicious string containing SQL code. This string is designed to manipulate the intended SQL query structure. Common techniques include:
    * **Adding `OR` conditions:** To bypass authentication or authorization checks.
    * **Using `UNION` statements:** To retrieve data from other tables.
    * **Executing stored procedures:** To perform administrative tasks or gain access to sensitive information.
    * **Using comment characters (`--`, `#`, `/* */`):** To truncate the original query and inject malicious code.
3. **Submit Malicious Input:** The attacker submits the crafted input through the identified input point.
4. **Unsanitized Input Reaches Custom SQL:** The application, using Ransack, incorporates the unsanitized input directly into the custom SQL query defined in the `ransacker` block.
5. **Malicious SQL Execution:** The database executes the modified SQL query, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or other malicious actions.

**Impact Assessment:**

This attack path is classified as **HIGH-RISK** and a **CRITICAL NODE** due to the potentially severe consequences of a successful SQL injection attack:

* **Data Breach (Confidentiality):** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials, personal information, financial records, and proprietary data.
* **Data Manipulation (Integrity):** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption, loss of trust, and potential legal repercussions.
* **Privilege Escalation:** If the database user has elevated privileges, attackers can potentially gain control over the entire database server or even the underlying operating system.
* **Denial of Service (Availability):** Attackers can execute queries that consume excessive resources, leading to performance degradation or complete service disruption.
* **Application Compromise:** In some cases, SQL injection can be used to execute arbitrary code on the application server, leading to complete application compromise.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively mitigate the risk of SQL injection within custom SQL queries in Ransack, the following strategies are crucial:

1. **Avoid Raw SQL in Custom Searchers:** The most effective mitigation is to avoid using raw SQL within `ransacker` blocks whenever possible. Leverage Ransack's built-in predicates and associations to construct safe search queries.

2. **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** If using raw SQL is unavoidable, **always** use parameterized queries or prepared statements. This technique separates the SQL structure from the user-supplied data, preventing the interpretation of user input as executable code. While Ransack's `Arel.sql` doesn't directly offer parameterization in the same way as raw SQL connections, you should strive to build the SQL string dynamically using safe methods and avoid direct string interpolation of user input.

3. **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input before incorporating it into any SQL query. This includes:
    * **Whitelisting:**  Only allow specific, expected characters or patterns.
    * **Escaping:**  Escape special characters that have meaning in SQL (e.g., single quotes, double quotes).
    * **Type Checking:** Ensure that input values match the expected data types.

4. **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended tasks. Avoid granting excessive privileges that could be exploited by an attacker.

5. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to detect and block common SQL injection attack patterns before they reach the application.

6. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities, including SQL injection flaws, and ensure that mitigation strategies are effective.

7. **Code Reviews:** Implement thorough code review processes to catch potential SQL injection vulnerabilities during development. Pay close attention to any code that constructs SQL queries based on user input.

8. **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct mitigation for SQL injection, a strong CSP can help limit the impact of a successful attack by restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources, potentially hindering data exfiltration attempts.

**Conclusion:**

The "SQL Injection within custom SQL queries" attack path represents a significant security risk in applications using the Ransack gem. The ability to execute raw SQL provides flexibility but also introduces the potential for severe vulnerabilities if user input is not handled with extreme care. By understanding the attack vector, potential impact, and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of successful SQL injection attacks and protect sensitive data. Prioritizing the avoidance of raw SQL and the use of parameterized queries (or safe dynamic SQL construction) is paramount in securing applications utilizing Ransack's custom search capabilities.
