This document provides a deep analysis of the attack tree path "Manipulate `g` parameter with SQL injection" targeting applications using the `ransack` gem (https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack).

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanics, potential impact, and mitigation strategies associated with exploiting the `g` parameter in `ransack` to perform SQL injection attacks. This includes:

* **Understanding the vulnerability:** How does the `g` parameter in `ransack` become a vector for SQL injection?
* **Identifying attack vectors:** What are the specific ways an attacker can manipulate the `g` parameter?
* **Assessing the potential impact:** What are the consequences of a successful SQL injection attack via this path?
* **Developing mitigation strategies:** What steps can the development team take to prevent this type of attack?

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack path involving the manipulation of the `g` parameter within the `ransack` gem to achieve SQL injection. The scope includes:

* **The `ransack` gem:** Its functionality related to search parameters and how it interacts with the database.
* **The `g` parameter:** Its role in grouping search conditions and how it can be exploited.
* **SQL injection vulnerabilities:** The underlying principles and how they apply in this context.
* **Potential attack scenarios:** Examples of how an attacker might exploit this vulnerability.
* **Mitigation techniques:** Specific code changes and security practices to address the vulnerability.

This analysis does **not** cover other potential vulnerabilities within the application or the `ransack` gem, unless they are directly related to the exploitation of the `g` parameter for SQL injection.

### 3. Methodology

The methodology for this deep analysis involves the following steps:

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Manipulate `g` parameter with SQL injection

#### 4.1 Understanding the `g` Parameter in Ransack

The `ransack` gem allows users to build complex search queries based on model attributes. The `g` parameter in `ransack` is used to group search conditions together using logical operators (AND/OR). It allows for nested conditions, making search queries more flexible.

The structure of the `g` parameter typically involves specifying attributes, predicates (e.g., `eq`, `cont`, `gt`), and values. For example:

```
params[:q][:g][0][:name_cont] = "John"
params[:q][:g][0][:email_or_title_cont] = "developer"
```

This example searches for records where the `name` contains "John" **AND** either the `email` or `title` contains "developer".

#### 4.2 The Vulnerability: Lack of Proper Sanitization

The core of the SQL injection vulnerability lies in how `ransack` (or the application using it) constructs SQL queries based on the values provided in the `g` parameter. If the values are not properly sanitized or parameterized before being incorporated into the SQL query, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.

Specifically, if the application directly interpolates the values from the `g` parameter into the SQL query string, it becomes vulnerable. Consider a scenario where the application might dynamically build a `WHERE` clause based on the `g` parameter.

#### 4.3 Attack Vectors: Manipulating the `g` Parameter

An attacker can manipulate the `g` parameter in several ways to inject SQL code:

* **Direct Injection in Values:**  The most straightforward approach is to inject SQL code directly into the values associated with attributes within the `g` parameter. For example, instead of a legitimate search term, an attacker could provide a malicious SQL fragment.

    **Example Payload:**

    ```
    params[:q][:g][0][:name_cont] = "'; DROP TABLE users; --"
    ```

    If the application naively constructs the SQL query like this:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%'; DROP TABLE users; --%';
    ```

    The injected SQL code (`DROP TABLE users;`) will be executed. The `--` comments out the rest of the intended query.

* **Manipulating Predicates (Less Likely but Possible):** While less common, if the application allows dynamic predicate selection based on user input (which is generally bad practice), an attacker might try to inject SQL through manipulated predicate values.

* **Exploiting Complex Grouping:**  Attackers might try to craft complex nested `g` parameter structures that, when processed by the application, lead to unexpected SQL query construction and injection points.

#### 4.4 Potential Impact

A successful SQL injection attack via the `g` parameter can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials, personal information, financial records, etc.
* **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify or delete data, leading to data corruption, loss of integrity, and disruption of services.
* **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms by manipulating queries to return valid user credentials or grant unauthorized access.
* **Remote Code Execution (in some cases):** In certain database configurations, attackers might be able to execute arbitrary code on the database server.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can execute resource-intensive queries that overload the database server, leading to a denial of service.

The impact depends on the privileges of the database user the application connects with and the sensitivity of the data stored.

#### 4.5 Mitigation Strategies

To prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities through the `g` parameter in `ransack`, the development team should implement the following mitigation strategies:

* **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the **most effective** way to prevent SQL injection. Instead of directly embedding user input into SQL queries, use parameterized queries where placeholders are used for values, and the database driver handles the proper escaping and quoting. **Ensure that the application's data access layer (e.g., ActiveRecord in Rails) is configured to use parameterized queries by default.**

    **Example (Conceptual - assuming direct SQL construction, which should be avoided):**

    ```ruby
    # Vulnerable code (avoid this)
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%#{params[:q][:g][0][:name_cont]}%'"
    ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(query)

    # Secure code using parameterized queries
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE ?"
    ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(query, "%#{params[:q][:g][0][:name_cont]}%")
    ```

    **With ActiveRecord and Ransack, ensure you are not manually constructing SQL based on `ransack` parameters.**  Let `ransack` and ActiveRecord handle the query building.

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While parameterized queries are the primary defense, validating and sanitizing user input provides an additional layer of security.

    * **Whitelisting:** Define allowed characters and patterns for input values. Reject any input that doesn't conform to the whitelist.
    * **Escaping Special Characters:**  Escape characters that have special meaning in SQL (e.g., single quotes, double quotes, backslashes). However, relying solely on escaping is less robust than parameterized queries.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user the application connects with has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended operations. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if SQL injection is successful.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF that can detect and block common SQL injection attack patterns in HTTP requests. This acts as a security layer before the request reaches the application.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities, including SQL injection flaws.

* **Keep Ransack Updated:** Ensure the `ransack` gem is updated to the latest version to benefit from any security patches and bug fixes.

* **Review Customizations:** If there are any custom extensions or modifications to how `ransack` is used in the application, carefully review them for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

#### 4.6 Specific Ransack Considerations

While `ransack` itself aims to provide a safe way to build search queries, vulnerabilities can arise if the application using `ransack`:

* **Manually constructs SQL based on `ransack` parameters:** This bypasses the intended safe abstractions of `ransack` and ActiveRecord.
* **Improperly handles or trusts the output of `ransack` in custom SQL logic.**

**It's crucial to rely on `ransack`'s built-in mechanisms for query generation and avoid directly interpolating `ransack` parameters into raw SQL.**

### 5. Conclusion

The ability to manipulate the `g` parameter in applications using `ransack` presents a significant risk of SQL injection. Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to potentially gain unauthorized access to data, modify information, or even disrupt the application's functionality.

The development team must prioritize implementing robust mitigation strategies, with **parameterized queries being the cornerstone of defense**. Combined with input validation, the principle of least privilege, and regular security assessments, these measures will significantly reduce the risk of successful SQL injection attacks via the `g` parameter. A thorough understanding of how `ransack` works and how user input is processed is essential for building secure applications.
