# Threat Model Analysis for activerecord-hackery/ransack

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Malicious Search Parameters](./threats/sql_injection_via_malicious_search_parameters.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input within search parameters (e.g., field names, predicates, or values) that, when processed by Ransack, is interpreted as SQL code by the underlying database. The attacker might inject arbitrary SQL queries to extract sensitive data, modify data, or even execute system commands on the database server. This directly involves how Ransack constructs SQL queries based on user-provided input.

**Impact:** Critical. Could lead to complete data breach, data corruption, unauthorized access, and potential compromise of the database server.

**Affected Ransack Component:** Search parameter processing, specifically how Ransack constructs SQL queries based on user input.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strictly whitelist allowed search attributes and predicates:** Only allow searching on explicitly defined fields and using a predefined set of safe predicates within Ransack's configuration.
*   **Avoid dynamic field names in search forms:** Do not allow users to directly specify the database column names to search against, limiting the parameters passed to Ransack.
*   **Regularly audit Ransack usage:** Review how Ransack is implemented and ensure no unexpected or overly permissive configurations exist within the Ransack setup.
*   **Keep Ransack updated:** Ensure the gem is updated to the latest version to benefit from any security patches within Ransack itself.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities via Search Attributes](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_via_search_attributes.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates search parameters to include attributes that are not intended to be searchable or modifiable through the search interface. Ransack might inadvertently allow setting values for these attributes, potentially bypassing authorization checks or modifying sensitive model data. This vulnerability arises from how Ransack maps input parameters to model attributes.

**Impact:** High. Could lead to unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, and compromise of application integrity.

**Affected Ransack Component:** Search parameter processing, specifically how Ransack maps input parameters to model attributes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Explicitly define searchable attributes:** Configure Ransack to only allow searching on a specific, controlled set of model attributes using Ransack's configuration options.
*   **Review and restrict accessible attributes:** Carefully review which attributes are exposed through Ransack's configuration and ensure no sensitive or modifiable attributes are inadvertently included.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex or Resource-Intensive Queries](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_complex_or_resource-intensive_queries.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts extremely complex search queries, potentially involving deep associations or multiple conditions, that are processed by Ransack and then executed against the database. When executed, these queries consume excessive database resources (CPU, memory, I/O), leading to performance degradation or complete application unavailability for legitimate users. This threat directly involves Ransack's query generation capabilities.

**Impact:** High. Can disrupt application availability, impacting users and potentially causing financial loss or reputational damage.

**Affected Ransack Component:** Query generation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Implement query complexity limits:**  Restrict the number of conditions or the depth of nested associations allowed in a single search query processed by Ransack.
*   **Set database query timeouts:** Configure the database to automatically terminate long-running queries generated by Ransack.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Custom Searchers](./threats/exploitation_of_custom_searchers.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes custom searchers defined within Ransack, an attacker might find vulnerabilities within this custom code. This could include SQL injection flaws if the custom searcher directly constructs SQL queries without proper sanitization, or other logic errors that can be exploited. The vulnerability resides within the custom Ransack component.

**Impact:** High to Critical, depending on the vulnerability. Could lead to SQL injection, data breaches, or other application-specific vulnerabilities.

**Affected Ransack Component:** Custom searcher implementation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Treat custom searchers as critical code:** Apply the same security rigor to custom searcher code as to any other sensitive part of the application interacting with Ransack.
*   **Avoid direct SQL construction in custom searchers:** If possible, leverage ActiveRecord methods or other safe mechanisms to interact with the database within the custom searcher logic.
*   **Thoroughly review and test custom searcher code:** Conduct code reviews and penetration testing specifically targeting custom searchers implemented within Ransack.
