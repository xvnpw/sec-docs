# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide advanced search and filtering capabilities for Ruby on Rails applications.
  - Enhance user experience by enabling users to easily find and filter data within applications.
  - Simplify the development of complex search interfaces in Rails applications.
  - Reduce development time and effort for implementing search functionality.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Risk of insecure search queries leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation if Ransack is misused or misconfigured.
  - Risk of performance issues and denial of service if complex or unoptimized search queries are executed.
  - Risk of application instability if Ransack introduces bugs or conflicts with other components of the Rails application.
  - Risk of developer misuse leading to unexpected application behavior or security vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Ruby on Rails Security Framework - The application using Ransack likely benefits from the security features provided by the Ruby on Rails framework, such as protection against common web vulnerabilities. Implemented by: Ruby on Rails framework.
  - security control: Database Security - The underlying database system will have its own security controls for access management and data protection. Implemented by: Database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
  - security control: Input Sanitization (Application Level) - It is expected that the application using Ransack will implement input sanitization and validation to protect against injection attacks. Implemented by: Application code using Ransack.
  - security control: Authorization (Application Level) -  Authorization logic within the application should control which users can access and search specific data. Implemented by: Application code using Ransack.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in Ransack Gem - There is an inherent risk of security vulnerabilities being present in the Ransack gem itself, which could be exploited if discovered.
  - accepted risk: Misuse of Ransack by Developers - Developers might misuse Ransack in a way that introduces security vulnerabilities, such as constructing insecure search queries or bypassing authorization checks.
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities - Ransack depends on other Ruby gems, and vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect applications using Ransack.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits of the Ransack gem code to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development process to automatically scan the Ransack codebase for security flaws.
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement dependency scanning to monitor for known vulnerabilities in Ransack's dependencies and update them promptly.
  - security control: Secure Coding Guidelines and Training - Provide developers with secure coding guidelines and training specific to using Ransack securely, emphasizing input validation and authorization.
  - security control: Example and Documentation Review - Review documentation and examples for security best practices and ensure they clearly demonstrate secure usage patterns.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Authentication is the responsibility of the application using Ransack. Ransack itself does not handle authentication.
    - Details: The application must authenticate users before allowing them to perform searches using Ransack.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Authorization must be implemented at the application level to control access to data being searched by Ransack.
    - Details: Ransack should be used in conjunction with application-level authorization mechanisms to ensure users can only search data they are authorized to access.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All user inputs used in Ransack search queries must be thoroughly validated and sanitized by the application to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, NoSQL injection).
    - Details: The application must sanitize user-provided search parameters before passing them to Ransack to construct database queries.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Cryptography is not directly a requirement for Ransack itself, but the application using Ransack should use cryptography to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    - Details:  If sensitive data is being searched, the application should ensure that data is encrypted in the database and transmitted securely over HTTPS.

```

- Build Process Description:
  - Developer commits code changes and gem updates to a Version Control System (e.g., GitHub).
  - A CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions) is triggered by a webhook or a scheduled build.
  - The CI/CD system checks out the code from the repository and sets up a build environment with necessary dependencies (e.g., Ruby, Bundler).
  - Quality and security checks are performed, including running unit tests, linters, and Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scanners to identify potential code quality issues and security vulnerabilities.
  - If all checks pass, the CI/CD system builds the gem package (e.g., a .gem file).
  - The build artifacts (gem file) are published to a gem repository (e.g., RubyGems.org) making the new version of the Ransack gem available for users.

  - security control: Access Control to Gem Repository - Secure access control to the gem repository (e.g., RubyGems.org) to prevent unauthorized publishing of gem versions. Implemented by: RubyGems.org access control.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing search functionality within Ruby on Rails applications is a critical business process for applications that rely on users being able to efficiently find and filter data. The availability and security of this search functionality directly impacts user experience and the ability to access information.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - The sensitivity of the data being searched depends entirely on the application using Ransack. Ransack itself does not handle or store data. If the application is searching sensitive data (e.g., personal information, financial data, health records), then the search functionality becomes a critical component for protecting this sensitive data. The risk associated with insecure search queries or vulnerabilities in Ransack increases significantly when sensitive data is involved.
