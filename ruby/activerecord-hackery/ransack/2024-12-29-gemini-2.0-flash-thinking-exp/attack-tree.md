Title: High-Risk Attack Paths and Critical Nodes in Ransack Threat Model

Attacker Goal: Compromise Application via Ransack Exploitation

Sub-Tree:

* Exploit Ransack Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)
    * Manipulate Search Parameters to Achieve SQL Injection (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)
        * Inject Malicious SQL in Field Names (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)
        * Inject Malicious SQL in Search Values (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)
        * Exploit Vulnerable Predicates or Custom Predicates (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)

Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Manipulate Search Parameters to Achieve SQL Injection

* Attack Vector: Inject Malicious SQL in Field Names
    * Goal: Execute arbitrary SQL queries by crafting malicious field names.
    * Method: Supply crafted field names in the search parameters that, when processed by Ransack, result in the execution of unintended SQL.
    * Example: `q[user_id_eq]=1' OR '1'='1` (if `user_id_eq` is directly used in SQL).
    * Potential Impact: Data breach, data manipulation, potential for privilege escalation.
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Input Sanitization: Strictly sanitize and validate all input used in Ransack queries, especially field names.
        * Parameterized Queries: Ensure Ransack or the underlying database adapter uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Avoid direct string interpolation of field names.
        * Least Privilege: Run database operations with the least necessary privileges.
        * Web Application Firewall (WAF): Implement a WAF to detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts.

* Attack Vector: Inject Malicious SQL in Search Values
    * Goal: Execute arbitrary SQL queries by crafting malicious values for search parameters.
    * Method: Supply crafted values in the search parameters that, when processed by Ransack, result in the execution of unintended SQL.
    * Example: `q[name_cont]=%'; DROP TABLE users; --`
    * Potential Impact: Data breach, data manipulation, potential for privilege escalation.
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Input Sanitization:  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-supplied search values.
        * Parameterized Queries:  Ensure all search values are passed as parameters to the database query, preventing interpretation as SQL code.
        * Least Privilege:  Limit the database user's permissions.
        * Web Application Firewall (WAF):  Use a WAF to identify and block SQL injection attempts in request parameters.

* Attack Vector: Exploit Vulnerable Predicates or Custom Predicates
    * Goal: Leverage specific Ransack predicates or custom predicates to inject SQL.
    * Method: Some predicates might have vulnerabilities if they don't properly sanitize input, or if custom predicates are implemented insecurely by directly embedding user input into SQL.
    * Example: A poorly implemented custom predicate that directly concatenates user input into a SQL query.
    * Potential Impact: Data breach, data manipulation, potential for privilege escalation.
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Review Custom Predicates:  Thoroughly review and audit any custom predicates for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. Ensure they use parameterized queries or safe input handling.
        * Secure Predicate Usage:  Avoid dynamically constructing predicate strings with user input.
        * Regular Updates: Keep Ransack updated to benefit from security patches that might address vulnerabilities in built-in predicates.

Critical Node: Exploit Ransack Vulnerabilities

* This node represents the entry point for all attacks specifically targeting Ransack. Successfully exploiting any vulnerability within Ransack can lead to significant compromise.
* Mitigation Strategies:
    * Keep Ransack Updated: Regularly update Ransack to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing focusing on how Ransack is used within the application.
    * Secure Configuration: Ensure Ransack is configured securely, avoiding any potentially insecure options if they exist.
    * Principle of Least Functionality: Only enable the Ransack features that are absolutely necessary for the application's functionality.
