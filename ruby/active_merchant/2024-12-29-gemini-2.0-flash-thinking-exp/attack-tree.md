## Threat Model: Active Merchant Application - Focused on High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Compromise application using Active Merchant by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself to gain unauthorized access to sensitive payment data or manipulate payment transactions.

**High-Risk and Critical Sub-Tree:**

* **[CRITICAL] Exploit Gateway Integration Vulnerabilities**
    * **[CRITICAL] Exploit Insecure Communication with Gateway**
        * *High-Risk Path* Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on Gateway Communication (If HTTPS not enforced or improperly configured)
        * Downgrade Attacks on TLS/SSL
    * **[CRITICAL] Exploit Response Manipulation**
        * *High-Risk Path* Intercept and Modify Gateway Responses
* **[CRITICAL] Exploit Data Handling Weaknesses within Active Merchant**
    * **[CRITICAL] Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs**
        * *High-Risk Path* Active Merchant Logging Sensitive Data (e.g., full PAN, CVV)
* **[CRITICAL] Exploit Configuration Issues in Active Merchant**
    * **[CRITICAL] Exposed API Credentials**
        * *High-Risk Path* Hardcoding API Keys/Secrets in Code
        * *High-Risk Path* Storing API Keys/Secrets Insecurely in Configuration Files

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**[CRITICAL] Exploit Gateway Integration Vulnerabilities:**

* This branch represents a critical area as it directly targets the interaction with external payment gateways, the core function of Active Merchant. Compromising this interaction can lead to significant financial loss and data breaches.

**[CRITICAL] Exploit Insecure Communication with Gateway:**

* This node is critical because it represents a fundamental security flaw in how the application communicates with payment gateways.

    * **High-Risk Path: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on Gateway Communication (If HTTPS not enforced or improperly configured)**
        * Actionable Insight: Ensure HTTPS is strictly enforced for all communication with payment gateways. Verify SSL/TLS certificate validity.
        * Likelihood: Low (if basic security practices are followed), High (if not)
        * Impact: Critical
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Difficult
    * Downgrade Attacks on TLS/SSL
        * Actionable Insight: Configure your application's HTTP client to use only strong TLS versions and cipher suites.
        * Likelihood: Low
        * Impact: Critical
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Difficult

**[CRITICAL] Exploit Response Manipulation:**

* This node is critical because successful manipulation of gateway responses can lead to fraudulent transactions and incorrect record-keeping.

    * **High-Risk Path: Intercept and Modify Gateway Responses**
        * Actionable Insight: Implement strong verification of gateway responses, including signatures or MACs where available. Do not rely solely on the response status code.
        * Likelihood: Low (if proper security measures are in place), Medium (if not)
        * Impact: Critical
        * Effort: High
        * Skill Level: Advanced
        * Detection Difficulty: Very Difficult

**[CRITICAL] Exploit Data Handling Weaknesses within Active Merchant:**

* This branch is critical because it focuses on vulnerabilities that directly expose sensitive payment data handled by Active Merchant.

    * **[CRITICAL] Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs:**
        * This node is critical due to the ease with which an attacker can exploit accessible logs to obtain sensitive information.
            * **High-Risk Path: Active Merchant Logging Sensitive Data (e.g., full PAN, CVV)**
                * Actionable Insight: Configure Active Merchant's logging level appropriately. Implement custom logging to redact sensitive data before logging.
                * Likelihood: Medium (if default logging is not reviewed)
                * Impact: Critical
                * Effort: Low
                * Skill Level: Novice
                * Detection Difficulty: Very Easy (if logs are accessible)

**[CRITICAL] Exploit Configuration Issues in Active Merchant:**

* This branch is critical because misconfigurations, especially regarding API credentials, can provide attackers with direct access to payment processing capabilities.

    * **[CRITICAL] Exposed API Credentials:**
        * This node is critical as compromised API credentials grant attackers significant control over payment processing.
            * **High-Risk Path: Hardcoding API Keys/Secrets in Code**
                * Actionable Insight: Never hardcode API keys or secrets. Use secure configuration management (e.g., environment variables, secrets management tools).
                * Likelihood: Medium (common developer mistake)
                * Impact: Critical
                * Effort: Low
                * Skill Level: Novice
                * Detection Difficulty: Easy (with code review or static analysis)
            * **High-Risk Path: Storing API Keys/Secrets Insecurely in Configuration Files**
                * Actionable Insight: Securely store API keys and secrets using appropriate methods like encrypted configuration files or dedicated secrets management services.
                * Likelihood: Medium
                * Impact: Critical
                * Effort: Low
                * Skill Level: Novice
                * Detection Difficulty: Easy (if configuration files are accessible)
