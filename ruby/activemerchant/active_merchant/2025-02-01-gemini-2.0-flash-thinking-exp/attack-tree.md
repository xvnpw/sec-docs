## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in ActiveMerchant Core [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_activemerchant_core__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs, security advisories) in the ActiveMerchant core library.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High (Potentially full application compromise, data breach)
    *   Effort: Low (Public information available)
    *   Skill Level: Low to Medium (Basic vulnerability research skills)
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Depends on logging and monitoring of application and dependency versions)
*   **Actionable Insight:**
    *   Keep ActiveMerchant and its dependencies updated to the latest secure versions.
    *   Regularly monitor security advisories and CVE databases related to ActiveMerchant.
    *   Implement automated dependency scanning in your CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerable versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Storage of API Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_storage_of_api_credentials__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Gaining unauthorized access to payment gateway API keys, secrets, or credentials due to insecure storage practices.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Likelihood: Medium to High
    *   Impact: Critical (Full access to payment gateway, transaction manipulation, data breach)
    *   Effort: Low (Finding hardcoded credentials or easily accessible configuration files)
    *   Skill Level: Low (Basic reconnaissance, code review)
    *   Detection Difficulty: Easy to Medium (Static code analysis, configuration reviews can detect)
*   **Actionable Insight:**
    *   **Never hardcode API credentials directly in the application code.**
    *   Utilize secure credential management practices:
        *   Environment variables
        *   Secrets management systems (e.g., Vault, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud KMS)
    *   Implement access controls to restrict access to configuration files and secrets storage.
    *   Regularly audit code and configuration for hardcoded credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Logging Practices [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_logging_practices__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the logging of sensitive payment data (full card numbers, CVV, etc.) and gaining unauthorized access to these logs.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Critical (PCI DSS violation, data breach, identity theft)
    *   Effort: Low (Finding logs, especially if accessible via web interface or insecure storage)
    *   Skill Level: Low (Basic access to logs)
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Log analysis tools, data loss prevention systems can detect)
*   **Actionable Insight:**
    *   **Implement strict logging policies that prohibit logging sensitive payment data.**
    *   Sanitize or mask sensitive data (e.g., PAN truncation, tokenization) before logging.
    *   Securely store logs with appropriate access controls.
    *   Implement log monitoring and alerting for suspicious access or patterns.
    *   Regularly review logging configurations and practices to ensure compliance and security.
