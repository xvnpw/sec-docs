# Threat Model Analysis for activemerchant/active_merchant

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability in Active Merchant Gem](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_in_active_merchant_gem.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known security vulnerability in an outdated version of the `active_merchant` gem. This could involve sending specially crafted requests or data that triggers the vulnerability. Exploitation could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or data breaches.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive data (including payment information if mishandled by the application), denial of service, reputational damage.
*   **Affected Active Merchant Component:** Core `active_merchant` gem code, potentially affecting various modules and functions depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update `active_merchant` to the latest stable version.
    *   Implement automated dependency scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerable versions.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for `active_merchant` and Ruby ecosystem.
    *   Have a process for quickly patching or upgrading dependencies when vulnerabilities are disclosed.

## Threat: [Insecure Communication with Payment Gateway](./threats/insecure_communication_with_payment_gateway.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker performs a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to intercept communication between the application and the payment gateway. This could be achieved by compromising network infrastructure or exploiting weaknesses in SSL/TLS configuration. The attacker could then steal sensitive payment data transmitted in clear text if HTTPS is not properly enforced or downgraded.
*   **Impact:** Interception of sensitive payment data (credit card details, etc.), fraudulent transactions, data breach, compliance violations (PCI DSS).
*   **Affected Active Merchant Component:**  `ActiveMerchant::Billing::Gateway` and specific gateway implementations (e.g., `ActiveMerchant::Billing::AuthorizeNetGateway`). Relates to the underlying HTTP communication handled by Ruby's standard libraries as used by Active Merchant.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all communication with payment gateways at both application and infrastructure levels.
    *   Verify SSL/TLS configuration and certificate validity.
    *   Use strong TLS protocols and cipher suites.
    *   Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers.
    *   Regularly review network security configurations.

## Threat: [Exposure of Gateway API Keys and Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_gateway_api_keys_and_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to payment gateway API keys or other credentials. This could happen through various means, such as:
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application or infrastructure to access configuration files or environment variables.
    *   Social engineering or phishing attacks targeting developers or operations staff.
    *   Insider threats.
    With compromised credentials, the attacker can impersonate the application and perform unauthorized actions on the payment gateway, such as initiating fraudulent transactions or accessing sensitive account information.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to payment gateway accounts, fraudulent transactions, financial losses, data breaches, reputational damage.
*   **Affected Active Merchant Component:** Configuration and initialization of `ActiveMerchant::Billing::Gateway` instances, where credentials are used.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store API keys and credentials securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
    *   Avoid hardcoding credentials in application code or configuration files.
    *   Implement strict access control for credential management systems.
    *   Regularly rotate API keys and credentials.
    *   Monitor for unauthorized access or usage of API keys.

## Threat: [Unnecessary or Insecure Storage of Sensitive Payment Data](./threats/unnecessary_or_insecure_storage_of_sensitive_payment_data.md)

*   **Description:**  Developers might mistakenly store sensitive payment data (e.g., credit card numbers, CVV codes) in databases, logs, or temporary files, even though `active_merchant` is designed to minimize this need. An attacker who gains access to these storage locations could steal sensitive payment information.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, compliance violations (PCI DSS), significant financial and reputational damage, legal repercussions.
*   **Affected Active Merchant Component:**  Application code that interacts with `active_merchant` and handles payment data. While not directly *in* `active_merchant`, it's a direct consequence of how developers use it and handle sensitive data related to payment processing facilitated by `active_merchant`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege and data minimization.
    *   Avoid storing sensitive payment data whenever possible.
    *   If storage is absolutely necessary (e.g., for recurring billing using tokenization), ensure data is encrypted at rest and in transit using strong encryption algorithms.
    *   Implement strict access control to sensitive data storage locations.
    *   Regularly audit data storage practices to identify and eliminate unnecessary storage of sensitive data.
    *   Utilize tokenization features provided by payment gateways through `active_merchant` to minimize direct handling of sensitive data.
