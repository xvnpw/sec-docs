# Threat Model Analysis for activemerchant/active_merchant

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of API Credentials](./threats/insecure_storage_of_api_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to API credentials (API keys, passwords, etc.) for payment gateways. These credentials are used directly by `active_merchant` to authenticate with the payment gateway. With these credentials, the attacker can impersonate the application and perform unauthorized actions on the payment gateway through `active_merchant`, such as initiating fraudulent transactions or accessing sensitive account information.

**Impact:** Financial loss due to unauthorized transactions processed via `active_merchant`, potential data breaches of customer payment information stored on the gateway accessed through `active_merchant`, and disruption of payment processing.

**Affected Component:** `active_merchant::Billing::Gateway` modules (e.g., `AuthorizeNetCim`, `Stripe`, etc.) which directly utilize the stored credentials.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store API credentials securely using environment variables.
* Utilize secure vault solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
* Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the application code where `active_merchant` is used.
* Implement proper access controls on configuration files that might be read by `active_merchant`.
* Regularly rotate API credentials used by `active_merchant`.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Gateway Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_gateway_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the application (using `active_merchant`) and the payment gateway. While `active_merchant` uses HTTPS, vulnerabilities in its underlying HTTP client's SSL/TLS configuration could allow an attacker to decrypt or modify the communication handled by `active_merchant`. This could lead to the theft of sensitive payment information being transmitted by `active_merchant` or manipulation of transaction data before it reaches the gateway.

**Impact:** Theft of customer payment information (credit card details, etc.) being transmitted through `active_merchant`, manipulation of transaction amounts or details handled by `active_merchant`, and potential for unauthorized transactions initiated or modified via `active_merchant`.

**Affected Component:** The underlying HTTP client used by `active_merchant` (e.g., `Net::HTTP`) and its SSL/TLS configuration when making requests to payment gateway APIs.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure the application's environment and the underlying HTTP client used by `active_merchant` are configured to enforce strong TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or higher).
* Consider implementing certificate pinning within the application's interaction with `active_merchant` to prevent attackers from using forged certificates.
* Regularly update the `active_merchant` gem and its dependencies to patch any known vulnerabilities in the HTTP client.
* Enforce HTTPS for all communication initiated by `active_merchant` with the payment gateway.

## Threat: [Logging of Sensitive Payment Information](./threats/logging_of_sensitive_payment_information.md)

**Description:** `active_merchant` itself, or the application's interaction with it, inadvertently logs sensitive payment information (e.g., full credit card numbers, CVV, cardholder names) in application logs, database logs, or other accessible locations. This occurs because `active_merchant` handles this sensitive data during processing.

**Impact:** Significant data breach of highly sensitive information processed by `active_merchant`, leading to potential financial fraud, identity theft, regulatory fines (e.g., PCI DSS violations), and severe reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Logging mechanisms within `active_merchant` (if any are enabled and not properly configured) and the application's logging of data passed to or received from `active_merchant` functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure `active_merchant` to avoid logging sensitive information.
* Implement strict logging policies in the application that explicitly prohibit logging sensitive payment information handled by `active_merchant`.
* Utilize logging libraries that allow for redaction or masking of sensitive data before or after `active_merchant` processes it.
* Securely store and manage application logs with appropriate access controls.
* Regularly review application logs for any accidental logging of sensitive data related to `active_merchant` operations.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Active Merchant Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_active_merchant_dependencies.md)

**Description:** `active_merchant` relies on other Ruby gems. If these dependencies have security vulnerabilities, attackers could potentially exploit them through the `active_merchant` library, compromising the application's payment processing functionality.

**Impact:** Application compromise via vulnerabilities in `active_merchant`'s dependencies, potentially leading to data breaches or other malicious activities affecting payment processing.

**Affected Component:** The dependency management system (e.g., Bundler) and the specific vulnerable dependency used by `active_merchant`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update `active_merchant` and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., Bundler Audit, Dependabot) to identify and remediate known vulnerabilities in `active_merchant`'s dependencies.
* Monitor security advisories for `active_merchant` and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on Active Merchant](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_active_merchant.md)

**Description:** The `active_merchant` gem itself is compromised, either through malicious code injection or account takeover on platforms like RubyGems.org. This could lead to malicious code being included in applications using the compromised version of `active_merchant`, directly affecting payment processing.

**Impact:** Widespread application compromise through the malicious `active_merchant` gem, potentially leading to data breaches, backdoors specifically targeting payment processing, or other malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** The `active_merchant` gem itself.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Verify the integrity of the `active_merchant` gem using checksums or signatures.
* Use trusted sources for downloading and installing the gem.
* Consider using dependency signing or other mechanisms to ensure the authenticity of the `active_merchant` gem.
* Monitor security advisories related to the `active_merchant` gem.
