## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Manipulating Payment Processing via Insecure Gateway Communication](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_manipulating_payment_processing_via_insecure_gateway_communication.md)

*   **Critical Node: Exploit Insecure Gateway Communication**
    *   This represents the attacker's ability to intercept or manipulate communication between the application and the payment gateway. This is a critical point because successful exploitation here can lead to various forms of payment fraud and manipulation.

*   **Attack Vector: Exploit Lack of Mutual TLS Verification**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Detailed Breakdown:** If the application or Active Merchant configuration does not enforce mutual TLS (where both the client and server authenticate each other using certificates), an attacker can potentially perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. This involves intercepting the communication flow and potentially modifying the data being exchanged. For instance, an attacker could alter the payment amount, recipient details, or even inject malicious commands. Detecting this requires careful network monitoring to identify unauthorized interception or manipulation of encrypted traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exposing Sensitive Data via Insecure Logging](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exposing_sensitive_data_via_insecure_logging.md)

*   **Critical Node: Exploit Insecure Logging Practices**
    *   This node signifies weaknesses in how the application or Active Merchant handles logging, making it a potential source of sensitive information leakage.

*   **Attack Vector: Log Sensitive Payment Information (e.g., Full PAN, CVV)**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
    *   **Detailed Breakdown:**  A common mistake in application development is logging sensitive data, such as full Primary Account Numbers (PAN), Card Verification Values (CVV), or other personally identifiable information (PII), in plain text. This can occur in application logs, server logs, or even debugging logs. An attacker gaining access to these logs, which often requires minimal effort and skill if permissions are not properly configured, can directly obtain this sensitive information, leading to identity theft, financial fraud, and regulatory compliance breaches. Detecting this involves reviewing log configurations and the content of log files for sensitive data patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Abusing Gateway Credentials due to Insecure Storage](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_abusing_gateway_credentials_due_to_insecure_storage.md)

*   **Critical Node: Exploit Insecure Storage of API Keys/Credentials**
    *   This represents vulnerabilities in how the application stores and manages the sensitive API keys or credentials required to authenticate with the payment gateway.

*   **Attack Vector: Retrieve API Keys from Configuration Files, Environment Variables, or Memory**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
    *   **Detailed Breakdown:** Payment gateway API keys are crucial for authenticating requests. If these keys are stored insecurely, such as in plain text configuration files committed to version control, easily accessible environment variables, or left in memory after use, an attacker can retrieve them. This access grants the attacker the ability to impersonate the application and make unauthorized API calls to the payment gateway. This could include processing fraudulent transactions, accessing sensitive account information, or even disabling the payment processing functionality. Detecting this involves reviewing configuration practices, environment variable management, and potentially memory analysis for exposed credentials.
