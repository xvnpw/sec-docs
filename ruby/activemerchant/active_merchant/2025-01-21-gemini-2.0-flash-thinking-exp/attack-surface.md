# Attack Surface Analysis for activemerchant/active_merchant

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Communication with Payment Gateways](./attack_surfaces/insecure_communication_with_payment_gateways.md)

*   **Description:**  Sensitive payment data transmitted between the application and the payment gateway is vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping.
*   **How Active Merchant Contributes:**  `active_merchant` handles the communication logic with various payment gateways. If not configured correctly or if the underlying HTTP client is vulnerable, it can facilitate insecure communication.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the application and the payment gateway over an unencrypted HTTP connection, capturing credit card details.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive payment information, leading to financial fraud, identity theft, and reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all communication with payment gateway APIs.
    *   Ensure proper TLS/SSL certificate validation is enabled in the underlying HTTP client used by `active_merchant`.
    *   Regularly update `active_merchant` and its dependencies to patch any known vulnerabilities in the communication layer.
    *   Utilize payment gateways that enforce secure communication protocols.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of API Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_api_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**  Payment gateway API keys, secrets, or other authentication credentials required by `active_merchant` are exposed, allowing unauthorized access to the payment gateway.
*   **How Active Merchant Contributes:** `active_merchant` requires these credentials to interact with payment gateways. Improper storage or handling of these credentials within the application using `active_merchant` creates a risk.
*   **Example:** API keys are hardcoded in the application's source code or stored in easily accessible configuration files without proper encryption. An attacker gains access to these keys and can make fraudulent transactions through the gateway.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the payment gateway, leading to financial losses, data breaches, and potential legal repercussions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store API credentials securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
    *   Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application code.
    *   Implement proper access controls to restrict who can access configuration files containing credentials.
    *   Regularly rotate API keys and secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Payment Gateway API Interactions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_payment_gateway_api_interactions.md)

*   **Description:**  Flaws in how `active_merchant` interacts with specific payment gateway APIs can be exploited to bypass security measures or cause unintended actions.
*   **How Active Merchant Contributes:** `active_merchant` provides abstractions for interacting with various gateways. Bugs or oversights in these abstractions or the handling of gateway responses can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in `active_merchant`'s implementation for a specific gateway allows an attacker to manipulate transaction parameters, leading to unauthorized refunds or changes in transaction amounts.
*   **Impact:**  Financial losses, data manipulation, and potential disruption of payment processing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `active_merchant` updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   Thoroughly test the application's payment processing logic with different scenarios and edge cases.
    *   Consult the specific payment gateway's documentation for security best practices and potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using the latest stable versions of payment gateway APIs.

## Attack Surface: [Data Leakage through Logging](./attack_surfaces/data_leakage_through_logging.md)

*   **Description:**  Sensitive payment information is unintentionally logged by `active_merchant` or the application using it, making it accessible to attackers.
*   **How Active Merchant Contributes:**  `active_merchant` might log request and response data for debugging purposes. If not configured carefully, this can include sensitive information.
*   **Example:**  `active_merchant` logs full credit card numbers or CVV codes in application logs, which are then compromised by an attacker.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive payment data, leading to financial fraud and reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure logging levels in `active_merchant` and the application to avoid logging sensitive data.
    *   Implement mechanisms to redact or mask sensitive information before logging.
    *   Securely store and manage application logs, restricting access to authorized personnel only.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Gateway Implementation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_gateway_implementation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  If developers create custom gateway integrations using `active_merchant`, vulnerabilities in this custom code can introduce security risks.
*   **How Active Merchant Contributes:** `active_merchant` provides a framework for building custom gateways. Security flaws in the custom implementation are the responsibility of the developer.
*   **Example:** A custom gateway implementation doesn't properly sanitize input before sending it to the third-party gateway, leading to injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability in the custom implementation, potentially leading to data breaches or financial losses.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom gateway integrations.
    *   Thoroughly test custom gateway implementations for security vulnerabilities.
    *   Regularly review and update custom gateway code.
    *   Consider using well-established and maintained gateway integrations provided by `active_merchant` whenever possible.
