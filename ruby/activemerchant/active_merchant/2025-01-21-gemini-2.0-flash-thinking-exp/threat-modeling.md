# Threat Model Analysis for activemerchant/active_merchant

## Threat: [Hardcoded API Credentials](./threats/hardcoded_api_credentials.md)

**Description:** Attackers might find API keys, passwords, or other sensitive credentials directly embedded within `active_merchant`'s configuration files or within gateway adapter files. This could occur through access to the codebase or configuration.

**Impact:** With these credentials, attackers can directly interact with the payment gateway via `active_merchant`, potentially processing fraudulent transactions or accessing sensitive account information.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid hardcoding credentials in `active_merchant` configuration or adapter files.
* Utilize environment variables or secure secrets management solutions for storing API credentials accessed by `active_merchant`.

## Threat: [Logging of Sensitive Payment Data](./threats/logging_of_sensitive_payment_data.md)

**Description:** `active_merchant`'s debugging or error handling code might inadvertently log sensitive payment information (e.g., full credit card numbers) if not properly configured. Attackers gaining access to these logs could steal this data.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive payment data leads to a significant data breach, potential financial fraud, and non-compliance with regulations like PCI DSS.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure `active_merchant` to prevent logging of sensitive data.
* Implement application-level logging practices that explicitly exclude sensitive information before interacting with `active_merchant`.

## Threat: [Improper Handling of Gateway Responses](./threats/improper_handling_of_gateway_responses.md)

**Description:** If the application doesn't properly validate responses received from the payment gateway through `active_merchant`, attackers might manipulate or forge responses. This could trick the application into believing a fraudulent transaction was successful.

**Impact:** Financial losses for the merchant due to processing fraudulent transactions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict validation of all data received from the payment gateway via `active_merchant`'s response objects.
* Verify the integrity and authenticity of gateway responses using mechanisms provided by the gateway.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Gateway Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_gateway_communication.md)

**Description:** While `active_merchant` uses HTTPS, misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the underlying SSL/TLS implementation used by `active_merchant`'s HTTP client could allow attackers to intercept and potentially manipulate communication between the application (via `active_merchant`) and the payment gateway.

**Impact:** Attackers could steal sensitive payment information transmitted through `active_merchant` or alter transaction details.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure the application and server environment use strong TLS versions and cipher suites for `active_merchant`'s underlying HTTP requests.
* Regularly update the underlying SSL/TLS libraries used by Ruby and `active_merchant`'s dependencies.
* Enforce certificate validation and hostname verification in `active_merchant`'s HTTP client configuration (if configurable).

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Gateway Implementations](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_gateway_implementations.md)

**Description:** Developers implementing custom gateway integrations using `active_merchant`'s framework might introduce security vulnerabilities in their custom code within the `ActiveMerchant::Billing::Gateway` subclass.

**Impact:** These vulnerabilities could expose sensitive data or allow for unauthorized transaction processing through the custom gateway integration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow secure coding practices when implementing custom gateway integrations within `active_merchant`.
* Conduct thorough security reviews and penetration testing of custom gateway code.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `active_merchant` Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__active_merchant__dependencies.md)

**Description:** `active_merchant` relies on other Ruby gems. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited by attackers to compromise the application's payment processing functionality through `active_merchant`.

**Impact:** Exploitation of dependency vulnerabilities could lead to various security breaches, including remote code execution or data leaks affecting `active_merchant`'s operations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update `active_merchant` and its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
* Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in `active_merchant`'s dependencies.
