## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Sent to Payment Gateway](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_sent_to_payment_gateway.md)

*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Data Sent to Payment Gateway
    *   AND Manipulate Transaction Amount
        *   Modify Amount Parameter (e.g., via MITM, compromised application logic)
    *   AND Inject Malicious Data into Transaction Parameters
        *   Inject Scripting Code (less likely due to gateway validation, but potential for application-side issues)
        *   Inject Data to Cause Gateway Errors or Unexpected Behavior (e.g., oversized fields)
    *   AND [CRITICAL] Leak Sensitive Data via Transaction Parameters (if not properly sanitized by application)
        *   Include Sensitive User Data in Description or Metadata fields

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Data Sent to Payment Gateway**

*   **Manipulate Transaction Amount:** Attackers might try to alter the transaction amount before it reaches the gateway. This could involve intercepting the request (Man-in-the-Middle) or exploiting vulnerabilities in the application logic that constructs the payment request. A successful attack could lead to the attacker paying less than the actual price.
*   **Inject Malicious Data into Transaction Parameters:** While payment gateways typically have strong validation, attackers might try to inject code or data into fields like descriptions or metadata. This could potentially cause issues on the application side when processing the gateway's response or if the gateway has unexpected behavior.
*   **[CRITICAL] Leak Sensitive Data via Transaction Parameters (if not properly sanitized by application):** If the application doesn't properly sanitize data before sending it to Active Merchant, sensitive user information might inadvertently be included in transaction parameters, potentially exposing it to the gateway or in gateway logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Gateway Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gateway_credentials.md)

*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** [CRITICAL] Exploit Gateway Credentials
    *   AND [CRITICAL] Obtain Stored Gateway Credentials
        *   Access Configuration Files (e.g., `.env`, `config/secrets.yml`)
        *   Exploit Application Vulnerabilities (e.g., Local File Inclusion, Remote Code Execution)
        *   Access Environment Variables
        *   Compromise Developer Machines or CI/CD Pipelines
        *   Social Engineering
    *   AND Intercept Gateway Credentials in Transit (less likely with HTTPS)
        *   Man-in-the-Middle Attack (requires compromising network or application infrastructure)
    *   AND Brute-force or Guess Gateway Credentials (unlikely with strong gateway security)
        *   Attempt Common API Keys or Passwords
    *   AND [CRITICAL] Exploit Insecure Credential Management Practices
        *   Hardcoded Credentials in Code
        *   Storing Credentials in Plain Text

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Gateway Credentials**

*   **[CRITICAL] Obtain Stored Gateway Credentials:** Gateway API keys and secrets are critical. Attackers will target locations where these credentials might be stored, including configuration files, environment variables, databases, and even developer machines. Exploiting application vulnerabilities like Local File Inclusion or Remote Code Execution can facilitate this.
*   **Intercept Gateway Credentials in Transit (less likely with HTTPS):** While less likely with HTTPS, if the communication channel is compromised, attackers could intercept credentials being exchanged.
*   **Brute-force or Guess Gateway Credentials (unlikely with strong gateway security):** While gateways usually have security measures against this, weak or default credentials could be vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
*   **[CRITICAL] Exploit Insecure Credential Management Practices:** Hardcoding credentials directly in the code or storing them in plain text is a significant security risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Application Integration with Active Merchant](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_application_integration_with_active_merchant.md)

*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** [CRITICAL] Exploit Insecure Application Integration with Active Merchant
    *   AND [CRITICAL] Improper Handling of Sensitive Data Before Passing to Active Merchant
        *   Logging or Storing Raw Credit Card Data before Tokenization
    *   AND Insecure Configuration of Active Merchant
        *   Using Insecure or Deprecated Gateway Configurations
    *   AND Lack of Proper Error Handling and Logging around Active Merchant Interactions
        *   Information Leakage through Verbose Error Messages
    *   AND Insufficient Input Validation Before Using Active Merchant Methods
        *   Passing Untrusted User Input Directly to Active Merchant Methods without Sanitization

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Insecure Application Integration with Active Merchant**

*   **[CRITICAL] Improper Handling of Sensitive Data Before Passing to Active Merchant:** Logging or storing raw credit card data before it's tokenized by Active Merchant creates a significant security vulnerability.
*   **Insecure Configuration of Active Merchant:** Using outdated or insecure gateway configurations can expose the application to known vulnerabilities.
*   **Lack of Proper Error Handling and Logging around Active Merchant Interactions:** Verbose error messages might leak sensitive information about the application's configuration or internal workings.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation Before Using Active Merchant Methods:** Passing untrusted user input directly to Active Merchant methods without proper sanitization can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
