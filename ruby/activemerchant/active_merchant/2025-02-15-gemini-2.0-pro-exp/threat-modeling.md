# Threat Model Analysis for activemerchant/active_merchant

## Threat: [Gateway Impersonation via Configuration Manipulation](./threats/gateway_impersonation_via_configuration_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the application's configuration and modifies the Active Merchant gateway URL (within the `ActiveMerchant::Billing::Base.gateway` setting or the specific gateway class configuration) to point to a malicious server. This allows the attacker to intercept all payment data processed by Active Merchant.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of payment data, financial loss for users and the merchant, severe reputational damage, legal liability.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ActiveMerchant::Billing::Base.gateway` (and the specific gateway class being used, e.g., `ActiveMerchant::Billing::BogusGateway`, `ActiveMerchant::Billing::StripeGateway`), configuration files/mechanisms storing gateway URLs and credentials.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Configuration Management:** Use a secure, access-controlled system (e.g., environment variables, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store gateway URLs and credentials. *Never* store them in source code.
        *   **Strict Access Control:** Implement the principle of least privilege for access to configuration data.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Monitor configuration files for unauthorized changes.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Audit configuration settings and access controls regularly.
        *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Require code reviews for any changes affecting gateway configuration.

## Threat: [Payment Data Tampering via MITM (Active Merchant's HTTPS Handling)](./threats/payment_data_tampering_via_mitm__active_merchant's_https_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** If Active Merchant's internal HTTPS handling is misconfigured or bypassed (e.g., due to a coding error, a vulnerability in Active Merchant's HTTPS implementation, or a failure to properly validate certificates), an attacker could perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack to intercept and modify payment data in transit between Active Merchant and the payment gateway.  This is *specifically* about failures *within* Active Merchant's handling of the connection, not general HTTPS failures.
    *   **Impact:** Financial loss, data breach, reputational damage, legal liability.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific `ActiveMerchant::Billing::Gateway` subclass being used, and the underlying network communication code *within* Active Merchant (how it uses libraries like `net/http`). The `purchase`, `authorize`, `capture`, `credit`, and `void` methods are all vulnerable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Verify HTTPS Configuration:** Ensure Active Merchant is correctly configured to use HTTPS and that certificate validation is *enabled* and *working correctly*.  Test this thoroughly.
        *   **Review Active Merchant Code (if necessary):** If you suspect issues with Active Merchant's HTTPS handling, review the relevant source code (though this is a less common mitigation).
        *   **Keep Active Merchant Updated:**  Ensure you are using the latest version of Active Merchant, which should include any security fixes related to HTTPS handling.
        *   **Minimize Data Exposure:** Prefer gateway integration methods that avoid sending sensitive data through your application server (e.g., hosted payment pages, tokenization). This reduces the reliance on Active Merchant's direct handling of sensitive data.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Leakage in Active Merchant's Logging](./threats/sensitive_data_leakage_in_active_merchant's_logging.md)

*   **Description:** Active Merchant's built-in logging (if enabled and misconfigured) could inadvertently log sensitive data, such as partial card numbers, CVV codes, or API responses containing sensitive details, to application logs. This is a direct threat if Active Merchant's logging features are used improperly.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, violation of PCI DSS, reputational damage, legal liability.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ActiveMerchant::Billing::Gateway` subclasses, specifically the methods that handle API requests and responses (e.g., `commit`), and any logging configuration options provided by Active Merchant.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable or Configure Active Merchant Logging:** Carefully review and configure Active Merchant's logging options. Disable logging of sensitive data or use filtering mechanisms if provided.  If Active Merchant doesn't offer sufficient control, disable its built-in logging entirely.
        *   **Implement Custom, Secure Logging:** If you need to log Active Merchant interactions, implement your own logging solution that *explicitly* filters out or redacts sensitive data.
        *   **Regular Log Review:** Regularly review application logs for any accidental exposure of sensitive data.
        *   **Secure Log Storage:** Store logs securely and protect them from unauthorized access.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization (within Active Merchant)](./threats/insecure_deserialization__within_active_merchant_.md)

* **Description:** If Active Merchant itself (or a tightly coupled, directly used component) uses insecure deserialization of data received from the payment gateway (e.g., using `Marshal.load` in Ruby without proper precautions), an attacker could inject malicious serialized objects, potentially leading to remote code execution. This is specifically about vulnerabilities *within* Active Merchant's code, not in a separate dependency.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete system compromise.
    * **Affected Component:** Any part of Active Merchant that uses deserialization of untrusted data, particularly from gateway responses.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Code Review (of Active Merchant):** Examine the Active Merchant codebase for any instances of insecure deserialization. This is a more advanced mitigation, requiring familiarity with the library's internals.
        * **Keep Active Merchant Updated:** Ensure you are using the latest version of Active Merchant, which should include any security fixes related to deserialization.
        * **Contribute Patches (if necessary):** If you identify an insecure deserialization vulnerability in Active Merchant, report it to the maintainers and, if possible, contribute a patch to fix it.
        * **Avoid Untrusted Deserialization (in your integration):** Ensure that *your* code, when interacting with Active Merchant, does not introduce any insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (within Active Merchant's XML handling)](./threats/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection__within_active_merchant's_xml_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** If Active Merchant is used with a payment gateway that uses XML for communication, *and* Active Merchant's internal XML parsing is not properly configured, an attacker could inject malicious XML containing external entities. This is specifically about vulnerabilities *within* Active Merchant's XML handling, not a general XXE vulnerability in a separate library.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (e.g., reading local files on the server), denial of service, potential for remote code execution (in rare cases).
    *   **Affected Component:** `ActiveMerchant::Billing::Gateway` subclasses that use XML-based communication, the XML parsing code *within* Active Merchant.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if applicable)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Review (of Active Merchant):** Examine the Active Merchant codebase for how it handles XML parsing. Ensure that external entities and DTDs are disabled.
        *   **Keep Active Merchant Updated:** Use the latest version of Active Merchant, which should include any security fixes related to XML parsing.
        *   **Contribute Patches (if necessary):** If you identify an XXE vulnerability in Active Merchant, report it and, if possible, contribute a fix.
        * **Avoid XML based gateways:** If possible, use gateways that use more secure formats like JSON.
