## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Gateway-Specific Logic Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_gateway-specific_logic_flaws.md)

*   **1a. Bypass CVV/AVS [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to submit transactions without valid Card Verification Value (CVV) or Address Verification System (AVS) data. This can occur if `active_merchant` or the application doesn't correctly handle the specific gateway's CVV/AVS response codes, or if the gateway allows optional or non-standard CVV/AVS checks.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (allows fraudulent transactions)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement server-side validation of CVV/AVS results, independent of `active_merchant`.
        *   Thoroughly test the gateway integration's handling of various CVV/AVS response codes.
        *   Consider using the gateway's specific API for more robust validation.

*   **1b. Replay Attacks [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker captures a legitimate, successful transaction and attempts to resubmit it to the payment gateway. This is possible if `active_merchant` or the application fails to properly handle nonces, timestamps, or other anti-replay mechanisms provided by the gateway.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High (allows duplicate fraudulent transactions)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Ensure the application uses and validates unique transaction identifiers (nonces) provided by the gateway.
        *   Implement strict timestamp validation, rejecting transactions that are too old.
        *   Consult the gateway's documentation for its recommended anti-replay measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Active Merchant's Abstraction Layer](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_active_merchant's_abstraction_layer.md)

*   **2a. Inject Malicious Parameters {CRITICAL} [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to inject unexpected or malicious data into the parameters passed to `active_merchant`. This aims to alter the transaction details (e.g., amount, currency) before they reach the gateway. This is a fundamental vulnerability stemming from insufficient input validation.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (can lead to unauthorized transactions, altered amounts, etc.)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   *Never* trust user-supplied input.
        *   Implement robust server-side validation and sanitization of *all* data *before* passing it to `active_merchant`.
        *   Use strong parameterization and whitelisting.

*   **2b. Bypass Gateway-Specific Checks [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to bypass security checks (e.g., amount limits, currency restrictions) that might be implemented within `active_merchant`. This relies on the application not implementing its own, independent server-side validation.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (can lead to unauthorized transactions)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement robust server-side validation of *all* critical transaction parameters, independent of `active_merchant`.
        *   Avoid relying solely on `active_merchant`'s built-in validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Leverage Configuration Errors](./attack_tree_paths/3__leverage_configuration_errors.md)

*   **3a. Use Default Credentials [HIGH RISK] {CRITICAL}:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker gains access to the payment gateway by using default or easily guessable credentials. This is a catastrophic configuration error.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High (complete compromise of the payment processing system)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   *Never* use default credentials.
        *   Use strong, unique passwords and API keys.
        *   Store credentials securely (environment variables, secrets manager, etc.).

*   **3b. Expose Sensitive Data [HIGH RISK] {CRITICAL}:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker obtains API keys, merchant IDs, or other sensitive information that is accidentally exposed in logs, error messages, client-side code, or source code repositories.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High (allows attackers to impersonate the merchant)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Carefully review all logging and error handling to ensure sensitive data is *never* exposed.
        *   Use a logging library that supports redaction.
        *   Avoid including sensitive data in client-side code.
        *   Regularly scan code repositories for accidental credential exposure.
