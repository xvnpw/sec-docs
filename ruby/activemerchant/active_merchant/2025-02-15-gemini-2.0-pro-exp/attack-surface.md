# Attack Surface Analysis for activemerchant/active_merchant

## Attack Surface: [Gateway-Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/gateway-specific_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **1. Gateway-Specific Vulnerabilities**

    *   **Description:** Flaws or weaknesses in the specific payment gateway's API or implementation, accessible *through* `active_merchant`'s integration code. This is the most direct and critical risk associated with using the library.
    *   **How `active_merchant` Contributes:** `active_merchant` is the *direct* interface to the potentially vulnerable gateway. The library's integration code for a specific gateway might be outdated, contain bugs, or fail to properly handle security features of the gateway's API. This is a *core* concern.
    *   **Example:** An outdated `active_merchant` integration for "GatewayX" doesn't implement a new security protocol required by GatewayX, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication and make fraudulent transactions. Or, a zero-day vulnerability in "GatewayY" is exploited via applications using `active_merchant` before a patch is available and integrated.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches (credit card details, PII), fraudulent transactions, financial loss, significant reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High** (severity depends on the specific gateway and the nature of the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Aggressive Updates:**  Maintain `active_merchant` and *all* its gateway-specific components at the *absolute latest* versions. This is non-negotiable. Automate dependency updates and security checks, prioritizing updates related to `active_merchant` and the specific gateways in use.
        *   **Gateway Selection & Due Diligence:**  Thoroughly research the security history and track record of *any* payment gateway before integration. Choose reputable, actively maintained gateways with a strong security posture. Continuously monitor for security advisories related to your chosen gateways.
        *   **Targeted Penetration Testing:**  Penetration testing *must* specifically target the payment processing flow, including interactions with the chosen gateway(s) through `active_merchant`. This should be a regular and high-priority activity.
        *   **Configuration Hardening:**  Regularly audit and secure *all* gateway configuration settings (API keys, secrets, encryption settings, etc.). Enforce the principle of least privilege for all credentials.
        *   **Response Validation (Beyond `active_merchant`):** Implement robust server-side validation of *all* responses received from the gateway, *even if* `active_merchant` performs some validation. Never blindly trust data returned from the gateway.

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data Mishandling (Directly Related to `active_merchant` Usage)](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_mishandling__directly_related_to__active_merchant__usage_.md)

*   **2. Sensitive Data Mishandling (Directly Related to `active_merchant` Usage)**

    *   **Description:**  Improper handling of sensitive data *specifically* within the context of `active_merchant` interactions, even if the library itself aims for secure handling. This focuses on errors *directly* related to how the application uses the library.
    *   **How `active_merchant` Contributes:** While `active_merchant` attempts to handle sensitive data securely, the application's code *interacting* with `active_merchant` is still a critical point of vulnerability. This includes how data is passed to and received from the library.
    *   **Example:** The application code incorrectly retrieves and logs raw response data from `active_merchant` *before* `active_merchant` has had a chance to mask or redact sensitive information. Or, API keys used *by* `active_merchant` are exposed due to insecure configuration practices.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches (credit card details, PII), compliance violations (PCI DSS), financial loss, severe reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input/Output Handling:**  Carefully review and control *all* data passed to and received from `active_merchant`. Avoid unnecessary logging or storage of raw response data.
        *   **Secrets Management (for `active_merchant` Credentials):**  Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and manage the API keys and secrets *required by* `active_merchant`. *Never* hardcode these credentials. Ensure secure access control to these secrets.
        *   **Tokenization (When Applicable):** If storing card details is absolutely necessary (e.g., for recurring billing), *always* use tokenization provided by the payment gateway, accessed *through* `active_merchant`. This replaces the actual card number with a non-sensitive token.
        * **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all data before passing to active_merchant.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency-Related Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency-related_vulnerabilities.md)

* **3. Dependency-Related Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:** Security flaws in the Ruby gems that `active_merchant` depends on (directly or transitively).
    *   **How `active_merchant` Contributes:** `active_merchant` introduces these dependencies into the application's environment. A vulnerability in *any* of these dependencies can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A gem used by `active_merchant` for HTTP requests has a vulnerability that allows for request smuggling. An attacker exploits this to bypass security controls and access sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the specific dependency and vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Auditing:** Use tools like `bundler-audit` or similar to automatically scan for known vulnerabilities in all dependencies. Integrate this into the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   **Dependency Locking:** Use a `Gemfile.lock` to enforce the use of specific, known-good versions of all dependencies. This prevents accidental upgrades to vulnerable versions.
        *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for new issues affecting your dependencies.
