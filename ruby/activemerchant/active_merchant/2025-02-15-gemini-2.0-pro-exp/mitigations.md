# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for activemerchant/active_merchant

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update `active_merchant`](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update__active_merchant_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update `active_merchant`

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schedule Regular Checks:** Establish a routine (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly) to check for new releases of the `active_merchant` gem.
    2.  **Use Bundler:** Utilize Ruby's Bundler to manage dependencies.
    3.  **Run `bundle update active_merchant`:** Execute this command to update `active_merchant` to the latest compatible version.
    4.  **Review Changelog:** Examine the `active_merchant` changelog for security patches and gateway updates.
    5.  **Run Tests:** *Immediately* run your complete test suite, focusing on payment processing.
    6.  **Deploy to Staging:** Deploy to a staging environment that mirrors production.
    7.  **Monitor Staging:** Thoroughly test all payment functionality in staging.
    8.  **Deploy to Production (if Staging is Successful):** Deploy to production after successful staging tests.
    9.  **Monitor Production:** Closely monitor logs and payment gateway dashboards.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Gateway-Specific Exploits (Severity: High to Critical):** Outdated gateway integrations *within* `active_merchant` are vulnerable. Updates include security patches.
    *   **`active_merchant` Internal Vulnerabilities (Severity: High to Critical):** The gem itself might have vulnerabilities. Updates address these.
    *   **Compatibility Issues (Severity: Medium):** Gateway APIs change; outdated `active_merchant` versions might become incompatible.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Gateway-Specific Exploits:** Significantly reduces/eliminates risk (if the update addresses the exploit).
    *   **`active_merchant` Internal Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces/eliminates risk (if the update addresses the vulnerability).
    *   **Compatibility Issues:** Eliminates incompatibility-related failures.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example:* Partially implemented. Updates are performed, but not on a strict schedule. Testing is done, but not always comprehensively.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example:* Need a formal schedule (e.g., every two weeks). Improve staging environment. Implement a checklist for changelog review and pre-update testing. Automate update checks.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor Gateway Security Advisories](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_gateway_security_advisories.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy:** Monitor Gateway Security Advisories

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Used Gateways:** List all payment gateways used *through* `active_merchant`.
    2.  **Subscribe to Advisories:** For *each* gateway, find their official security advisory channels (email, blogs, security pages, Twitter).
    3.  **Establish a Monitoring Process:** Designate a team member or system to check these channels.
    4.  **Assess Impact:** Determine:
        *   Does it affect your gateway integration?
        *   Does it affect your `active_merchant` version?
        *   What is the severity?
        *   What is the recommended mitigation?
    5.  **Take Action:** Update `active_merchant`, change configuration, or implement workarounds.
    6.  **Document Actions:** Record advisories, assessments, and actions taken.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Gateway-Specific Exploits (Severity: High to Critical):** Directly addresses vulnerabilities announced by gateways, even before `active_merchant` updates.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Severity: Critical):** Might provide early warning and mitigation guidance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Gateway-Specific Exploits:** Significantly reduces risk by providing timely information.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits:** Potentially reduces impact by providing early warning.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example:* Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example:* Need to list gateways, subscribe to advisories, designate a team member, and establish a process.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Never Log Raw Gateway Responses](./mitigation_strategies/never_log_raw_gateway_responses.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy:** Never Log Raw Gateway Responses

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Logging Points:** Review code where you interact with `active_merchant` to find logging.
    2.  **Review Logged Data:** Are you logging the entire `response` object from `active_merchant`?
    3.  **Modify Logging:** *Only* log specific, non-sensitive fields:
        *   `response.success?`
        *   A custom transaction ID (not the gateway's if sensitive).
        *   `response.message` (but *sanitize* this first).
        *   Error codes (but *not* the full message if sensitive).
    4.  **Use a Logging Library:** Use a library like `Logger` for control and rotation.
    5.  **Configure Log Rotation:** Rotate logs regularly and limit size/number.
    6.  **Secure Log Storage:** Store logs securely with restricted access.
    7.  **Regularly audit logs:** Periodically review logs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach (Severity: High):** Compromised logs would expose sensitive data.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Severity: High):** Violates PCI DSS and data privacy regulations.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Significantly reduces risk of exposing data in log compromise.
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Helps ensure compliance.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example:* Partially implemented. Some code logs only specific fields, others log the entire object.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example:* Comprehensive code review to fix all instances. Consistent logging policy. Configure log rotation and secure storage.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Error Messages](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_error_messages.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize Error Messages

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Error Handling:** Review how you handle errors from `active_merchant`.
    2.  **Create a Sanitization Function:** Function to remove sensitive data (card numbers, CVV, internal codes) and replace with placeholders.
    3.  **Apply Sanitization:** *Always* pass raw error messages from `active_merchant` through this function *before* displaying or logging.
    4.  **Log Detailed Errors Internally:** Log the *original*, unsanitized message (and sanitized version) in a secure, internal log.
    5.  **Use Generic User-Facing Messages:** Display generic messages (e.g., "An error occurred...").
    6.  **Test Error Handling:** Test with various errors to ensure sanitization works.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium to High):** Raw messages might contain sensitive information.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: Medium to High):** Unescaped data could be vulnerable to XSS.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Severity: High):** Displaying raw error messages with sensitive data to users can violate PCI-DSS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces risk of exposing information.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Reduces XSS risk.
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Helps to ensure compliance.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example:* Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example:* Create a sanitization function, apply it consistently, implement separate logging for internal errors, and test.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unused Gateways](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unused_gateways.md)

**5. Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Unused Gateways

* **Description:**
    1. **Identify Active Gateways:** Determine which gateways are *actively* used in production.
    2. **Review Configuration:** Examine your `active_merchant` configuration.
    3. **Remove Unused Configuration:** For unused gateways, remove their configuration settings from your `active_merchant` setup.
    4. **Remove Unused Code:** Remove any code related to the unused gateways.
    5. **Test:** Thoroughly test your application.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Unnecessary Attack Surface (Severity: Low to Medium):** Each configured gateway is a potential attack surface, even if unused.
    * **Configuration Errors (Severity: Low):** Simplifies configuration, reducing misconfiguration chances.

* **Impact:**
    * **Unnecessary Attack Surface:** Reduces the attack surface.
    * **Configuration Errors:** Reduces configuration complexity.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * *Example:* Not implemented.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * *Example:* Identify active gateways, remove unused configuration and code, and test.
