# Attack Surface Analysis for diaspora/diaspora

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Federated ActivityPub Objects](./attack_surfaces/malicious_federated_activitypub_objects.md)

*   **Description:** A remote attacker on another Diaspora pod sends specially crafted ActivityPub objects (e.g., Posts, Comments, Likes) designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the receiving Diaspora pod's parsing or processing logic.
    *   **How Diaspora Contributes:** Diaspora's core functionality relies on receiving and processing ActivityPub objects from potentially untrusted remote pods. The complexity of the ActivityPub specification and its implementation in Diaspora creates opportunities for parsing errors or logic flaws.
    *   **Example:** A malicious pod sends a post with an excessively long or malformed URL in an attachment, causing a buffer overflow in the receiving Diaspora pod's image processing library.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Diaspora pod, Denial of Service (DoS), data corruption, or unauthorized access to data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all incoming ActivityPub objects. Use secure parsing libraries and regularly update them. Implement rate limiting on incoming federation requests. Employ sandboxing or containerization for processing federated content. Conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing focusing on federation handling.

## Attack Surface: [Spoofed or Impersonated Federated Pods](./attack_surfaces/spoofed_or_impersonated_federated_pods.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sets up a rogue Diaspora pod that impersonates a legitimate pod, sending false information or malicious content that appears to originate from a trusted source.
    *   **How Diaspora Contributes:** The decentralized nature of Diaspora makes it challenging to definitively verify the identity and legitimacy of every federated pod. Weaknesses in the pod identification or verification mechanisms can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker creates a pod with a similar name and avatar to a well-known community pod and sends out misleading announcements or links to phishing sites.
    *   **Impact:** Social engineering attacks, spread of misinformation, reputational damage to legitimate pods, potential for users to be tricked into revealing credentials or downloading malware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong pod verification mechanisms, potentially using cryptographic signatures or decentralized identity solutions. Provide users with clear indicators of pod legitimacy. Consider implementing reputation scoring or trust mechanisms for federated pods.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Federated Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_federated_content.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious user on a remote Diaspora pod injects XSS payloads into their posts, comments, or profile information, which are then federated and executed in the browsers of users on the local Diaspora pod when they view that content.
    *   **How Diaspora Contributes:** Diaspora's federation mechanism propagates user-generated content from various sources. If the local pod doesn't properly sanitize this incoming content, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A user on a remote pod includes a `<script>` tag in their post, which, when viewed by users on the local pod, executes malicious JavaScript in their browser, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting them to malicious sites.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, information theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust server-side output encoding and sanitization for all federated user-generated content before rendering it in the browser. Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources. Regularly audit and update frontend code to prevent client-side XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Federated Media Handling](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_federated_media_handling.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious user on a remote pod uploads a specially crafted media file (image, video, etc.) that exploits vulnerabilities in the local Diaspora pod's media processing libraries.
    *   **How Diaspora Contributes:** Diaspora needs to handle and process media received from other pods. Vulnerabilities in image processing libraries (e.g., ImageMagick, Pillow) or video transcoding tools can be exploited through malicious files.
    *   **Example:** A malicious user uploads a specially crafted PNG file that triggers a buffer overflow in the image processing library used by the local Diaspora pod, leading to RCE.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or access to sensitive files on the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use secure and up-to-date media processing libraries. Implement strict input validation and sanitization for uploaded media files. Consider sandboxing or containerization for media processing tasks. Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
