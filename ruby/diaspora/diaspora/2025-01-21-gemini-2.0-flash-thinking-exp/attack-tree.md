        * **Attack Vector: Brute-force Weak Password Policies (Diaspora's default settings)**
            * Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access to user accounts by trying numerous password combinations. This is more likely if Diaspora's default password policies are weak or if the application doesn't enforce stronger policies.
        * **Attack Vector: Exploit Password Reset Flaws (e.g., insecure tokens, lack of rate limiting)**
            * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the password reset process, such as predictable reset tokens or the absence of rate limiting, to gain access to accounts without knowing the original password.
