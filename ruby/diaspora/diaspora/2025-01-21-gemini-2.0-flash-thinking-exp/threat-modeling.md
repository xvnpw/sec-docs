# Threat Model Analysis for diaspora/diaspora

## Threat: [Malicious Pod Content Injection](./threats/malicious_pod_content_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker controlling a remote Diaspora pod injects malicious content (e.g., crafted HTML, JavaScript) into posts, comments, or profile information that is then federated to the application's pod and potentially rendered within the application's interface. The attacker aims to execute scripts in users' browsers or deface the application's presentation of Diaspora content.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against users of the application, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites. Defacement of the application's interface displaying Diaspora content.
*   **Affected Component:** Diaspora's Federation Protocol, Post/Comment rendering logic, User Profile handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the application implements strict content security policies (CSP) to limit the execution of inline scripts and the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
    *   The application should sanitize and escape all Diaspora content received before rendering it in its interface.
    *   Regularly update the Diaspora software on the application's pod to benefit from security patches that might address content sanitization issues.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Federation Flood](./threats/denial_of_service_via_federation_flood.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the application's Diaspora pod with a large volume of requests or data from multiple compromised or controlled pods. This overwhelms the pod's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and makes the application unresponsive or unavailable.
*   **Impact:** Application downtime, impacting user access and functionality. Resource exhaustion on the server hosting the Diaspora pod.
*   **Affected Component:** Diaspora's Federation Protocol, Pod-to-Pod communication handling, Request processing logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure Diaspora to implement rate limiting on incoming federation requests.
    *   Deploy infrastructure with sufficient resources to handle expected and some unexpected spikes in federation traffic.
    *   Consider using a firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to detect and block malicious federation traffic patterns targeting the Diaspora pod.
    *   Regularly monitor the Diaspora pod's resource usage and performance.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Federation Leaks](./threats/information_disclosure_via_federation_leaks.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Diaspora federation protocol or its implementation could lead to unintended disclosure of information between pods. This exposes user data, private messages, or other sensitive information managed by the application's pod to unauthorized parties on other pods.
*   **Impact:** Breach of user privacy, potential violation of data protection regulations. Loss of trust in the application and the Diaspora platform.
*   **Affected Component:** Diaspora's Federation Protocol, Data serialization and deserialization, Access control mechanisms within federation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the application's Diaspora pod is running the latest stable version of Diaspora with all security patches applied.
    *   Carefully review the privacy settings and sharing configurations of the Diaspora pod.
    *   Avoid storing highly sensitive information directly within the Diaspora data structures if possible. Consider encrypting sensitive data before storing it within Diaspora.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Federation Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_federation_communication.md)

*   **Description:** While Diaspora uses HTTPS for pod-to-pod communication, vulnerabilities in Diaspora's TLS/SSL implementation or misconfigurations on the application's pod could allow an attacker to intercept and potentially modify communication between the application's pod and other pods.
*   **Impact:** Data interception, modification of federated content, potential for injecting malicious content or commands into the application's pod.
*   **Affected Component:** Diaspora's Networking module, TLS/SSL implementation, Certificate handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the application's Diaspora pod and the underlying operating system have up-to-date TLS libraries and secure configurations.
    *   Enforce strong TLS configurations (e.g., using strong ciphers and protocols) within the Diaspora pod's configuration.
    *   Monitor for suspicious network activity that might indicate a MITM attack targeting the Diaspora pod's communication.

## Threat: [Data Corruption within Diaspora Storage](./threats/data_corruption_within_diaspora_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities within Diaspora's data storage mechanisms (e.g., database interactions) could lead to corruption of data associated with the application's pod. This could affect posts, comments, user profiles, or other data managed by the application within the Diaspora context.
*   **Impact:** Loss of data integrity, application malfunction, potential data loss.
*   **Affected Component:** Diaspora's Database interaction layer, Data persistence mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly back up the Diaspora pod's data.
    *   Ensure the database system used by Diaspora is properly configured and maintained according to Diaspora's recommendations.
    *   Monitor for database errors or inconsistencies within the Diaspora pod.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Diaspora Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_diaspora_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Diaspora relies on various third-party libraries and components. Known vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the application's pod.
*   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution on the Diaspora pod, data breaches affecting the pod's data, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Various third-party libraries used by Diaspora (e.g., Ruby gems, JavaScript libraries).
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update the Diaspora software and its dependencies to the latest versions with security patches.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Diaspora's dependencies and prioritize updates.
