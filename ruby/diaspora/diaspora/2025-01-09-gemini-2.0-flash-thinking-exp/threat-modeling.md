# Threat Model Analysis for diaspora/diaspora

## Threat: [Malicious Pod Infiltration](./threats/malicious_pod_infiltration.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability within Diaspora's federation handling allows a compromised remote pod to inject malicious content (e.g., spam, phishing links, exploits) into the federated network, directly impacting users of other Diaspora pods. This could exploit flaws in content validation or sanitization during federation.

**Impact:** Damage to user trust across the network, potential for credential theft or malware infection of Diaspora users, widespread spread of misinformation.

**Affected Component:** Federation module, Activity Streams, Messaging.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization of content received from federated pods within Diaspora's codebase.
*   Develop and implement mechanisms for pods to assess and potentially block or limit interaction with known malicious or compromised pods at the Diaspora level.
*   Improve the security and integrity checks of inter-pod communication protocols within Diaspora.

## Threat: [Aspect Visibility Bypass](./threats/aspect_visibility_bypass.md)

**Description:** A critical vulnerability exists within Diaspora's aspect (grouping of contacts) management, allowing unauthorized users on the same pod or potentially across the federation to bypass intended visibility restrictions and view content intended for specific aspects they are not a member of. This could stem from logic errors in access control enforcement.

**Impact:** Significant privacy breaches, unintended disclosure of sensitive information to unauthorized users within the Diaspora network.

**Affected Component:** Aspects module, Privacy controls.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly review and refactor Diaspora's aspect access control logic to eliminate any bypass vulnerabilities.
*   Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests specifically targeting aspect visibility enforcement.
*   Conduct security audits focusing on Diaspora's privacy mechanisms.

## Threat: [Malicious Content Injection via Messaging](./threats/malicious_content_injection_via_messaging.md)

**Description:** A critical vulnerability in Diaspora's private messaging system allows attackers to send malicious content (e.g., XSS payloads) that is not properly sanitized, leading to execution of arbitrary code in the context of other users' browsers when they view the message.

**Impact:** Client-side attacks on Diaspora users, potential for session hijacking, credential theft, or redirection to malicious websites within the Diaspora platform.

**Affected Component:** Messaging module, Content rendering.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust server-side sanitization and encoding of all message content within Diaspora.
*   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) with strict directives within Diaspora to mitigate XSS risks.
*   Regularly review and update Diaspora's dependencies that handle content rendering.

## Threat: [Outdated Diaspora Version](./threats/outdated_diaspora_version.md)

**Description:** Running an outdated version of Diaspora exposes the instance to known security vulnerabilities present in those versions. Attackers can leverage public exploits targeting these vulnerabilities to compromise the Diaspora instance and potentially access user data.

**Impact:** Potential for complete compromise of the Diaspora instance, data breaches affecting all users on that instance, service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Entire Diaspora application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Proactively maintain and update Diaspora instances to the latest stable version with security patches.
*   Implement automated update mechanisms where feasible.
*   Clearly communicate the importance of staying updated to Diaspora instance administrators.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Diaspora Instance](./threats/misconfigured_diaspora_instance.md)

**Description:**  Insecure default configurations or administrator misconfigurations within Diaspora itself create exploitable weaknesses. This could include leaving default administrative credentials, enabling unnecessary and insecure features, or having overly permissive access controls within the Diaspora application's settings.

**Impact:** Increased attack surface, potential for unauthorized administrative access, data breaches affecting all users on the instance.

**Affected Component:** Configuration files, security settings, administrative interface.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Enforce secure default configurations within the Diaspora codebase.
*   Provide clear and comprehensive documentation on secure configuration practices for Diaspora administrators.
*   Implement security audits and checks within Diaspora to identify and flag insecure configurations.
