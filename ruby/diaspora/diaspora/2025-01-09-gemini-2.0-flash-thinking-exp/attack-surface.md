# Attack Surface Analysis for diaspora/diaspora

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Federated Content Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_federated_content_injection.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Federated Content Injection
    *   **Description:** A malicious actor on a remote Diaspora pod crafts and sends malicious content (posts, comments, profile information) that exploits vulnerabilities in receiving *Diaspora* pods.
    *   **How Diaspora Contributes to the Attack Surface:** *Diaspora's* core functionality relies on federating content between independent pods. This inherent trust and data exchange mechanism creates an avenue for malicious actors on remote pods to inject harmful data that *Diaspora* instances must process.
    *   **Example:** A user on a compromised pod crafts a post containing a specially crafted SVG image that, when rendered by a vulnerable receiving *Diaspora* pod, executes arbitrary JavaScript (XSS) within the *Diaspora* application context.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites within the *Diaspora* application. Potential for denial-of-service if malicious content causes excessive resource consumption on the *Diaspora* pod.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all federated content received by *Diaspora*, including text, media, and metadata.
            *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) within the *Diaspora* application to restrict the sources from which the application can load resources, mitigating XSS.
            *   Employ secure parsing libraries within *Diaspora* for handling different content types (e.g., images, videos).
            *   Regularly update *Diaspora* and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Federation Protocol Exploits](./attack_surfaces/federation_protocol_exploits.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Federation Protocol Exploits
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the underlying federation protocol (e.g., ActivityPub implementation *within Diaspora*) are exploited to manipulate or intercept communication between pods involving *Diaspora*.
    *   **How Diaspora Contributes to the Attack Surface:** *Diaspora's* implementation and use of a specific federation protocol introduces attack vectors inherent to that protocol's design or implementation flaws *within the Diaspora codebase*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw in the signature verification process of the federation protocol *as implemented by Diaspora* to impersonate another pod or user when communicating with a *Diaspora* instance, allowing them to send malicious messages.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data within *Diaspora*, impersonation of users or pods interacting with *Diaspora*, manipulation of federated content displayed by *Diaspora*, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks targeting *Diaspora*'s federation communication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Thoroughly audit and test *Diaspora's* implementation of the federation protocol.
            *   Adhere strictly to the protocol specifications and best practices in the *Diaspora* codebase.
            *   Implement strong cryptographic measures for message signing and encryption within *Diaspora*'s federation handling.
            *   Stay updated with security advisories and patches for the federation protocol implementation used by *Diaspora*.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Handling Federated Media](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_handling_federated_media.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Handling Federated Media
    *   **Description:** Flaws in how *Diaspora* processes and renders media (images, videos, etc.) received from other pods can be exploited.
    *   **How Diaspora Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The *Diaspora* application's need to handle diverse media formats from various sources across the federation introduces complexity and potential vulnerabilities in its media processing libraries.
    *   **Example:** A malicious user on another pod uploads a specially crafted image that, when processed by a vulnerable receiving *Diaspora* pod, triggers a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issue, potentially leading to remote code execution on the *Diaspora* server.
    *   **Impact:** Denial-of-service of the *Diaspora* pod, potential remote code execution on the server running *Diaspora*, information disclosure from the *Diaspora* server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Utilize secure and up-to-date media processing libraries within the *Diaspora* application.
            *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for media files received by *Diaspora*, including format checks and size limits.
            *   Consider sandboxing or isolating media processing within *Diaspora* to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
