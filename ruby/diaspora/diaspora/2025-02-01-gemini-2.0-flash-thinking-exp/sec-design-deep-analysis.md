### 3. Architecture, Components, and Data Flow Inference

Based on the diagrams and descriptions, the Diaspora architecture can be inferred as follows:

* **Decentralized Federation:** Diaspora is designed as a federated social network. Each "Diaspora Pod" is an independent server running the Diaspora software. Pods communicate with each other to exchange social content, forming a distributed network.
* **Web Application Architecture:**  A typical web application architecture is employed:
    * **Frontend (Web Application):**  Javascript, HTML, CSS running in the user's browser, providing the user interface.
    * **Backend (Rails Application):** Ruby on Rails application handling business logic, user requests, data management, and federation.
    * **Database (PostgreSQL):**  Persistent storage for user data, posts, relationships, etc.
    * **Background Job Queue (Redis) & Worker (Sidekiq):** Asynchronous task processing for notifications, federation, and other background operations.
* **Data Flow:**
    1. **User Interaction:** User interacts with the Web Application in their browser.
    2. **HTTPS Requests:** The Web Application sends HTTPS requests to the Web Server (Nginx).
    3. **Reverse Proxy to Rails:** Nginx reverse proxies requests to the Rails Application.
    4. **Rails Application Processing:** The Rails Application handles authentication, authorization, business logic, and interacts with the Database and Redis.
    5. **Database Interaction:** Rails Application queries and updates the PostgreSQL database for persistent data storage.
    6. **Background Jobs:** Rails Application enqueues background jobs in Redis for asynchronous tasks.
    7. **Background Worker Processing:** Background Workers (Sidekiq) consume jobs from Redis and execute them, potentially interacting with the Database, Email Server, or other Diaspora Pods.
    8. **Email Notifications:** Rails Application or Background Workers send email notifications via SMTP to the Email Server.
    9. **Federation:** Rails Application communicates with other Diaspora Pods via HTTP to exchange social content and user data according to the federation protocol.
* **Deployment:** Dockerized deployment is assumed, with containers for the Rails Application, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Background Workers, orchestrated potentially by Docker Compose or a cloud platform.

**Sensitive Data Flow:**

* **User Credentials (Passwords):**  Transmitted over HTTPS, hashed and stored in the Database.
* **User Profile Data:** Transmitted over HTTPS, stored in the Database, exchanged with federated pods over HTTP (federation protocol).
* **User Posts and Content:** Transmitted over HTTPS, stored in the Database, exchanged with federated pods over HTTP (federation protocol).
* **Private Messages:** Transmitted over HTTPS, stored in the Database, exchanged with federated pods over HTTP (federation protocol).  *Note: End-to-end encryption is only considered, not yet implemented according to the review.*
* **Pod Configuration and Secrets:** Stored as environment variables or configuration files within the Rails Application Container and potentially other containers.
