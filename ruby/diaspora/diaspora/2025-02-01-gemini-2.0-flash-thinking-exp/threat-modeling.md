        *   **Pod Administrators:**  Thoroughly review and strictly configure Diaspora's federation settings to minimize the sharing of private data.  Ensure robust TLS encryption is enforced for all pod-to-pod communication.  Implement strict access controls and auditing for any logs related to federation.
        *   **Diaspora Developers:**  Conduct in-depth security reviews of data handling during federation, especially for private and encrypted data.  Implement end-to-end encryption where feasible to minimize exposure during federation.  Minimize the transmission of sensitive metadata.  Provide very clear and prominent configuration options for pod administrators to control the sharing of private data during federation.  Implement automated testing and security checks specifically for data leakage during federation.

## Threat: [Cross-Pod Scripting (XPS) - Persistent and Widespread](./threats/cross-pod_scripting__xps__-_persistent_and_widespread.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers successfully exploit weaknesses in Diaspora's content sanitization or CSP to inject persistent and highly impactful malicious scripts into federated content. These scripts are not easily removed and affect a large number of users across multiple pods, potentially for extended periods.
    *   **Impact:**  Large-scale and persistent Cross-site scripting attacks affecting a significant portion of the Diaspora network, widespread account compromise and data theft, potential for botnet creation using compromised user browsers, significant disruption of user experience and functionality across the network, long-lasting reputational damage and erosion of user trust.
    *   **Diaspora Component Affected:** Content Rendering, User Interface (Web UI), Content Sanitization, Content Security Policy (CSP), Content Storage, Federation Protocol (for content propagation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Pod Administrators:**  Implement and rigorously enforce a highly restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP).  Deploy advanced content sanitization techniques and regularly update sanitization libraries.  Actively monitor for and respond to reports of XPS attacks.  Educate users about the risks of XPS and encourage safe browsing practices.
        *   **Diaspora Developers:**  Completely overhaul content sanitization mechanisms to be extremely robust and resistant to bypasses.
