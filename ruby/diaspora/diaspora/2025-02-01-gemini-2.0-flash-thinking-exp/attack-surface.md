# Attack Surface Analysis for diaspora/diaspora

## Attack Surface: [ActivityPub Federation Message Forgery](./attack_surfaces/activitypub_federation_message_forgery.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Diaspora's ActivityPub protocol implementation to forge federation messages. This allows attackers to send messages that appear to originate from legitimate pods or users within the Diaspora network, enabling impersonation and malicious content injection across federated pods.
*   **Diaspora Contribution:** Diaspora's core functionality relies on ActivityPub for federated communication.  Vulnerabilities in *Diaspora's specific implementation* of ActivityPub, including message signing, verification, and processing logic, directly create this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw in Diaspora's signature verification process for ActivityPub messages. They craft a forged "Create" activity for a post, making it appear to originate from a trusted user on a different Diaspora pod. This forged post, propagated through federation, could contain misinformation, phishing links, or malicious scripts, impacting users across multiple pods.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reputation Damage (Critical):** Spoofing identities of users and pods can severely damage trust within the Diaspora network.
    *   **Widespread Misinformation (High):** Forged posts can propagate false information rapidly across the federated network, impacting a large user base.
    *   **Large-Scale Social Engineering/Phishing (High):** Forged messages can be used to launch widespread phishing campaigns targeting users across multiple Diaspora pods.
    *   **Potential Network Instability (High):**  Large volumes of forged or malicious messages could destabilize the federation network.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Diaspora Core Team & Pod Maintainers):**
        *   **Rigorous ActivityPub Implementation Review (Critical):**  Conduct thorough code reviews specifically focusing on Diaspora's ActivityPub implementation, ensuring strict adherence to the specification and robust security practices for message signing and verification.
        *   **Regular Security Audits of Federation Logic (High):**  Perform regular security audits focusing on the federation logic within Diaspora to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in message handling and routing.
        *   **Implement Robust Input Validation for Federated Messages (High):**  Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all data received via ActivityPub messages to prevent injection attacks.
        *   **Rate Limiting and Anomaly Detection for Federation Traffic (High):** Implement rate limiting on federation requests and anomaly detection mechanisms to identify and mitigate suspicious federation activity, including potential forgery attempts.
        *   **Promote Secure Pod Infrastructure (High):**  Provide clear guidelines and best practices for securing Diaspora pod infrastructure to prevent pod compromise, which could be used to launch federation-based attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown Injection in Diaspora Posts/Comments](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_markdown_injection_in_diaspora_postscomments.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in *Diaspora's* Markdown parsing and rendering process to inject malicious JavaScript code into user-generated content (posts and comments). This code executes in the browsers of other users viewing the content within the Diaspora pod.
*   **Diaspora Contribution:** Diaspora's design choice to use Markdown for user content formatting, combined with *its specific implementation* of Markdown parsing and rendering, introduces this attack surface. If *Diaspora's sanitization or parsing logic* is flawed, XSS vulnerabilities can arise.
*   **Example:** A malicious user crafts a Diaspora post containing specially crafted Markdown that bypasses *Diaspora's* sanitization and includes a `<script>` tag. When another user views this post on the Diaspora pod, the malicious JavaScript code executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies specific to the Diaspora pod, redirecting them to phishing sites disguised as Diaspora, or manipulating their actions within the Diaspora interface.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Account Takeover within Diaspora Pod (Critical):** Stealing session cookies allows attackers to take over user accounts *specifically on the affected Diaspora pod*.
    *   **Data Theft of Diaspora Specific Information (High):** Malicious scripts can steal user data displayed within the Diaspora pod's context, such as private messages or aspect memberships.
    *   **Phishing Attacks Targeting Diaspora Users (High):** Users can be redirected to convincing phishing sites designed to steal Diaspora credentials.
    *   **Defacement of Diaspora Pod Content (High):**  Malicious scripts can manipulate the displayed content within the Diaspora pod, potentially defacing user profiles or posts.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Diaspora Core Team & Pod Maintainers):**
        *   **Employ a Robust and Security-Focused Markdown Parsing Library (Critical):**  Utilize a well-vetted, actively maintained, and security-focused Markdown parsing library known for its XSS prevention capabilities.
        *   **Implement Strict Server-Side Markdown Output Sanitization (Critical):**  Implement robust server-side sanitization of the HTML output generated from Markdown parsing *specifically within Diaspora's rendering pipeline*. This should aggressively remove or neutralize any potentially malicious HTML tags and attributes.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Hardening (High):**  Implement and enforce a strong Content Security Policy *specifically configured for Diaspora* to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, significantly mitigating the impact of XSS vulnerabilities even if they are present.
        *   **Regularly Update Markdown Parsing Library and Frontend Dependencies (High):**  Maintain a rigorous update schedule for the Markdown parsing library and all frontend dependencies used by Diaspora to promptly patch any newly discovered XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious File Uploads Exploiting Diaspora's Media Handling](./attack_surfaces/malicious_file_uploads_exploiting_diaspora's_media_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Uploading malicious files (images, videos, etc.) that exploit vulnerabilities in *Diaspora's* media handling processes or the underlying libraries *Diaspora* uses for media processing. This can lead to server-side vulnerabilities when *Diaspora* processes these files.
*   **Diaspora Contribution:** Diaspora's feature allowing users to upload media files, and *its specific choice and configuration* of media processing libraries (like image resizing or thumbnail generation), creates this attack surface. Vulnerabilities in *how Diaspora integrates and uses* these libraries become relevant.
*   **Example:** A malicious user uploads a specially crafted image file designed to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in the image processing library *Diaspora* uses (e.g., during thumbnail generation). When *Diaspora* processes this image server-side, it triggers the vulnerability, leading to remote code execution and allowing the attacker to gain control of the Diaspora pod server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) on Diaspora Pod Server (Critical):** Exploiting server-side media processing vulnerabilities can lead to RCE, allowing full compromise of the Diaspora pod server and all data it hosts.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Diaspora Pod (High):** Processing malicious media files can consume excessive server resources, leading to denial of service and making the Diaspora pod unavailable to users.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for RCE), High (for DoS)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Diaspora Core Team & Pod Maintainers):**
        *   **Strict File Type Validation and Content Inspection (High):** Implement robust file type validation on the server-side within *Diaspora's upload handling*, going beyond file extensions to inspect file headers and content to ensure they match the declared type and are not malicious.
        *   **Utilize Secure and Regularly Updated Media Processing Libraries (Critical):**  Choose well-vetted, security-focused media processing libraries and maintain a strict update schedule to ensure *Diaspora* uses the latest versions with known vulnerabilities patched.
        *   **Implement Sandboxed Media Processing (Critical):**  Process uploaded media files in a sandboxed environment *specifically within Diaspora's backend* to isolate the processing and limit the impact if a vulnerability is exploited. This prevents a successful exploit from compromising the entire server.
        *   **Minimize Server-Side Media Processing (High):**  Reduce the amount of server-side media processing *performed by Diaspora* to the minimum necessary. If certain features like automatic thumbnail generation are not essential, consider disabling them to reduce the attack surface.
        *   **Resource Limits for Media Processing (High):** Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, time) for media processing tasks *within Diaspora* to prevent denial of service attacks caused by processing maliciously crafted files.
