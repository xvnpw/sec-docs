# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Diaspora project aims to provide a decentralized, privacy-focused social network as an alternative to centralized platforms. It prioritizes user control over data, resisting censorship, and fostering a community-driven environment.

- Business priorities and goals:
  - Provide users with a privacy-respecting social networking platform.
  - Empower users with control over their data and online identity.
  - Foster a decentralized and open social network, resistant to censorship and single points of failure.
  - Build a community-driven and sustainable open-source project.

- Most important business risks:
  - Data breaches and privacy violations could erode user trust and damage the project's reputation.
  - Platform instability or downtime could discourage user adoption and community growth.
  - Security vulnerabilities could be exploited to compromise user accounts or platform integrity.
  - Lack of moderation or ineffective content moderation could lead to a toxic environment and user attrition.
  - Difficulty in achieving widespread adoption and network effects compared to established centralized platforms.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security controls:
  - security control: HTTPS encryption for communication between users and pods (Diaspora servers). Implemented at web server level.
  - security control: Password hashing for user authentication. Implemented in application code.
  - security control: Input validation on user-provided data. Implemented in application code.
  - security control: Protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Implemented in application code using templating engines and output encoding.
  - security control: Protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities. Implemented in application code using CSRF tokens.
  - security control: Regular security updates of underlying operating system and software libraries. Responsibility of pod administrators.
  - security control: Open source code, allowing for community security reviews and contributions. Publicly available on GitHub.

- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability discovery and patching.
  - accepted risk: Security posture varies across different Diaspora pods, depending on administrator practices.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - accepted risk: Limited resources for dedicated security audits and penetration testing.

- Recommended security controls:

  - security control: Establish a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
  - security control: Conduct regular security code reviews, especially for critical components.
  - security control: Implement rate limiting and abuse prevention mechanisms to protect against denial-of-service attacks and spam.
  - security control: Enhance logging and monitoring for security events and intrusion detection.
  - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for pod administrators.

    - requirement: Role-based access control to manage administrative functions within a pod.
    - requirement: Fine-grained authorization to control access to user data and features based on relationships and privacy settings.
    - requirement: Ensure consistent authorization checks across all application components.
  - Input validation:
    - requirement: Validate all user inputs on both client-side and server-side to prevent injection attacks.
    - requirement: Sanitize user-generated content to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    - requirement: Implement robust input validation for API endpoints.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes:
  - User registration and account management.
  - Posting and sharing content.
  - Private messaging and communication.
  - User profile management and privacy settings.
  - Federation with other pods.

- Data to protect and sensitivity:
  - User profiles (personal information, contact details, etc.) - Highly sensitive.
  - User posts and content - Sensitive.
  - Private messages - Highly sensitive.
  - User relationships and social graph - Sensitive.
  - Authentication credentials (password hashes) - Highly sensitive.
  - Pod configuration and secrets - Highly sensitive.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the current process for security vulnerability management and patching in the Diaspora project?
  - Are there any existing security incident response plans or procedures?
  - What is the level of security awareness and training among Diaspora developers and pod administrators?
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements or regulations that Diaspora needs to adhere to (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)?
  - What are the typical resource constraints for security within the open-source project?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a privacy-focused and decentralized social network. User privacy and data security are high priorities.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Basic web application security best practices are implemented. Security is primarily driven by community contributions and open-source principles. Formal security processes might be limited due to resource constraints.
  - DESIGN: The system follows a typical web application architecture with a Rails backend, PostgreSQL database, and Redis for background jobs. Deployment is likely containerized using Docker.
