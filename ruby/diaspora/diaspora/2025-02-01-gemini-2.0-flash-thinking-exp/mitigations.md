# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for diaspora/diaspora

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Pod Federation Policies](./mitigation_strategies/strict_pod_federation_policies.md)

### Description:
1.  **Establish a Review Process:** Create a formal process for reviewing and approving pods for federation. This should involve security and community team members, focusing on the security posture of potential federated pods.
2.  **Define Security Criteria:**  Develop clear security criteria for evaluating pods *specifically for Diaspora federation*. This could include:
    *   Confirmed use of the latest Diaspora version.
    *   Publicly available security policy and contact information for the pod administrator.
    *   Evidence of timely security patching and updates on their pod.
    *   Community reputation and moderation practices within the Diaspora community.
3.  **Initial Pod Selection:** Start with a small, curated list of pods known within the Diaspora community for strong security and responsible administration. Consult Diaspora community forums and security discussions for recommendations.
4.  **Implement a Pod Whitelist:** Configure the Diaspora application to *only* federate with pods explicitly added to a whitelist. This is a crucial Diaspora-specific security control to limit exposure to potentially vulnerable or malicious pods in the wider Diaspora network.
    *   Utilize Diaspora's configuration options (e.g., within `diaspora.yml` or admin panel if available) to enforce a federation whitelist.
    *   Develop an administrative interface or script *within the Diaspora context* to manage this pod whitelist.
5.  **Regular Review and Update:**  Schedule regular reviews (e.g., quarterly) of the pod whitelist, specifically considering the evolving security landscape of the Diaspora federation. Re-evaluate existing pods and consider adding or removing pods based on ongoing security assessments and community reputation *within the Diaspora ecosystem*.
6.  **Communication and Transparency:**  Communicate the pod federation policy to users, explaining *why* a strict policy is in place for their security within the federated Diaspora network.

### Threats Mitigated:
