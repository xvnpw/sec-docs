# Project Design Document: Diaspora Social Network

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Prepared By:** AI Software Architect

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed architectural design of the Diaspora social network project, based on the information available in the provided GitHub repository (https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora). This document aims to clearly outline the system's components, their interactions, and data flows. It will serve as a foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities, enabling the identification of potential security vulnerabilities and the design of appropriate mitigations.

### 1.1. Purpose

The primary purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive and understandable description of the Diaspora architecture, specifically tailored for security analysis. This detailed view will empower security professionals and developers to effectively identify potential security vulnerabilities, understand attack surfaces, and design appropriate security controls.

### 1.2. Scope

This document covers the core architectural components of the Diaspora social network, emphasizing its decentralized nature, key functionalities, and data storage and exchange mechanisms. It focuses on the logical and physical components and their interactions, which are directly relevant for threat modeling and security assessments.

### 1.3. Target Audience

This document is intended for:

*   Security engineers and architects responsible for threat modeling, security assessments, and penetration testing.
*   Software developers working on the Diaspora project, particularly those involved in backend development and federation implementation.
*   System administrators responsible for deploying, configuring, and maintaining Diaspora pod instances.
*   Anyone needing a detailed understanding of the Diaspora architecture from a security perspective.

## 2. System Overview

Diaspora is a decentralized social network platform designed with user privacy and data ownership in mind. Unlike centralized platforms, user data is distributed across independent server instances called "pods." Users choose a pod to register with, and their data primarily resides on that pod, giving them greater control. Federation is the core mechanism that allows users on different pods to seamlessly interact with each other.

### 2.1. Key Concepts

*   **Pods:** Independent, self-contained server instances running the Diaspora software. Each pod operates autonomously, managing its own users, data storage, and security policies.
*   **Aspects:** User-defined groups or circles of contacts, enabling granular control over content visibility and sharing.
*   **Federation:** The standardized process by which different Diaspora pods communicate and exchange information, enabling cross-pod interactions such as following, sharing posts, and commenting. This relies heavily on the ActivityPub protocol.
*   **Activities:** Represent specific actions performed by users within the network. These are the fundamental units of information exchanged during federation, such as creating a post, liking a comment, or following another user.
*   **ActivityPub:** The W3C standard protocol used for decentralized social networking federation in modern Diaspora versions. It defines the format and methods for exchanging activities between actors on different servers.

### 2.2. High-Level Architecture
