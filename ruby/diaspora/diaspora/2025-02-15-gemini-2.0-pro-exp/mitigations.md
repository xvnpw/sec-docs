# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for diaspora/diaspora

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Pod Validation (Incoming)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_pod_validation__incoming_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Pod Validation (Incoming)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Data Reception:** Upon receiving data from another Diaspora pod (post, comment, profile update, etc.).
        2.  **Signature Verification (Federated Context):**
            *   Retrieve the sending pod's public key (cached or fetched from the pod).
            *   Cryptographically verify the data's digital signature against the public key.
            *   *Reject* data with invalid or missing signatures.  This is *critical* for federation.
        3.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) Enforcement (Federated Content):**
            *   Apply a *strict* CSP header to all pages, *especially* those displaying federated content.
            *   Restrict resource loading (scripts, styles, images) to the local pod and *explicitly trusted* domains.  This mitigates XSS from malicious pods.
        4.  **Rate Limiting (Per Pod):**
            *   Track requests *per originating pod*.
            *   Throttle or block pods exceeding a predefined request threshold within a time window.  This is distinct from general rate limiting.
        5.  **Isolation of Federated Data Processing:** Process data from other pods in isolated environments (sandboxed processes, containers with minimal privileges).  This limits the impact of exploits via federated data.
        6.  **Reputation System (Pod-Level):**  Develop a system to track the reputation of *individual pods*.  This could involve community reporting, automated analysis, or cryptographic attestations.  Treat content from low-reputation pods with increased scrutiny.
        7. **Federation Allowlist/Denylist:** Implement the ability to explicitly allow or deny connections with specific pods.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious Code Injection (from Pods) (High Severity):** Prevents malicious pods from injecting harmful scripts via federated content.
        *   **Spam and Phishing (from Pods) (Medium Severity):** Reduces spam/phishing from compromised or malicious pods.
        *   **Data Poisoning (from Pods) (High Severity):** Prevents malicious pods from injecting invalid data.
        *   **Denial of Service (Single Pod) (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting *per pod* mitigates DoS from a single malicious pod.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Malicious Code Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (CSP, signature verification).
        *   **Spam/Phishing:** Risk reduced (rate limiting, reputation).
        *   **Data Poisoning:** Risk significantly reduced (signature verification, validation).
        *   **DoS (Single Pod):** Risk partially mitigated (per-pod rate limiting).

    *   **Currently Implemented (Likely):**
        *   Basic signature verification.

    *   **Missing Implementation (Likely):**
        *   Comprehensive CSP for federated content.
        *   Per-pod rate limiting.
        *   Pod reputation system.
        *   Federated data processing isolation.
        *   Federation allowlist/denylist.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Aspect Logic Auditing and Enforcement (Diaspora-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/aspect_logic_auditing_and_enforcement__diaspora-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Aspect Logic Auditing and Enforcement (Diaspora-Specific)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Code Review (Aspect Logic):** Thoroughly review code handling aspect membership and content visibility.  Look for logic errors that could cause unintended sharing.
        2.  **Default-Private Aspects:** Enforce (or strongly encourage) default-private aspects.  Users should explicitly choose to share more broadly.
        3.  **Clear Aspect UI/UX:** Ensure the UI for managing aspects is clear, intuitive, and makes accidental misconfiguration difficult.
        4.  **Aspect Membership Verification (Double-Check):** Before displaying *any* content, *double-check* the user's aspect membership against the content's visibility, providing redundancy.
        5. **Input Validation (Aspect Names):** Validate aspect names to prevent injection or unexpected behavior.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Leakage (Aspect Misconfiguration) (High Severity):** Prevents accidental exposure of private information due to aspect misconfiguration or logic flaws.
        *   **Privacy Violations (Aspect-Related) (High Severity):** Protects user privacy by ensuring correct aspect enforcement.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Leakage:** Risk significantly reduced (auditing, testing, double-checks).
        *   **Privacy Violations:** Risk significantly reduced (correct aspect enforcement).

    *   **Currently Implemented (Likely):**
        *   Basic aspect logic and filtering.

    *   **Missing Implementation (Likely):**
        *   Comprehensive aspect-focused code auditing.
        *   Enforced default-private aspects.
        *   Redundant aspect membership verification.
        *   Strict input validation on aspect names.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Handling of Serialized Data (Federated Context)](./mitigation_strategies/safe_handling_of_serialized_data__federated_context_.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Safe Handling of Serialized Data (Federated Context)
    * **Description:**
        1. **Identify Deserialization Points (Federated Data):** Find all code locations where serialized data *from other pods* is deserialized.
        2. **Use Safe Deserialization Methods:** Use *only* safe methods (e.g., `YAML.safe_load` in Ruby) for federated data.
        3. **Whitelist Allowed Classes (Strict):** When using `YAML.safe_load`, *strictly* whitelist only the necessary classes for deserialization of federated data.
        4. **Input Validation (Pre-Deserialization, Federated Data):** Before deserializing *any* data from another pod, perform basic validation to check for expected format and malicious content.

    * **Threats Mitigated:**
        * **Object Injection (from Pods) (Critical Severity):** Prevents malicious pods from injecting objects via deserialization, leading to RCE.
        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (from Pods) (Critical Severity):** Directly mitigates RCE by preventing malicious object instantiation from federated data.

    * **Impact:**
        * **Object Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (safe methods, whitelisting).
        * **RCE:** Risk significantly reduced (prevents object injection).

    * **Currently Implemented (Likely):**
        * Some awareness of safe deserialization might exist.

    * **Missing Implementation (Likely):**
        * Consistent use of `YAML.safe_load` with strict whitelisting for *all* federated data deserialization.
        * Pre-deserialization input validation specifically for federated data.
