# Deep Analysis of Diaspora* Attack Tree Path: 1.3.2 - Exploit Trust Relationships Between Pods

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the technical mechanisms by which an attacker could exploit trust relationships between Diaspora* pods.
*   Identify specific vulnerabilities within the Diaspora* codebase and federation protocol that could facilitate this attack.
*   Assess the feasibility and impact of this attack vector in a realistic context.
*   Propose concrete mitigation strategies and security enhancements to reduce the risk.
*   Determine the detection capabilities and how to improve them.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on attack path 1.3.2 ("Exploit trust relationships between pods") within the broader attack tree for the Diaspora* application.  The scope includes:

*   **Diaspora* Federation Protocol:**  The core communication mechanisms between pods, including message formats, authentication, and authorization.  This is the *critical* area.
*   **Diaspora* Codebase (Ruby on Rails):**  Relevant sections of the code responsible for handling incoming and outgoing federated messages, user authentication, and data validation.  We'll focus on areas related to inter-pod communication.
*   **Trust Model:**  The implicit and explicit trust assumptions made between pods in the Diaspora* network.  How is trust established and maintained?
*   **Data Handling:** How sensitive data (user data, private messages, etc.) is handled during inter-pod communication.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** How Diaspora verifies the identity of other pods and enforces access controls on inter-pod requests.

The scope *excludes* attacks that do not directly involve exploiting inter-pod trust.  For example, compromising a pod through a web application vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection) is *out of scope* for this specific analysis, although it's a prerequisite for this attack path.  We're assuming the attacker *already has control* of a pod.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Manual inspection of the Diaspora* source code (available on GitHub) to identify potential vulnerabilities.  We'll use static analysis techniques, focusing on areas related to federation.
*   **Protocol Analysis:**  Detailed examination of the Diaspora* federation protocol documentation and implementation to understand the communication flow and security mechanisms.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Applying threat modeling principles to identify potential attack scenarios and their impact.  We'll use the existing attack tree path as a starting point.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  Searching for existing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) or research papers related to Diaspora* federation or similar federated systems.
*   **Hypothetical Attack Scenario Development:**  Constructing detailed, step-by-step scenarios of how an attacker might exploit trust relationships.
*   **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Based on the identified vulnerabilities and attack scenarios, proposing specific mitigation strategies.
* **Detection Strategy Development:** Based on attack scenarios, proposing specific detection strategies.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.3.2

### 2.1 Understanding the Trust Model

Diaspora*'s federation relies on a decentralized, web-of-trust model.  Each pod operates independently, but they communicate with each other to share posts, comments, and other social data.  The core trust assumption is that *other pods are generally well-behaved*.  There isn't a central authority vouching for the integrity of every pod.

Key aspects of the trust model:

*   **Pod Registration:**  Anyone can run a Diaspora* pod.  There's no vetting process. This is a fundamental weakness.
*   **Federation Protocol (Salmon, ActivityPub, etc.):**  Diaspora* has used different federation protocols over time (Salmon, and now primarily ActivityPub).  These protocols define how pods communicate, but they don't inherently guarantee security.
*   **Implicit Trust:**  When a user on Pod A follows a user on Pod B, Pod A implicitly trusts Pod B to deliver content from that user.  This trust is transitive to some extent.
*   **No Global Reputation System:**  There's no built-in mechanism to track the reputation or trustworthiness of individual pods.  A malicious pod can operate with relative impunity until it's manually blocked by other pods.
* **HTTPS and Public Key Infrastructure:** Pods communicate over HTTPS, which provides encryption and some level of server authentication (verifying the pod's domain name).  However, this doesn't prevent a compromised or malicious pod from sending harmful data.

### 2.2 Potential Vulnerabilities and Attack Scenarios

Given the trust model, several vulnerabilities and attack scenarios are possible:

**Scenario 1: Malicious Data Injection (ActivityPub)**

1.  **Compromise:** Attacker compromises Pod A (e.g., through a web vulnerability or stolen admin credentials).
2.  **Craft Malicious Activity:** The attacker crafts a malicious ActivityPub message (e.g., a "Create" activity for a new post) that contains harmful content.  This could include:
    *   **XSS Payload:**  JavaScript code designed to steal cookies or perform actions on behalf of users on other pods.
    *   **Misleading Content:**  Fake news, phishing links, or other deceptive content.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  An extremely large or complex message designed to overload the receiving pod.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:**  A message designed to trigger the receiving pod to send sensitive data back to the attacker.
3.  **Send to Trusted Pods:**  The attacker uses Pod A's existing connections to send the malicious activity to Pod B, Pod C, etc.  These pods trust Pod A (to varying degrees) because they have users who follow users on Pod A.
4.  **Exploitation:**  Pod B, Pod C, etc., process the malicious activity.  If they don't properly validate the content, the attack succeeds.  For example:
    *   The XSS payload executes in the browsers of users on Pod B.
    *   Users on Pod B are tricked into clicking a phishing link.
    *   Pod B crashes due to resource exhaustion.
    *   Pod B sends sensitive data to the attacker.

**Scenario 2: Impersonation and Spoofing**

1.  **Compromise:** Attacker compromises Pod A.
2.  **Spoof User Identity:** The attacker crafts messages that appear to come from a legitimate user on Pod A, but with a modified `actor` field or other identifying information.  This might involve manipulating the ActivityPub message structure.
3.  **Send Malicious Requests:** The attacker sends these spoofed messages to other pods, requesting actions that the impersonated user wouldn't normally be allowed to perform.  This could include:
    *   Requesting access to private data.
    *   Sending direct messages to users on other pods.
    *   Modifying user profiles or settings.
4.  **Exploitation:**  If the receiving pods don't properly verify the authenticity of the sender, they might grant the attacker unauthorized access or perform actions based on the spoofed identity.

**Scenario 3: Relay Attack**

1.  **Compromise:** Attacker compromises Pod A.
2.  **Intercept Legitimate Traffic:** The attacker intercepts legitimate federated traffic between Pod B and Pod C.
3.  **Modify and Replay:** The attacker modifies the intercepted messages (e.g., changing the content of a post or comment) and then relays them to the intended recipient.
4.  **Exploitation:**  Pod C receives the modified message, believing it came directly from Pod B.  This could lead to the spread of misinformation or other harmful content.

**Scenario 4: Denial of Service via Federation**

1.  **Compromise:** Attacker compromises Pod A.
2.  **Flood Target Pod:** The attacker uses Pod A to send a massive number of legitimate-looking but ultimately useless federated messages to Pod B.
3.  **Resource Exhaustion:** Pod B's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) are overwhelmed by the flood of messages, causing it to become unresponsive or crash.

### 2.3 Code Review Focus Areas (Diaspora* on GitHub)

A code review should prioritize the following areas:

*   **`app/models/federation/*`:**  This directory likely contains the core logic for handling federated communication.  Examine classes and methods related to:
    *   Receiving and parsing incoming ActivityPub messages.
    *   Validating the signatures and authenticity of messages.
    *   Sanitizing and escaping user-provided content.
    *   Sending outgoing ActivityPub messages.
*   **`app/services/federation/*`:** Services related to federation tasks.
*   **`lib/diaspora/federation/*`:** Libraries related to federation.
*   **`config/initializers/federation.rb`:**  Configuration settings related to federation.
*   **Any code that handles `params[:signature]` or `params[:actor]` (or similar parameters) in controllers that handle incoming federated requests.**  These are critical points for authentication and authorization.
*   **Code related to fetching remote objects (e.g., user profiles, posts) from other pods.**  This is where vulnerabilities like Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) could exist.

Specific code patterns to look for:

*   **Missing or Inadequate Input Validation:**  Failure to properly validate and sanitize data received from other pods.
*   **Insufficient Authentication/Authorization:**  Accepting messages from unauthenticated or unauthorized sources.
*   **Trusting Unvalidated Data:**  Using data from other pods without proper verification.
*   **Lack of Rate Limiting:**  Allowing a single pod to send an excessive number of requests.
*   **Hardcoded Secrets or Weak Cryptographic Practices:**  Using weak keys or algorithms for signing or encrypting messages.

### 2.4 Detection Strategies

Detecting this type of attack is extremely challenging because it exploits legitimate communication channels.  However, several strategies can be employed:

*   **Inter-Pod Anomaly Detection:**
    *   **Traffic Analysis:** Monitor the volume and patterns of traffic between pods.  Sudden spikes in traffic from a particular pod could indicate an attack.
    *   **Content Analysis:**  Analyze the content of federated messages for suspicious patterns (e.g., unusual URLs, repeated text, known malicious code).  This requires sophisticated content filtering and potentially machine learning.
    *   **Reputation Monitoring (External):**  Develop or utilize external services that track the reputation of Diaspora* pods.  This could involve community reporting and automated analysis.
*   **Intra-Pod Anomaly Detection:**
    *   **Log Analysis:**  Monitor server logs for unusual activity, such as failed authentication attempts, errors related to federation, or unexpected database queries.
    *   **Process Monitoring:**  Monitor running processes for signs of compromise, such as unexpected network connections or high resource utilization.
    *   **Honeypots:**  Deploy fake user accounts or data that are designed to attract attackers.  Any interaction with these honeypots would be a strong indicator of compromise.
*   **Security Audits:**  Regularly audit the Diaspora* codebase and configuration for vulnerabilities.
*   **Incident Response Plan:**  Have a well-defined plan for responding to suspected or confirmed security incidents.

### 2.5 Mitigation Strategies

Mitigating this attack vector requires a multi-layered approach:

*   **Strengthen Federation Protocol Security:**
    *   **Mandatory Signature Verification:**  Ensure that *all* federated messages are digitally signed and that signatures are *always* verified.  Reject any unsigned or invalidly signed messages.
    *   **Robust Authentication:**  Implement strong authentication mechanisms for inter-pod communication.  This could involve using per-pod API keys or mutual TLS authentication.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Use CSP headers to restrict the types of content that can be loaded in the browser, mitigating XSS attacks.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Rigorously validate and sanitize *all* data received from other pods.  Use a whitelist approach whenever possible, allowing only known-good data.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent a single pod from overwhelming the system with requests.
    *   **Object Capability Model:** Consider adopting an object-capability model for inter-pod communication, where access to resources is granted based on explicit capabilities rather than implicit trust.
*   **Improve Code Security:**
    *   **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular security-focused code reviews.
    *   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Use static analysis tools to automatically identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities.
*   **Enhance Trust Model:**
    *   **Pod Reputation System:**  Develop a mechanism for tracking the reputation of Diaspora* pods.  This could involve community feedback, automated analysis, or a combination of both.
    *   **Federation Blocklists:**  Allow pods to easily share lists of known malicious pods.
    *   **Optional Enhanced Security Modes:**  Provide options for pods to operate in a more secure mode, with stricter federation policies.
*   **Improve Incident Response:**
    *   **Develop a clear incident response plan.**
    *   **Establish communication channels for reporting security issues.**
    *   **Regularly test the incident response plan.**

## 3. Conclusion

Exploiting trust relationships between Diaspora* pods is a high-impact, but also high-effort and high-skill attack.  The decentralized nature of Diaspora* and its reliance on implicit trust between pods create inherent vulnerabilities.  Mitigating this risk requires a combination of protocol-level security enhancements, code-level security improvements, and a more robust trust model.  Continuous monitoring and anomaly detection are crucial for identifying and responding to attacks.  The recommendations in this analysis provide a roadmap for significantly improving the security of the Diaspora* network against this type of attack.
