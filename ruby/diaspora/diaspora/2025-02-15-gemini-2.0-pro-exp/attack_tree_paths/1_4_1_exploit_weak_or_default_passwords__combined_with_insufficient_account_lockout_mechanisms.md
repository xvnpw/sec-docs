# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.4.1 (Exploit Weak/Default Passwords & Insufficient Account Lockout)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly assess the vulnerability of Diaspora* pods to attack path 1.4.1 (Exploitation of weak/default passwords combined with insufficient account lockout).
*   Identify specific weaknesses in Diaspora*'s password policy enforcement, account lockout mechanisms, and related security controls.
*   Propose concrete, actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and enhance the security posture of Diaspora* pods against this attack vector.
*   Provide developers with clear guidance on how to implement the recommendations.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following aspects of the Diaspora* application:

*   **User Authentication:**  The entire process of user login, including password input, validation, and handling of failed attempts.
*   **Password Policies:**  The configuration and enforcement of password complexity requirements (length, character types, etc.).  This includes both default settings and the ability for pod administrators to customize these settings.
*   **Account Lockout Mechanisms:**  The implementation and effectiveness of account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts.  This includes the duration of lockouts, the process for unlocking accounts, and any notification mechanisms.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  The presence and effectiveness of rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.  This is closely related to account lockout, but focuses on slowing down attacks rather than completely blocking them.
*   **Relevant Codebase:**  The specific Ruby on Rails code within the Diaspora* repository (https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora) that handles user authentication, password management, and account lockout.  This includes models, controllers, and any relevant libraries or gems.
*   **Configuration Files:**  Any configuration files (e.g., `diaspora.yml`) that control password policies, account lockout settings, or rate limiting.
*   **Database Interactions:** How user credentials and lockout status are stored and managed in the database.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** How failed login attempts are logged, and what monitoring capabilities exist to detect and respond to brute-force attacks.

This analysis *excludes* the following:

*   Other attack vectors outside of 1.4.1.
*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system or web server.
*   Social engineering attacks.
*   Physical security of the server.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough examination of the relevant Diaspora* source code (Ruby on Rails) to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the implementation of password policies, account lockout, and rate limiting.  This will involve searching for:
    *   Hardcoded default passwords.
    *   Weak or missing password complexity checks.
    *   Inadequate or easily bypassed account lockout logic.
    *   Absence of rate limiting or easily circumvented rate limits.
    *   Insecure storage of passwords or lockout status.
    *   Lack of proper input validation.
    *   Use of outdated or vulnerable libraries/gems.

2.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Review of default configuration files and documentation to understand the default settings for password policies and account lockout.  This will identify if the default configuration is secure or if it leaves pods vulnerable.

3.  **Dynamic Testing (Simulated Attacks):**  Performing controlled, simulated attacks against a test instance of a Diaspora* pod.  This will involve:
    *   Attempting to create accounts with weak passwords.
    *   Attempting to log in with common default passwords.
    *   Performing brute-force attacks using automated tools (e.g., Hydra, Burp Suite Intruder) to test the effectiveness of account lockout and rate limiting.
    *   Varying the attack parameters (e.g., number of attempts, delay between attempts) to assess the robustness of the defenses.

4.  **Documentation Review:**  Examining the official Diaspora* documentation for administrators and users to identify any guidance on password security and account lockout.

5.  **Vulnerability Database Search:**  Checking vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD) for any previously reported vulnerabilities related to password management or account lockout in Diaspora*.

6.  **Best Practice Comparison:**  Comparing Diaspora*'s implementation to industry best practices for password management and account lockout (e.g., OWASP recommendations, NIST guidelines).

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.4.1

### 2.1 Code Review Findings

This section will be populated with specific findings from the code review.  Examples (hypothetical, but illustrative of what to look for):

*   **File:** `app/models/user.rb`
    *   **Finding:**  The `validates :password` method only checks for a minimum length of 6 characters.  It does not enforce any requirements for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or special characters.
    *   **Risk:**  Users can create weak passwords that are easily guessed or cracked.
    *   **Recommendation:**  Modify the `validates :password` method to enforce stronger password complexity requirements.  Use a regular expression to require at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.  Consider using a password strength estimation library (e.g., `zxcvbn`) to provide feedback to users on the strength of their passwords.
    *   **Code Example (Improved):**
        ```ruby
        validates :password, presence: true, length: { minimum: 8 }, format: { with: /(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[!@#$%^&*])/ }
        # Consider adding:  validate :password_strength
        ```

*   **File:** `app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb`
    *   **Finding:**  The `create` action (which handles login attempts) does not implement any account lockout mechanism.  It simply checks the password and redirects the user.
    *   **Risk:**  An attacker can make an unlimited number of login attempts without being blocked.
    *   **Recommendation:**  Implement an account lockout mechanism that locks the user's account after a certain number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts).  Store the number of failed attempts and the lockout status in the database.  Use a gem like `devise-security` or implement a custom solution.
    *   **Code Example (Conceptual):**
        ```ruby
        def create
          user = User.find_by(username: params[:session][:username])
          if user && user.authenticate(params[:session][:password])
            # ... successful login ...
            user.reset_failed_attempts! # Reset counter on success
          else
            user.increment_failed_attempts!
            if user.locked?
              flash[:error] = "Your account is locked. Please try again later."
              # ... redirect ...
            else
              flash[:error] = "Invalid username or password."
              # ... redirect ...
            end
          end
        end
        ```

*   **File:** `config/initializers/devise.rb` (if Devise is used)
    *   **Finding:**  The `config.lock_strategy` is set to `:none`.
    *   **Risk:**  Devise's built-in account lockout functionality is disabled.
    *   **Recommendation:**  Set `config.lock_strategy` to `:failed_attempts` and configure the `config.maximum_attempts` and `config.unlock_in` options appropriately.

*   **File:** `config/diaspora.yml`
    *   **Finding:** There are no configuration options related to password complexity or account lockout.
    *   **Risk:** Pod administrators have no way to customize these settings.
    *   **Recommendation:** Add configuration options to `diaspora.yml` to allow pod administrators to control password complexity requirements, the number of failed login attempts before lockout, the lockout duration, and whether to enable/disable account lockout.

* **File:** `app/models/user.rb`
    *   **Finding:**  The `failed_attempts` column is an integer, but there's no timestamp associated with the failed attempts.
    *   **Risk:**  An attacker could make a few failed attempts, wait a long time, and then make a few more, potentially bypassing the lockout mechanism.
    *   **Recommendation:**  Add a `last_failed_attempt_at` timestamp column to the `users` table.  When checking for lockout, consider both the number of failed attempts *and* the time elapsed since the last failed attempt.  Only lock the account if the failed attempts occurred within a specific time window (e.g., 5 attempts within 15 minutes).

### 2.2 Configuration Analysis Findings

*   **Default Configuration:**  The default Diaspora* configuration (as shipped) does *not* enforce strong password policies or enable account lockout by default.  (This needs to be verified by examining the actual `diaspora.yml` and other relevant configuration files.)
*   **Customization Options:**  Pod administrators have limited or no options to customize password policies and account lockout settings through the web interface or configuration files. (Again, this needs verification.)

### 2.3 Dynamic Testing Results

This section will be populated with the results of the simulated attacks.  Examples:

*   **Test 1: Weak Password Creation:**  Successfully created an account with the password "password".
    *   **Result:**  Vulnerable.
*   **Test 2: Default Password Login:**  Attempted to log in with common default usernames and passwords (e.g., admin/admin, admin/password).
    *   **Result:**  Not vulnerable (assuming no default accounts exist with these credentials).
*   **Test 3: Brute-Force Attack (No Lockout):**  Used Hydra to attempt 100 login attempts with different passwords.  All attempts were processed without any lockout.
    *   **Result:**  Highly vulnerable.
*   **Test 4: Brute-Force Attack (With Lockout - Hypothetical):**  Used Hydra to attempt 10 login attempts.  After 5 attempts, the account was locked, and subsequent attempts returned an "account locked" error.
    *   **Result:**  Mitigated (assuming the lockout implementation is robust).
* **Test 5: Rate Limiting Test:** Used a script to send login requests with varying delays.
    * **Result:** If requests are significantly slowed down or blocked after a certain threshold, rate limiting is effective. If not, it's a vulnerability.

### 2.4 Documentation Review

*   **Administrator Documentation:**  The Diaspora* administrator documentation does *not* provide sufficient guidance on configuring password policies or account lockout. (Verify this.)
*   **User Documentation:**  The user documentation does *not* emphasize the importance of strong passwords or provide any information about account lockout. (Verify this.)

### 2.5 Vulnerability Database Search

*   **CVE/NVD:**  Searched for vulnerabilities related to "Diaspora password" and "Diaspora account lockout".  (Report any relevant CVEs found here.)  Even if no *exact* matches are found, look for similar vulnerabilities in other Ruby on Rails applications, as they might indicate potential weaknesses in Diaspora*.

### 2.6 Best Practice Comparison

*   **OWASP:**  Diaspora*'s current implementation (based on the hypothetical findings above) does *not* fully comply with OWASP recommendations for password storage, password complexity, and account lockout.  Specifically, it falls short on:
    *   **Password Complexity:**  OWASP recommends enforcing strong password complexity rules.
    *   **Account Lockout:**  OWASP recommends implementing account lockout after a small number of failed login attempts.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** OWASP recommends rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
*   **NIST:**  Similar to OWASP, Diaspora*'s implementation likely does not fully meet NIST guidelines for password management and authentication.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on the findings above, the following recommendations are made:

1.  **Enforce Strong Password Policies:**
    *   Modify the `User` model to enforce strong password complexity requirements using regular expressions or a password strength estimation library (e.g., `zxcvbn`).
    *   Require a minimum password length (e.g., 12 characters).
    *   Require a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
    *   Provide feedback to users on the strength of their passwords.
    *   Consider disallowing common passwords (e.g., using a blacklist).

2.  **Implement Robust Account Lockout:**
    *   Implement an account lockout mechanism that locks the user's account after a configurable number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts).
    *   Store the number of failed attempts, the lockout status, and the last failed attempt timestamp in the database.
    *   Use a gem like `devise-security` or build a custom solution.
    *   Configure the lockout duration (e.g., 30 minutes).
    *   Provide a mechanism for users to unlock their accounts (e.g., email verification, security questions).
    *   Consider implementing a "time window" for failed attempts (e.g., 5 attempts within 15 minutes).

3.  **Implement Rate Limiting:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on login attempts to slow down brute-force attacks.
    *   Use a gem like `rack-attack` or build a custom solution.
    *   Configure the rate limit (e.g., 10 attempts per minute per IP address).

4.  **Provide Configuration Options:**
    *   Add configuration options to `diaspora.yml` (or another appropriate configuration file) to allow pod administrators to customize:
        *   Password complexity requirements.
        *   The number of failed login attempts before lockout.
        *   The lockout duration.
        *   Rate limiting settings.
        *   Whether to enable/disable account lockout.

5.  **Improve Documentation:**
    *   Update the administrator documentation to provide clear guidance on configuring password policies and account lockout.
    *   Update the user documentation to emphasize the importance of strong passwords and explain the account lockout mechanism.

6.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the Diaspora* codebase, including penetration testing, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

7.  **Stay Updated:**
    *   Keep the Diaspora* codebase and all dependencies (gems) up to date to ensure that security patches are applied promptly.

8. **Logging and Monitoring:**
    * Ensure failed login attempts are logged with sufficient detail (timestamp, IP address, username).
    * Implement monitoring to detect and alert on unusual login activity, such as a high number of failed login attempts from a single IP address.

## 4. Conclusion

The attack path 1.4.1 represents a significant risk to Diaspora* pods if not properly addressed.  By implementing the recommendations outlined in this analysis, the development team can significantly enhance the security of Diaspora* and protect user accounts from brute-force attacks and unauthorized access.  The combination of strong password policies, robust account lockout, and rate limiting provides a multi-layered defense against this common attack vector.  Regular security audits and updates are crucial to maintaining a strong security posture.
