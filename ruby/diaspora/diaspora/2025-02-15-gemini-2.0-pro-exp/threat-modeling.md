# Threat Model Analysis for diaspora/diaspora

## Threat: [Malicious Pod Injection](./threats/malicious_pod_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Pod Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker registers a new pod on the Diaspora* network with the specific intent of injecting malicious content or exploiting vulnerabilities in other pods. The attacker crafts specially formatted messages, profiles, or other data. When processed by other pods, this data triggers vulnerabilities or causes unintended behavior. This could involve exploiting parsing errors, buffer overflows in federation-related code, or logic flaws in how remote content is handled. The attacker's goal is to compromise other pods, steal data, or disrupt the network.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of other pods, data breaches, spread of malware, denial of service, manipulation of user accounts, censorship.  Widespread impact across the federated network.
    *   **Affected Component:** Federation protocol handling (specifically `Federation::Receiver`, `Federation::Sender`, and related entity processing classes), XML parsing libraries used for federation, and *any* code that processes incoming data from remote pods without sufficient validation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  *Crucially*, implement rigorous input validation and sanitization *at the very point of receiving data from other pods*.  Fuzz testing of all federation endpoints is essential.  Strictly adhere to the federation protocol specification, with robust error handling for *any* malformed data.  Isolate federation processing from core application logic (e.g., using separate processes or containers). Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures across the network.  Consider sandboxing techniques for processing untrusted content.
        *   **Users/Admins:**  Monitor pod activity for any suspicious behavior. Be extremely cautious about interacting with unknown or newly registered pods.

## Threat: [Aspect Manipulation](./threats/aspect_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Aspect Manipulation

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the aspect management logic (the core privacy feature of Diaspora*) to gain unauthorized access to posts or user data.  This could involve manipulating aspect IDs, exploiting race conditions in aspect membership updates, or bypassing access control checks entirely. The attacker might try to add themselves to private aspects or modify existing aspects to include unintended recipients, effectively breaking the intended privacy model.
    *   **Impact:**  Severe privacy violation, unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential for social engineering attacks, and erosion of trust in the platform's core privacy features.
    *   **Affected Component:** Aspect-related models (specifically `Aspect`, `AspectMembership`), controllers handling aspect creation/modification/deletion (e.g., `AspectsController`), and any views or helpers that display aspect-related information. The *authorization checks* within these components are the primary target.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Thoroughly audit the authorization logic for *all* aspect-related actions. Use a robust authorization framework (e.g., Pundit) and ensure that all access control checks are consistently and correctly applied.  Test extensively for race conditions and other concurrency issues that could lead to incorrect aspect memberships. Implement strong input validation to prevent manipulation of aspect IDs or other parameters.
        *   **Users:**  Be mindful of who you add to your aspects. Regularly review your aspect memberships to ensure they are correct.

## Threat: [Federation Protocol Hijacking](./threats/federation_protocol_hijacking.md)

*   **Threat:** Federation Protocol Hijacking

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and modifies federation traffic *between* Diaspora* pods. This could involve a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the network, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the TLS configuration of a pod. The attacker could alter posts, messages, or profile information *in transit*, leading to misinformation, impersonation, or data corruption. This undermines the integrity of the entire federated network.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of data integrity, privacy violations, spread of misinformation, impersonation, potential for denial of service.  Compromises the trust between pods.
    *   **Affected Component:**  TLS configuration of the web server and Diaspora* application. The `Federation::Sender` and `Federation::Receiver` classes (or equivalent) responsible for sending and receiving federated data. Any code that relies on the *authenticity* of federated data is at risk.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  *Enforce* HTTPS for *all* federation traffic. Use strong TLS ciphers and protocols, and keep them updated. Implement certificate pinning (if feasible and carefully managed) to prevent MITM attacks. Validate the certificates of remote pods rigorously. Regularly update TLS libraries to address any newly discovered vulnerabilities.
        *   **Admins:** Ensure proper and secure TLS configuration on the server. Use a trusted certificate authority. Actively monitor for TLS vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerable Diaspora*-Specific Gem](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerable_diaspora-specific_gem.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerable Diaspora*-Specific Gem

    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies a vulnerability in a Ruby gem that is *specifically* used by Diaspora* (not a general-purpose gem like Rails, but one that is more niche or unique to the Diaspora* project).  They craft an exploit that leverages this vulnerability.  This could be delivered through a malicious pod (via federation) or by directly targeting a vulnerable pod if the attacker can identify it.
    *   **Impact:** Varies greatly depending on the specific vulnerability in the gem, but could range from information disclosure to *remote code execution* (RCE), giving the attacker complete control over the pod.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable gem and any Diaspora* code that interacts with it.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the gem and the nature of the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Actively monitor security advisories for *all* dependencies, *especially* less common or Diaspora*-specific ones. Use automated dependency vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., Bundler-Audit, Dependabot) and configure them to be highly sensitive. Be extremely cautious when adding new dependencies; thoroughly vet their security posture and maintenance history. Consider forking critical, niche gems to maintain direct control over security updates and patches. Contribute security patches upstream to the gem's maintainers.
        *   **Admins:** Regularly update the Diaspora* installation, including *all* gems, to their latest secure versions.  This is a critical ongoing maintenance task.
