## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise User Account (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_user_account__high_risk_.md)

This is a high-risk area because successful account compromise grants the attacker direct access to user data and potentially the ability to impersonate the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Leverage insufficient email verification (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_leverage_insufficient_email_verification__high_risk_.md)

**Description:**  Attackers exploit weaknesses in the email verification process during account recovery. This could involve spoofing emails to appear as if they are from the Diaspora* pod, intercepting password reset emails, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the email server itself.  If the pod doesn't properly verify the ownership of the email address before sending a reset link, an attacker can take over an account.
**Likelihood:** High (Email spoofing and phishing are common)
**Impact:** High (Complete account takeover)
**Effort:** Low (Tools and techniques are readily available)
**Skill Level:** Intermediate
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring email logs and user activity)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 Session Hijacking (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_session_hijacking__high_risk_.md)

**Description:** Attackers steal a user's valid session cookie, allowing them to impersonate the user without needing their credentials.  This can occur if cookies lack the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags, are transmitted over unencrypted connections (HTTP), or are predictable.  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities can also be used to steal cookies.
**Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on configuration and presence of XSS vulnerabilities)
**Impact:** High (Complete account takeover)
**Effort:** Low (If vulnerabilities exist, exploitation is straightforward)
**Skill Level:** Intermediate
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring network traffic and user activity)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Federation-Related Account Takeover (CRITICAL) (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_federation-related_account_takeover__critical___high_risk_.md)

This is *critical* because it leverages the core functionality of Diaspora*.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Spoof a user from another pod (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_spoof_a_user_from_another_pod__high_risk_.md)

**Description:**  If the digital signature verification of messages from other pods is flawed or missing, an attacker can forge messages that appear to come from a legitimate user on a different pod.  This allows the attacker to impersonate that user and potentially gain access to their data or interact with other users on their behalf.
**Likelihood:** Medium (Requires finding a flaw in signature verification)
**Impact:** Very High (Cross-pod impersonation, potential for widespread damage)
**Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of the federation protocol and cryptography)
**Skill Level:** Advanced
**Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires robust signature validation and anomaly detection)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2 Exploit trust relationships between pods (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_exploit_trust_relationships_between_pods__high_risk_.md)

**Description:** If one pod is compromised, an attacker could use that pod's trusted status to send malicious messages or requests to other pods.  This could lead to a cascading compromise across the network.  This relies on a "trust chain" vulnerability.
**Likelihood:** Low (Requires compromising a federated pod first)
**Impact:** Very High (Potential for widespread compromise across the network)
**Effort:** High (Requires significant resources and coordination)
**Skill Level:** Expert
**Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (Requires inter-pod monitoring and anomaly detection)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4 Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_brute-forcecredential_stuffing__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.4.1 Exploit weak or default passwords, combined with insufficient account lockout mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_1_exploit_weak_or_default_passwords__combined_with_insufficient_account_lockout_mechanisms.md)

**Description:** Attackers use automated tools to try common passwords or credentials obtained from data breaches against user accounts. If the pod doesn't have strong password policies or effective account lockout mechanisms, this attack can be successful.
**Likelihood:** High (Common attack vector)
**Impact:** Medium (Individual account compromise)
**Effort:** Low (Automated tools are readily available)
**Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
**Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Failed login attempts can be logged and monitored)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Diaspora*-Specific Code Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_diaspora-specific_code_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This is *critical* because it targets the unique aspects of the Diaspora* software.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Federation Protocol Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL) (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_federation_protocol_vulnerabilities__critical___high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2 Injection attacks in federation messages (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_injection_attacks_in_federation_messages__high_risk_.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious code or data into messages exchanged between pods.  If the receiving pod doesn't properly sanitize this data, it could lead to code execution, data corruption, or other vulnerabilities.  This is similar to SQL injection or XSS, but within the context of the federation protocol.
**Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the robustness of input validation)
**Impact:** High (Potential for code execution and data compromise)
**Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of the federation protocol and message formats)
**Skill Level:** Intermediate
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires careful inspection of federated messages)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.3 Denial-of-Service attacks targeting the federation protocol (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_3_denial-of-service_attacks_targeting_the_federation_protocol__high_risk_.md)

**Description:** Attackers send a flood of specially crafted messages designed to overwhelm the pod's federation processing capabilities.  This could involve sending excessively large messages, messages with invalid formats, or exploiting specific vulnerabilities in the protocol implementation.
**Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the robustness of the federation implementation)
**Impact:** Medium (Service disruption)
**Effort:** Low (Can be automated)
**Skill Level:** Intermediate
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring network traffic and resource usage)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.4 Privacy leaks in federation (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_4_privacy_leaks_in_federation__high_risk_.md)

**Description:**  The federation protocol might unintentionally expose private user data to other pods.  This could be due to bugs in the code, misconfigurations, or design flaws in the protocol itself.  For example, a pod might inadvertently share information about a user's private posts or contacts with other pods.
**Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the complexity of the federation protocol and implementation)
**Impact:** High (Loss of user privacy)
**Effort:** Medium (Requires analyzing the federation protocol and code)
**Skill Level:** Intermediate
**Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires careful analysis of data flows)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.2 Image/File Upload Vulnerabilities (RCE or XSS) (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_2_imagefile_upload_vulnerabilities__rce_or_xss___high_risk_.md)

**Description:** If Diaspora* allows users to upload images or other files, and it doesn't properly sanitize these files, attackers could upload malicious files that exploit vulnerabilities in the server's image processing libraries or web server. This could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
**Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the security of file upload handling)
**Impact:** High (Potential for RCE or XSS)
**Effort:** Medium (Requires finding and exploiting a vulnerability)
**Skill Level:** Intermediate
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires file analysis and web application security testing)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3 API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_api_vulnerabilities.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1 Insufficient authentication/authorization for API endpoints (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1_insufficient_authenticationauthorization_for_api_endpoints__high_risk_.md)

**Description:** If Diaspora*'s API endpoints are not properly protected, attackers could access or modify data without proper credentials. This could allow them to read private messages, create posts, or even delete user accounts.
**Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the API design and implementation)
**Impact:** High (Data breach and potential for account takeover)
**Effort:** Low (If authentication is weak, exploitation is easy)
**Skill Level:** Intermediate
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires API testing and monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/3__denial_of_service__dos_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Federation-Based DoS (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_federation-based_dos__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.2 Send malformed federation messages designed to crash the receiving pod. (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_2_send_malformed_federation_messages_designed_to_crash_the_receiving_pod___high_risk_.md)

**Description:**  Similar to 2.1.3, but specifically targeting vulnerabilities that cause the receiving pod to crash or become unresponsive, rather than just consuming resources. This might involve exploiting buffer overflows or other memory corruption vulnerabilities.
**Likelihood:** Low (Requires finding a specific vulnerability)
**Impact:** High (Service outage)
**Effort:** Medium (Requires vulnerability research and exploit development)
**Skill Level:** Advanced
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Crashes are usually logged, but root cause analysis can be difficult)

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Server-Side Configuration Issues (Specific to Diaspora*) (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_server-side_configuration_issues__specific_to_diaspora___critical_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [4.1 Misconfigured Federation Settings (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_misconfigured_federation_settings__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.2 Incorrectly configured TLS settings for federation. (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_2_incorrectly_configured_tls_settings_for_federation___high_risk_.md)

**Description:**  Using weak ciphers, expired certificates, or disabling certificate validation during federation communication can allow attackers to perform Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, intercepting and potentially modifying data exchanged between pods.
**Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration)
**Impact:** High (Data interception and modification)
**Effort:** Very Low (Requires basic network sniffing tools)
**Skill Level:** Beginner
**Detection Difficulty:** Easy (TLS configuration can be easily checked)

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2 Weak Database Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/4_2_weak_database_configuration.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [4.2.1 Using default database credentials. (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/4_2_1_using_default_database_credentials___high_risk_.md)

**Description:** If the Diaspora* installation uses default database credentials (e.g., "root" with no password), attackers can easily gain access to the database and all its data.
**Likelihood:** Low (Should be caught during initial setup, but still happens)
**Impact:** Very High (Complete data compromise)
**Effort:** Very Low (Trivial to exploit)
**Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
**Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Credentials can be easily checked)
