# Attack Surface Analysis for diaspora/diaspora

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Pod Interaction](./attack_surfaces/malicious_pod_interaction.md)

*   **Description:**  A compromised or intentionally malicious Diaspora* pod can send harmful data or exploit vulnerabilities in other connected pods. This is the core risk of the federated model.
*   **Diaspora Contribution:** Diaspora*'s federated architecture, where independent pods communicate and share data, creates this inherent risk. Trust is distributed, not centralized. This is *the* defining characteristic that introduces this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A malicious pod sends a crafted post containing a cross-site scripting (XSS) payload designed to steal session cookies from users on a target pod. Another example: a malicious pod floods a target pod with connection requests, causing a denial of service. A third example: a malicious pod sends specially-crafted ActivityPub messages designed to exploit a parsing bug in the receiving pod's federation code.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of user accounts, data breaches, denial of service, spread of malware, misinformation campaigns, complete pod compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for *all* data received from *any* external pod, treating it as untrusted. This includes posts, comments, profile data, and federation protocol messages.  This is *the* primary defense.
        *   Enforce strict adherence to the federation protocol specifications (ActivityPub, Salmon, etc.) and validate protocol messages *extensively*.
        *   Implement robust rate limiting and connection throttling to prevent DoS attacks from other pods.
        *   Develop and maintain a system for reporting, flagging, and potentially blocking malicious pods (both automated and community-driven). This is a crucial community-based defense.
        *   Regularly audit the federation-related code for vulnerabilities, including fuzzing and penetration testing. This code is unique to Diaspora*'s federated nature.
        *   Consider using sandboxing or containerization to isolate the processing of data from external pods, limiting the impact of a successful exploit.
        *   Implement cryptographic signatures for data integrity verification to detect tampering during transit between pods.
    *   **Users/Pod Admins:**
        *   Be *extremely* cautious about connecting to unknown or untrusted pods. Research a pod's reputation before connecting. This is the user's primary defense.
        *   Monitor pod activity for suspicious behavior.
        *   Report any suspected malicious pods to the Diaspora* community or relevant authorities.
        *   Keep your Diaspora* installation updated to the latest version to receive security patches.

## Attack Surface: [API Endpoint Vulnerabilities (Federation-Specific)](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoint_vulnerabilities__federation-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Diaspora*'s API endpoints *specifically those used for inter-pod communication* can allow malicious pods to bypass authentication, inject malicious data, or cause denial of service.
*   **Diaspora Contribution:**  Diaspora*'s federated architecture *requires* API endpoints for pods to communicate.  The complexity and security of these *federation-specific* endpoints are unique to Diaspora*.
*   **Example:** An attacker (operating a malicious pod) discovers an API endpoint used for exchanging user profile information that lacks proper authentication, allowing them to retrieve private user data from another pod. Another example: a vulnerability in an ActivityPub-related API endpoint allows a malicious pod to inject forged messages into another pod's data stream.
*   **Impact:**  Data breaches, unauthorized access to user accounts on other pods, denial of service against other pods, manipulation of data across the network, complete compromise of connected pods.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for *all* federation-related API endpoints, using industry-standard protocols and ensuring that pod identities are cryptographically verified.
        *   Perform rigorous input validation and sanitization on all API parameters received from other pods, treating all input as untrusted.
        *   Implement rate limiting and throttling specifically for inter-pod API requests to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.
        *   Regularly audit the federation API code and documentation for security vulnerabilities. This is a critical area for focused security reviews.
        *   Implement robust error handling to prevent information leakage through error messages sent to other pods.
        *   Follow secure coding practices for API development, paying special attention to the OWASP API Security Top 10, and adapting them to the federated context.
