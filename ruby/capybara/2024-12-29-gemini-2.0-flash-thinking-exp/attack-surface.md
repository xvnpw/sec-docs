Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Capybara, with high and critical risk severity:

*   **Malicious JavaScript Injection via `execute_script`**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that Capybara executes within the browser context if the script content is derived from untrusted sources.
    *   **How Capybara Contributes:** The `execute_script` method allows executing arbitrary JavaScript within the browser context. If the script content is not carefully controlled, it becomes an injection point.
    *   **Example:** A test uses `execute_script("window.location = '" + user_input + "'")`. If `user_input` is attacker-controlled, they can redirect the page or execute other malicious scripts.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the test environment, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or further exploitation if the test environment is not isolated.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `execute_script` with dynamically generated content based on external input.
        *   If dynamic JavaScript execution is necessary, carefully sanitize and validate the input.
        *   Consider alternative Capybara methods that don't involve raw JavaScript execution.

*   **Malicious File Uploads via `attach_file`**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can upload malicious files to the application under test if the file paths or content used with `attach_file` are influenced by external sources.
    *   **How Capybara Contributes:** The `attach_file` method simulates file uploads. If the file path or content is not controlled, it can be used to upload arbitrary files.
    *   **Example:** A test uses `attach_file('document', params[:file_path])`. If `params[:file_path]` is attacker-controlled, they can upload any file to the application.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of file upload vulnerabilities in the application, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure file paths used with `attach_file` are static or generated securely within the test suite.
        *   Avoid using external input to determine file paths for uploads in tests.
        *   Focus on testing the application's file upload validation and security mechanisms directly, rather than relying on dynamic file paths in Capybara.
