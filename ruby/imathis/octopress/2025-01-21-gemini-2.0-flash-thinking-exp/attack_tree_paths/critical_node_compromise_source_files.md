## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Source Files

**Critical Node:** Compromise Source Files

**Why it's Critical:** Access to the source files (themes, plugins, Markdown content) provides attackers with numerous opportunities to inject malicious content. They can modify themes to inject site-wide scripts, add malicious plugins, or directly embed harmful code into content files. Compromising this node opens up multiple attack vectors with significant impact.

**Expanding on the Criticality and Potential Impacts:**

Gaining access to the source files is a highly critical compromise because it grants the attacker a significant level of control over the website's functionality and content. The impact can be categorized as follows:

* **Malicious Script Injection (Themes):**
    * **Impact:** By modifying theme files (e.g., header, footer, layout templates), attackers can inject malicious JavaScript that executes on every page load for all visitors. This allows for:
        * **Credential Harvesting:** Stealing user credentials through fake login forms or keyloggers.
        * **Redirection to Malicious Sites:**  Redirecting visitors to phishing sites or malware distribution platforms.
        * **Drive-by Downloads:**  Silently installing malware on visitor machines.
        * **Cryptojacking:**  Using visitor's CPU power to mine cryptocurrency.
        * **Defacement:**  Altering the visual appearance of the website.
    * **Severity:** High. This is a highly effective way to compromise a large number of users.

* **Malicious Plugin Installation/Modification:**
    * **Impact:** If the attacker can add or modify plugin files, they can introduce arbitrary code execution capabilities within the Octopress environment. This allows for:
        * **Backdoors:**  Creating persistent access points for future attacks.
        * **Data Exfiltration:**  Stealing sensitive data stored within the application or accessible through it.
        * **Server-Side Exploitation:**  Potentially gaining control of the underlying server.
        * **Spam Injection:**  Using the website to send out spam emails.
    * **Severity:** Very High. This grants significant control over the application and potentially the server.

* **Malicious Content Injection (Markdown Files):**
    * **Impact:** Directly modifying Markdown content files allows attackers to:
        * **Spread Misinformation:**  Altering factual content to spread false information or propaganda.
        * **SEO Poisoning:**  Injecting hidden links or content to manipulate search engine rankings for malicious purposes.
        * **Phishing Links:**  Embedding links to phishing sites within seemingly legitimate content.
        * **Subtle Malware Distribution:**  Embedding links to exploit kits or drive-by download sites within the content.
    * **Severity:** Medium to High. While less impactful than site-wide script injection, it can still damage reputation and compromise individual users.

* **Configuration File Manipulation (`_config.yml`):**
    * **Impact:** Modifying the configuration file can lead to:
        * **Altered Site Behavior:**  Changing the website's functionality or appearance.
        * **Exposure of Sensitive Information:**  If sensitive credentials or API keys are stored in the configuration (though this is bad practice).
        * **Disruption of Service:**  Introducing incorrect settings that break the website.
    * **Severity:** Medium. The impact depends on the specific configurations modified.

**Potential Attack Vectors for Compromising Source Files:**

To achieve the "Compromise Source Files" objective, an attacker could employ various methods:

* **Compromised Credentials:**
    * **Description:** Obtaining valid login credentials for the server or hosting platform where the Octopress files are stored (e.g., SSH, FTP, control panel).
    * **Likelihood:** Moderate to High, depending on password security practices and the presence of multi-factor authentication.
    * **Mitigation:** Strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, regular password audits, limiting access privileges.

* **Vulnerabilities in Octopress or its Dependencies:**
    * **Description:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in Octopress itself, its themes, or installed plugins. This could allow for remote code execution or file manipulation.
    * **Likelihood:** Moderate. Octopress is a relatively mature project, but vulnerabilities can still be discovered. Themes and plugins are often less rigorously audited.
    * **Mitigation:** Regularly updating Octopress, themes, and plugins; using security scanners to identify vulnerabilities; subscribing to security advisories.

* **Insecure Hosting Environment:**
    * **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the hosting environment, such as insecure server configurations, outdated software, or weak security measures.

    * **Mitigation:** Choosing reputable hosting providers with strong security measures; regularly patching server software; configuring firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

* **Supply Chain Attacks:**
    * **Description:** Compromising a dependency used by Octopress, a theme, or a plugin, leading to the introduction of malicious code into the source files.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Moderate, but increasing in prevalence.
    * **Mitigation:** Using dependency management tools with security scanning capabilities; verifying the integrity of downloaded dependencies; being cautious about using untrusted or unmaintained themes and plugins.

* **Direct Access through Web Server Misconfiguration:**
    * **Description:**  Misconfigured web server settings that allow direct access to sensitive files or directories containing the source code.
    * **Likelihood:** Low, but possible with improper configuration.
    * **Mitigation:**  Properly configuring the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to restrict access to sensitive directories; disabling directory listing.

* **Social Engineering:**
    * **Description:** Tricking developers or administrators into revealing credentials or directly uploading malicious files.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Moderate, depending on the awareness and training of personnel.
    * **Mitigation:** Security awareness training for developers and administrators; implementing strict file upload policies; using secure communication channels.

**Mitigation Strategies for "Compromise Source Files":**

To effectively mitigate the risk of source file compromise, the following strategies should be implemented:
