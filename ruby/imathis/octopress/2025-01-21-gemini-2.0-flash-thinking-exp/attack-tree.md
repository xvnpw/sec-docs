## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Gem Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_gem_vulnerabilities.md)

- Likelihood: Medium
- Impact: Critical (Full control of build process)
- Effort: Medium
- Skill Level: Intermediate
- Detection Difficulty: Difficult
- Attack Steps:
    - Introduce Malicious Gem Dependency: An attacker identifies a vulnerability in a Ruby Gem used by Octopress. They then introduce a malicious Gem dependency, either by convincing a developer to add it to the Gemfile or by compromising the dependency resolution process.
- Why it's High-Risk: Gem vulnerabilities are relatively common, and successfully introducing a malicious dependency allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code during the build process, potentially compromising the entire website.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Manipulate Build Scripts](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_build_scripts.md)

- Likelihood: Medium
- Impact: Critical (Modify generated output, compromise server)
- Effort: Low (If access is gained)
- Skill Level: Beginner/Intermediate
- Detection Difficulty: Medium
- Attack Steps:
    - Modify Rakefile or other build scripts: An attacker gains access to the source code repository or the build environment.
    - Inject Malicious Commands: They modify the `Rakefile` or other build scripts to inject malicious commands that will be executed during the build process.
- Why it's High-Risk: Gaining access to the repository or build environment is a realistic threat, and modifying build scripts provides a direct way to manipulate the generated website content or compromise the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Content via Theme](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_malicious_content_via_theme.md)

- Likelihood: Medium
- Impact: Significant (Inject malicious code into all generated pages)
- Effort: Low
- Skill Level: Beginner/Intermediate
- Detection Difficulty: Medium
- Attack Steps:
    - Use a Malicious Theme: An attacker creates or compromises an Octopress theme.
    - Introduce Backdoors or Malicious Scripts: The malicious theme contains backdoors or malicious scripts. A developer, unaware of the threat, uses this theme for the Octopress site.
- Why it's High-Risk: Developers might inadvertently use themes from untrusted sources, and a malicious theme can inject code into every page of the generated website, leading to widespread compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Build Process Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_build_process_vulnerabilities.md)

- Why it's Critical: If an attacker successfully exploits vulnerabilities in the build process, they can gain control over the entire website generation process. This allows them to inject malicious content into every page, install backdoors, or compromise the server used for building the site. Success at this node has a widespread and severe impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Ruby Environment](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_ruby_environment.md)

- Why it's Critical: The Ruby environment is fundamental to the Octopress build process. Compromising it allows attackers to introduce malicious dependencies (via Gem exploits) or exploit vulnerabilities in the Ruby interpreter itself, both leading to arbitrary code execution during the build. This node is a gateway to several high-impact attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Source Files](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_source_files.md)

- Why it's Critical: Access to the source files (themes, plugins, Markdown content) provides attackers with numerous opportunities to inject malicious content. They can modify themes to inject site-wide scripts, add malicious plugins, or directly embed harmful code into content files. Compromising this node opens up multiple attack vectors with significant impact.
