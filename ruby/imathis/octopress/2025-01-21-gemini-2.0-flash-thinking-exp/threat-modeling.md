# Threat Model Analysis for imathis/octopress

## Threat: [Code Injection via Malicious Liquid Tags/Filters](./threats/code_injection_via_malicious_liquid_tagsfilters.md)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to the Octopress configuration files (`_config.yml`) or content files (Markdown, HTML) could inject malicious Liquid tags or filters. During the site generation process (`rake generate`), the Liquid templating engine *within Octopress* would execute this code, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the build server.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the build server, including data exfiltration, modification of the generated website, or using the server for further attacks.

**Affected Octopress Component:** Liquid Templating Engine (core component of Octopress).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Strictly control access to the build environment and the ability to modify configuration and content files.
*   Regularly review configuration and content files for unexpected or suspicious Liquid code.
*   Consider using a sandboxed or isolated environment for the build process.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Ruby Gem Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_ruby_gem_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Octopress relies on various Ruby gems for its core functionality. Attackers could exploit known vulnerabilities in these gems *during the Octopress build process*. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the build server or introduce vulnerabilities into the generated static site (e.g., through compromised libraries used by Octopress itself).

**Impact:** Compromise of the build server, introduction of malicious code into the generated website, or denial of service during the build process.

**Affected Octopress Component:** Gem Dependencies (managed by Bundler, a dependency of Octopress).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Regularly update Octopress and all its gem dependencies using `bundle update`.
*   Use tools like `bundler-audit` to scan for known vulnerabilities in your gem dependencies.
*   Pin gem versions in your `Gemfile.lock` to ensure consistent and tested dependencies.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** Developers might inadvertently store sensitive information (API keys, database credentials, internal paths) directly in core Octopress configuration files (`_config.yml`). If these files are not properly secured or are accidentally exposed (e.g., through a misconfigured web server serving the source code), attackers could gain access to this sensitive data.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to internal systems, data breaches, or the ability to impersonate the website owner.

**Affected Octopress Component:** Configuration Files (`_config.yml`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files.
*   Use environment variables or secure secrets management tools to handle sensitive data.
*   Ensure the web server is configured to prevent access to Octopress source files and configuration files.
