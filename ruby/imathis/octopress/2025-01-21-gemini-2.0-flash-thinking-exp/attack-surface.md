# Attack Surface Analysis for imathis/octopress

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Ruby Gem Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_ruby_gem_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Octopress relies on various Ruby Gems for its functionality. Vulnerabilities in these gems (direct or transitive dependencies) can be exploited.
    *   **How Octopress Contributes:** Octopress's architecture necessitates the use of Ruby Gems defined in its `Gemfile`. These gems are executed during the site generation process, making vulnerabilities exploitable in this context.
    *   **Example:** A known remote code execution vulnerability in a specific version of the `jekyll` gem (which Octopress uses) could be triggered by a maliciously crafted input file processed during site generation.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the build server, potentially leading to data breaches, defacement of the generated website, or further compromise of the development environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Ruby Gems using `bundle update`.
        *   Utilize `Gemfile.lock` to ensure consistent gem versions across environments.
        *   Employ tools like `bundler-audit` or `ruby-advisory-check` to identify and remediate known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Ruby Gems used by Octopress.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Octopress Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_octopress_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Octopress allows the use of plugins to extend its functionality. Malicious or poorly written plugins can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Octopress Contributes:** Octopress's plugin architecture allows for the execution of arbitrary Ruby code during the site generation process. This provides a vector for malicious code injection.
    *   **Example:** A plugin with a vulnerability allowing arbitrary file read could be exploited to access sensitive configuration files or source code during the build process. A plugin with a remote code execution vulnerability could compromise the build server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the build server, data breaches, or defacement of the generated website.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only use plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
        *   Review the source code of plugins before installation.
        *   Keep plugins updated to their latest versions.
        *   Consider the principle of least privilege for plugin permissions if applicable.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Input Files during Site Generation](./attack_surfaces/malicious_input_files_during_site_generation.md)

*   **Description:**  Maliciously crafted Markdown files or other input files processed by Octopress could exploit vulnerabilities in the parsing or rendering engines.
    *   **How Octopress Contributes:** Octopress's core function is to process input files (primarily Markdown) and convert them into static HTML. This process involves parsing and rendering, which can be vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted Markdown file could exploit a vulnerability in the Markdown parser (e.g., `rdiscount`) leading to arbitrary code execution during the build process.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the build server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize or validate any user-provided content that is used as input for the site generation process.
        *   Keep the Markdown parser and other processing libraries updated.
        *   Limit the ability of untrusted users to contribute content directly to the Octopress site.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deployment Scripts](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deployment_scripts.md)

*   **Description:** Octopress provides built-in deployment scripts. If these scripts are not secure, they can be exploited.
    *   **How Octopress Contributes:** Octopress offers scripts to automate the deployment process, and vulnerabilities in these scripts can directly compromise the deployment target.
    *   **Example:** A deployment script that hardcodes credentials or uses insecure protocols (like FTP) could be intercepted or exploited. A script vulnerable to command injection could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the deployment server.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the deployment server, potentially leading to website defacement, data breaches, or further access to the hosting environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding credentials in deployment scripts. Use secure methods for managing deployment credentials (e.g., environment variables, SSH keys).
        *   Use secure protocols for deployment (e.g., SSH, rsync over SSH).
        *   Review and audit deployment scripts for potential vulnerabilities like command injection.
        *   Implement proper access controls on the deployment server.
