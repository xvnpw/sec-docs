# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for imathis/octopress

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Dependency Auditing and Updates (Gems)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_dependency_auditing_and_updates__gems_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Setup:** Install `bundler-audit` gem: `gem install bundler-audit`.
2.  **Audit:** Run `bundle audit check --update` in the Octopress project directory. This checks `Gemfile.lock` against vulnerability databases.
3.  **Update:** If vulnerabilities are found, review and run `bundle update <gem_name>` (specific gem) or `bundle update` (all gems), followed by thorough testing of the Octopress site.
4. **Gemfile Specificity:** Use precise version constraints in your `Gemfile` (e.g., `gem 'somegem', '~> 1.2.3'`) to control which gem versions are installed. Avoid overly broad constraints.
5. **Gem Source Verification:** Ensure your `Gemfile` sources point to trusted repositories (primarily `https://rubygems.org`).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Gems (Severity: Critical):** Vulnerable gems could allow code execution during Octopress build/deployment.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Gems (Severity: High):** Vulnerable gems generating HTML could introduce XSS.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) in Gems (Severity: Medium):** Vulnerable gems could cause Octopress to crash during build.
*   **Information Disclosure in Gems (Severity: Medium):** Gems might leak sensitive information used during the build process.

**Impact:**
*   **RCE:** Risk significantly reduced (Critical to Low/Negligible).
*   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Negligible).
*   **DoS:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `bundle audit` is run manually after gem changes.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   More frequent and automated `bundle audit` checks.
*   Stricter adherence to specific gem versions in `Gemfile`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize and Audit Octopress Plugins](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_and_audit_octopress_plugins.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review:** Examine the `_plugins` directory and `Gemfile` for all Octopress plugins.
2.  **Justification:** Document the purpose of each plugin and remove any that are not strictly necessary.
3.  **Auditing:** Apply the same `bundler-audit` and update procedures (as with core gems) to all plugins.
4.  **Source Review:** For *critical* plugins, manually review the Ruby source code (if available) for potential security issues.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Same threats as core gems (RCE, XSS, DoS, Information Disclosure), but originating from plugins (Severity: Varies, potentially Critical to Medium).**

**Impact:**
*   Reduces the attack surface. Impact depends on the number and criticality of plugins removed/updated. Moderate to high risk reduction.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   A list of used plugins exists, but no formal justification or audit.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Formal justification for each plugin.
*   Regular auditing of plugin dependencies.
*   Source code review of critical plugins.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Octopress Configuration and Secret Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_octopress_configuration_and_secret_management.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Environment Variables:** Identify sensitive values in `_config.yml` and other Octopress configuration files.
2.  **`dotenv` (Local):** Install `dotenv`: `gem install dotenv`. Create a `.env` file (and add it to `.gitignore`!). Store sensitive values as `KEY=value`.
3.  **Configuration Access:** Modify Octopress configuration (e.g., `_config.yml`) to access values using `ENV['KEY']`.
4.  **Deployment Configuration:** Ensure your deployment method (even if it's just copying files) correctly sets these environment variables on the *target* server. This is crucial. Octopress itself doesn't handle deployment, but the configuration *for* deployment needs to be secure.
5. **Review config:** Check all config files to ensure that no debug options are enabled.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Critical):** Prevents exposure of sensitive information if the Octopress source repository is compromised or made public.
*   **Credential Theft (Severity: Critical):** Protects credentials used by Octopress during build/deployment.

**Impact:**
*   Significantly reduces risk of information disclosure and credential theft (Critical to Negligible).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Some sensitive values use environment variables, but not consistently.
*   `.env` is used locally, but deployment environment configuration is incomplete.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent use of environment variables for *all* sensitive values within Octopress configuration.
*   Proper configuration of environment variables in the deployment environment, ensuring they are available to the Octopress build process.
*   Review of the config files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Octopress Itself Updated (or Migrate)](./mitigation_strategies/keep_octopress_itself_updated__or_migrate_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Monitor:** Regularly check the Octopress GitHub repository for new releases or security advisories.
2.  **Update (If Possible):** If updates are available, apply them following Octopress's official instructions. This usually involves updating the Octopress gem and potentially running migration scripts.
3.  **Fork (If Necessary):** If Octopress is unmaintained and you identify vulnerabilities *within Octopress itself*, consider forking the repository and applying security fixes yourself. This requires Ruby expertise.
4.  **Migrate (Long-Term):** If Octopress becomes significantly outdated and unmaintained, plan a migration to a more modern static site generator (Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, Next.js, etc.). This is the most robust long-term solution.
5. **Ruby updates:** Keep the underlying Ruby environment updated with the latest security patches.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Vulnerabilities in Octopress Core (Severity: Varies, potentially Critical to Low):** Addresses security flaws in the Octopress framework itself.
*   **Vulnerabilities in the Ruby Environment (Severity: Varies, potentially Critical to Low):** Addresses security flaws in the underlying Ruby runtime.

**Impact:**
*   Reduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in Octopress and Ruby. Impact depends on the specific vulnerabilities.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   No regular checks for Octopress updates.
*   Ruby is updated sporadically.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Regular monitoring of the Octopress repository.
*   A defined schedule for updating Ruby.
*   A long-term plan for potential migration.
