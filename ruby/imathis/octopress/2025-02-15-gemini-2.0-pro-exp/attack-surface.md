# Attack Surface Analysis for imathis/octopress

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Gems)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__gems_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitable weaknesses in Ruby Gems used by Octopress.
*   **Octopress Contribution:** Octopress's reliance on a defined set of Gems (Jekyll, plugins, etc.) in its `Gemfile` creates this vulnerability. The specific versions and interdependencies are crucial.
*   **Example:** A known CVE in an older version of a Gem like `kramdown` (Markdown parser) allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code during the build by crafting a malicious Markdown document.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of the build environment, injection of malicious code into the generated site, potential data exfiltration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific Gem vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Regularly run `bundle update`. Use `bundler-audit` (or similar) to scan for vulnerabilities. Pin Gem versions to known-good releases in `Gemfile` (balance security with updates). Consider a Gem dependency proxy. Review Gemfile and Gemfile.lock.
    *   **Users (if building locally):** Follow the same practices as developers. Keep your Ruby and Gem environment updated.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws in Octopress/Jekyll plugins, especially third-party ones.
*   **Octopress Contribution:** Octopress's plugin architecture allows for extensibility, directly introducing the risk of using vulnerable or malicious plugins.
*   **Example:** A poorly written plugin processing user data (even for static comments) without proper sanitization could be vulnerable to XSS, injecting malicious JavaScript during the build.
*   **Impact:** Code injection, data breaches, potential compromise of the build environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin and vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Thoroughly vet all third-party plugins (code review, reputation, updates). Minimize plugin usage. Regularly update plugins. Consider sandboxing the build environment (e.g., Docker).
    *   **Users:**  If installing plugins, follow the same precautions as developers.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Exposure (`_config.yml`)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_exposure____config_yml__.md)

*   **Description:** Accidental exposure of sensitive information in Octopress configuration files.
*   **Octopress Contribution:** Octopress uses `_config.yml` and similar files for site settings.  Direct web access to these files leaks sensitive data.
*   **Example:**  A misconfigured web server allows direct access to `/_config.yml`, revealing API keys or other secrets.
*   **Impact:**  Leakage of API keys, deployment credentials, leading to unauthorized access to services or the deployment environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Configure the web server to *deny* access to files starting with `_` and specific directories (`_includes`, `_layouts`, `_plugins`). Store sensitive data in environment variables, *not* in `_config.yml`. Use a `.env` file and `dotenv` for local development.
    *   **Users:** Ensure your web server is properly configured. Verify security settings with your hosting provider.

## Attack Surface: [Build Process Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/build_process_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker gaining control of the Octopress build process to inject malicious code.
*   **Octopress Contribution:**  The Octopress build process (using `rake` and Ruby) is the direct target.  Compromising this process allows complete control over the output.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises a developer's workstation and modifies the `Rakefile` to include a malicious payload in the generated HTML.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the generated static site; the attacker can inject arbitrary code.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Secure the build environment (strong passwords, MFA, updated software). Use a dedicated, isolated build server (CI/CD). Implement code signing. Monitor build logs.
    *   **Users:** If building locally, follow the same security practices as developers for your workstation.
