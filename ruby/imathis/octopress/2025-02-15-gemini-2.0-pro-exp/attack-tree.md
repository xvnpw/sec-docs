## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Octopress Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_octopress_core_vulnerabilities.md)

**1.1. Vulnerable Ruby Gems (Dependencies) [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Octopress relies on various Ruby gems (libraries).  If these gems have known vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them to compromise the website.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  **1.1.1. Identify outdated/vulnerable gems:**  The attacker uses tools like `bundler-audit` or manually inspects the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` to find outdated or vulnerable gems.
        2.  **1.1.2. Exploit known vulnerabilities:** The attacker searches for public exploits (e.g., on Exploit-DB or Metasploit) or crafts custom exploits based on the vulnerability details.
        3.  **1.1.3. Achieve RCE/Data Exfiltration/Content Manipulation [CRITICAL]:**  Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution (RCE), data theft, or content modification.
    *   **Mitigation:** Regularly update gems (`bundle update`), use dependency checking tools (`bundler-audit`), and monitor security advisories.

**1.3. Vulnerabilities in Octopress Plugins/Themes [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:**  Third-party plugins and themes can contain vulnerabilities similar to those found in the core Octopress code.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  **1.3.1. Identify installed plugins/themes:** The attacker examines the website's source or configuration to determine which plugins and themes are used.
        2.  **1.3.2. Analyze plugin/theme code:** The attacker analyzes the code of the identified plugins and themes for vulnerabilities (e.g., using static analysis or manual review).
        3.  **1.3.3. Exploit vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:** The attacker exploits any discovered vulnerabilities to gain control, steal data, or modify content.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Carefully vet plugins/themes before installation, keep them updated, and review their code for security issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Octopress Configuration Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_octopress_configuration_weaknesses__high-risk_.md)

*   **2.1. Default/Weak Credentials**
    *   **Description:**  Octopress might be deployed with default or easily guessable credentials for deployment mechanisms (e.g., Rsync, GitHub Pages).
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  **2.1.1. Check for default credentials:** The attacker looks for default deployment keys or secrets in the `_config.yml` file.
        2.  **2.1.2. Attempt to use default credentials:** The attacker tries to use these default credentials to access the deployment targets.
        3.  **2.1.3. Gain unauthorized access [CRITICAL]:**  Successful login grants the attacker control over the deployment process, allowing them to upload malicious files or modify the website.
    *   **Mitigation:**  *Never* use default credentials.  Use strong, unique passwords and key-based authentication for deployments.

*   **2.2. Sensitive Information Exposure [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:**  API keys, passwords, or other secrets might be accidentally exposed in the `_config.yml` file, source code, or generated output.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  **2.2.1. Check _config.yml:** The attacker examines the `_config.yml` file for exposed secrets.
        2.  **2.2.2. Search source code:** The attacker searches the source code and generated website files for accidentally committed secrets.
        3.  **2.2.3. Use exposed secrets [CRITICAL]:** The attacker uses the discovered secrets to access external services (e.g., databases, APIs) or escalate privileges on the server.
    *   **Mitigation:**  *Never* store secrets in the repository.  Use environment variables or a secure secrets management solution.

*   **2.3. Misconfigured Deployment Settings**
    *   **Description:**  The deployment process might be configured insecurely (e.g., using unencrypted Rsync), allowing attackers to intercept traffic or inject malicious code.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  **2.3.1. Analyze _config.yml:** The attacker examines the `_config.yml` file for insecure deployment methods.
        2.  **2.3.2. Intercept deployment traffic:** The attacker intercepts the network traffic during deployment to steal credentials or inject malicious code (e.g., using a man-in-the-middle attack).
        3.  **2.3.3. Compromise the server [CRITICAL]:**  Successful interception allows the attacker to compromise the server hosting the website.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Use secure deployment methods (e.g., SSH with key-based authentication).  Avoid unencrypted protocols.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Octopress Usage Patterns [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_octopress_usage_patterns__high-risk_.md)

*   **3.1. Unpatched Octopress Installations**
    *   **Description:**  Websites running outdated versions of Octopress are vulnerable to known exploits.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  **3.1.1. Identify outdated versions:** The attacker analyzes the generated HTML/CSS or uses other techniques to identify the Octopress version.
        2.  **3.1.2. Exploit known vulnerabilities:** The attacker searches for and exploits known vulnerabilities in the identified version.
        3.  **3.1.3. Achieve RCE/Data Exfiltration/Content Manipulation [CRITICAL]:** Successful exploitation leads to RCE, data theft, or content modification.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Keep Octopress and all its components updated to the latest versions.

*   **3.2. Lack of Source Code Management Best Practices [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:**  If the `.git` repository is publicly accessible, attackers can download the entire source code history, including potentially sensitive information and past vulnerabilities.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  **3.2.1. Check for .git:** The attacker checks if the `.git` directory is accessible via a web browser.
        2.  **3.2.2. Download .git:** The attacker downloads the entire `.git` repository.
        3.  **3.2.3. Find sensitive information:** The attacker analyzes the commit history to find accidentally committed secrets or vulnerabilities that were later patched.
        4.  **3.2.4. Use information from .git [CRITICAL]:** The attacker uses the discovered information to craft targeted attacks.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Ensure the `.git` directory is *not* publicly accessible.  Use a `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive files from being committed.

*   **3.3. Inclusion of Sensitive Data in Source**
    *   **Description:** Similar to 2.2, but focuses specifically on secrets hardcoded directly into source files (not just configuration).
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  **3.3.1. Search source files:** The attacker searches the source files for hardcoded credentials, API keys, or other secrets.
        2.  **3.3.2. Use exposed secrets [CRITICAL]:** The attacker uses the discovered secrets to access external services or escalate privileges.
    *   **Mitigation:** *Never* hardcode secrets in the source code. Use environment variables or a secure secrets management solution.
