### High and Critical Octopress Threats

Here's a list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Octopress framework:

*   **Threat:** Compromised Gem Dependencies
    *   **Description:** An attacker could introduce a malicious or vulnerable version of a Ruby Gem that Octopress depends on. This could happen through a supply chain attack on the gem repository or by tricking a developer into adding a compromised gem. The attacker could then execute arbitrary code during the Octopress build process or introduce vulnerabilities into the generated website.
    *   **Impact:**  Code execution on the build server, leading to potential data breaches, modification of generated content, or denial of service. Vulnerabilities introduced into the generated site could lead to client-side attacks (e.g., if a compromised gem is used for asset processing).
    *   **Affected Component:** RubyGems dependency management system, specifically the gems used by Octopress (defined in the Gemfile).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update RubyGems and all installed gems using `bundle update`.
        *   Use a `Gemfile.lock` to ensure consistent dependency versions across environments.
        *   Consider using tools like `bundler-audit` or `ruby-advisory-check` to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Be cautious about adding new or unverified gems to the project.

*   **Threat:** Source Code Disclosure in Generated Output
    *   **Description:**  Incorrect configuration or vulnerabilities in Octopress or its plugins could lead to the accidental inclusion of source code files (e.g., `.rb`, `.erb`) in the generated static site. This would expose the application's logic and potentially reveal sensitive information or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of the application's source code, potentially allowing attackers to identify vulnerabilities and plan attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** The Octopress build process and the configuration of file processing and output.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that the Octopress configuration correctly processes and outputs only the intended static files.
        *   Review the generated website content to verify that no source code files are included.
        *   Be cautious about using plugins that might inadvertently expose source code.
