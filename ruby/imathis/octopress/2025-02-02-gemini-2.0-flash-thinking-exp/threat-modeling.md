# Threat Model Analysis for imathis/octopress

## Threat: [Vulnerable Ruby Gems](./threats/vulnerable_ruby_gems.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated Ruby Gems used by Octopress. This could involve injecting malicious code during the build process by crafting specific inputs or dependencies that trigger vulnerabilities in the gems.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the build server.
        *   Compromise of the generated static site with malicious code.
        *   Data exfiltration from the build environment.
    *   **Octopress Component Affected:** Dependency Management (Bundler, Gemfile, Gemfile.lock), Ruby Environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Ruby and all Ruby Gems using `bundle update`.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., `bundle audit`) to identify and remediate vulnerable gems.
        *   Pin gem versions in `Gemfile.lock` to ensure consistent and tested dependencies.
        *   Review and minimize gem dependencies.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Jekyll Version](./threats/vulnerable_jekyll_version.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could target known vulnerabilities in the specific version of Jekyll that Octopress relies upon. This could involve crafting malicious content or exploiting weaknesses in Jekyll's processing logic to execute arbitrary code during site generation.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) during the Octopress build process.
        *   Introduction of vulnerabilities into the generated static HTML files.
        *   Website defacement or malicious content injection.
    *   **Octopress Component Affected:** Jekyll Core, Octopress Core (as it depends on Jekyll).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Jekyll updated to the latest stable and secure version compatible with Octopress.
        *   Monitor Jekyll security advisories and apply patches promptly.
        *   If Octopress uses an outdated and unpatchable Jekyll, consider migrating to a more actively maintained static site generator or a newer Octopress fork with updated dependencies.

## Threat: [Malicious or Vulnerable Octopress Plugins](./threats/malicious_or_vulnerable_octopress_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could create or compromise an Octopress plugin and inject malicious code. If a user installs this plugin, the attacker's code could be executed during the build process, allowing them to modify the generated site or compromise the build environment. Vulnerable plugins could also contain XSS or other vulnerabilities that are then incorporated into the generated website.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Backdoor installation in the generated website.
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the website.
        *   Data exfiltration from the build environment or website visitors.
        *   Website defacement or redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Octopress Component Affected:** Plugin System, Individual Plugins.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the use of Octopress plugins.
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit plugin code before installation, especially from third-party sources.
        *   Only use plugins from trusted and reputable developers or repositories.
        *   Keep plugins updated to their latest versions.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate potential XSS from plugins.

## Threat: [Build Process Manipulation](./threats/build_process_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who gains access to the development environment or build pipeline could modify the Octopress source code, configuration, or content. This could involve injecting malicious scripts, altering website content, or introducing backdoors into the generated static site during the build process.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete compromise of the generated website.
        *   Malware distribution to website visitors.
        *   Phishing attacks targeting website visitors.
        *   Long-term website compromise and data breaches.
    *   **Octopress Component Affected:** Entire Build Process, Source Code Repository, Configuration Files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the development environment with strong access controls and regular security updates.
        *   Use version control (Git) and code review processes to detect unauthorized changes.
        *   Implement secure CI/CD pipelines with automated security checks.
        *   Regularly audit the build process and infrastructure for vulnerabilities.
        *   Use multi-factor authentication for access to development and deployment systems.

## Threat: [Theme Vulnerabilities](./threats/theme_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Octopress themes, especially those from untrusted sources, may contain vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), insecure JavaScript code, or even backdoors. These vulnerabilities are then incorporated into every page of the generated website.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks targeting website visitors.
        *   Malicious redirects or content injection on the website.
        *   Compromise of website visitors' browsers and potentially their systems.
    *   **Octopress Component Affected:** Theme System, Theme Templates (Layouts, Includes, Posts).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Choose themes from reputable and trusted sources.
        *   Audit theme code for vulnerabilities before use, paying close attention to JavaScript and template code.
        *   Keep themes updated to their latest versions.
        *   Consider developing or heavily customizing themes in-house for better security control.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate potential XSS from themes.
