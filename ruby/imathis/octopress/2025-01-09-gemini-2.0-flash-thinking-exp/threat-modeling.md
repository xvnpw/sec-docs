# Threat Model Analysis for imathis/octopress

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution during Generation](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_during_generation.md)

*   **Threat:** Arbitrary Code Execution during Generation
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability exists within the core Octopress codebase (e.g., in a custom generator, rake task, or through insecure handling of user-provided data during the build process) that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server during static site generation. This could be triggered by a specially crafted blog post, theme file, or configuration setting.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the build server, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, modify files, inject malicious code into the generated website, or disrupt the build process.
    *   **Affected Component:** Octopress core codebase, custom generators, rake tasks, build process logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Octopress updated to the latest version with security patches.
        *   Thoroughly audit any custom code or modifications made to the Octopress core.
        *   Run the build process in a sandboxed or isolated environment with limited privileges.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data processed by Octopress during the build.

## Threat: [Malicious Content Injection via Build Process](./threats/malicious_content_injection_via_build_process.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Content Injection via Build Process
    *   **Description:** A flaw within Octopress's core processing of content (e.g., insecure handling of Markdown extensions, Liquid tags, or custom template logic within Octopress itself) allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts or markup into the generated static HTML files. This injected code executes in the browsers of website visitors.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, enabling the attacker to steal user cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Affected Component:** Octopress core codebase, specifically the parts responsible for processing and rendering content (potentially involving custom tag handlers or rendering extensions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Octopress's content processing logic properly escapes or sanitizes user-provided data to prevent the injection of malicious HTML or JavaScript.
        *   Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly review Octopress's codebase for potential injection vulnerabilities, especially in custom rendering logic.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugins or Themes](./threats/malicious_plugins_or_themes.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugins or Themes
    *   **Description:** The Octopress architecture allows for the use of plugins and themes. If Octopress's plugin/theme loading or execution mechanism has vulnerabilities, a malicious plugin or theme could be loaded and executed, leading to compromise. Even without core vulnerabilities, a malicious plugin designed specifically for Octopress could exploit the framework's features to execute arbitrary code during the build or inject malicious content.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the build server, injection of malicious code into the generated website leading to XSS or other client-side attacks, theft of secrets or credentials from the build environment.
    *   **Affected Component:** Octopress plugin/theme loading mechanism, plugin API, potentially core functionalities exposed to plugins.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when installing third-party Octopress plugins or themes. Only use those from trusted and reputable sources.
        *   Review the code of any third-party plugins or themes before installation to understand their functionality and potential risks.
        *   Be wary of plugins or themes that request excessive permissions or access to sensitive data within the Octopress environment.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Plugins or Themes](./threats/vulnerable_plugins_or_themes.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable Plugins or Themes
    *   **Description:**  Even if not intentionally malicious, a poorly coded Octopress plugin or theme might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., due to insecure data handling or improper use of Octopress APIs). If Octopress's core doesn't provide sufficient sandboxing or security boundaries, these vulnerabilities could be exploited during the build process or affect the security of the generated website.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), potential for remote code execution if the plugin interacts with external systems in an insecure way (less likely in a static site context but possible via plugin actions), data breaches if the plugin handles sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Octopress plugin API, potentially core functionalities that plugins can interact with, the specific vulnerable plugin itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if the vulnerability allows for RCE or significant data breach)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep all installed Octopress plugins and themes updated to the latest versions, as updates often contain security fixes.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues in used Octopress plugins and themes.
        *   If a vulnerability is discovered in a plugin or theme, consider disabling or removing it until a patch is available.
        *   Report any discovered vulnerabilities to the plugin/theme developers and potentially to the Octopress project if it highlights a weakness in the plugin API.
