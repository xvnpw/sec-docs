# Attack Surface Analysis for imathis/octopress

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Octopress relies on various Ruby gems (libraries) like Jekyll and plugins. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited.
    *   **How Octopress Contributes:** Octopress mandates the use of specific versions or ranges of these dependencies, and the plugin ecosystem introduces numerous external dependencies.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the `Redcarpet` gem (a common Markdown parser used by Jekyll) could allow an attacker to inject malicious code through a specially crafted Markdown post.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server during site generation, cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the generated site.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Octopress and all its dependencies using `bundle update`.
        *   Monitor security advisories for RubyGems and Jekyll.
        *   Carefully vet and audit any third-party plugins before installation.
        *   Use tools like `bundler-audit` to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./attack_surfaces/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

*   **Description:** Users can install third-party plugins to extend Octopress's functionality. Malicious plugins can introduce security risks.
    *   **How Octopress Contributes:** Octopress's plugin architecture allows arbitrary Ruby code execution during the site generation process.
    *   **Example:** A malicious plugin could read sensitive files from the server, inject malicious scripts into the generated HTML, or modify the site's content.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the site and potentially the server, data theft, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install plugins from trusted sources.
        *   Review the plugin's code before installation if possible.
        *   Keep installed plugins updated.
        *   Implement strong access controls on the server to limit the impact of a compromised plugin.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Manipulation (`_config.yml`)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_manipulation____config_yml__.md)

*   **Description:** The `_config.yml` file contains important site settings. If an attacker gains access to this file, they can modify the site's behavior.
    *   **How Octopress Contributes:** Octopress relies heavily on this file for configuration, including paths, URLs, and plugin settings.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could modify the `url` setting to redirect all traffic to a malicious site or disable security-related features.
    *   **Impact:** Site defacement, redirection to malicious sites, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to the `_config.yml` file using appropriate file system permissions.
        *   Do not store sensitive information directly in the `_config.yml` file.
        *   Use environment variables for sensitive settings where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Custom Code in Includes or Layouts](./attack_surfaces/insecure_custom_code_in_includes_or_layouts.md)

*   **Description:** Developers can add custom Ruby code within includes or layouts. Vulnerabilities in this code can be exploited during site generation.
    *   **How Octopress Contributes:** Octopress allows embedding Ruby code within Liquid templates.
    *   **Example:** Custom code might perform insecure file operations or execute arbitrary commands based on user-controlled data (if such data is somehow incorporated into the generation process).
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server during site generation, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly audit any custom Ruby code for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Avoid executing external commands or performing file system operations directly within templates if possible.
        *   Sanitize any user-provided data before using it in custom code (though this is less common in static site generation).
