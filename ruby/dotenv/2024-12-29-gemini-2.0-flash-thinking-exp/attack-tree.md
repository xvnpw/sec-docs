Threat Model: dotenv Attack Tree - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

Objective: Gain Unauthorized Access and Control of the Application by Exploiting dotenv Weaknesses.

High-Risk & Critical Sub-Tree:

[!] Compromise Application via dotenv Exploitation
├─── AND ─ [!] Gain Access to Sensitive Information Stored in .env
│    └── OR ─ [!] Directly Access the .env File
│        └─── *** [!] Access Compromised Server
│        └─── *** [!] Exploit Application Vulnerability to Read Files
├─── AND ─ [!] Modify Application Behavior via Malicious Environment Variables
│    └── OR ─ [!] Modify Existing .env File
│        └─── *** [!] Access Compromised Server
│        └─── *** Exploit Application Vulnerability to Write Files
└─── AND ─ Cause Denial of Service or Application Failure via Malicious Environment Variables
     └── OR ─ *** Inject Variables Causing Application Errors

Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

**Critical Node: Compromise Application via dotenv Exploitation**
* This is the root goal of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has achieved significant control or access to the application by exploiting weaknesses related to dotenv.

**Critical Node: Gain Access to Sensitive Information Stored in .env**
* This node represents the attacker's goal of obtaining sensitive data stored within the `.env` file, such as API keys, database credentials, etc.

**Critical Node: Directly Access the .env File**
* This node represents the most direct way to access the sensitive information. It encompasses methods where the attacker directly interacts with the `.env` file.

**High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Access Compromised Server**
* **Attack Vector:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the server hosting the application.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** Critical (Full access to the `.env` file and potentially the entire server)
* **Effort:** Medium to High
* **Skill Level:** Medium to High
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Why High-Risk:** Server compromise provides direct access to the `.env` file, bypassing application-level security. It's a common and highly impactful attack vector.

**High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit Application Vulnerability to Read Files**
* **Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities within the application (e.g., path traversal, arbitrary file read) to read the contents of the `.env` file.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High (Exposure of sensitive information)
* **Effort:** Low to Medium
* **Skill Level:** Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Why High-Risk:** Web application vulnerabilities are relatively common, and successful exploitation can directly expose sensitive data stored in the `.env` file.

**Critical Node: Modify Application Behavior via Malicious Environment Variables**
* This node represents the attacker's goal of altering the application's behavior by injecting or modifying environment variables.

**Critical Node: Modify Existing .env File**
* This node represents the attacker's goal of directly changing the contents of the `.env` file to inject malicious environment variables.

**High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Access Compromised Server (for modification)**
* **Attack Vector:**  Similar to the previous "Access Compromised Server," but the goal here is to modify the `.env` file.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** Critical (Ability to inject arbitrary environment variables, potentially leading to further compromise)
* **Effort:** Medium to High
* **Skill Level:** Medium to High
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Why High-Risk:**  Compromising the server allows direct modification of the `.env` file, giving the attacker significant control over the application's configuration.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Application Vulnerability to Write Files**
* **Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities within the application (e.g., arbitrary file write) to modify the contents of the `.env` file.
* **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
* **Impact:** Critical (Ability to inject arbitrary environment variables)
* **Effort:** Medium
* **Skill Level:** Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Why High-Risk:** While potentially less common than read vulnerabilities, successful exploitation allows the attacker to inject malicious configurations.

**High-Risk Path: Inject Variables Causing Application Errors**
* **Attack Vector:** The attacker injects environment variables with invalid or malicious values that cause the application to malfunction or crash, leading to a denial of service.
* **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
* **Impact:** High (Application malfunction or denial of service)
* **Effort:** Low to Medium
* **Skill Level:** Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Why High-Risk:**  Disrupting the application's availability can have significant consequences, and exploiting environment variables for this purpose can be relatively straightforward.
