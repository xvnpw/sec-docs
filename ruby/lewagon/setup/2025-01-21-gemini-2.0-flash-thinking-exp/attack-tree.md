## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Setup Script Directly](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_setup_script_directly.md)

**1. *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Setup Script Directly:**

This path focuses on directly attacking the `lewagon/setup` script itself to compromise applications using it.

*   **[CRITICAL] Compromise the Source of the Setup Script:**
    *   **Compromise Maintainer's Account:** An attacker targets the GitHub account of a maintainer with write access to the `lewagon/setup` repository.
        *   **Phishing Attack:** The attacker sends deceptive emails or messages to trick the maintainer into revealing their credentials.
        *   **Credential Stuffing:** The attacker uses known username/password combinations (obtained from previous data breaches) to try and log into the maintainer's account.
        *   **Malware on Developer's Machine:** The attacker infects the maintainer's computer with malware that can steal credentials or session tokens.
*   **Inject Malicious Code into the Setup Script:** Once the source is compromised, the attacker modifies the script to include malicious functionality.
    *   **Add Backdoor:** The attacker inserts code that allows them to gain unauthorized remote access to systems where the script is run.
    *   **Modify Installation Steps to Include Malicious Software:** The attacker alters the script to download and install malware alongside the intended development tools.
*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in the Setup Script Itself:** The attacker leverages weaknesses in the script's code.
    *   **Command Injection Vulnerabilities:** The attacker provides malicious input that, when processed by the script, results in the execution of arbitrary commands on the system.
        *   **Supply Malicious Input via Environment Variables:** The attacker sets environment variables with malicious commands that the script uses without proper sanitization.
        *   **Supply Malicious Input via Configuration Files:** The attacker modifies configuration files that the script reads, injecting malicious commands.
    *   **Path Traversal Vulnerabilities:** The attacker manipulates file paths used by the script to access or overwrite files outside of the intended directories, potentially including critical system files.
        *   **Overwrite Critical System Files:** The attacker uses path traversal to overwrite important system files, leading to system instability or compromise.
    *   **Insecure Handling of Dependencies:** The attacker exploits how the script manages external resources or packages.
        *   **Dependency Confusion Attack:** The attacker uploads a malicious package to a public repository with the same name as an internal dependency, tricking the script into downloading the malicious version.
        *   **Downgrade Attack to Vulnerable Dependency:** The attacker forces the script to install an older, vulnerable version of a dependency.
