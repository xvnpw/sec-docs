# Attack Surface Analysis for lewagon/setup

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Download Source](./attack_surfaces/compromised_download_source.md)

**Description:** The risk that the source of the `lewagon/setup` script itself (the GitHub repository) or the specific commit being used has been maliciously altered.

**How Setup Contributes:** The script is downloaded and executed directly from a remote source. If this source is compromised, the user will execute malicious code.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the `lewagon/setup` repository and injects code that installs a backdoor on the user's system.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the developer's machine, including data theft, malware installation, and potential lateral movement within a network.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Verify the integrity of the script: Check the commit history and ensure it aligns with trusted sources. Look for unexpected changes.
* Use a specific, known good commit: Pin the script to a specific commit hash instead of relying on the latest version, especially in production-related setups.
* Monitor the repository for suspicious activity: Track changes to the repository and be alerted to unexpected modifications.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks During Download](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_during_download.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the download of the `lewagon/setup` script or any of its dependencies, replacing legitimate files with malicious ones.

**How Setup Contributes:** The script initiates downloads from various sources. If these downloads are not secured with HTTPS and proper certificate verification, they are vulnerable to MitM attacks.

**Example:** An attacker on the same network as the developer intercepts the download of a required package and replaces it with a trojanized version.

**Impact:** Installation of malware, backdoors, or compromised dependencies, leading to system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure HTTPS is used for all downloads: Verify that the script uses `https://` for all download URLs.
* Implement certificate pinning or verification: Ensure the script validates the SSL/TLS certificates of the download sources.
* Use secure network connections: Avoid running the setup on untrusted or public Wi-Fi networks.

## Attack Surface: [Execution of Arbitrary Code via Script Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/execution_of_arbitrary_code_via_script_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The `lewagon/setup` script itself contains vulnerabilities, such as command injection flaws, that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.

**How Setup Contributes:** The script is designed to execute commands to configure the system. If these commands are constructed insecurely based on external input or internal logic, it can be exploited.

**Example:** The script takes user input for a software version without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands into the executed shell command.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the developer's machine with the privileges of the user running the script.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Review the script's code: Carefully examine the script for potential command injection vulnerabilities, especially where external input is used.
* Use parameterized commands or safe command execution methods: Avoid directly constructing shell commands from strings.
* Minimize the use of `eval()` or similar functions: These functions can execute arbitrary code and should be used with extreme caution.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information During Setup](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_during_setup.md)

**Description:** The setup process might involve handling sensitive information like API keys, credentials, or personal data, which could be exposed if not handled securely.

**How Setup Contributes:** The script might prompt for or store sensitive information during the setup process. If this information is logged, stored in insecure files, or transmitted insecurely, it becomes an attack surface.

**Example:** The script prompts for an API key and stores it in a plain text configuration file with world-readable permissions.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially leading to account compromise, data breaches, or financial loss.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the script: Use environment variables or secure secret management solutions.
* Ensure sensitive information is not logged: Review the script for any logging of sensitive data.
* Use secure methods for handling credentials: Explore options like credential managers or secure vaults.
