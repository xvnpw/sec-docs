# Threat Model Analysis for lewagon/setup

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise of `lewagon/setup` Repository](./threats/supply_chain_compromise_of__lewagonsetup__repository.md)

**Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** A malicious actor gains unauthorized access to the `lewagon/setup` GitHub repository. They then modify the scripts (e.g., `install.sh`, language-specific installers) to include malicious code. This could involve adding backdoors, keyloggers, or code that exfiltrates sensitive information.
    * **How:** This could happen through compromised maintainer accounts, exploiting vulnerabilities in GitHub's infrastructure, or social engineering.
**Impact:**
    * Developers running the compromised `lewagon/setup` script will unknowingly install malware or backdoors onto their development machines. This could lead to the compromise of their local environment, including access to source code, credentials, and other sensitive data. It could also introduce vulnerabilities into the applications being developed.
**Affected Component:**
    * The entire `lewagon/setup` repository and its scripts (e.g., `install.sh`, language-specific installers).
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Regularly check the commit history and maintainers of the `lewagon/setup` repository for any suspicious or unexpected changes.
    * Consider forking the repository and maintaining a local, vetted version, especially for sensitive projects.
    * Implement code signing for the scripts within the `lewagon/setup` repository to ensure authenticity and integrity.
    * Monitor the `lewagon/setup` repository for security advisories or reports of compromise.

## Threat: [Execution of Arbitrary Code via Script Vulnerabilities](./threats/execution_of_arbitrary_code_via_script_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** A malicious actor identifies vulnerabilities within the `lewagon/setup` scripts themselves (e.g., command injection, path traversal). They then craft malicious input or manipulate the execution environment to exploit these vulnerabilities.
    * **How:** This could involve providing specially crafted arguments to the script, manipulating environment variables, or exploiting insecure handling of user input.
**Impact:**
    * Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the developer's machine with the privileges of the user running the script (often requiring `sudo`). This could lead to full system compromise, data theft, or the installation of persistent backdoors.
**Affected Component:**
    * The shell scripts within the `lewagon/setup` repository, particularly those that handle user input or execute external commands.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Thoroughly review the `lewagon/setup` script for potential vulnerabilities before execution.
    * Avoid running the script blindly without understanding its actions.
    * Implement proper input validation and sanitization within the scripts.
    * Follow secure coding practices when writing or modifying the scripts.
    * Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the scripts.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Setup Scripts or Logs](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_setup_scripts_or_logs.md)

**Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** Sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, or other secrets, is inadvertently included directly in the `lewagon/setup` scripts or is logged during the execution of the scripts. An attacker gains access to the repository or the logs.
    * **How:** This could happen if developers hardcode secrets in the scripts or if logging is not properly configured to exclude sensitive data. Access to the repository could be gained through compromised accounts, and access to logs could occur if they are not properly secured.
**Impact:**
    * Exposed credentials could allow attackers to access internal systems, databases, or third-party services, leading to data breaches, financial loss, or reputational damage.
**Affected Component:**
    * The shell scripts within the `lewagon/setup` repository and any logging mechanisms used by the scripts.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly in the `lewagon/setup` script.
    * Utilize environment variables or secure secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to handle sensitive data.
    * Ensure that any logs generated by the script are stored securely and access is restricted.
    * Regularly audit the scripts and logs for accidentally exposed secrets.
