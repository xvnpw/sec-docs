# Threat Model Analysis for lewagon/setup

## Threat: [Compromised `lewagon/setup` Repository](./threats/compromised__lewagonsetup__repository.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of the official `lewagon/setup` GitHub repository. They might modify the script to include malicious code that gets executed on the user's machine when they run the setup. This could involve adding backdoors, installing malware, or stealing credentials.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, data breaches, installation of malware, unauthorized access to resources.

**Affected Component:** Entire script, specifically the downloaded `setup.sh` file and any other associated scripts or configuration files within the repository.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Verify the integrity of the downloaded `setup.sh` script by checking its checksum against a known good value (if available and reliably sourced).
* Monitor the `lewagon/setup` repository for unusual activity or commits.
* Consider forking the repository and maintaining a known good version for internal use.
* Implement code signing for the script if feasible.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Download](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_download.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the download of the `setup.sh` script (or other resources downloaded *by the script itself*) if it's not done over a secure connection (HTTPS). The attacker replaces the legitimate script with a malicious one before it reaches the user.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code on the user's machine, leading to system compromise, data theft, or malware installation.

**Affected Component:** Script download process, specifically the `curl` or `wget` commands used to fetch the script and other resources *directly managed by the setup script*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure the `lewagon/setup` script itself and any resources it directly downloads are fetched over HTTPS.
* Verify SSL/TLS certificates to prevent certificate spoofing during the initial script download.
* Use tools that automatically enforce secure connections for the initial script download.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Script Actions](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_script_actions.md)

**Description:** The `lewagon/setup` script often requires elevated privileges (e.g., using `sudo`) to install software or modify system configurations. Vulnerabilities in the script could be exploited to perform actions with root privileges that were not intended.

**Impact:** Full control over the system where the script is executed.

**Affected Component:** Parts of the script that use `sudo` or other mechanisms to gain elevated privileges.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Minimize the need for `sudo` within the script.
* Carefully audit any commands executed with `sudo`.
* Run the script with the least necessary privileges.
* Consider using containerization or virtualization to isolate the setup process.
