# Attack Surface Analysis for lewagon/setup

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Script Compromise](./attack_surfaces/malicious_script_compromise.md)

* **Description:** The `lewagon/setup` script hosted on GitHub is compromised, containing malicious code.
    * **How Setup Contributes to Attack Surface:** Developers directly download and execute this script, trusting its source.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the `lewagon/setup` repository and injects code that installs a backdoor or steals credentials. When developers run the script, their machines are compromised.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the developer's machine, potential data loss, exposure of sensitive information, and use of the machine for further attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Manual Review:** Carefully inspect the script's contents before execution.
        * **Fork and Review:** Fork the repository, review the code changes, and then run the forked version.
        * **Checksum Verification:** If available, verify the script's integrity using checksums provided by trusted sources.
        * **Monitor Repository:** Keep an eye on the repository for unexpected changes or commits.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack during Download](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_during_download.md)

* **Description:** An attacker intercepts the download of the `lewagon/setup` script and replaces it with a malicious version.
    * **How Setup Contributes to Attack Surface:** Developers download the script from a remote source, creating an opportunity for interception.
    * **Example:** While downloading the script over a compromised network, an attacker intercepts the connection and serves a modified script that appears legitimate but contains malicious code.
    * **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code on the developer's machine, leading to system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Verify HTTPS:** Ensure the download is performed over a secure HTTPS connection (though this doesn't completely eliminate MITM risks).
        * **Use Trusted Networks:** Avoid downloading the script on public or untrusted Wi-Fi networks.
        * **Checksum Verification:** If checksums are provided by a trusted out-of-band method, verify the downloaded script against them.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation.md)

* **Description:** The `lewagon/setup` script might require or request elevated privileges (e.g., using `sudo`) which could be misused.
    * **How Setup Contributes to Attack Surface:** By requiring elevated privileges, the script increases the potential damage if it is compromised or contains vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability in the script could be exploited to execute malicious commands with root privileges if the script is run with `sudo`.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the operating system.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Minimize `sudo` Usage:** Understand why the script requires elevated privileges and explore alternative methods if possible.
        * **Inspect `sudo` Commands:** Carefully examine the specific commands executed with `sudo`.
        * **Run in Isolated Environment:** Test the script in a virtual machine or container before running it on a production or personal machine.
