# Attack Tree Analysis for lewagon/setup

Objective: Gain unauthorized access and control over the application's environment and potentially the application itself, by leveraging vulnerabilities introduced during the setup process facilitated by `lewagon/setup`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Developer Machine -> Introduce Malicious Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_developer_machine_-_introduce_malicious_dependencies.md)

*   **Compromise Developer Machine [CRITICAL NODE]:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a developer's machine.
    *   **Modify dependency lists (e.g., Gemfile, requirements.txt) [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker modifies the project's dependency files.
    *   **Introduce Malicious Dependencies:** The modified dependency files cause the installation of malicious packages during the setup process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Developer Machine -> Inject Malicious Code into Setup Scripts](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_developer_machine_-_inject_malicious_code_into_setup_scripts.md)

*   **Compromise Developer Machine [CRITICAL NODE]:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a developer's machine.
    *   **Modify core setup scripts (e.g., install.sh, configure.sh) [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker directly modifies the setup scripts.
    *   **Inject Malicious Code into Setup Scripts:** The modified scripts execute malicious commands during the setup process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise CI/CD Pipeline -> Introduce Malicious Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_cicd_pipeline_-_introduce_malicious_dependencies.md)

*   **Compromise CI/CD Pipeline [CRITICAL NODE]:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the CI/CD pipeline configuration or environment.
    *   **Modify dependency lists (e.g., Gemfile, requirements.txt) [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker modifies the project's dependency files within the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Introduce Malicious Dependencies:** The modified dependency files cause the installation of malicious packages during the CI/CD build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise CI/CD Pipeline -> Inject Malicious Code into Setup Scripts](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_cicd_pipeline_-_inject_malicious_code_into_setup_scripts.md)

*   **Compromise CI/CD Pipeline [CRITICAL NODE]:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the CI/CD pipeline configuration or environment.
    *   **Modify core setup scripts (e.g., install.sh, configure.sh) [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker modifies the setup scripts within the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Inject Malicious Code into Setup Scripts:** The modified scripts execute malicious commands during the CI/CD build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Outdated or Vulnerable Software Installation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_outdated_or_vulnerable_software_installation.md)

*   **The setup installs outdated versions of software with known vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:** The `lewagon/setup` scripts are configured to install specific versions of software that have known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Exploit Outdated or Vulnerable Software Installation:** After the setup is complete, an attacker can leverage these known vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
