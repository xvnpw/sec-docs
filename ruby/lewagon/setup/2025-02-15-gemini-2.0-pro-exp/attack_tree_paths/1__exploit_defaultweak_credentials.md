# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Hardcoded Credentials in Configuration Files

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the risk of hardcoded credentials remaining in configuration files after using the `lewagon/setup` scripts.  We aim to determine the specific vulnerabilities, assess the likelihood and impact, and propose concrete mitigation strategies to prevent this critical security flaw.  This analysis will inform development practices and potentially lead to improvements in the `lewagon/setup` scripts themselves.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Target:** Applications deployed using the `lewagon/setup` repository (or similar setup scripts).  This includes, but is not limited to, Ruby on Rails applications.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploitation of hardcoded credentials found within configuration files.
*   **Configuration Files of Interest:**  Primarily `database.yml`, `secrets.yml` (or their equivalents in other frameworks), and any other files identified as potentially storing sensitive information (e.g., environment-specific configuration files, `.env` files, etc.).  We will also consider files that might be generated *by* the setup scripts.
*   **Post-Setup State:**  We are concerned with the state of the application *after* the `lewagon/setup` scripts have been executed, assuming a developer follows the standard instructions.
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover vulnerabilities introduced by subsequent developer actions (e.g., manually adding hardcoded credentials *after* the initial setup).  It also does not cover vulnerabilities unrelated to hardcoded credentials.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough examination of the `lewagon/setup` repository's scripts (Bash, Ruby, etc.) will be conducted.  We will specifically look for:
    *   How credentials are handled (generated, prompted for, stored).
    *   Whether default credentials are used at any point.
    *   Whether the scripts attempt to enforce strong credential practices.
    *   Any potential for credentials to be inadvertently written to configuration files.
    *   Any warnings or documentation related to credential management.

2.  **Dynamic Testing (Sandbox Environment):**  We will execute the `lewagon/setup` scripts in a controlled, isolated environment (e.g., a Docker container or a virtual machine).  This allows us to:
    *   Observe the script's behavior in a realistic setting.
    *   Inspect the generated configuration files for hardcoded credentials.
    *   Test different setup scenarios (e.g., default options vs. custom configurations).
    *   Simulate an attacker gaining access to the configuration files.

3.  **Vulnerability Scanning (Static Analysis):** We will use static analysis tools (e.g., `brakeman` for Rails, `bandit` for Python, general-purpose tools like `trufflehog` or `gitleaks`) to scan:
    *   The `lewagon/setup` repository itself.
    *   A sample application *after* it has been set up using the scripts.
    * This helps identify potential hardcoded secrets and other security issues.

4.  **Documentation Review:**  We will carefully review the `lewagon/setup` documentation (README, wiki, etc.) to understand the intended credential management process and identify any gaps or ambiguities.

5.  **Best Practices Comparison:**  We will compare the observed credential handling practices against established security best practices for application deployment and configuration management.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2 Hardcoded Credentials in Configuration Files

**4.1. Threat Model Refinement:**

*   **Attacker Profile:**  The attacker could be an external actor who gains unauthorized access to the server (e.g., through a separate vulnerability) or an insider with legitimate access to the server but malicious intent.  The attacker's skill level is assumed to be low, as exploiting this vulnerability requires minimal technical expertise.
*   **Attack Surface:** The attack surface consists of the configuration files themselves, which are typically stored within the application's directory structure.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker gains read access to the configuration files. This could be achieved through various means, including:
    *   Exploiting a file inclusion vulnerability.
    *   Gaining shell access via a compromised service.
    *   Leveraging a misconfigured web server that exposes the files.
    *   Social engineering an authorized user.
    *   Physical access to the server.

**4.2.  `lewagon/setup` Specific Analysis:**

**(Note: This section requires actual code review and dynamic testing.  The following are *hypothetical* findings and examples, illustrating the types of issues we would look for.)**

*   **Hypothetical Finding 1 (Code Review):**  The `setup.sh` script might contain a section like this:

    ```bash
    # database.yml generation (HYPOTHETICAL - DO NOT USE)
    cat <<EOF > config/database.yml
    development:
      adapter: postgresql
      encoding: unicode
      database: myapp_development
      pool: 5
      username: myappuser
      password: myapppassword  # <--- HARDCODED DEFAULT!
    EOF
    ```

    This is a *critical* vulnerability.  The script directly writes a default password into the `database.yml` file.

*   **Hypothetical Finding 2 (Dynamic Testing):**  After running the setup script, we examine `config/secrets.yml` and find:

    ```yaml
    # secrets.yml (HYPOTHETICAL - DO NOT USE)
    development:
      secret_key_base: 3b7cd727ee24e8444053437c36cc66c4  # <--- WEAK DEFAULT!
    ```

    While not a *hardcoded* secret in the strictest sense, this is a *weak, predictable* default.  If the script doesn't force a change, an attacker can easily guess or brute-force this key.

*   **Hypothetical Finding 3 (Documentation Review):**  The `README.md` file might contain a vague instruction like: "Make sure to change the default database password."  However, it doesn't provide specific steps or emphasize the critical importance of this step.  This is a *documentation weakness* that increases the likelihood of the vulnerability being exploited.

*   **Hypothetical Finding 4 (Static Analysis):**  Running `brakeman` on a Rails application set up with the script might report:

    ```
    Confidence: High
    Warning Type: Hardcoded Secret
    File: config/initializers/some_initializer.rb
    Message: Hardcoded value 'my_secret_api_key' used in configuration.
    ```

    This indicates that the setup process, or a template it uses, has introduced a hardcoded API key.

**4.3. Impact Analysis:**

*   **Database Compromise:**  If the `database.yml` contains hardcoded credentials, an attacker can gain full access to the application's database.  This allows them to:
    *   Steal sensitive data (user information, financial data, etc.).
    *   Modify or delete data.
    *   Potentially use the database server as a launchpad for further attacks.
*   **Session Hijacking:**  If the `secrets.yml` (or equivalent) contains a weak or default `secret_key_base`, an attacker can:
    *   Forge session cookies.
    *   Impersonate legitimate users.
    *   Gain unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Code Execution:**  In some cases, hardcoded credentials for external services (e.g., cloud storage, message queues) could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within those services, potentially escalating their privileges.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack exploiting hardcoded credentials can lead to significant reputational damage for the organization and loss of customer trust.

**4.4. Likelihood Analysis:**

The likelihood depends heavily on the *actual* implementation of the `lewagon/setup` scripts.

*   **High Likelihood:** If the scripts do *not* force credential changes and rely on default values, the likelihood is very high.  Developers might overlook manual configuration steps, especially in development or testing environments.
*   **Low Likelihood:** If the scripts *actively prevent* the use of default credentials (e.g., by prompting for strong passwords during setup and refusing to proceed with defaults), the likelihood is significantly lower.  However, even then, there's a small risk of human error (e.g., a developer accidentally committing a configuration file with hardcoded credentials to a public repository).

**4.5. Mitigation Strategies:**

The following mitigation strategies are crucial:

1.  **Enforce Strong Credential Generation:**
    *   The `lewagon/setup` scripts *must* generate strong, random credentials for all sensitive components (database, secret key base, API keys, etc.).
    *   Use cryptographically secure random number generators (e.g., `/dev/urandom` on Linux, `SecureRandom` in Ruby).
    *   Do *not* use predictable defaults or easily guessable values.

2.  **Interactive Prompts:**
    *   The scripts should interactively prompt the user for credentials during setup.
    *   Clearly explain the purpose of each credential and the importance of choosing strong values.
    *   Provide guidance on password complexity requirements.
    *   *Never* display the entered credentials on the screen in plain text.

3.  **Secure Storage:**
    *   Credentials should be stored securely in configuration files.
    *   Use appropriate file permissions (e.g., `chmod 600` on Linux) to restrict access to authorized users only.
    *   Consider using environment variables instead of storing credentials directly in configuration files, especially for sensitive API keys.
    *   For production environments, explore using dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).

4.  **Configuration File Templates:**
    *   Provide clear and secure configuration file templates.
    *   Use placeholders or comments to indicate where credentials should be inserted.
    *   *Never* include default credentials in the templates, even as examples.

5.  **Documentation and Warnings:**
    *   The `lewagon/setup` documentation *must* clearly and emphatically warn against using default credentials.
    *   Provide step-by-step instructions on how to securely configure credentials.
    *   Include warnings within the scripts themselves (e.g., error messages if default credentials are detected).

6.  **Static Analysis Integration:**
    *   Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., `brakeman`, `bandit`, `trufflehog`, `gitleaks`) into the development workflow and CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Configure these tools to detect hardcoded secrets and other security vulnerabilities.
    *   Treat any detected issues as critical errors that must be addressed before deployment.

7.  **Regular Audits:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the application and its configuration.
    *   Review the `lewagon/setup` scripts periodically to ensure they are up-to-date with security best practices.

8.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the credentials used by the application have the minimum necessary privileges. For example, the database user should only have access to the specific database and tables it needs, not full administrative access.

9. **.gitignore:** Ensure that configuration files containing sensitive information (like `database.yml` and `secrets.yml`) are included in the `.gitignore` file to prevent them from being accidentally committed to the version control system.

## 5. Conclusion

The risk of hardcoded credentials in configuration files is a serious security vulnerability that can lead to complete system compromise.  The `lewagon/setup` scripts, and any similar setup tools, must be carefully designed and implemented to mitigate this risk.  By following the recommendations outlined in this analysis, developers can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this type of attack.  Continuous vigilance and adherence to security best practices are essential for maintaining the security of applications deployed using these scripts.
