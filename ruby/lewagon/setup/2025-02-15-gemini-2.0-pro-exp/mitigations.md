# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for lewagon/setup

## Mitigation Strategy: [Thorough Code Review and Vetting of `setup` Scripts](./mitigation_strategies/thorough_code_review_and_vetting_of__setup__scripts.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain the Scripts:** Before execution, obtain a local copy of the `lewagon/setup` repository's shell scripts (`.sh` files).
    2.  **Open in a Text Editor:** Use a text editor or IDE with syntax highlighting.
    3.  **Line-by-Line Analysis:** Examine each line, focusing on:
        *   External Commands: (`curl`, `wget`, `apt-get`, `gem install`).
        *   URLs and Sources: Verify URLs are official and trusted.
        *   Hardcoded Values: Look for (and remove) any hardcoded credentials.
        *   System Modifications: Identify commands that modify system settings.
        *   Unknown Commands: Research any unfamiliar commands.
    4.  **Document Findings:** Note any potential issues.
    5.  **Collaborative Review (Recommended):** Have another developer review.
    6.  **Address Concerns:** Modify scripts or contact maintainers before execution.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (High Severity):** Reduces risk of executing malicious code.
    *   **Configuration Errors (Medium Severity):** Identifies potentially insecure configurations.
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information (High Severity):** Prevents hardcoded credentials.
    *   **Execution of Unintended Commands (Medium Severity):** Ensures only intended commands are run.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Configuration Errors:** Moderately reduces risk.
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Eliminates risk of hardcoded credentials.
    *   **Execution of Unintended Commands:** Eliminates risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented (depends on individual developer habits).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No formal code review process is mandated or documented in `lewagon/setup`. A checklist/guide would help.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pinning Dependencies and Using Checksums (within the Scripts)](./mitigation_strategies/pinning_dependencies_and_using_checksums__within_the_scripts_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Fork or Copy:** Fork the repository or copy relevant script sections.
    2.  **Identify Dependencies:** Analyze scripts to list all software being installed.
    3.  **Determine Specific Versions:** Research desired, stable versions of each dependency.
    4.  **Modify Installation Commands:** Update commands to specify *exact* versions:
        *   `apt-get install ruby=2.7.4-1` (not `apt-get install ruby`)
        *   `gem install rails -v 6.1.4` (not `gem install rails`)
    5.  **Obtain Checksums:** Get official checksums (SHA256, etc.) for downloaded files.
    6.  **Integrate Checksum Verification:** Add commands to verify checksums *before* installation:
        ```bash
        wget https://example.com/somefile.tar.gz
        echo "expected_checksum  somefile.tar.gz" | sha256sum -c -
        ```
    7.  **Test Thoroughly:** Test modified scripts in an isolated environment.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents installation of compromised packages.
    *   **Outdated Components (Medium Severity):** Uses known-good versions.
    *   **Inconsistent Environments (Low Severity):** Promotes reproducible environments.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Outdated Components:** Eliminates risk (if pinned versions are chosen well).
    *   **Inconsistent Environments:** Greatly improves consistency.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented in the base `lewagon/setup` repository.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `lewagon/setup` scripts install latest versions without specifying versions or checksums. This needs to be added to a forked/modified version.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Modify Scripts for Secure Environment Variable Handling](./mitigation_strategies/modify_scripts_for_secure_environment_variable_handling.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Variables:**  Find all environment variables in the scripts containing sensitive data.
    2.  **Remove Hardcoded Values:**  *Delete* any instances where sensitive values are directly written in the scripts.
    3.  **Replace with Variable References:**  Use standard environment variable syntax (e.g., `$API_KEY`, `${DATABASE_PASSWORD}`) in place of the hardcoded values.
    4.  **Document Required Variables:**  Create clear documentation (e.g., a `README` section or comments within the scripts) listing all the required environment variables and their purpose.  This documentation should *not* include the actual values.
    5. **Provide Instructions for Setting Variables:** Clearly explain *how* users should set these variables (using `.env` files, system environment, or a secrets manager â€“ *outside* of the scripts themselves).  Emphasize *not* committing `.env` files.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information (High Severity):** Prevents credentials from being stored in the scripts.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Eliminates the risk of hardcoded credentials within the setup scripts.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. `lewagon/setup` mentions `.env` files, but doesn't fully enforce their use *within the scripts themselves*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The scripts should be refactored to *completely* remove any hardcoded sensitive values and rely *entirely* on environment variables, with clear documentation on how to set those variables securely *outside* the scripts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Installed Software (within the Scripts)](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_installed_software__within_the_scripts_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Installation Commands:** Examine all `apt-get install`, `gem install`, etc., commands in the scripts.
    2.  **Identify Project-Specific Needs:** Determine which packages are *absolutely essential* for *your* project.
    3.  **Comment Out/Remove Unnecessary Installations:**  In your forked/copied scripts, comment out or delete the installation commands for any packages you don't need.
    4.  **Test After Modification:**  Thoroughly test the modified scripts to ensure your development environment still works.
    5.  **Document Changes:**  Keep notes on what was removed and why.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Attack Surface Reduction (Medium Severity):** Reduces potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Attack Surface Reduction:** Moderately reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented in `lewagon/setup`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The scripts install a broad set of tools.  Users need to actively customize the scripts (in a fork/copy) to remove unnecessary components.  The documentation could encourage this.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Audit and Update Forked/Copied Scripts](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_audit_and_update_forkedcopied_scripts.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Schedule:** Determine a regular schedule (e.g., monthly).
    2.  **Monitor Original Repository:** Check the original `lewagon/setup` repository for updates.
    3.  **Review Changes:** Carefully review changes, paying attention to:
        *   Security Patches
        *   New Dependencies
        *   Script Improvements
    4.  **Merge Relevant Changes:** Carefully merge relevant changes into your forked/copied version.
    5.  **Test After Merging:** Thoroughly test the updated scripts.
    6.  **Document Updates:** Keep a record of updates.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Outdated Components (Medium Severity):** Keeps the environment up-to-date.
    *   **New Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Addresses potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Outdated Components:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **New Vulnerabilities:** Moderately reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented as a formal process.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Documentation should emphasize ongoing maintenance and updating of forked scripts.
