# Attack Surface Analysis for lewagon/setup

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/outdated_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Ruby gems, Node.js packages, or system-level libraries defined within the setup files.
*   **How `setup` Contributes:** The `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`, `package.json`, `yarn.lock`, and `Dockerfile` (if present) *directly* define the project's initial dependencies. `lewagon/setup` may include older versions or not enforce strict version pinning at the time of project creation.
*   **Example:** An outdated version of the `rack` gem (used by Rails) with a known denial-of-service vulnerability is specified in the `Gemfile` generated by `setup`.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High** (depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Immediately after using `lewagon/setup`, run `bundle update`, `npm update`, or `yarn upgrade` to update dependencies to the latest compatible versions.
    *   Use dependency vulnerability scanners (e.g., `bundler-audit`, `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, Dependabot) and address reported issues promptly.
    *   Consider pinning dependencies to specific, known-safe versions, especially for critical libraries.
    *   If using Docker, update the base image specified in the `Dockerfile` to a recent, secure version.
    *   Remove unnecessary development dependencies before deploying to production.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Development Tools](./attack_surfaces/exposed_development_tools.md)

*   **Description:** Development-only tools (debuggers, test frameworks) are included in the project's dependency lists without proper separation.
*   **How `setup` Contributes:** `lewagon/setup` might include these tools by default in the project's `Gemfile` or `package.json` without clearly distinguishing between development and production dependencies *within the generated files*.
*   **Example:** The `pry-byebug` gem (a Ruby debugger) is listed in the main section of the `Gemfile` (not within a `group :development` block), making it likely to be included in production.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, code execution, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Immediately after using `lewagon/setup`, *manually* edit the `Gemfile` and `package.json` to move development-only tools into appropriate `group :development` blocks (Ruby) or `devDependencies` sections (Node.js).
    *   Use environment variables (e.g., `RAILS_ENV`, `NODE_ENV`) to conditionally load dependencies.
    *   Review the production build process to ensure development tools are excluded.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Template configuration files provided by the setup contain weak defaults.
*   **How `setup` Contributes:** `lewagon/setup` *directly* provides template configuration files (e.g., `config/database.yml`, `.env.example`) that may contain insecure default values or comments suggesting insecure practices.
*   **Example:** The `config/database.yml` file generated by `setup` uses the default PostgreSQL username (`postgres`) and suggests a blank or easily guessable password in comments.  The `.env.example` file might contain placeholder API keys that are not strong or unique.
*   **Impact:** Database compromise, data breach, unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Immediately after using `lewagon/setup`, *manually* review and modify all generated configuration files.
    *   **Never** use default passwords or API keys. Generate strong, unique credentials.
    *   Remove any comments suggesting insecure practices.
    *   Use environment variables to manage sensitive configuration settings, and *do not* commit the `.env` file.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege.

## Attack Surface: [Rails Secret Key Base (Initial Generation)](./attack_surfaces/rails_secret_key_base__initial_generation_.md)

*   **Description:** The initial `secret_key_base` generated by the setup process might be weak or predictable if the setup script itself has flaws.  (This is less likely with a well-maintained project like `lewagon/setup`, but still a theoretical direct contribution).
*   **How `setup` Contributes:** `lewagon/setup` is *directly* responsible for generating the initial `secret_key_base` for the Rails application.
*   **Example:** (Hypothetical) If the `setup` script used a weak random number generator, the generated `secret_key_base` could be predictable.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Immediately after using `lewagon/setup`, *regenerate* the `secret_key_base` using a strong, cryptographically secure random number generator (e.g., `rails secret`).
    *   **Never** commit the `secret_key_base` to the Git repository.
    *   Store it securely in environment variables.
    *   Regularly rotate the key.

## Attack Surface: [Docker Image Vulnerabilities (If Dockerfile is Provided)](./attack_surfaces/docker_image_vulnerabilities__if_dockerfile_is_provided_.md)

* **Description:** The `Dockerfile` provided by the setup specifies a vulnerable base image or insecure build steps.
* **How `setup` Contributes:** If `lewagon/setup` includes a `Dockerfile`, it *directly* defines the base image and the commands used to build the application's container.
* **Example:** The `Dockerfile` uses an outdated version of `ruby:2.7-slim` as its base image, which contains known vulnerabilities.
* **Impact:** Code execution, container escape, host system compromise.
* **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Immediately after using `lewagon/setup`, *manually* update the `FROM` instruction in the `Dockerfile` to use a recent, secure version of the base image.
    *   Review all commands in the `Dockerfile` to ensure they follow security best practices (e.g., avoid installing unnecessary packages, run as a non-root user).
    *   Use a Docker image vulnerability scanner (Trivy, Clair, Docker Scan) before deploying the image.
