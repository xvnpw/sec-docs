# Threat Model Analysis for lewagon/setup

## Threat: [Upstream Repository Compromise (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/upstream_repository_compromise__supply_chain_attack_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the `lewagon/setup` GitHub repository. The attacker injects malicious code into the setup scripts *before* they are downloaded and executed by the user. This code could do anything from installing backdoors, stealing credentials, to deploying ransomware. This is a direct threat because the user is executing compromised code *from* the setup process.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker could gain full control over the developer's machine. Data theft, system destruction, and lateral movement are all possible.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `lewagon/setup` repository, including all scripts and configuration files within it (e.g., `setup.sh`, `macOS/setup`, `ubuntu/setup`, dotfiles). This is *directly* the setup scripts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Fork and Maintain:** Fork the `lewagon/setup` repository into a private, controlled repository. Thoroughly review *all* code before merging any upstream changes. This is the most effective mitigation.
        *   **Pin to Commit Hash:** Use a specific, audited commit hash. Regularly review and update the pinned commit after careful inspection. Example: `git clone --branch <commit_hash> https://github.com/lewagon/setup.git`.
        *   **Code Review (Difficult but Important):** Attempt to review the code of the `lewagon/setup` repository before each use. Look for obfuscated code, unusual network connections, or modifications to system security settings.
        *   **Monitor for Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security notifications for the repository.
        *   **Checksum Verification (If Provided):** If the repository provides checksums, verify the downloaded files against these checksums *before* execution. *Strongly encourage the maintainers to provide this.*

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack During Download](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_during_download.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the network traffic between the developer's machine and GitHub *during* the `lewagon/setup` download. The attacker modifies the downloaded scripts *in transit*, injecting malicious code *before* they are executed. This is a direct threat because the compromised code is executed as part of the setup process.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, similar to the upstream compromise. Data theft and lateral movement are likely.
    *   **Affected Component:** The downloaded scripts from the `lewagon/setup` repository (e.g., `setup.sh`, individual OS-specific scripts). This is *directly* the setup scripts being downloaded.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Checksum Verification (Essential):** The `lewagon/setup` repository *must* provide checksums (e.g., SHA-256) for the scripts. The user *must* verify these checksums *before* executing the scripts. This is the primary defense.
        *   **VPN Usage:** Use a trusted VPN during the setup process, especially on untrusted networks.
        *   **Trusted Network:** Perform the setup on a known, trusted network.
        *   **Manual Script Inspection:** Before running any downloaded script, carefully inspect its contents.

## Threat: [Unintentional Exposure of Sensitive Information (During Setup)](./threats/unintentional_exposure_of_sensitive_information__during_setup_.md)

*   **Description:** The `lewagon/setup` scripts themselves, *during their execution*, might prompt the user for sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) and then store this information insecurely, such as in a plainly readable configuration file or in shell history. This is a *direct* threat if the script itself handles the sensitive data insecurely.
    *   **Impact:** Credential theft, unauthorized access to services.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The `lewagon/setup` scripts themselves, and any configuration files they directly modify or create *during the initial setup process*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Script Review:** Carefully review the `lewagon/setup` scripts *before* running them to identify how they handle sensitive information. Look for any instances where they might be storing credentials insecurely.
        *   **Avoid Prompts:** If the scripts prompt for sensitive information, consider modifying them to use environment variables or a secrets management tool instead.
        *   **Immediate Remediation:** If sensitive information *is* stored insecurely by the scripts, immediately remove it and rotate the affected credentials.
        * **Provide secure input:** If the script asks for sensitive information, make sure that the input is not stored in shell history.
