# Threat Model Analysis for lewagon/setup

## Threat: [Malicious Repository Takeover](./threats/malicious_repository_takeover.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the `lewagon/setup` GitHub repository and modifies the script to inject malicious code. This could include backdoors, malware installers, or data exfiltration tools. When developers run the compromised script, their machines become infected.
*   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of developer machines. Data breaches from compromised developer environments. Supply chain attacks targeting applications built in these environments. Loss of trust in the setup process and potentially the development organization.
*   **Affected Component:** `lewagon/setup` script (entire script)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Verify repository integrity by checking commit history for suspicious changes.
    *   Perform manual code review of the script before execution, especially after updates.
    *   Use specific commit hashes or tagged releases instead of the latest version.
    *   Monitor the `lewagon/setup` repository for unusual activity.

## Threat: [Compromised Download Source](./threats/compromised_download_source.md)

*   **Description:** The `lewagon/setup` script downloads additional files or scripts from external sources. An attacker compromises these external sources to serve malicious files instead of legitimate ones. When the script downloads and executes these compromised files, developer machines are infected.
*   **Impact:** Similar to Malicious Repository Takeover, leading to compromised developer machines and potential downstream attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Download mechanism within `lewagon/setup` script, external download sources.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Verify all external download sources used by the script are reputable and use HTTPS.
    *   Implement checksum verification for downloaded files within the script.
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all downloads to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Threat: [Installation of Vulnerable Software Packages](./threats/installation_of_vulnerable_software_packages.md)

*   **Description:** The `lewagon/setup` script installs various software packages (e.g., Ruby, Node.js, databases). If the script installs outdated or vulnerable versions of these packages, the development environment starts with known security weaknesses. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities in the development environment or in applications built within it.
*   **Impact:** Vulnerable development environment. Potential exploitation of vulnerabilities during development. Risk of carrying vulnerable dependencies into deployed applications.
*   **Affected Component:** Package installation modules within `lewagon/setup` script.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the script installs the latest stable and secure versions of software packages.
    *   Implement dependency version management within the setup process.
    *   Recommend or integrate vulnerability scanning for installed packages.
    *   Verify package sources are official and trusted repositories.

## Threat: [Compromised Package Repositories (Upstream)](./threats/compromised_package_repositories__upstream_.md)

*   **Description:** Upstream package repositories used by `lewagon/setup` (e.g., RubyGems, npm, apt, yum) are compromised. Attackers inject malicious packages into these repositories. When `lewagon/setup` installs packages from these compromised repositories, it unknowingly installs malware.
*   **Impact:** Installation of malware or backdoors into the development environment, similar to Malicious Repository Takeover.
*   **Affected Component:** Package installation modules within `lewagon/setup` script, reliance on upstream repositories.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Primarily rely on official and well-maintained package repositories.
    *   Monitor security advisories related to package repositories.
    *   Utilize package manager features for package signing and verification to ensure authenticity.
