**Attack Vector:** Targeting the setup script during the download and execution phase. This is a critical point of vulnerability because the script is often executed with elevated privileges and can make significant changes to the system.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Successful compromise at this stage can lead to full control of the developer's machine.
    *   **Likelihood:** Varies depending on the specific sub-path, but overall, the initial download and execution is a vulnerable point.
    *   **Effort:** Can range from low to high depending on the specific attack (MITM lower, Repo compromise higher).
    *   **Skill Level:** Can range from medium to expert depending on the specific attack.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Can be high, especially for MITM attacks and subtle repository compromises.

    *   **Mitigation Focus:**
        *   **Secure Download:** Enforce HTTPS for script download.
        *   **Script Inspection:**  Mandate and facilitate script inspection before execution.
        *   **Source Verification:**  Strictly use and verify the official repository.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Download [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_download__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Intercepting the network traffic during the download of `setup.sh` to inject a malicious script.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Execution of a malicious script with user privileges, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium - Depends on network environment. Less likely on secure networks, more likely on public Wi-Fi or compromised networks.

    *   **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires basic networking knowledge and ability to use MITM tools.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High - Difficult for average users to detect in real-time without network monitoring tools.

    *   **Mitigation Focus:**
        *   **HTTPS Enforcement:**  Strictly enforce HTTPS for download to prevent interception.
        *   **VPN Usage:** Encourage developers to use VPNs, especially on untrusted networks.

    *   **1.1.1. Intercept HTTP Download (if fallback to HTTP) [HIGH RISK PATH]
        *   **Specific Vector:** Exploiting a fallback to HTTP download, if it exists, making interception trivial.
        *   **Increased Risk:**  HTTP download is unencrypted and easily intercepted.
        *   **Mitigation:** Eliminate any possibility of HTTP fallback. Ensure HTTPS is mandatory and enforced.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Compromised lewagon/setup Repository [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__compromised_lewagonsetup_repository__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Compromising the official `lewagon/setup` GitHub repository to inject malicious code directly into the source script.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Wide-scale compromise affecting all users who download the script after the repository is compromised.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low - GitHub has security measures, but account compromise or repository vulnerabilities are always a potential risk.
    *   **Effort:** High - Requires sophisticated attacks like social engineering, phishing, or exploiting GitHub platform vulnerabilities.
    *   **Skill Level:** High-Expert - Requires expertise in social engineering, platform-specific exploits, or potentially insider access.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-High - Difficult to detect immediately. Relies on GitHub security monitoring, community reporting, and code review processes.

    *   **Mitigation Focus:**
        *   **Repository Security:** Implement strong security practices for the repository and maintainer accounts (MFA, strong passwords, access control).
        *   **Code Review:** Rigorous code review process for all changes to `setup.sh`.
        *   **Security Audits:** Regular security audits of the repository and infrastructure.
        *   **Incident Response Plan:** Have a plan in place to quickly respond to and mitigate a repository compromise.

    *   **1.2.1. Direct Repository Compromise (GitHub Account/Repo) [HIGH RISK PATH]
        *   **Specific Vector:** Directly gaining control of maintainer accounts or exploiting vulnerabilities in the GitHub platform to modify the repository.
        *   **Increased Risk:**  Direct compromise of the official source is highly impactful and undermines trust.
        *   **Mitigation:** Focus on robust account security, platform security monitoring, and proactive vulnerability management for the repository.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise Post-Setup via Introduced Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_post-setup_via_introduced_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities introduced into the developer's environment by the `setup.sh` script after the initial setup is complete.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High - Can lead to application compromise, data breaches, or unauthorized access depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - If the setup script installs outdated software or insecure configurations, the likelihood of exploitation increases over time.
    *   **Effort:** Low - Exploits for known vulnerabilities and default configurations are often readily available and easy to use.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Exploiting known vulnerabilities and default configurations requires relatively low skill.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium - Vulnerability scanners and security audits can detect many of these issues.

    *   **Mitigation Focus:**
        *   **Tool Version Management:**  Use up-to-date and secure versions of tools. Implement a process for regular updates.
        *   **Secure Defaults:**  Configure tools with secure default settings. Avoid weak passwords or overly permissive access controls.
        *   **Configuration Hardening:**  Harden system and tool configurations to minimize the attack surface.

    *   **2.1. Vulnerable Tool Versions Installed [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]
        *   **Specific Vector:** Installing outdated versions of software (Ruby, Node.js, PostgreSQL, etc.) that contain known security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Increased Risk:** Known vulnerabilities are actively targeted by attackers and exploits are often publicly available.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Version Pinning and Updates:** Pin tool versions to stable and reasonably up-to-date releases. Provide clear instructions and mechanisms for users to update these versions easily.
            *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regularly scan the installed tool versions for known vulnerabilities.

        *   **2.1.1. Outdated Software with Known Vulnerabilities (e.g., Ruby, Node.js, PostgreSQL) [HIGH RISK PATH]
            *   **Specific Vector:**  Directly exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated software versions installed by the setup script.
            *   **Increased Risk:**  Exploits are readily available, making this a low-effort attack.
            *   **Mitigation:**  Prioritize updating software versions to patch known vulnerabilities.

    *   **2.2. Malicious Configuration Introduced [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]
        *   **Specific Vector:**  The setup script intentionally or unintentionally introduces malicious configurations, such as backdoors in dotfiles.
        *   **Increased Risk:** Malicious configurations can be persistent and stealthy, providing long-term access for attackers.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Script Review:**  Thoroughly review the setup script for any configuration changes, especially to dotfiles and system settings.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Avoid making unnecessary configuration changes. Only modify settings that are essential for the intended development environment.
            *   **Configuration Monitoring:**  Implement mechanisms to monitor and detect unauthorized changes to system configurations and dotfiles.

        *   **2.2.1. Backdoor in Dotfiles (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.) [HIGH RISK PATH]
            *   **Specific Vector:** Injecting malicious code into dotfiles that executes every time a new shell is opened, creating a persistent backdoor.
            *   **Increased Risk:** Backdoors in dotfiles are very stealthy and can provide long-term, persistent access. Detection is difficult without careful inspection.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   **Dotfile Integrity:**  Ensure the setup script does not modify dotfiles in unexpected or suspicious ways.
