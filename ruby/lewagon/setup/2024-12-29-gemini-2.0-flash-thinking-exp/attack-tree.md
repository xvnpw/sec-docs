## Threat Model: Compromising Applications Using lewagon/setup - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Compromise an application that utilizes the `lewagon/setup` project by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the setup process itself.

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

Compromise Application Using lewagon/setup [CRITICAL NODE]
* AND Compromise the Setup Process [CRITICAL NODE]
    * OR Compromise the Setup Script Itself [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Modify the Official Repository [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]
        * Man-in-the-Middle Attack During Download [HIGH-RISK PATH]
        * Distribute a Maliciously Modified Script [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    * OR Exploit Dependencies Installed by Setup [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Compromise Package Repositories [CRITICAL NODE]
    * OR Manipulate Configuration During Setup [CRITICAL NODE]
    * OR Exploit Insecure Practices Encouraged by Setup [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application Using lewagon/setup:**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node signifies a complete breach of the application's security due to vulnerabilities introduced during the setup process.

* **Compromise the Setup Process:**
    * This node represents the attacker's primary objective within the scope of this threat model. Successfully compromising the setup process allows for the introduction of vulnerabilities that can be later exploited.

* **Compromise the Setup Script Itself:**
    * This is a critical point of failure. If the setup script is compromised, any system running it will be vulnerable. This allows for widespread and potentially automated compromise.

* **Modify the Official Repository:**
    * Directly altering the official repository is a highly impactful attack. A compromised repository allows the attacker to inject malicious code directly into the source that developers trust and use.

* **Distribute a Maliciously Modified Script:**
    * Even if the official repository remains secure, distributing a modified version of the script through social engineering or other means can lead to widespread compromise if developers are tricked into using it.

* **Exploit Dependencies Installed by Setup:**
    * The setup script installs various dependencies. If these dependencies are compromised or contain vulnerabilities, the application's security is directly affected.

* **Compromise Package Repositories:**
    * While generally well-secured, a compromise of a package repository (like PyPI, npm, or RubyGems) allows attackers to inject malicious packages that will be installed by users relying on the setup script. This has a potentially very wide impact.

* **Manipulate Configuration During Setup:**
    * If an attacker can manipulate the configuration steps within the setup process, they can introduce backdoors, weaken security settings, or otherwise compromise the application's environment.

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Modify the Official Repository -> Distribute a Maliciously Modified Script:**
    * This path combines the high impact of compromising the official source with the practical method of distributing the malicious code to target developers.
        * **Modify the Official Repository:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the official repository (e.g., through compromised maintainer credentials) and injects malicious code into the setup script.
        * **Distribute a Maliciously Modified Script:** The attacker then relies on the fact that users will download and run the compromised official script, unknowingly executing the malicious code.

* **Man-in-the-Middle Attack During Download:**
    * This path exploits a vulnerability in the download process to inject malicious code.
        * **Intercept HTTP Download (if not using HTTPS exclusively):** If the setup script is downloaded over a non-HTTPS connection, an attacker on the network can intercept the download request and replace the legitimate script with a malicious one.

* **Distribute a Maliciously Modified Script:**
    * This path focuses on social engineering to bypass the official repository.
        * **Social Engineering to Run Modified Script:** An attacker creates a modified version of the setup script containing malicious code and uses social engineering tactics (e.g., phishing, fake tutorials) to trick developers into downloading and running this malicious version instead of the official one.

* **Exploit Insecure Practices Encouraged by Setup:**
    * This path highlights the risk of the setup script itself introducing vulnerabilities through insecure practices.
        * **Disable Security Features:** The setup script might disable important security features like firewalls or security tools to simplify the setup process, leaving the system vulnerable.
        * **Use Default Credentials:** The setup script might install services with default, well-known credentials, making them easy targets for attackers.
        * **Overly Permissive File Permissions:** The setup script might set overly permissive file permissions on critical files or directories, allowing unauthorized access or modification.
