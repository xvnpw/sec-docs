Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve `lewagon/setup`:

*   **Threat:** Compromised `lewagon/setup` Script
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the `lewagon/setup` repository or the distribution mechanism of the script and injects malicious code. When developers run the compromised script, the malicious code is executed with their privileges, potentially installing malware, modifying system configurations, or stealing credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the developer's machine, potential for widespread impact if the compromised script is used by many developers.
    *   **Affected Component:** The main `lewagon/setup` script itself and any files it downloads or executes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Obtain the `lewagon/setup` script from the official and trusted repository (https://github.com/lewagon/setup).
        *   Verify the integrity of the downloaded script (e.g., by comparing checksums if provided by the maintainers).
        *   Review the script's content before execution to understand what it does.
        *   Run the script in a sandboxed environment or virtual machine for initial inspection.

*   **Threat:** Execution of Untrusted Code
    *   **Description:** The `lewagon/setup` script itself executes code with the privileges of the user running it. If the script is compromised or contains vulnerabilities, attackers could leverage this to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the developer's machine.
    *   **Affected Component:** The main `lewagon/setup` script and any external scripts it executes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review the `lewagon/setup` script before execution.
        *   Obtain the script from a trusted source.
        *   Run the script with the least necessary privileges.
        *   Use static analysis tools to scan the script for potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in the Script or Configuration
    *   **Description:** The `lewagon/setup` script or its associated configuration files might inadvertently contain sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other secrets. If these are exposed (e.g., through public repositories or insecure storage), attackers could exploit them.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, databases, or other resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `lewagon/setup` script itself and any configuration files it uses or generates.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the `lewagon/setup` script or configuration files.
        *   Use environment variables or dedicated secret management tools to handle sensitive information.
        *   Ensure that the `lewagon/setup` script and its configuration files are not accidentally committed to public repositories.
