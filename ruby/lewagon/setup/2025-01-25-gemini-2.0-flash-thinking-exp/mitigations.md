# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for lewagon/setup

## Mitigation Strategy: [Version Pinning of `lewagon/setup`](./mitigation_strategies/version_pinning_of__lewagonsetup_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Instead of using the `latest` tag or branch when referencing `lewagon/setup` in your setup scripts or documentation, identify a specific commit hash or tagged release from the official `lewagon/setup` repository on GitHub.
    2.  Replace any instances of `lewagon/setup` that use `latest` with the chosen specific commit hash or tag. For example, instead of `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/setup/latest/install.sh | bash`, use `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/setup/[COMMIT_HASH_OR_TAG]/install.sh | bash`.
    3.  Document the chosen version in your project's README or setup instructions.
    4.  Periodically review the `lewagon/setup` repository for new releases or security updates. When considering an update, thoroughly review the changes introduced in the new version before adopting it and updating the pinned version in your project.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Supply Chain Vulnerabilities & Malicious Code in `lewagon/setup` (Severity: High) - Mitigates the risk of unknowingly using a compromised or backdoored version of the setup script if the `lewagon/setup` repository itself is compromised or if a malicious update is pushed to `latest`.
    *   Unintended Software Installation & Configuration (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the risk of unexpected changes in the setup process due to automatic updates in the `latest` version, which could introduce unwanted software or configuration changes.
    *   Inconsistent Development Environments & Configuration Drift (Severity: Medium) - Ensures that all developers are using the same, tested version of the setup script, promoting consistency across development environments *during the setup phase*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Supply Chain Vulnerabilities & Malicious Code in `lewagon/setup`: Significantly Reduces risk by preventing automatic adoption of potentially malicious updates.
    *   Unintended Software Installation & Configuration: Moderately Reduces risk by ensuring predictable setup behavior.
    *   Inconsistent Development Environments & Configuration Drift: Moderately Reduces risk by promoting consistent setup across environments.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Generally **not implemented** by default when users simply follow the basic `lewagon/setup` instructions which often point to `latest`. Project teams need to consciously implement version pinning.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Project setup documentation and scripts likely use `latest` or a branch name instead of a specific commit or tag. This needs to be updated in all project-specific setup guides, READMEs, and any automated setup scripts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Review and Auditing of `lewagon/setup`](./mitigation_strategies/code_review_and_auditing_of__lewagonsetup_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Before integrating `lewagon/setup` into your project's development workflow, download the script (and any files it sources or downloads) corresponding to the pinned version (as per Mitigation Strategy 1).
    2.  Thoroughly read and understand the script's code. Pay close attention to:
        *   Commands executed with `sudo` or elevated privileges.
        *   Software packages being installed and their sources (package managers, URLs).
        *   Configuration files being downloaded or modified.
        *   Network connections being established *by the setup script*.
        *   Any potentially sensitive operations or data handling *within the setup script*.
    3.  If forking `lewagon/setup` (as recommended in advanced scenarios), establish a process for regularly auditing your forked repository against the upstream repository for changes. Review any updates from upstream before merging them into your forked version.
    4.  Document your findings from the code review, highlighting any potential security concerns or areas for customization.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Supply Chain Vulnerabilities & Malicious Code in `lewagon/setup` (Severity: High) - Allows for detection of potentially malicious code or backdoors introduced into the setup script.
    *   Unintended Software Installation & Configuration (Severity: Medium) - Helps identify and prevent the installation of unnecessary or unwanted software packages and configurations *by the setup script*.
    *   Exposure of Sensitive Information during Setup (Severity: Medium) - Can reveal if the script inadvertently handles or exposes sensitive information during the setup process.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Supply Chain Vulnerabilities & Malicious Code in `lewagon/setup`: Significantly Reduces risk by enabling proactive identification of malicious code.
    *   Unintended Software Installation & Configuration: Moderately Reduces risk by allowing for informed decisions about the installed software.
    *   Exposure of Sensitive Information during Setup: Moderately Reduces risk by identifying potential leaks of sensitive data *during setup*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Generally **not implemented** as a standard practice by most users of `lewagon/setup`. Code review requires dedicated effort and security awareness.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No formal code review process is likely in place for `lewagon/setup` within most projects using it. This should be incorporated into the project's setup and onboarding procedures.  Documented guidelines for code review of external scripts should be created.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Customization and Minimalization of `lewagon/setup`](./mitigation_strategies/customization_and_minimalization_of__lewagonsetup_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  After reviewing the `lewagon/setup` script (as per Mitigation Strategy 2), identify the essential components required for your project's development environment.
    2.  Fork the `lewagon/setup` repository.
    3.  Modify the forked script to remove any unnecessary software installations, configurations, or steps that are not directly relevant to your project's needs.
    4.  Refine the script to install only the minimum required software versions and dependencies *as part of the setup process*.
    5.  Maintain your customized, minimalized version of `lewagon/setup` in your project's repository or a dedicated internal repository.
    6.  Use this customized script for setting up development environments instead of the original, potentially more comprehensive, `lewagon/setup`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unintended Software Installation & Configuration (Severity: Medium) - Prevents the installation of unnecessary software *by the setup script*, reducing the attack surface and potential for conflicts.
    *   Outdated Software & Vulnerabilities Introduced by Installed Packages (Severity: Medium) - By controlling the software *installed by the setup script*, you can better manage and update dependencies relevant to your project *at the initial setup stage*.
    *   Inconsistent Development Environments & Configuration Drift (Severity: Medium) - Customization, when version controlled, leads to more predictable and consistent environments tailored to project needs *during setup*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unintended Software Installation & Configuration: Significantly Reduces risk by limiting the installed software footprint *during setup*.
    *   Outdated Software & Vulnerabilities Introduced by Installed Packages: Moderately Reduces risk by focusing on necessary dependencies and making updates more manageable *at setup time*.
    *   Inconsistent Development Environments & Configuration Drift: Moderately Reduces risk by creating project-specific and controlled setup.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Rarely implemented** due to the added effort of forking and customizing. Most users likely use the script as-is.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Projects are likely using the standard `lewagon/setup` without customization.  Implementing a forking and customization process would require initial effort but improve long-term security and control *over the setup process*.
