# Attack Surface Analysis for chatwoot/chatwoot

## Attack Surface: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Chat Messages](./attack_surfaces/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__in_chat_messages.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious scripts injected into chat messages are stored in the database and executed when other users view the conversation.
    *   **How Chatwoot Contributes:** Chatwoot's core functionality involves storing and displaying user-generated content (chat messages). If input sanitization and output encoding are insufficient, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a message containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When an agent views this conversation, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover of agents or other users, data exfiltration, defacement of the Chatwoot interface for other users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation on all user-provided content, especially within chat messages. Utilize context-aware output encoding when rendering messages. Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources. Regularly update Chatwoot and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities related to how Chatwoot handles file uploads, potentially allowing for malware uploads, path traversal, or access control bypass.
    *   **How Chatwoot Contributes:** Chatwoot allows users and agents to upload files as attachments within conversations.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script disguised as an image. If the server doesn't properly validate the file type and stores it in a publicly accessible directory, the attacker could execute the script. Another example is uploading a file with a manipulated filename like `../../../../evil.sh` to overwrite system files.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation based on content (magic numbers) rather than just the file extension. Store uploaded files outside the webroot and serve them through a controlled mechanism. Generate unique and unpredictable filenames. Implement antivirus scanning on uploaded files. Enforce size limits on uploads.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure API Authentication and Authorization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_api_authentication_and_authorization.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in how Chatwoot authenticates and authorizes API requests, potentially allowing unauthorized access to data or functionality.
    *   **How Chatwoot Contributes:** Chatwoot exposes APIs for various functionalities, including managing conversations, contacts, and agents.
    *   **Example:** An API endpoint lacks proper authentication, allowing anyone to retrieve a list of all contacts. Another example is using predictable API keys or tokens that can be easily guessed or brute-forced.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of data, account takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT). Enforce the principle of least privilege for API access. Thoroughly validate all API requests and parameters. Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks. Securely store and manage API keys and secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Weak default settings in Chatwoot can leave it vulnerable out-of-the-box.
    *   **How Chatwoot Contributes:** The initial setup and default configurations provided by Chatwoot can introduce security risks if not properly hardened.
    *   **Example:** Default administrative credentials that are easily guessable. Debug mode left enabled in production. Insecure default CORS settings.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, compromise of the entire application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Ensure secure default configurations are in place. Force users to change default credentials during initial setup. Provide clear guidance on security hardening steps during deployment.
