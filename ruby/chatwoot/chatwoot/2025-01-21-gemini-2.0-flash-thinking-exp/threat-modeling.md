# Threat Model Analysis for chatwoot/chatwoot

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Chat Messages](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_chat_messages.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a chat message. When an agent or another visitor views this message, the script executes in their browser. This could allow the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the interface.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the Chatwoot interface for agents or visitors, potentially compromising the security of the agent's machine or the visitor's browser.
    *   **Affected Component:** `app/javascript/modules/conversation/components/ChatMessage.vue` (rendering of chat messages), potentially backend message processing if it doesn't sanitize input.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust input sanitization on the backend before storing messages. Utilize output encoding/escaping on the frontend when rendering chat messages. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Threat: [Stored XSS in Knowledge Base Articles](./threats/stored_xss_in_knowledge_base_articles.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with access to create or edit knowledge base articles injects malicious JavaScript code into the article content. When other users view this article, the script executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to chat XSS, but persistent and affects anyone viewing the compromised knowledge base article. This could lead to widespread compromise of agent accounts or visitor browsers.
    *   **Affected Component:** Knowledge base article editor and rendering components, potentially backend storage for knowledge base content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for knowledge base content on the backend. Utilize output encoding/escaping when rendering knowledge base articles. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of File Uploads](./threats/insecure_handling_of_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., malware, a web shell) through the chat interface or knowledge base editor. If the server doesn't properly validate and store these files, the attacker could potentially execute the file on the server or trick users into downloading and executing it. Path traversal vulnerabilities during upload or retrieval could allow overwriting critical system files.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, malware distribution to agents or visitors, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** File upload handlers in the backend, storage mechanisms for uploaded files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strict validation of file types, sizes, and content on the backend. Store uploaded files outside the web root and serve them through a separate, secure mechanism. Implement antivirus scanning on uploaded files. Prevent direct execution of uploaded files.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Chat Logs](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_chat_logs.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to chat logs, which may contain sensitive customer data, internal company information, or personally identifiable information (PII). This could happen due to weak access controls, insecure storage, or vulnerabilities in the log viewing interface.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violations, reputational damage, legal repercussions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Database storage for chat conversations, log viewing interface for agents, potentially backup mechanisms for chat logs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong access controls for the database and log files. Encrypt sensitive data at rest. Regularly audit access to chat logs. Implement secure backup practices. Consider data retention policies to minimize the storage of sensitive information.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Authentication Tokens/Sessions](./threats/insecure_handling_of_authentication_tokenssessions.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in how Chatwoot generates, stores, or validates authentication tokens or user sessions could allow attackers to hijack user sessions. This could involve stealing tokens through XSS or brute-forcing weak session IDs.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to agent accounts, potentially leading to data breaches or malicious actions performed under the guise of a legitimate user.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication and session management modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Use strong, randomly generated session IDs or tokens. Securely store tokens (e.g., using HttpOnly and Secure flags for cookies). Implement session timeouts and consider using techniques like token binding.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Chatwoot's Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_chatwoot's_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Chatwoot relies on various third-party libraries and frameworks. Known vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited if Chatwoot doesn't keep them updated.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** All components relying on vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly update all dependencies to the latest stable versions. Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the Chat Widget Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_chat_widget_itself.md)

*   **Description:** The JavaScript chat widget embedded on client websites could contain vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, insecure data handling) that could be exploited to compromise the security of the host website or steal information from visitors interacting with the widget.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of websites embedding the Chatwoot widget, potential data theft from website visitors, defacement of client websites.
    *   **Affected Component:** `app/javascript/packs/widget.js` and related widget code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (impacts external websites).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Follow secure coding practices when developing the chat widget. Regularly audit the widget code for vulnerabilities. Consider using Subresource Integrity (SRI) to ensure the integrity of the widget script. Provide clear guidance to users on how to securely embed the widget.
