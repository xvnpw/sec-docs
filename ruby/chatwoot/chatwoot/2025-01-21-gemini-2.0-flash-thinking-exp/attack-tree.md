## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Web Interface Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_web_interface_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Inject malicious script via agent interface (CRITICAL NODE):** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into fields or areas within the agent interface (e.g., conversation input, notes). When another agent views this content, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies, performing actions on their behalf, or redirecting them to malicious sites.
    *   **Inject malicious script via customer widget (CRITICAL NODE):** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the customer-facing chat widget (e.g., in messages). When an agent views the conversation, the script executes in their browser, leading to similar consequences as agent-side XSS.
    *   **Stored XSS in conversation history (CRITICAL NODE):** Malicious JavaScript is stored persistently in the conversation history (e.g., injected by a compromised agent or through a vulnerability in message processing). When any user views the conversation, the script executes.
*   **Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Bypass authentication mechanisms (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers find ways to circumvent the login process without providing valid credentials. This could involve exploiting flaws in the authentication logic, using default credentials (if not changed), or exploiting vulnerabilities like insecure password reset flows.
    *   **Elevate privileges to admin (CRITICAL NODE):** An attacker with a regular user account finds a vulnerability that allows them to gain administrative privileges. This could involve exploiting flaws in role-based access control, manipulating user parameters, or exploiting insecure API endpoints related to user roles.
*   **Force admin to perform privileged actions (via CSRF) (CRITICAL NODE):** An attacker tricks an authenticated administrator into unknowingly performing actions on the attacker's behalf. This is typically done by embedding malicious requests in emails or on websites that the administrator visits while logged into the Chatwoot application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws in API (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Bypass API authentication (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers find ways to access API endpoints without providing valid API keys, tokens, or other authentication credentials. This could involve exploiting flaws in the API authentication logic or exploiting misconfigurations.
*   **Exploit Injection Flaws in API (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **SQL Injection via API parameters (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers craft malicious SQL queries within API request parameters. If the application doesn't properly sanitize these inputs, the queries are executed against the database, potentially allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data.
    *   **Command Injection via API parameters (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers inject malicious system commands into API request parameters. If the application executes these commands without proper sanitization, the attacker can gain control of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Database Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_database_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Exploit SQL Injection (if not mitigated by ORM) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Gain unauthorized access to the database (CRITICAL NODE):** If the application uses raw SQL queries or if there are vulnerabilities in the ORM usage, attackers can inject malicious SQL code to bypass authentication and directly access the database, potentially stealing sensitive information.
*   **Exploit Insecure Database Configuration (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Access database with default credentials or weak passwords (CRITICAL NODE):** If the database is configured with default credentials or weak passwords, attackers can easily gain direct access to the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Upload Functionality (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_upload_functionality__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Upload Malicious Files (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Upload executable files leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers upload malicious executable files (e.g., PHP, Python scripts) and find a way to execute them on the server. This can lead to complete server compromise.
*   **Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Access or overwrite arbitrary files on the server (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers manipulate file paths during the upload process to access or overwrite files outside the intended upload directory. This can allow them to read sensitive configuration files, overwrite application code, or even execute arbitrary code.
