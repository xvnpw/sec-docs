# Attack Surface Analysis for chatwoot/chatwoot

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Widget](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_widget.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages through vulnerabilities in the Chatwoot widget or its interaction with the Chatwoot backend. These scripts execute in the user's browser when they visit a website embedding the widget.
*   **Chatwoot Contribution:** Chatwoot provides a widget designed to be embedded on external websites. If the widget code or the Chatwoot backend processing widget-related data is vulnerable, it can become a vector for XSS attacks on websites using the widget.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a chat message or through a vulnerable widget configuration parameter. When a user visits a website with the Chatwoot widget, this malicious script executes, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Impact:** High - Can lead to account takeover, data theft, website defacement, and malware distribution on websites embedding the Chatwoot widget.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Chatwoot Team):**
        *   Rigorous input sanitization and output encoding for all user-supplied data processed by the widget and backend.
        *   Regular security audits and penetration testing of the widget code and related backend APIs.
        *   Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation to restrict the sources from which the widget can load resources and execute scripts.
    *   **Users (Chatwoot Deployers & Website Owners):**
        *   Keep Chatwoot instance and widget code updated to the latest versions.
        *   Carefully review and sanitize any custom widget configurations.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms protecting Chatwoot's API endpoints, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.
*   **Chatwoot Contribution:** Chatwoot exposes numerous API endpoints for its frontend, integrations, and potentially external access. Weaknesses in how these APIs are secured directly contribute to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the API authentication logic (e.g., a flaw in JWT verification, session management, or OAuth implementation) to gain access without valid credentials. Or, an attacker uses insecure direct object references to access resources they are not authorized to view or modify.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Can lead to complete compromise of the Chatwoot instance, including access to all customer data, conversations, system configurations, and potentially the underlying server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Chatwoot Team):**
        *   Implement robust and industry-standard authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
        *   Enforce strict authorization checks at every API endpoint to ensure users only access resources they are permitted to.
        *   Regularly review and audit API authentication and authorization code for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users (Chatwoot Deployers):**
        *   Follow secure deployment guidelines provided by Chatwoot.
        *   Regularly review user roles and permissions within Chatwoot.

## Attack Surface: [API Input Validation Vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, Command Injection)](./attack_surfaces/api_input_validation_vulnerabilities__sql_injection__command_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit insufficient input validation in Chatwoot's API endpoints to inject malicious code or commands, leading to unauthorized database access or server-side command execution.
*   **Chatwoot Contribution:** Chatwoot's API endpoints handle various types of user input. If this input is not properly validated and sanitized before being used in database queries or system commands, it creates a significant attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious SQL code into an API parameter that is used in a database query without proper sanitization. This could allow the attacker to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, modify data, or even drop tables in the database. Similarly, command injection could allow execution of arbitrary system commands on the server.
*   **Impact:** Critical - SQL Injection can lead to full database compromise, data breaches, and denial of service. Command Injection can lead to complete server takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Chatwoot Team):**
        *   Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions to prevent SQL Injection.
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize all user input at API endpoints, using whitelisting and appropriate encoding techniques.
        *   Avoid constructing system commands directly from user input.
    *   **Users (Chatwoot Deployers):**
        *   Ensure Chatwoot and its dependencies are updated to the latest versions, patching known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Attachment Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/attachment_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how Chatwoot handles file uploads and attachments to execute malicious code, serve malicious content, or gain unauthorized access to the server's file system.
*   **Chatwoot Contribution:** Chatwoot allows users to upload attachments in conversations. Improper handling of these uploads, including insufficient validation, insecure storage, or incorrect content-type handling, creates this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious web shell (e.g., a PHP script) disguised as an image. If Chatwoot does not properly validate file types or prevents direct execution of uploaded files, the attacker could access this web shell through the web server and gain code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** High - Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, stored XSS, local file inclusion, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Chatwoot Team):**
        *   Implement strict file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) and not just file extensions.
        *   Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root and serve them through a separate, controlled mechanism.
    *   **Users (Chatwoot Deployers):**
        *   Configure web server to prevent execution of scripts in the upload directory.

## Attack Surface: [Admin Panel Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/admin_panel_specific_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target vulnerabilities specifically within the Chatwoot admin panel to gain administrative privileges and control over the entire Chatwoot instance.
*   **Chatwoot Contribution:** Chatwoot's admin panel provides extensive configuration and management capabilities. Vulnerabilities within this panel are particularly critical due to the elevated privileges associated with admin accounts.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits an XSS vulnerability, CSRF vulnerability, or authentication bypass vulnerability specifically within the admin panel. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to create new admin accounts, modify system settings, access sensitive data, or even take complete control of the Chatwoot instance.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Full compromise of the Chatwoot instance, including access to all data, configurations, and potentially the underlying server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Chatwoot Team):**
        *   Prioritize security testing and hardening of the admin panel.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms specifically for admin panel access.
        *   Apply all general security best practices (input validation, output encoding, etc.) rigorously within the admin panel code.
    *   **Users (Chatwoot Deployers):**
        *   Restrict access to the admin panel to only authorized personnel.
        *   Use strong and unique passwords for admin accounts.
