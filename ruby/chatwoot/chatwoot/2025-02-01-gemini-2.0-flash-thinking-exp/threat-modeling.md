*   **Affected Component:** Frontend application (Agent and Customer interfaces), Message rendering module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all message content rendered in Chatwoot interfaces.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy to restrict script sources and prevent inline script execution.
