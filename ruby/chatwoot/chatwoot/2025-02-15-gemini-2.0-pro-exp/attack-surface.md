# Attack Surface Analysis for chatwoot/chatwoot

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Customer Input](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_customer_input.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious JavaScript into the agent interface through user-supplied content.
    *   **Chatwoot Contribution:** Chatwoot's core function is handling user input from various channels (website, email, social media), making it inherently susceptible to XSS if sanitization is flawed.  This is a *direct* consequence of Chatwoot's functionality.
    *   **Example:** A customer sends a message containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` through the website widget. If not properly sanitized, this script executes in the agent's browser.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Session hijacking of agent accounts.
        *   Redirection to malicious websites.
        *   Data theft (cookies, local storage).
        *   Defacement of the agent interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust, context-aware output encoding (escaping) for *all* user-supplied data displayed in the agent interface.  Use a well-vetted sanitization library.
            *   Enforce a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
            *   Regularly review and test input validation and sanitization logic, especially for new features or integrations.
            *   Sanitize data at the point of entry *and* at the point of display (defense in depth).
            *   Consider using a framework that provides built-in XSS protection.
        *   **Users (Administrators):**
            *   Ensure Chatwoot is kept up-to-date to receive the latest security patches.
            *   If file uploads are enabled, restrict file types to safe formats and implement strict MIME type validation.
            *   Monitor agent activity for suspicious behavior.

## Attack Surface: [API Endpoint Abuse](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoint_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Chatwoot's API endpoints.
    *   **Chatwoot Contribution:** Chatwoot *itself* exposes a comprehensive API for various functionalities, creating this attack surface directly.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers an unauthenticated API endpoint that allows listing all agent accounts and their details.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breaches (customer data, agent information).
        *   Unauthorized modification of data (conversations, settings).
        *   Denial of service.
        *   Privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for *all* API endpoints. Use industry-standard authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
            *   Enforce rate limiting to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.
            *   Validate all input parameters to API endpoints.
            *   Follow the principle of least privilege.
            *   Implement robust error handling that does *not* leak sensitive information.
            *   Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing of the API.
        *   **Users (Administrators):**
            *   If possible, restrict API access to specific IP addresses or networks.
            *   Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation within the Dashboard](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation_within_the_dashboard.md)

*   **Description:** A low-privileged agent gaining unauthorized access to higher-level functions or data.
    *   **Chatwoot Contribution:** This is entirely dependent on the implementation of Chatwoot's role-based access control (RBAC) system.  The vulnerability exists *within* Chatwoot.
    *   **Example:** A "support agent" discovers a way to modify their own role to "administrator" through a vulnerable API endpoint or by manipulating client-side code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Full system compromise.
        *   Data breaches.
        *   Unauthorized configuration changes.
        *   Account takeovers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Thoroughly test the RBAC system.
            *   Implement server-side authorization checks for *all* actions.
            *   Avoid using hidden form fields or URL parameters to store sensitive permission data.
            *   Regularly review and audit the RBAC implementation.
        *   **Users (Administrators):**
            *   Carefully assign roles and permissions to agents, following the principle of least privilege.
            *   Regularly review agent accounts and their assigned roles.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in Agent/Team Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__in_agentteam_management.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to or modification of other agents' or teams' data by manipulating identifiers.
    *   **Chatwoot Contribution:** This vulnerability stems directly from how Chatwoot handles access control for agent and team data.
    *   **Example:** An agent changes the URL from `/agents/1/edit` to `/agents/2/edit` and gains access to edit another agent's profile.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized modification of agent accounts (passwords, roles).
        *   Information disclosure (agent details, team assignments).
        *   Account takeovers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust authorization checks. Do *not* rely solely on object IDs for authorization.
            *   Use indirect object references.
            *   Regularly test for IDOR vulnerabilities.
        *   **Users (Administrators):**
            *   Monitor agent activity for suspicious access patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Webhook Security Issues](./attack_surfaces/webhook_security_issues.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Chatwoot's webhook handling.
    *   **Chatwoot Contribution:** Chatwoot's *use* of webhooks for event notifications creates these potential attack vectors. The security of the webhook implementation is entirely Chatwoot's responsibility.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends forged webhook requests to trigger unintended actions or gain access to sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized actions (e.g., creating conversations, modifying data).
        *   Data breaches.
        *   Denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strong authentication for all webhook endpoints (e.g., using HMAC signatures, API keys).
            *   Validate the source of webhook requests (e.g., using IP whitelisting, verifying signatures).
            *   Validate and sanitize all data received from webhooks.
            *   Implement replay protection.
            *   Use HTTPS for all webhook communication.
            *   Avoid logging sensitive data received from webhooks.
        *   **Users (Administrators):**
            *   Configure webhook security settings appropriately.
            *   Monitor webhook activity for suspicious requests.
