# Threat Model Analysis for chatwoot/chatwoot

## Threat: [SQL Injection in Conversation Search](./threats/sql_injection_in_conversation_search.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious search query within the Chatwoot interface or API that exploits a vulnerability in the SQL query used to retrieve conversation history.  The attacker could potentially extract data from the database, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server. This directly exploits a vulnerability *within* Chatwoot's code.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete database compromise, data exfiltration, data modification, potential system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `app/models/conversation.rb` (specifically, functions related to searching conversations, likely involving ActiveRecord queries), potentially database adapter.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure *all* user-supplied input used in database queries is properly parameterized or escaped using ActiveRecord's built-in mechanisms.  Avoid string concatenation for building SQL queries.
        *   Implement strict input validation to reject any input containing suspicious characters or patterns (e.g., SQL keywords).
        *   Regularly review and audit the code responsible for handling conversation searches.
        *   Use a database user with limited privileges (least privilege principle).

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Agent Notes](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_agent_notes.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, either a malicious agent or an external attacker who has compromised an agent account, inserts malicious JavaScript code into an agent note.  When another agent views the note, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing their session cookies, redirecting them to a phishing site, or performing actions on their behalf. This is a direct vulnerability in how Chatwoot handles user-supplied content.
    *   **Impact:**  Agent account compromise, session hijacking, potential access to sensitive data, defacement.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `app/views/shared/_notes.html.erb` (or similar view templates rendering agent notes), `app/models/note.rb` (if content sanitization is not performed before saving), potentially related controllers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust output encoding (escaping) of all user-supplied content displayed in agent notes.  Use Rails' built-in helpers (e.g., `h()`, `sanitize()`) appropriately.  `sanitize()` should be used with a very restrictive whitelist.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) that restricts the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
        *   Sanitize input *before* saving it to the database, in addition to output encoding.
        *   Educate agents about the risks of XSS and to be wary of unusual content in notes.

## Threat: [Broken Access Control in API for Message Creation](./threats/broken_access_control_in_api_for_message_creation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers that the Chatwoot API endpoint for creating new messages (`/api/v1/accounts/{account_id}/conversations/{conversation_id}/messages`) does not properly enforce authorization checks.  The attacker could potentially send messages on behalf of any user or agent, or to conversations they should not have access to. This is a direct flaw in Chatwoot's API authorization logic.
    *   **Impact:**  Impersonation of users or agents, unauthorized message injection, potential spam or phishing attacks, data integrity violation.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `app/controllers/api/v1/messages_controller.rb` (specifically the `create` action), potentially related authorization logic (e.g., Pundit policies).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks in the `create` action of the `MessagesController` to ensure that the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to create messages in the specified conversation.  Use Pundit or a similar authorization framework consistently.
        *   Verify that the user ID associated with the API request matches the intended sender of the message.
        *   Implement rate limiting on the API endpoint to prevent abuse.
        *   Regularly audit the API authorization logic.

## Threat: [File Upload Vulnerability in Attachments](./threats/file_upload_vulnerability_in_attachments.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a script disguised as an image) through the Chatwoot file attachment feature.  If Chatwoot does not properly validate and sanitize the uploaded file, the attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server or perform a client-side attack (e.g., XSS) if the file is served directly to other users. This is a direct vulnerability in Chatwoot's file handling mechanism.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution (RCE), server compromise, client-side attacks (XSS), data exfiltration.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `app/controllers/api/v1/messages_controller.rb` (attachment handling logic), `app/models/attachment.rb`, potentially the storage service integration (e.g., Active Storage configuration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file type validation, allowing only a limited set of safe file types (e.g., images, PDFs).  Validate based on file content, *not* just file extension.
        *   Store uploaded files outside of the web root to prevent direct execution.
        *   Use a secure file storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage) with appropriate security configurations.
        *   Rename uploaded files to prevent predictable filenames.
        *   Scan uploaded files for malware using a virus scanner.
        *   Serve files with appropriate `Content-Type` and `Content-Disposition` headers to prevent browser misinterpretation.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Conversation Access](./threats/insecure_direct_object_reference__idor__in_conversation_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the conversation ID in a Chatwoot URL or API request to access a conversation they should not have access to.  This occurs if Chatwoot does not properly check if the authenticated user is authorized to view the specified conversation. This is a direct flaw in Chatwoot's authorization logic.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive conversation data, privacy violation.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `app/controllers/api/v1/conversations_controller.rb` (and potentially other controllers handling conversation access), authorization logic (e.g., Pundit policies).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks in all controllers and API endpoints that handle conversation access.  Ensure that the authenticated user is associated with the requested conversation (e.g., as a participant or an authorized agent).
        *   Use Pundit or a similar authorization framework consistently.
        *   Avoid exposing internal database IDs directly in URLs or API responses.  Consider using UUIDs or other non-sequential identifiers.
