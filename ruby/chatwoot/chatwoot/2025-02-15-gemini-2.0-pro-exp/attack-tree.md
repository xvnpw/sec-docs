## Attack Tree Path: [1. Data Exfiltration [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__data_exfiltration__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.1.1.1 Bypass Chatwoot's sanitization logic for search queries. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts malicious SQL queries that bypass Chatwoot's input sanitization, allowing them to directly query the database and extract sensitive information.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation using parameterized queries or prepared statements.  Thoroughly test and fuzz the search functionality.

*   **1.1.2.1 Bypass authentication/authorization checks for conversation API endpoints. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker accesses Chatwoot's API endpoints without proper authentication or authorization, gaining access to all conversation data.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:** Enforce strict authentication and authorization for all API endpoints.  Implement robust session management.

*   **1.1.2.2 Exploit API vulnerabilities (e.g., IDOR) to access conversations belonging to other users/accounts. [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker manipulates API parameters (e.g., conversation IDs) to access conversations they are not authorized to view.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict authorization checks on all API endpoints, verifying that the user has permission to access the requested resource.  Test thoroughly for IDOR vulnerabilities.

*   **1.1.4.1 Use webhooks to make requests to internal resources or external services, leaking data. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker configures a malicious webhook that, when triggered, causes Chatwoot to make requests to internal or external services, potentially exposing sensitive data or internal network information.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:** Validate and restrict the URLs that can be used for webhooks.  Implement a whitelist of allowed domains.  Monitor network traffic for suspicious requests.

*   **1.2.2.1 Upload executable files (e.g., web shells) disguised as images or documents. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a PHP web shell) disguised as a legitimate file type, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:** Strictly validate file types based on content, not just extensions.  Store uploaded files outside the web root.  Use a whitelist of allowed file types.  Scan uploaded files with antivirus software.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Account Takeover (Agent/Admin) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__account_takeover__agentadmin___high_risk_.md)

*   **2.1.1 Exploit weak password policies or lack of rate limiting on login attempts. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker uses automated tools to guess passwords or perform credential stuffing attacks, exploiting weak password requirements or the absence of rate limiting.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, uniqueness).  Implement account lockout or rate limiting after a certain number of failed login attempts.  Consider multi-factor authentication.

*   **2.2.1 Exploit insecure session management (e.g., predictable session IDs, lack of HttpOnly/Secure flags on cookies). [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker steals or predicts a user's session ID, allowing them to impersonate the user and gain access to their account.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:** Use strong, randomly generated session IDs.  Set `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies.  Implement session expiration and invalidation.

*  **2.4.1 Misconfigured OAuth provider settings. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:**  If Chatwoot is integrated with an OAuth provider (like Google, GitHub, etc.), misconfigurations in the provider settings could allow an attacker to bypass authentication or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**  Carefully review and follow the security best practices for the chosen OAuth provider.  Regularly audit the configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. System Compromise (Server-Side)](./attack_tree_paths/3__system_compromise__server-side_.md)

*   **3.1.2 Exploit vulnerabilities in Chatwoot's custom code (e.g., unsafe use of `eval`, `system` calls). [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Chatwoot's code, such as unsafe use of dynamic code execution functions, to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:** Avoid using dynamic code execution functions (`eval`, `system`, etc.) whenever possible.  If necessary, use them with extreme caution and rigorous input validation.  Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits.

*   **3.1.4.1 Send crafted WebSocket messages to trigger unexpected behavior or code execution. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker sends specially crafted messages over Chatwoot's WebSocket connection (ActionCable) to exploit vulnerabilities and potentially execute code on the server.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

*   **5.1.1.1 Bypass Chatwoot's XSS sanitization mechanisms. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into conversation messages, agent profiles, or other stored data, which is then executed in the browsers of other users.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
