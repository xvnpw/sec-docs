# Threat Model Analysis for chatwoot/chatwoot

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Conversation Messages](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_conversation_messages.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a conversation message (as a customer or compromised agent). When another agent views this message in the agent dashboard, the script executes in their browser. This could allow the attacker to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the agent, or redirect them to a malicious site.

**Impact:** Agent account compromise, data theft, unauthorized actions, potential spread of malware within the organization.

**Affected Component:** Conversation Handling (specifically message rendering in the agent dashboard).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict input sanitization and output encoding for all user-generated content displayed in the agent dashboard.
*   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
*   Regularly update Chatwoot and its dependencies to patch known XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload via Attachments](./threats/malicious_file_upload_via_attachments.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., malware, virus) as an attachment in a conversation. If an agent downloads and executes this file, their system could be compromised.

**Impact:** Agent workstation compromise, data loss, malware propagation within the organization's network.

**Affected Component:** File Upload Functionality within the Conversation Handling module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust server-side file validation to restrict allowed file types.
*   Integrate with an antivirus scanning engine to scan all uploaded files.
*   Store uploaded files in a secure location with restricted access and prevent direct execution from the storage location.
*   Educate agents about the risks of downloading attachments from unknown or suspicious sources.

## Threat: [Exploiting Markdown Parsing Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_markdown_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious markdown code within a conversation message that exploits vulnerabilities in the markdown parsing library used by Chatwoot. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or information disclosure on the server or client-side.

**Impact:** Server compromise, agent workstation compromise, information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** Markdown Rendering Engine used in Conversation Handling.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Use a well-maintained and actively patched markdown parsing library.
*   Regularly update the markdown parsing library to the latest version.
*   Consider sandboxing the markdown rendering process.

## Threat: [Agent Impersonation through Session Hijacking](./threats/agent_impersonation_through_session_hijacking.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to a valid agent's session ID (e.g., through XSS or network sniffing). They can then use this session ID to impersonate the agent and access the Chatwoot dashboard, view conversations, and potentially take actions on behalf of the agent.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to manipulate conversations, potential damage to customer relationships.

**Affected Component:** Agent Authentication and Session Management.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement secure session management practices, including using HTTPOnly and Secure flags for cookies.
*   Implement session timeouts and regular session invalidation.
*   Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for agent accounts.
*   Protect against XSS vulnerabilities (as mentioned above) which can facilitate session hijacking.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via RBAC Vulnerabilities](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_rbac_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Chatwoot's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to gain access to functionalities or data they are not authorized to access. For example, a standard agent might gain administrative privileges.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to modify system configurations, potential for complete system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly test and audit the RBAC implementation to ensure proper privilege separation.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles to users.
*   Regularly review and update user roles and permissions.

## Threat: [API Key Compromise Leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/api_key_compromise_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to API keys used for integrating Chatwoot with other services. They can then use these keys to access Chatwoot data or perform actions on behalf of the organization without proper authorization.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, potential abuse of integrated services.

**Affected Component:** API Integration Module and API Key Management.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Store API keys securely (e.g., using environment variables or a secrets management system).
*   Implement proper access controls and authentication for API endpoints.
*   Regularly rotate API keys.
*   Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Insecure OAuth Implementation in Integrations](./threats/insecure_oauth_implementation_in_integrations.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in Chatwoot's OAuth implementation for connecting with external platforms could allow attackers to intercept authorization codes or tokens, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts on connected platforms or potentially accessing data from those platforms within Chatwoot.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to third-party accounts, data breaches on connected platforms.

**Affected Component:** OAuth Client Implementation within the Integrations module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Follow secure OAuth implementation best practices.
*   Properly validate redirect URIs.
*   Use state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks during the OAuth flow.
*   Regularly update the libraries used for OAuth implementation.

## Threat: [Data Breach due to Insufficient Data Encryption](./threats/data_breach_due_to_insufficient_data_encryption.md)

**Description:** Sensitive conversation data, customer information, or other stored data is not properly encrypted at rest or in transit. If the database or storage system is compromised, this data could be easily accessed by attackers.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive customer and business data, legal and regulatory repercussions.

**Affected Component:** Data Storage and Retrieval Mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Encrypt sensitive data at rest using strong encryption algorithms.
*   Enforce HTTPS for all communication to encrypt data in transit.
*   Properly manage encryption keys and access controls.
