# Attack Surface Analysis for chatwoot/chatwoot

## Attack Surface: [Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in Chat Messages](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities_in_chat_messages.md)

**Description:** Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in Chat Messages
*   **How Chatwoot Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Chatwoot's core functionality involves rendering user-generated content within chat messages from both agents and customers. Insufficient input sanitization in Chatwoot's codebase directly leads to this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a message containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` which, when viewed by another user within the Chatwoot interface, executes the JavaScript code.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking of agents or other users, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites through the Chatwoot interface, defacement of the chat interface, and potentially more severe actions depending on the targeted user's privileges within Chatwoot.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding specifically within Chatwoot's message rendering components. Utilize context-aware escaping based on where the data is being rendered (HTML, JavaScript, URL). Enforce Content Security Policy (CSP) within the Chatwoot application to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/malicious_file_uploads.md)

**Description:** Malicious File Uploads
*   **How Chatwoot Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Chatwoot allows users (both agents and sometimes customers) to upload files directly through its interface. The lack of proper validation and handling of these uploads within Chatwoot's backend creates this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image via the Chatwoot file upload feature. If Chatwoot's server is not configured to prevent execution in the upload directory, this script could be executed, granting the attacker remote access.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Chatwoot server, potentially compromising the entire instance. Serving malware to other Chatwoot users who download the file. Storage exhaustion on the Chatwoot server leading to denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation within Chatwoot's upload handling logic based on content (magic numbers) rather than just file extensions. Configure Chatwoot to store uploaded files outside the webroot. Integrate Chatwoot with a dedicated storage service (like AWS S3) with appropriate access controls. Implement malware scanning of uploaded files within the Chatwoot application flow. Generate unique and unpredictable filenames within Chatwoot's file storage mechanism.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_weaknesses.md)

**Description:** API Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses
*   **How Chatwoot Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Chatwoot provides an API for programmatic access to its features. Vulnerabilities in Chatwoot's API authentication (verifying the user's identity) or authorization (verifying what the user is allowed to do) mechanisms directly expose the application.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw in Chatwoot's API authentication to obtain an access token belonging to an administrator, allowing them to perform administrative actions like deleting conversations or modifying user roles through the API.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches affecting conversations and user data managed by Chatwoot. Unauthorized modification or deletion of data within Chatwoot. Account takeover of agents or administrators. Denial of service by abusing API endpoints.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms for Chatwoot's API (e.g., OAuth 2.0). Enforce the principle of least privilege for API access within Chatwoot's authorization framework. Thoroughly validate all API requests and parameters within the Chatwoot API endpoints. Implement rate limiting specifically for Chatwoot's API endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks. Regularly review and update Chatwoot's API security practices.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Webhooks](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_webhooks.md)

**Description:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Webhooks
*   **How Chatwoot Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Chatwoot's webhook functionality allows users to configure HTTP requests to external URLs when certain events occur within Chatwoot. Weak or missing validation of these webhook URLs within Chatwoot's configuration settings enables SSRF.
*   **Example:** An attacker configures a webhook within Chatwoot that, upon a new conversation, makes a request to an internal server within the Chatwoot hosting infrastructure (e.g., `http://localhost:6379`), potentially accessing sensitive resources like Redis.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources within the Chatwoot hosting environment. Port scanning of internal networks from the Chatwoot server. Potential for further exploitation of internal services accessible from the Chatwoot server.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict validation of webhook URLs within Chatwoot, potentially using allowlists of known safe domains or by resolving hostnames to verify they are external. Sanitize data sent in webhook payloads by Chatwoot to prevent injection vulnerabilities in the receiving application. Consider using a dedicated service for handling outbound requests initiated by Chatwoot's webhooks.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Vulnerabilities in Custom Attributes/Metadata](./attack_surfaces/injection_vulnerabilities_in_custom_attributesmetadata.md)

**Description:** Injection Vulnerabilities in Custom Attributes/Metadata
*   **How Chatwoot Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Chatwoot allows for the creation of custom attributes for contacts and conversations. If Chatwoot's code does not properly sanitize these attributes before using them in database queries or other server-side operations, injection vulnerabilities can arise.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious string in a custom attribute (e.g., `'; DROP TABLE users; --`) that, when used in a database query by Chatwoot, allows them to execute arbitrary SQL commands against Chatwoot's database.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches affecting all information stored within Chatwoot's database. Data manipulation or deletion within Chatwoot. Potential for remote code execution on the Chatwoot server depending on the context of the injection.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements within Chatwoot's database interaction code. Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all custom attributes within Chatwoot's data handling logic. Avoid dynamically constructing queries using user-provided data within Chatwoot's codebase.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Sensitive Configuration Data](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

**Description:** Insecure Handling of Sensitive Configuration Data
*   **How Chatwoot Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Chatwoot requires configuration with sensitive information like database credentials, API keys for integrations, and email server details. If Chatwoot's deployment process or configuration management stores this information insecurely, it becomes a high-value target.
*   **Example:** Database credentials for Chatwoot are stored in plain text in a configuration file within the Chatwoot installation directory, accessible due to misconfigured web server settings or a directory traversal vulnerability in Chatwoot itself.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Chatwoot instance, allowing attackers to access all data and potentially pivot to connected systems using the exposed credentials.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Document and enforce secure configuration practices for deploying Chatwoot, emphasizing the use of environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) instead of storing sensitive data in configuration files. Ensure Chatwoot's code does not inadvertently expose configuration details.
    *   **Users (Deployers):**  Follow secure deployment practices for Chatwoot, ensuring sensitive configuration data is managed securely using environment variables or secrets management solutions and that file permissions are appropriately set.
