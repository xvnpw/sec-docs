## Mitigation Strategy: [Chef Server Security Mitigations:](./mitigation_strategies/chef_server_security_mitigations.md)

### Chef Server Security Mitigations:

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Access Chef Server UI or CLI:** Log in as an administrator to the Chef Server.
        2.  **Define Roles in Chef Server:** Use the Chef Server UI or `chef-server-ctl` command-line tool to create roles with specific permissions within Chef Server's RBAC system. Define granular roles based on Chef Server resource access (nodes, cookbooks, environments, roles, data bags).
        3.  **Assign Roles to Users and Teams:**  Assign the created Chef Server roles to users and teams within the Chef Server RBAC system.
        4.  **Regularly Review and Audit Chef RBAC:** Periodically review and audit role assignments and permissions within Chef Server RBAC to ensure adherence to least privilege. Utilize Chef Server's built-in reporting and audit logs for RBAC.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Chef Server Resources (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from modifying critical Chef Server configurations, cookbooks, or node data *within the Chef ecosystem*.
        *   **Privilege Escalation within Chef Server (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential damage from compromised Chef accounts by restricting their access to only necessary Chef resources.
        *   **Data Breaches through Accidental or Malicious Access via Chef Server (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of sensitive data exposure managed by Chef by controlling access through Chef RBAC.
    *   **Impact:**
