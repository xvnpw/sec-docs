## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Managed by Chef [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_managed_by_chef__critical_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. Success here means the application is under the attacker's control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Chef Server Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_chef_server_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Gain Unauthorized Access to Chef Server [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Exploit Authentication Weaknesses (e.g., default credentials, weak passwords):**
        *   **Attack Vectors:** Attackers attempt to log in using default credentials or commonly used/weak passwords. This is often automated through brute-force attacks or by leveraging lists of known default credentials.
    *   **Exploit Known Chef Server Software Vulnerabilities (CVEs):**
        *   **Attack Vectors:** Attackers identify and exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the Chef Server software. This often involves using existing exploit code or adapting it to the specific environment.
*   **Inject Malicious Code/Configurations [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Upload Malicious Cookbooks/Recipes:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:** After gaining unauthorized access, attackers upload new cookbooks or recipes containing malicious code designed to compromise managed nodes (e.g., installing backdoors, stealing data).
    *   **Modify Existing Cookbooks/Recipes:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:** Attackers modify existing, legitimate cookbooks or recipes to inject malicious code that will be executed on managed nodes during the next Chef client run. This can be subtle and harder to detect.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in Cookbook Management and Distribution [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_cookbook_management_and_distribution__critical_.md)

*   **Compromise Cookbook Repositories (e.g., GitHub, internal repositories) [CRITICAL]:**
    *   Gain Unauthorized Access to Repository Credentials:
        *   **Attack Vectors:** Attackers target the credentials used to access the cookbook repositories (e.g., through phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the repository platform).
    *   **Inject Malicious Code into Cookbooks:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:** Once repository access is gained, attackers directly modify cookbooks by injecting malicious code. This code will then be distributed to all nodes using those cookbooks.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks via Third-Party Cookbooks:**
    *   **Use Vulnerable or Malicious Community Cookbooks:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:** Developers unknowingly use community cookbooks that contain vulnerabilities or are intentionally malicious. This can introduce security risks into the managed environment without the developers' direct knowledge.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Use of Chef Features](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_use_of_chef_features.md)

*   **Insecure Storage of Secrets in Cookbooks or Attributes:**
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Developers directly embed sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or certificates within cookbook code or node attributes. This makes these secrets easily accessible to anyone who can view the cookbook or node data.
*   **Unnecessary Remote Code Execution via Chef Resources (e.g., `execute`, `script`):**
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Cookbooks use resources like `execute` or `script` in a way that allows for arbitrary command execution on the managed nodes. This can be exploited if the input to these resources is not properly sanitized or controlled, allowing attackers to inject malicious commands.
