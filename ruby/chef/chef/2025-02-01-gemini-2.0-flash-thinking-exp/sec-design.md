# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Chef project is an infrastructure automation platform that enables users to manage and automate the configuration of servers, applications, and networks. It aims to streamline IT operations, ensure consistency across infrastructure, and accelerate application deployment.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Automate infrastructure management to reduce manual effort and operational costs.
- Ensure consistent configurations across all managed systems to improve reliability and reduce configuration drift.
- Accelerate application deployment and updates by automating infrastructure provisioning and configuration.
- Improve compliance and auditability by codifying infrastructure configurations.
- Enable scalability and agility in infrastructure management to support business growth.

Business Risks:
- Misconfiguration of infrastructure leading to service disruptions, security vulnerabilities, or compliance violations.
- Unauthorized access to Chef infrastructure allowing malicious actors to control managed systems.
- Data breaches due to insecure storage or transmission of sensitive configuration data and secrets.
- Supply chain attacks targeting Chef components or dependencies, compromising managed infrastructure.
- Operational disruptions due to failures in the Chef infrastructure itself.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Code review process for Chef codebase (location: GitHub repository - pull request reviews).
- security control: Static code analysis and linting (location: likely integrated into CI/CD pipelines, details not publicly available).
- security control: Unit and integration testing (location: GitHub repository - test suites).
- security control: Package signing for Chef Client and Chef Server packages (location: package repositories).
- security control: HTTPS for communication between Chef components (Chef Client, Chef Server, Chef Workstation).
- security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Chef Server to manage user permissions.
- security control: Secrets management capabilities within Chef to handle sensitive data (e.g., encrypted attributes, Chef Vault).

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by Chef.
- accepted risk: Risk of misconfiguration by Chef users leading to security issues in managed infrastructure.
- accepted risk: Reliance on user-provided cookbooks and recipes, which may contain vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to continuously monitor third-party dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- security control: Enhance input validation and sanitization throughout Chef components to prevent injection attacks.
- security control: Implement robust secret scanning in code repositories and CI/CD pipelines to prevent accidental exposure of credentials.
- security control: Provide security hardening guidelines and best practices for Chef Server and Chef Client deployments.
- security control: Implement automated security testing (e.g., vulnerability scanning, penetration testing) of Chef components and managed infrastructure.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Secure authentication mechanisms for users accessing Chef Server (e.g., username/password, LDAP, SAML).
    - Requirement: Mutual TLS authentication between Chef Client and Chef Server to ensure secure communication and client identity verification.
    - Requirement: API keys or tokens for programmatic access to Chef Server APIs.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions for users and services within Chef Server.
    - Requirement: Granular authorization policies to control access to nodes, cookbooks, environments, and other Chef resources.
    - Requirement: Principle of least privilege should be applied to all user and service accounts.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Strict input validation for all data received by Chef Server and Chef Client, including API requests, cookbook attributes, and node data.
    - Requirement: Sanitize user-provided data to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, SQL injection).
    - Requirement: Validate cookbook syntax and structure to prevent errors and potential security issues.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use strong encryption algorithms for sensitive data at rest and in transit (e.g., AES-256, TLS 1.2+).
    - Requirement: Securely store and manage cryptographic keys used for encryption and signing.
    - Requirement: Implement cryptographic signing and verification for Chef cookbooks and packages to ensure integrity and authenticity.

    - Audit logs containing information about user actions and system changes.
- Medium Sensitivity:
    - Cookbook code and recipes, as they define infrastructure configurations and application deployments.
    - Node data and metadata, including system inventory and configuration details.
- Low Sensitivity:
    - Chef Server application logs (excluding sensitive data).
    - Publicly available Chef packages and documentation.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the intended deployment environment (on-premise, cloud, hybrid)?
- What are the specific compliance requirements for the project (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2)?
- What is the organization's risk tolerance for security vulnerabilities and operational disruptions?
- Are there any specific security tools or technologies already in use that should be integrated with Chef?
- What is the process for managing and rotating secrets used by Chef?
- What is the disaster recovery plan for Chef Server and managed infrastructure?

Assumptions:
