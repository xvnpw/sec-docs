# Threat Model Analysis for chef/chef

## Threat: [Chef Server Software Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/chef_server_software_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability in the Chef Server software. This could be done by sending crafted requests to the Chef Server API or exploiting vulnerabilities in exposed services.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Chef Server, leading to unauthorized access to all cookbooks, nodes, data bags, and secrets. Data breach exposing sensitive configuration data and secrets. Denial of Service (DoS) making Chef infrastructure management impossible.
*   **Affected Chef Component:** Chef Server application, underlying operating system, and dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly patch and update the Chef Server software and underlying operating system.
    *   Harden the Chef Server operating system.
    *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the Chef Server.
    *   Conduct regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing of the Chef Server.

## Threat: [Weak Chef Server Credentials](./threats/weak_chef_server_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized administrative access to the Chef Server by guessing or cracking weak or default credentials.
*   **Impact:** Full administrative access to the Chef Server, allowing the attacker to control all Chef infrastructure, modify cookbooks, access secrets, and potentially compromise managed nodes.
*   **Affected Chef Component:** Chef Server authentication system, administrative user accounts.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for all Chef Server user accounts.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Chef Server administrative access.
    *   Disable or remove default administrative accounts if possible.
    *   Monitor Chef Server login attempts and alert on suspicious activity.
    *   Consider using Single Sign-On (SSO) with a strong identity provider.

## Threat: [Malicious Cookbooks from Untrusted Sources](./threats/malicious_cookbooks_from_untrusted_sources.md)

*   **Description:** A developer or operator unknowingly or intentionally introduces a malicious cookbook into the Chef infrastructure. This cookbook could be downloaded from a compromised public repository or created by a malicious insider.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code on managed nodes, leading to full system compromise, data theft, or denial of service. Introduction of backdoors or malware onto managed nodes.
*   **Affected Chef Component:** Chef Client, cookbooks, cookbook repositories.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only use cookbooks from trusted and vetted sources.
    *   Implement a cookbook review and approval process.
    *   Use cookbook signing and verification mechanisms.
    *   Employ static code analysis and vulnerability scanning tools on cookbooks.
    *   Isolate Chef Client execution environments.

## Threat: [Hardcoded Secrets in Cookbooks](./threats/hardcoded_secrets_in_cookbooks.md)

*   **Description:** Developers accidentally or intentionally hardcode sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or certificates directly into cookbooks or recipes.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems and data. Privilege escalation if exposed credentials grant elevated access.
*   **Affected Chef Component:** Cookbooks, recipes, data bags (if misused), version control systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never hardcode secrets directly into cookbooks or recipes.
    *   Utilize secure secret management tools like Chef Vault, HashiCorp Vault, or cloud provider secret management services.
    *   Store secrets securely in data bags or encrypted attributes and retrieve them dynamically during Chef Client runs.
    *   Implement code scanning tools to detect hardcoded secrets in cookbooks.
    *   Educate developers on secure secret management practices.

## Threat: [Command Injection Vulnerabilities in Cookbooks](./threats/command_injection_vulnerabilities_in_cookbooks.md)

*   **Description:** Cookbooks or recipes contain vulnerabilities that allow attackers to inject arbitrary commands into system calls due to improper input validation or sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on managed nodes, leading to full system compromise. Privilege escalation if the injected command is executed with elevated privileges.
*   **Affected Chef Component:** Cookbooks, recipes, Chef Client execution environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid constructing shell commands dynamically within recipes whenever possible.
    *   If shell commands are necessary, carefully validate and sanitize all user-provided or external input.
    *   Use parameterized commands or prepared statements where applicable.
    *   Implement static code analysis tools to detect potential command injection vulnerabilities in cookbooks.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing cookbooks and recipes.

## Threat: [Insecure Chef Server API Access](./threats/insecure_chef_server_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Chef Server API due to missing or weak authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Chef Server data, including cookbooks, nodes, data bags, and secrets. Ability to modify Chef Server configuration, potentially leading to infrastructure disruption or compromise.
*   **Affected Chef Component:** Chef Server API endpoints, authentication and authorization modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure proper authentication is enforced for all Chef Server API endpoints.
    *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and least privilege principles for API access.
    *   Securely configure Chef Server API access controls.
    *   Regularly review and audit Chef Server API access logs.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Chef Client Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_chef_client_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and potentially modifies communication between a Chef Client and the Chef Server.
*   **Impact:** Injection of malicious cookbooks or recipes onto managed nodes, leading to system compromise. Modification of configuration data during transit, causing misconfiguration of managed nodes.
*   **Affected Chef Component:** Chef Client, Chef Server, network communication channels.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce TLS/SSL for all Chef Client to Chef Server communication.
    *   Use strong encryption algorithms for Chef Client communication.
    *   Secure the network infrastructure between Chef Clients and the Chef Server.
    *   Consider using VPNs or other secure tunnels for Chef Client communication, especially over untrusted networks.
    *   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication between Chef Client and Server.

## Threat: [Insecure Cookbook Repository Access](./threats/insecure_cookbook_repository_access.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized users gain access to the cookbook repository (e.g., Git repository) where cookbooks are stored.
*   **Impact:** Modification or deletion of cookbooks, potentially disrupting infrastructure management or introducing malicious code. Information disclosure by accessing cookbook content, potentially revealing sensitive configuration details or secrets (if improperly stored).
*   **Affected Chef Component:** Cookbook repositories (e.g., Git, Artifactory), version control system, access control mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong access control policies for cookbook repositories.
    *   Use strong authentication mechanisms for repository access.
    *   Regularly audit and review repository access logs.
    *   Secure the repository infrastructure itself.
    *   Consider using private or self-hosted cookbook repositories.
