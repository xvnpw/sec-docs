# Attack Surface Analysis for chef/chef

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Chef Server](./attack_surfaces/compromised_chef_server.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Chef Server.
*   **Chef Contribution:** Chef Server is the central control point, managing configurations and storing sensitive data. Compromise grants wide-ranging control over managed infrastructure.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits an unpatched vulnerability in the Chef Server software or gains access through weak administrator credentials.
*   **Impact:** Full control over managed infrastructure, data breaches, service disruption, deployment of malicious configurations across all nodes.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly patch and update Chef Server software and underlying OS.
    *   Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for Chef Server administrators.
    *   Harden the Chef Server operating system and network configuration.
    *   Implement robust access control lists (ACLs) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Chef Server.
    *   Regularly audit Chef Server logs and activity.
    *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the Chef Server API.

## Attack Surface: [Recipe Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/recipe_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious code is injected into recipes, leading to arbitrary command execution on managed nodes.
*   **Chef Contribution:** Chef recipes are executed with elevated privileges on managed nodes. Recipes that dynamically construct commands based on external input are vulnerable.
*   **Example:** A recipe uses node attributes or external data to construct a shell command without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands through attribute manipulation or data bag poisoning.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on managed nodes, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid dynamic command construction in recipes whenever possible.
    *   Sanitize and validate all external input (node attributes, data bags, external data sources) used in recipes.
    *   Use Chef resources (e.g., `execute`, `bash`, `powershell`) securely, avoiding `shell=True` and carefully constructing commands.
    *   Employ input validation and output encoding techniques within recipes.
    *   Regularly review and audit recipe code for potential injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Adopt infrastructure-as-code security scanning tools to detect potential vulnerabilities in recipes.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Data Bag Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_data_bag_management.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data, including secrets, stored in data bags is compromised due to weak encryption or insecure access controls.
*   **Chef Contribution:** Chef Data Bags are a mechanism for storing configuration data, including secrets. Insecure handling of data bags can lead to secrets exposure.
*   **Example:** Data bags containing passwords or API keys are encrypted with weak keys, default keys, or not encrypted at all. Access controls are not properly configured, allowing unauthorized users to read data bags.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, unauthorized access to systems and applications, potential data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always encrypt sensitive data in data bags using strong encryption algorithms.
    *   Implement robust key management practices for data bag encryption keys, storing them securely and separately from the Chef Server if possible.
    *   Utilize Chef Server RBAC to restrict access to data bags to only authorized users and roles.
    *   Consider using external secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) integrated with Chef instead of relying solely on data bag encryption for highly sensitive secrets.
    *   Regularly audit data bag access and encryption configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Cookbooks from Untrusted Sources](./attack_surfaces/compromised_cookbooks_from_untrusted_sources.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious or vulnerable cookbooks from public repositories or untrusted sources are used in the Chef environment.
*   **Chef Contribution:** Chef allows the use of cookbooks from various sources, including public repositories. Using untrusted sources introduces supply chain risks.
*   **Example:** A developer downloads and uses a cookbook from a public repository without proper review, unknowingly including malicious code or vulnerable dependencies in their infrastructure configuration.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious functionality into managed infrastructure, potentially leading to system compromise and data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and audit cookbooks from public repositories before use.
    *   Prefer using cookbooks from trusted and reputable sources.
    *   Implement a process for vetting and approving cookbooks before they are used in production.
    *   Utilize cookbook dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerable dependencies.
    *   Consider hosting and managing cookbooks in a private, controlled repository.
    *   Implement code signing and verification for cookbooks to ensure integrity and authenticity.
