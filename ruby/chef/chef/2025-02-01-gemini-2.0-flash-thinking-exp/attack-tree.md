## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Chef Server (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_chef_server__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.1 Exploit Chef Server Software Vulnerabilities:**
        *   Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in Chef Server software or its dependencies.
        *   **Impact:** Full control of Chef Server, potential compromise of all managed nodes and applications.
        *   **Mitigation:** Regular patching, vulnerability scanning, dependency management.
    *   **1.2 Credential Theft for Chef Server Access (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **1.2.1 Brute-force/Password Guessing:** Trying common passwords or using automated tools to guess administrator passwords.
            *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Chef Server.
            *   **Mitigation:** Strong passwords, account lockout, MFA.
        *   **1.2.2 Phishing/Social Engineering:** Tricking administrators into revealing their credentials through deceptive emails or social manipulation.
            *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Chef Server.
            *   **Mitigation:** Security awareness training, phishing simulations.
    *   **1.3 Misconfiguration of Chef Server Security (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **1.3.1 Insecure API Endpoints Exposed:**  Leaving Chef Server API endpoints publicly accessible without proper authentication or authorization.
            *   **Impact:** Unauthorized API access, potential data exfiltration or manipulation.
            *   **Mitigation:** Restrict API access by network, strong API authentication.
        *   **1.3.3 Default Credentials Left Active:** Failing to change default usernames and passwords for Chef Server or related services.
            *   **Impact:** Easy unauthorized access to Chef Server.
            *   **Mitigation:** Change default credentials during setup.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise Managed Node via Chef Client (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_managed_node_via_chef_client__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **2.3 Malicious Cookbook/Recipe Execution (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
        *   **2.3.1 Compromised Cookbook Repository (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
            *   Gaining unauthorized access to the Git repository hosting cookbooks and injecting malicious code.
            *   **Impact:** Widespread deployment of malicious configurations across managed nodes.
            *   **Mitigation:** Secure Git access, branch protection, code review, cookbook signing.
        *   **2.3.2 Maliciously Crafted Cookbooks/Recipes by Insiders (High-Risk Path):**
            *   A malicious insider intentionally creating or modifying cookbooks to include malicious code.
            *   **Impact:** Targeted or widespread compromise depending on cookbook scope.
            *   **Mitigation:** Code review, separation of duties, audit logging, background checks.
        *   **2.3.3 Injection Vulnerabilities in Cookbooks/Recipes (High-Risk Path):**
            *   **2.3.3.1 Command Injection (High-Risk Path):**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in cookbook code that allow attackers to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands on managed nodes.
                *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on managed nodes, privilege escalation.
                *   **Mitigation:** Input sanitization, secure coding practices, avoid shell execution.
        *   **2.3.4 Data Bag Manipulation (High-Risk Path):**
            *   **2.3.4.2 Unauthorized Access to Data Bags (High-Risk Path):** Gaining unauthorized access to read or modify data bags containing sensitive configuration data.
                *   **Impact:** Data breaches, configuration manipulation, privilege escalation.
                *   **Mitigation:** Data bag access control, least privilege.
            *   **2.3.4.3 Data Bag Injection/Modification (High-Risk Path):**  Injecting malicious data or modifying existing data in data bags to alter node configurations.
                *   **Impact:** Configuration manipulation, potential for remote code execution or service disruption.
                *   **Mitigation:** Data bag validation, schema validation.
    *   **2.5 Insecure Secrets Management in Chef (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **2.5.1 Hardcoded Secrets in Cookbooks/Recipes (High-Risk Path):** Embedding secrets directly in cookbook code, making them easily discoverable.
            *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potential for lateral movement or data breaches.
            *   **Mitigation:** Never hardcode secrets, use Chef Vault or external secrets management.
        *   **2.5.2 Secrets Exposed in Chef Logs (High-Risk Path):**  Accidentally logging secrets in Chef Client or Server logs.
            *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials if logs are compromised or improperly accessed.
            *   **Mitigation:** Sanitize logs, configure logging levels, secure log storage.
        *   **2.5.3 Secrets Stored in Plaintext Data Bags (High-Risk Path):** Storing sensitive data in data bags without encryption.
            *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data if data bags are accessed without authorization.
            *   **Mitigation:** Always encrypt sensitive data in data bags using Chef Vault or similar.
