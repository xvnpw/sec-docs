## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Privileged Access (Root Node) {CRITICAL NODE}](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_privileged_access__root_node__{critical_node}.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker.  Success here means complete control over systems managed by Chef.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the overarching goal; all other nodes contribute to this.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Chef Server {CRITICAL NODE}](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_chef_server_{critical_node}.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining control of the Chef Server, which acts as the central authority for managing infrastructure.
*   **Why Critical:** The Chef Server is a single point of failure.  Compromise here grants control over all managed nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Weak Credentials (Server) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_weak_credentials__server___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting weak or default credentials to gain access to the Chef Server.
*   **Why High Risk:** High impact (server compromise) combined with a relatively high likelihood due to human error or lack of strong password policies.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **1.1.1 Default Credentials:** Using unchanged default credentials provided with the Chef Server software.
        *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Very Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice
        *   Detection Difficulty: Very Easy
    *   **1.1.2 Brute Force:** Attempting to guess passwords through automated attacks.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Medium
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Credential Theft (Server) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_credential_theft__server___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Stealing valid Chef Server administrator credentials.
*   **Why High Risk:** High impact (server compromise) and high likelihood due to the prevalence of phishing attacks.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **1.3.1 Phishing (Targeting Chef Server Admins):** Using deceptive emails or websites to trick administrators into revealing their credentials.
        *   Likelihood: High
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Chef Configuration/Cookbooks [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_chef_configurationcookbooks__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Leveraging vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within Chef cookbooks and configurations to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Why High Risk:** This is a broad and common attack vector, encompassing various methods of exploiting weaknesses in how Chef is used.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Malicious Cookbook Injection [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_malicious_cookbook_injection__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Introducing malicious code into Chef cookbooks.
*   **Why High Risk:** Can be difficult to detect and can lead to widespread compromise of managed nodes.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **3.1.1 Compromised Repository:** Gaining control of the source code repository where cookbooks are stored (e.g., Git) and inserting malicious code.
        *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: High
        *   Skill Level: Advanced
        *   Detection Difficulty: Hard
    *   **3.1.2 Supply Chain Attack (e.g., Berkshelf):** Exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party cookbook dependencies (managed by tools like Berkshelf) to inject malicious code.
        *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: High
        *   Skill Level: Expert
        *   Detection Difficulty: Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Insecure Configuration [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_insecure_configuration__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Using insecure configurations within Chef cookbooks, leading to vulnerabilities.
*   **Why High Risk:** Common due to human error and lack of secure coding practices.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **3.2.1 Hardcoded Credentials:** Storing passwords or other sensitive information directly within cookbook code.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Very Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
    *   **3.2.2 Unencrypted Secrets {CRITICAL NODE}**: Storing sensitive data without proper encryption.
        *   **Description:** Failing to encrypt sensitive data like passwords, API keys, or other credentials.
        *   **Why Critical:** Access to unencrypted secrets can allow attackers to pivot to other systems and escalate privileges.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Very Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
        *   **Sub-Sub-Vectors:**
            *   **3.2.2.1 Data Bags:** Using unencrypted data bags to store sensitive information.
            *   **3.2.2.2 Attributes:** Storing sensitive data directly in Chef attributes, which can be overridden.
            *   **3.2.2.3 Environment Variables:** Relying on environment variables for secrets, which can be easily exposed.
