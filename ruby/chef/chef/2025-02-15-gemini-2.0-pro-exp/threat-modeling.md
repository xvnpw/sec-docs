# Threat Model Analysis for chef/chef

## Threat: [Unauthorized Cookbook Modification on Chef Server](./threats/unauthorized_cookbook_modification_on_chef_server.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Cookbook Modification on Chef Server

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Chef Server (e.g., through compromised credentials, a vulnerability in the Chef Server API, or a misconfigured firewall) and modifies existing cookbooks or uploads malicious ones. They might alter recipes to install backdoors, exfiltrate data, or disrupt services. They could target specific recipes within a cookbook or replace entire cookbooks.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of all nodes that use the modified cookbooks. This could lead to data breaches, system outages, or the establishment of a persistent presence within the infrastructure. The attacker could gain root access to all affected systems.
    *   **Affected Chef Component:** Chef Server (specifically the cookbook storage and API endpoints), potentially the `chef-server-ctl` command-line tool if used for unauthorized modifications.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Chef Server access, including API access.
        *   **RBAC:** Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to cookbooks based on the principle of least privilege. Ensure that only authorized users can modify or upload cookbooks.
        *   **API Key Management:** Regularly rotate API keys and store them securely. Avoid hardcoding API keys in scripts or configuration files.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Chef Server on a separate network segment with strict firewall rules.
        *   **Chef Server Hardening:** Follow Chef's security best practices for hardening the Chef Server operating system and application.
        *   **Audit Logging:** Enable detailed audit logging on the Chef Server and monitor logs for suspicious activity.
        *   **Version Control:** Store cookbooks in a version control system (e.g., Git) and use a CI/CD pipeline to deploy them to the Chef Server. This allows for tracking changes and reverting to previous versions if necessary.
        *   **Code Signing:** Implement code signing for cookbooks to verify their integrity and authenticity.

## Threat: [Data Bag Decryption](./threats/data_bag_decryption.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Bag Decryption

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to encrypted data bags and obtains the decryption key. This could happen through a compromised Chef Server, a compromised workstation with access to the key, or by exploiting a vulnerability in the data bag encryption mechanism. The attacker could then decrypt sensitive data stored in the data bags, such as passwords, API keys, or database credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to further compromise of systems and services. The attacker could use the decrypted credentials to access other resources.
    *   **Affected Chef Component:** Chef Server (data bag storage), Chef Workstation (if the key is stored there), `knife` command-line tool (used for managing data bags).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Key Management System (KMS):** Use a dedicated KMS (e.g., AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault) to manage data bag encryption keys. Avoid storing keys directly on the Chef Server or workstations.
        *   **Strong Encryption:** Use strong encryption algorithms and key lengths for data bag encryption.
        *   **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate data bag encryption keys.
        *   **Access Control:** Restrict access to data bag encryption keys to authorized users and services.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Only store the minimum necessary sensitive data in data bags.

## Threat: [`client.pem` Theft from Managed Node](./threats/_client_pem__theft_from_managed_node.md)

*   **Threat:** `client.pem` Theft from Managed Node

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a managed node (e.g., through a vulnerability in an application running on the node â€“ though this initial access is *not* a Chef-direct threat, the theft of the `client.pem` *is*) and steals the `client.pem` file. This file contains the node's private key, which is used to authenticate with the Chef Server.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can impersonate the node and potentially access data intended for that node. While less severe than a Chef Server compromise, it can be a stepping stone to further attacks. The attacker *cannot* modify cookbooks on the server, but they *can* see the node's run-list and attributes.
    *   **Affected Chef Component:** Chef Client (specifically the `client.pem` file on the managed node).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure File Permissions:** Ensure that the `client.pem` file has restrictive file permissions (e.g., readable only by the root user).
        *   **Node Hardening:** Implement strong security hardening practices on managed nodes to prevent unauthorized access.
        *   **Regular Key Rotation:** Although less common, consider periodic rotation of `client.pem` files.
        *   **Intrusion Detection:** Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) on managed nodes to detect unauthorized access and file modifications.

## Threat: [Malicious Community Cookbook](./threats/malicious_community_cookbook.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Community Cookbook

    *   **Description:** A developer unknowingly uses a malicious or vulnerable cookbook from the Chef Supermarket or another public repository. The cookbook might contain intentional backdoors, vulnerabilities that can be exploited, or dependencies on compromised packages.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of malicious code to managed nodes, potentially leading to system compromise, data breaches, or service disruption.
    *   **Affected Chef Component:** Chef Client (on managed nodes), potentially the `knife` command-line tool (if used to download the cookbook), Chef Supermarket (as the source of the cookbook).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Cookbook Vetting:** Carefully review the source code of community cookbooks before using them. Look for suspicious code, known vulnerabilities, and the reputation of the cookbook author.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (e.g., Berkshelf, Policyfiles) to manage cookbook dependencies and ensure that only trusted versions are used.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan cookbooks for vulnerabilities using static analysis tools.
        *   **Private Cookbook Repository:** Use a private cookbook repository to manage internal cookbooks and control which cookbooks are available to developers.
        *   **Policyfiles:** Use Policyfiles to define a specific set of cookbooks and their versions for each environment, preventing the use of unapproved cookbooks.

## Threat: [Attribute Override Attack](./threats/attribute_override_attack.md)

* **Threat:** Attribute Override Attack

    * **Description:** An attacker with access to modify node attributes (either through compromised node access or compromised Chef Server access) changes attributes used by cookbooks. This can alter the behavior of recipes in unexpected ways, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. For example, changing a firewall rule attribute to open a port.  The *ability* to modify the attributes might come from a non-Chef vulnerability, but the *impact* is directly through Chef.
    * **Impact:** Cookbooks behave in unintended ways, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities, data breaches, or service disruptions. The attacker can indirectly control the configuration of the node.
    * **Affected Chef Component:** Chef Client (node attributes), Chef Server (if attributes are modified there).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Attribute Precedence:** Understand Chef's attribute precedence rules and use appropriate attribute levels (e.g., `default`, `normal`, `override`) to control which attributes take precedence.
        * **Policyfiles:** Use Policyfiles to lock down node attributes and prevent unintended changes.
        * **Input Validation:** Validate attribute values within cookbooks to ensure they are within expected ranges and formats.
        * **Node Hardening:** Secure managed nodes to prevent unauthorized access and modification of attributes.
        * **Audit Logging:** Monitor changes to node attributes on the Chef Server.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerability in Chef Software (Critical/High Impact)](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerability_in_chef_software__criticalhigh_impact_.md)

* **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerability in Chef Software (Critical/High Impact)

    * **Description:**  An attacker exploits a *critical or high-impact* vulnerability in the Chef Client, Chef Server, or a related tool (e.g., knife, InSpec).  This focuses on vulnerabilities that could lead to significant compromise, such as remote code execution or privilege escalation.
    * **Impact:**  Could range from denial of service to remote code execution on the Chef Server, workstations, or managed nodes, leading to complete system compromise.  This entry specifically covers *high-impact* vulnerabilities.
    * **Affected Chef Component:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability. Could be Chef Client, Chef Server, `knife`, InSpec, or other related components.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical or High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Patch Management:**  *Immediately* apply security updates to all Chef components upon release, especially for critical and high-severity vulnerabilities.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a vulnerability scanner that specifically supports Chef components to identify known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Security Advisories:**  Actively monitor Chef security advisories and promptly apply recommended mitigations.  Subscribe to notification channels.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run Chef components with the least privilege necessary.
