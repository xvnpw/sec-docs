# Threat Model Analysis for chef/chef

## Threat: [Cookbook Injection/Tampering](./threats/cookbook_injectiontampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to the Chef Server (due to compromised credentials or a vulnerability in the Chef Server software) modifies an existing cookbook or uploads a new malicious one. This cookbook contains malicious code that will be executed on nodes during the next Chef Client run.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on managed nodes, allowing the attacker to install malware, exfiltrate data, disrupt services, or gain further access to the infrastructure.

**Affected Component:** Chef Server (Cookbook storage and distribution), Chef Client (Cookbook execution).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong access controls on the Chef Server, enforce code review processes for cookbooks, sign cookbooks to ensure integrity, use trusted sources for community cookbooks, implement change control and versioning for cookbooks, regularly scan cookbooks for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Data Bag Manipulation](./threats/data_bag_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to modify data bags on the Chef Server, potentially through compromised credentials or exploiting a vulnerability in the Chef Server API. They could inject malicious data, such as compromised credentials or altered configuration settings, which are then used by cookbooks during Chef Client runs.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation on managed nodes, deployment of malicious software, unauthorized access to sensitive resources, disruption of application functionality.

**Affected Component:** Chef Server (Data Bag storage and API), Chef Client (Data Bag retrieval).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strict access controls on data bags, encrypt sensitive data within data bags using Chef Vault or other secrets management solutions, implement version control and auditing of data bag changes, regularly review data bag contents for anomalies.

## Threat: [Chef Server API Credential Compromise](./threats/chef_server_api_credential_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker obtains valid credentials (username/password or API keys) for the Chef Server API. This could be through phishing, credential stuffing, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in systems where these credentials are stored. With these credentials, the attacker can perform any action the compromised user is authorized for, including modifying cookbooks, data bags, and node configurations.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the managed infrastructure, data breaches, denial of service, deployment of malicious software.

**Affected Component:** Chef Server (API authentication and authorization).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Enforce strong password policies and complexity requirements, implement multi-factor authentication for Chef Server access, securely store and manage Chef Server credentials, regularly rotate API keys, monitor API access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Chef Server Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_chef_server_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Unpatched vulnerabilities in the Chef Server software itself are exploited by an attacker. This could allow for unauthorized access, remote code execution on the Chef Server, or denial of service.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Chef Server, potentially leading to the compromise of all managed nodes, data breaches, and service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Chef Server (various components depending on the vulnerability).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly update the Chef Server software to the latest stable version, subscribe to security advisories from Chef, implement network segmentation to limit access to the Chef Server, use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect the Chef Server web interface.

## Threat: [Insecure Attribute Usage](./threats/insecure_attribute_usage.md)

**Description:** Developers may inadvertently store sensitive information (like passwords or API keys) directly in node attributes or environment attributes without proper encryption or secure handling. This information can then be accessed by anyone with read access to the Chef Server or the node itself.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, allowing attackers to access other systems or services.

**Affected Component:** Chef Server (Attribute storage), Chef Client (Attribute retrieval).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Avoid storing sensitive information directly in attributes, use secure secrets management solutions like Chef Vault or HashiCorp Vault, encrypt sensitive attributes, implement access controls on attribute data.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Chef Client Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_chef_client_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between a Chef Client and the Chef Server. If the communication is not properly secured (e.g., using HTTPS with certificate verification), the attacker could potentially steal credentials, inject malicious commands, or alter the configurations being downloaded by the client.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Chef Server, manipulation of node configurations, deployment of malicious software on nodes.

**Affected Component:** Chef Client (communication module), Chef Server (communication module).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure that Chef Client and Server communication is always over HTTPS, verify the Chef Server's SSL certificate on the client side, avoid using self-signed certificates in production environments.

## Threat: [Weak or Default Credentials on Chef Server](./threats/weak_or_default_credentials_on_chef_server.md)

**Description:** The Chef Server is deployed with default or easily guessable administrator credentials. Attackers can exploit this to gain immediate access to the Chef Server without needing to exploit any vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Chef Server and potentially the entire managed infrastructure.

**Affected Component:** Chef Server (initial setup and authentication).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure that default credentials are changed immediately upon installation, enforce strong password policies for all Chef Server users.

## Threat: [Exposure of Secrets in Version Control](./threats/exposure_of_secrets_in_version_control.md)

**Description:** Developers accidentally commit sensitive information, such as Chef Server credentials or API keys, directly into version control systems (like Git). This information can then be easily discovered by attackers and used to compromise the Chef Server.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Chef Server, potential compromise of the managed infrastructure.

**Affected Component:** Chef Workstation (local files), Version Control Systems (repositories) - *Directly impacts Chef Server security*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Educate developers on secure coding practices, use `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive files, implement secrets scanning tools in CI/CD pipelines to detect and prevent accidental commits of secrets.
