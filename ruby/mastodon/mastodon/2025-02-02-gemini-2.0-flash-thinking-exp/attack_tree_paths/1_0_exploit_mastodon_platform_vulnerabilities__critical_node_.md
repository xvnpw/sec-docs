    *   **Regular Security Audits and XSS Testing:**  Specifically testing for XSS vulnerabilities.

###### 1.1.1.1.a Stored XSS in User Content (Posts, Profiles) [CRITICAL NODE]

*   **Description:** Stored XSS, also known as persistent XSS, is a particularly dangerous type of XSS vulnerability. In this case, the malicious script is stored directly on the server (e.g., in a database) and is executed every time a user accesses the page containing the malicious content. In Mastodon, this could be in user posts (toots), profiles, or other user-generated content.
*   **Technical Details:** An attacker crafts a malicious post or profile containing JavaScript code and submits it to the Mastodon server. The server stores this malicious content in its database. When other users view this post or profile, the malicious script is retrieved from the database and executed in their browsers.
*   **Potential Impact:**  The impact of Stored XSS is generally higher than reflected XSS because the attack is persistent and affects all users who view the compromised content.
    *   **Widespread Account Compromise:**  If a malicious post goes viral, a large number of users could be affected.
    *   **Persistent Defacement:**  Malicious content remains on the platform until manually removed.
    *   **Automated Attacks:**  Attackers can automate the process of injecting malicious content, making it easier to scale the attack.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-generated content *before* storing it in the database. This is the most critical mitigation for Stored XSS.
    *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  Encode user-generated content appropriately when displaying it on web pages.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  CSP can help mitigate the impact of XSS even if it's not fully prevented.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Specifically focus on identifying Stored XSS vulnerabilities in user content handling.
    *   **User Content Scanning:**  Consider implementing automated scanning of user-generated content for potentially malicious scripts (though this can be complex and resource-intensive).
    *   **Rate Limiting and Input Length Restrictions:**  Limit the length and frequency of user inputs to make it harder to inject large or complex malicious scripts.

#### 1.1.1.2 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) [CRITICAL NODE]

*   **Description:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities allow an attacker to trick the server into making requests to unintended destinations. This can be internal resources within the server's network or external resources on the internet.
*   **Technical Details:** SSRF vulnerabilities typically occur when a web application takes user-supplied input (e.g., a URL) and uses it to make a server-side request without proper validation. Attackers can manipulate this input to make the server send requests to internal IP addresses, localhost, or other restricted resources.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Access to Internal Resources:**  Gaining access to internal services, databases, or APIs that are not publicly accessible.
    *   **Port Scanning and Network Mapping:**  Using the server to scan internal networks and identify open ports and services.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Retrieving sensitive data from internal resources.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Overloading internal services or external websites by making a large number of requests.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (in some cases):**  If internal services are vulnerable, SSRF can be a stepping stone to RCE.

    *   **User Security Awareness Training:**  Educate users about phishing attacks and how to recognize them.
    *   **Strong Password Policies and MFA:**  Encourage or enforce strong passwords and MFA to make account takeover more difficult even if credentials are phished.
    *   **Anti-Phishing Measures:**  Implement anti-phishing technologies, such as email filtering and browser extensions that detect phishing websites.
    *   **Domain Monitoring:**  Monitor for domain squatting and typosquatting to prevent attackers from registering similar-looking domains for phishing attacks.
    *   **Clear Communication and Branding:**  Maintain consistent branding and communication to help users distinguish legitimate communications from phishing attempts.

##### 1.3.1.1 Phishing for Mastodon Admin Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]

*   **Description:** This sub-vector specifically targets Mastodon administrators with phishing attacks. Compromising admin accounts is particularly dangerous as it grants attackers extensive control over the Mastodon instance.
*   **Technical Details:** Attackers tailor phishing attacks to target administrators, often using social engineering tactics that exploit administrators' roles and responsibilities. They might impersonate legitimate authorities or use urgent requests to trick admins into revealing their credentials.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Complete Platform Compromise:**  Gaining full administrative control over the Mastodon instance.
    *   **Data Breaches:**  Accessing all data, including sensitive server configurations and user data.
    *   **Service Disruption:**  Taking the platform offline or manipulating its functionality.
    *   **Malware Distribution:**  Using administrative privileges to inject malware or deface the platform.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enhanced Security Awareness Training for Admins:**  Provide specialized security awareness training for administrators, focusing on phishing attacks targeting privileged accounts.
    *   **Strong Password Policies and Enforced MFA for Admins:**  Enforce strong password policies and mandatory MFA for all administrator accounts.
    *   **Dedicated Admin Accounts:**  Use dedicated administrator accounts that are separate from regular user accounts.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant administrative privileges only to necessary personnel and limit the scope of those privileges.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Social Engineering Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and social engineering tests, including phishing simulations targeting administrators.
    *   **Incident Response Plan for Admin Account Compromise:**  Have a specific incident response plan in place for handling the compromise of administrator accounts.
