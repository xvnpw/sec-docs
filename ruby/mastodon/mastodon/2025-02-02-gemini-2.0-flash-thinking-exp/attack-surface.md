# Attack Surface Analysis for mastodon/mastodon

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via ActivityPub](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_activitypub.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can trick the Mastodon server into making requests to unintended locations, potentially internal resources or external services.
*   **Mastodon Contribution:** Mastodon's federation relies on fetching remote actor profiles and content via URLs provided in ActivityPub messages. Weak URL validation allows malicious URLs to be injected.
*   **Example:** A malicious actor crafts an ActivityPub `Follow` activity with a forged actor URL pointing to `http://localhost:6379/`. Mastodon attempts to fetch data from its own Redis instance, potentially leaking sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (internal services, configuration), internal network scanning, potential for further exploitation of internal services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize URLs received in ActivityPub messages.
        *   Use URL parsing libraries robust against manipulation.
        *   Whitelist allowed URL schemes and domains for federation requests.
        *   Use HTTP client libraries with SSRF protection.
        *   Regularly audit URL validation logic.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Federated Instances](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_malicious_federated_instances.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious instance floods a target Mastodon instance with requests or crafted messages to overwhelm its resources.
*   **Mastodon Contribution:** Mastodon's federated nature requires processing interactions from any instance, creating a channel for DoS attacks.
*   **Example:** A botnet of compromised Mastodon instances sends a massive number of `Follow` requests or large ActivityPub payloads, exhausting the target instance's resources.
*   **Impact:** Instance unavailability, degraded performance, service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust rate limiting on ActivityPub endpoints.
        *   Implement connection limits and request queue management.
        *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic.
        *   Implement mechanisms to identify and block malicious instances.
        *   Optimize Mastodon's code for high loads.
    *   **Users (Instance Administrators):**
        *   Monitor instance resource usage and network traffic.
        *   Implement instance-level firewalls and intrusion detection.
        *   Consider blocking or defederating from problematic instances.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Toot Content (Markdown Rendering)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_toot_content__markdown_rendering_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into toots that execute in users' browsers.
*   **Mastodon Contribution:** Mastodon uses Markdown for toot formatting. Vulnerabilities in rendering or sanitization can lead to XSS.
*   **Example:** A malicious user crafts a toot with Markdown that injects JavaScript. When users view the toot, the script executes, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting to malicious sites.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Use a secure and maintained Markdown rendering library.
        *   Implement strict output encoding and sanitization of rendered Markdown.
        *   Regularly update the Markdown rendering library.
        *   Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.

## Attack Surface: [Media Injection Exploits (Malicious File Uploads)](./attack_surfaces/media_injection_exploits__malicious_file_uploads_.md)

*   **Description:** Uploading crafted media files to exploit vulnerabilities in media processing libraries.
*   **Mastodon Contribution:** Mastodon allows media attachments in toots and profiles. Insecure media processing can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a crafted PNG image as an avatar. Image processing triggers a vulnerability leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), denial of service, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Use secure and maintained media processing libraries.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for media files.
        *   Run media processing in sandboxed environments.
        *   Regularly update media processing libraries.
        *   Use file type validation and magic number checks.

## Attack Surface: [Admin Panel Account Compromise (Weak Credentials & Lack of MFA)](./attack_surfaces/admin_panel_account_compromise__weak_credentials_&_lack_of_mfa_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized admin panel access due to weak passwords, lack of MFA, or login vulnerabilities.
*   **Mastodon Contribution:** Mastodon's admin panel manages the instance. Compromise grants extensive control.
*   **Example:** An attacker brute-forces a weak admin password. Once logged in, they can control the instance, access user data, or shut it down.
*   **Impact:** Full instance compromise, data breach, service disruption, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for admin accounts.
        *   Implement and encourage Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for admin accounts.
        *   Regularly audit admin login security.
        *   Implement account lockout mechanisms.
    *   **Users (Instance Administrators):**
        *   Use strong, unique passwords for admin accounts.
        *   Enable and use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for admin accounts.
        *   Regularly review admin account access.
        *   Limit the number of admin accounts.
