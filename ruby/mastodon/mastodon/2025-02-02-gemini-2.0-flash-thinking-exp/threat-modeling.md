# Threat Model Analysis for mastodon/mastodon

## Threat: [Malicious Instance Federation](./threats/malicious_instance_federation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker operates a malicious Mastodon instance and convinces your instance administrator to federate with it. The attacker then uses this connection to distribute malware, spam, or illegal content to users on your instance through federated timelines and interactions.
*   **Impact:** Users exposed to harmful content, instance reputational damage, potential legal issues, user trust erosion.
*   **Affected Mastodon Component:** Federation module, Federated timelines, User interface (displaying federated content).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a strict instance allowlist/blocklist.
    *   Thoroughly vet instances before federating.
    *   Actively monitor federated timelines for suspicious content.
    *   Establish clear criteria and processes for instance federation and removal.
    *   Provide users with tools to report malicious content from federated instances.

## Threat: [ActivityPub Protocol Exploits](./threats/activitypub_protocol_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious or malformed ActivityPub messages and sends them to your Mastodon instance. Exploiting vulnerabilities in Mastodon's ActivityPub implementation, these messages could cause denial of service, data corruption, or potentially remote code execution on the instance server.
*   **Impact:** Instance crash, service disruption, data integrity compromise, potential server compromise, security breaches.
*   **Affected Mastodon Component:** ActivityPub implementation module, Message processing functions, Federation handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Mastodon instance updated to the latest version with security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories related to ActivityPub implementations and Mastodon.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization for incoming ActivityPub messages.
    *   Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to filter potentially malicious ActivityPub traffic.

## Threat: [Data Leakage via Federation](./threats/data_leakage_via_federation.md)

*   **Description:** Due to misconfiguration, software vulnerabilities, or design flaws, private user data (e.g., private posts, direct messages, user profiles marked as private) is unintentionally or maliciously leaked to federated instances. This could happen during ActivityPub message exchange or data synchronization processes.
*   **Impact:** Privacy breaches, violation of user trust, potential legal repercussions (e.g., GDPR violations), reputational damage.
*   **Affected Mastodon Component:** Federation module, Data serialization/deserialization, Privacy controls, ActivityPub message handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review and configure federation settings, especially privacy-related options.
    *   Ensure proper access controls and data handling for private user data within the federation context.
    *   Regularly audit data handling practices and federation configurations.
    *   Implement robust testing to prevent accidental data leakage during development and updates.

## Threat: [Account Takeover via Instance Compromise (Federated Context)](./threats/account_takeover_via_instance_compromise__federated_context_.md)

*   **Description:** If a federated instance is compromised by an attacker, they gain access to user accounts on that instance. They can then use these compromised accounts to spread misinformation, launch attacks against other federated instances, or impersonate users across the network.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, spread of malicious content across the federation, potential disruption of the federated network, reputational damage to the compromised instance and potentially others.
*   **Affected Mastodon Component:** User authentication module, Account management, Federation module (outbound messages).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Encourage users to use strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication.
    *   Instance administrators should prioritize instance security and promptly address vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement security monitoring and intrusion detection systems on the instance.
    *   Promote secure instance administration practices within the Mastodon community.

## Threat: [Federated Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/federated_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious or compromised federated instance sends a large volume of requests or data to your instance, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth, database connections). This can lead to a denial of service, making your instance unavailable to users.
*   **Impact:** Instance unavailability, service disruption, degraded performance, user frustration, potential financial losses if the instance is for commercial purposes.
*   **Affected Mastodon Component:** Federation module, Network communication, Request handling, Resource management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting for federated requests.
    *   Monitor instance resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.
    *   Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic and protect against DoS attacks.
    *   Implement caching mechanisms to reduce server load.
    *   Ensure sufficient server resources to handle expected federated traffic.
