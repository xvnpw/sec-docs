# Threat Model Analysis for mastodon/mastodon

## Threat: [Stored XSS in Mastodon Frontend](./threats/stored_xss_in_mastodon_frontend.md)

*   **Threat:** Stored XSS in Mastodon Frontend
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability exists within the Mastodon frontend code (likely in the rendering of toots, notifications, or profile information) that allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript. This script is then stored and executed in other users' browsers when they view the affected content. This could be achieved through crafted Markdown, HTML, or potentially through vulnerabilities in how user input is processed.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover (session hijacking, cookie theft), redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the Mastodon instance, execution of arbitrary actions in the victim's browser within the Mastodon context.
    *   **Affected Component:** `mastodon/app/javascript` (frontend codebase, specifically components responsible for rendering user-generated content).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mastodon Developers:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding throughout the frontend codebase. Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed. Regularly audit and test frontend components for XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Mastodon Backend](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__in_mastodon_backend.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Mastodon Backend
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability in the Mastodon backend allows an attacker to induce the server to make requests to arbitrary external or internal resources. This could be exploited through features that process URLs provided by users (e.g., fetching link previews, importing data from external sources). An attacker could use this to scan internal networks, access internal services, or potentially leak sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of internal services and data, potential for further exploitation of internal systems, denial-of-service against internal resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** `mastodon/app/lib/` (backend libraries handling external requests, URL processing), specific features like link preview generation or import functionalities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mastodon Developers:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of user-provided URLs. Use allow-lists for allowed domains or protocols. Consider using a dedicated service for making external requests. Disable or restrict access to potentially vulnerable features if necessary.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__via_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Vulnerabilities in Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Mastodon relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. If vulnerabilities exist in these dependencies (e.g., in image processing libraries, networking libraries), an attacker might be able to exploit them to execute arbitrary code on the Mastodon server. This could be achieved by uploading malicious files or sending specially crafted network requests.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Mastodon server, allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, modify the system, or use it for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Potentially various components depending on the vulnerable dependency, including image processing (`mastodon/app/uploaders`), media handling, or networking components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mastodon Developers:** Regularly update all dependencies to their latest secure versions. Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability monitoring tools. Employ secure coding practices to minimize the impact of potential dependency vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in API Endpoints](./threats/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__in_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in API Endpoints
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Mastodon's API endpoints allow attackers to access or modify resources belonging to other users by manipulating resource IDs in API requests. For example, an attacker might be able to view or delete another user's toots or direct messages by changing the toot ID in the API request.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive user data, potential for data modification or deletion, privacy violations.
    *   **Affected Component:** `mastodon/app/controllers/api/v1/` (API controllers), authorization logic within API endpoints.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mastodon Developers:** Implement proper authorization checks and access controls for all API endpoints. Ensure that users can only access resources they are explicitly authorized to access. Avoid exposing internal object IDs directly in API requests.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass or Privilege Escalation](./threats/authentication_bypass_or_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Threat:** Authentication Bypass or Privilege Escalation
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Mastodon's authentication or authorization mechanisms allow attackers to bypass login procedures or gain elevated privileges within the system. This could involve exploiting flaws in the OAuth implementation, session management, or role-based access control.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of user accounts, ability to perform administrative actions, access to sensitive system data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `mastodon/app/controllers/concerns/`, `mastodon/lib/auth/`, `mastodon/app/models/account.rb` (authentication and authorization logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mastodon Developers:** Implement robust and well-tested authentication and authorization mechanisms. Follow security best practices for password hashing, session management, and access control. Regularly audit authentication and authorization code for vulnerabilities.
