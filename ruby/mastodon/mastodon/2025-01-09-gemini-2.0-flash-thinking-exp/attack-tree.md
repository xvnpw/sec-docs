# Attack Tree Analysis for mastodon/mastodon

Objective: Attacker's Goal: Gain unauthorized access or control over the application that integrates with Mastodon by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within Mastodon itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   OR: Exploit Mastodon API Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   AND: Discover Vulnerability in Used Endpoint [CRITICAL NODE]
        *   OR: Injection Flaws (e.g., SQLi via parameters, command injection via user input passed to Mastodon) [HIGH RISK PATH]
        *   OR: Authentication/Authorization Bypass [HIGH RISK PATH]
    *   AND: Leverage Vulnerability to Impact Application
        *   OR: Data Exfiltration from Application via Mastodon API (e.g., manipulating data fetched from Mastodon and displayed in the application) [HIGH RISK PATH]
        *   OR: Data Manipulation within Application via Mastodon API (e.g., triggering actions in the application through crafted Mastodon interactions) [HIGH RISK PATH]
