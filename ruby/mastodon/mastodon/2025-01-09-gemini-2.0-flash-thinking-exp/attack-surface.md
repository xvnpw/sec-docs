# Attack Surface Analysis for mastodon/mastodon

## Attack Surface: [Malicious ActivityPub Objects (Federation)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_activitypub_objects__federation_.md)

**Description:**  Crafting and sending specially crafted ActivityPub objects that exploit vulnerabilities in Mastodon's parsing, processing, or state management logic.

**How Mastodon Contributes:** Mastodon's reliance on the ActivityPub protocol for federated communication makes it vulnerable to issues in how it interprets and acts upon received objects from other instances. The complexity of the protocol and the potential for variations in implementation across instances increase the attack surface.

**Example:** An attacker crafts an `Update` activity with a malformed `object` field that, when processed by Mastodon, triggers a buffer overflow or attempts to access restricted resources.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the Mastodon instance, denial of service, data corruption, or bypassing moderation controls.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of all incoming ActivityPub objects, including all fields and nested structures.
    *   Utilize robust parsing libraries and ensure they are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Implement rate limiting and resource quotas for processing incoming federated data.
    *   Employ sandboxing or containerization to isolate the processing of federated data.
    *   Regularly audit and test the ActivityPub handling logic for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Spoofed or Impersonated Federated Actors](./attack_surfaces/spoofed_or_impersonated_federated_actors.md)

**Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in the verification of actor identities when receiving federated data, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users or instances.

**How Mastodon Contributes:** The trust model inherent in federation relies on the correct identification of remote actors. If Mastodon's verification process is flawed or incomplete, attackers can forge identities.

**Example:** An attacker sets up a rogue instance that claims to be a popular verified account, then uses this fake identity to spread misinformation or malicious links.

**Impact:** Spread of misinformation, reputational damage, circumvention of instance blocks, social engineering attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Implement rigorous verification of actor signatures and key ownership for incoming ActivityPub objects.
    *   Utilize secure key exchange mechanisms and ensure proper key management.
    *   Provide clear indicators to users about the origin and verification status of federated content.
    *   Consider implementing mechanisms for users to report suspected impersonation.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Media Files (Federation and Local Uploads)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_media_files__federation_and_local_uploads_.md)

**Description:** Uploading or receiving specially crafted media files (images, videos, audio) that exploit vulnerabilities in Mastodon's processing libraries or lead to other security issues.

**How Mastodon Contributes:** Mastodon needs to process user-uploaded and federated media for display and storage. Vulnerabilities in the libraries used for this processing can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file that, when processed by Mastodon's image library, triggers a buffer overflow leading to remote code execution. Alternatively, a malformed video file could cause excessive resource consumption, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, serving malicious content to users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Utilize secure and up-to-date media processing libraries.
    *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of all uploaded and federated media files.
    *   Perform content security policy (CSP) configuration to restrict the execution of scripts from media URLs.
    *   Consider sandboxing or containerization for media processing tasks.
    *   Implement file size and type restrictions for uploads.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication and authorization mechanisms of Mastodon's API endpoints to gain unauthorized access to data or functionality.

**How Mastodon Contributes:** Mastodon exposes a comprehensive API for various functionalities. Weaknesses in how these endpoints are secured can lead to unauthorized access.

**Example:** An attacker finds an API endpoint that doesn't properly validate user permissions, allowing them to access or modify data belonging to other users.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; account takeover; abuse of API functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0) and enforce proper token validation.
    *   Implement fine-grained authorization controls to ensure users can only access resources they are permitted to.
    *   Regularly audit API endpoints for authentication and authorization vulnerabilities.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting API access.

## Attack Surface: [Admin Interface Brute-Force and Privilege Escalation](./attack_surfaces/admin_interface_brute-force_and_privilege_escalation.md)

**Description:** Attempting to guess administrator credentials or exploiting vulnerabilities to gain elevated privileges within the Mastodon administrative interface.

**How Mastodon Contributes:** The admin interface provides powerful controls over the instance. Weak security here can have significant consequences.

**Example:** An attacker attempts to brute-force administrator login credentials or exploits a vulnerability in the admin panel's code to gain administrative access without proper authentication.

**Impact:** Complete control over the Mastodon instance, including user data, configuration, and the ability to execute arbitrary code.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for administrator accounts.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrator logins.
    *   Regularly audit the admin interface for security vulnerabilities.
    *   Restrict access to the admin interface to specific IP addresses or networks.
    *   Implement robust logging and monitoring of admin actions.
