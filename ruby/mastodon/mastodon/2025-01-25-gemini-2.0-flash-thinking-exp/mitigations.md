# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mastodon/mastodon

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Instance Allow/Deny Lists](./mitigation_strategies/implement_instance_allowdeny_lists.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Policy:** Define criteria for instance federation based on moderation, security, and community reputation relevant to the Mastodon fediverse.
    2.  **Configure Allow/Deny Lists via Mastodon Configuration:**  Modify Mastodon's configuration files (e.g., `.env.production`) to set `ALLOWED_INSTANCES` and `DENIED_INSTANCES` environment variables. These are Mastodon-specific configuration options.
    3.  **Input Instance Domains:** Populate these variables with comma-separated lists of fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) of Mastodon instances to allow or deny federation with. This directly uses Mastodon's built-in federation control.
    4.  **Restart Mastodon Services:** Restart Mastodon services (e.g., `mastodon-web`, `mastodon-sidekiq`, `mastodon-streaming`) for the configuration changes to take effect. This is necessary for Mastodon to apply the new federation rules.
    5.  **Regular Review and Update:** Schedule reviews of these lists, considering community feedback and Mastodon instance reputation within the fediverse ecosystem. Update the lists directly in Mastodon's configuration.
    6.  **Communicate Policy (Mastodon Instance Specific):** Inform users about your instance's federation policy, referencing the use of Mastodon's allow/deny list feature to manage federation.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious Instance Federation (High Severity):**  Federating with a compromised Mastodon instance can introduce threats specific to the fediverse context, like targeted abuse campaigns or misinformation spreading within the Mastodon network.
        *   **Exposure to Poorly Moderated Content (Medium Severity):**  Federating with Mastodon instances with different moderation standards can lead to content conflicts and user dissatisfaction within *your* Mastodon instance community.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion from Unstable Instances (Medium Severity):**  Interacting with poorly maintained Mastodon instances can cause federation errors and performance issues specifically within the Mastodon federation process.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Malicious Instance Federation:**  Significantly reduces risk by leveraging Mastodon's built-in federation controls to prevent connection with potentially harmful actors in the Mastodon network.
        *   **Exposure to Poorly Moderated Content:**  Reduces risk by using Mastodon's configuration to limit exposure to instances with content policies incompatible with your Mastodon community standards.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion from Unstable Instances:**  Reduces risk by using Mastodon's settings to avoid communication with unreliable Mastodon instances, improving your instance's stability within the fediverse.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Mastodon software provides the `ALLOWED_INSTANCES` and `DENIED_INSTANCES` configuration options. Documentation within the Mastodon project explains their usage.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  No user-friendly interface within the Mastodon admin panel to manage these lists. Management is purely through direct configuration file editing, which is less accessible to some Mastodon instance administrators. No automated tools or suggestions *within Mastodon itself* for list curation are provided.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting Federated Requests](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_federated_requests.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Mastodon Rate Limiting Configuration:** Locate Mastodon's rate limiting configuration, which might involve Rack::Attack or similar middleware integrated into the Mastodon application. Configuration files are within the Mastodon codebase (e.g., `config/initializers/rack_attack.rb`).
    2.  **Configure Rate Limits for Mastodon Federation Endpoints:**  Define rate limits specifically for Mastodon endpoints handling federation, such as `/inbox`, `/api/v1/push`, and endpoints related to federated timelines. These endpoints are specific to Mastodon's federation implementation.
    3.  **Set Appropriate Limits (Mastodon Context):** Determine rate limits based on expected legitimate federation traffic *within the Mastodon network* and your server capacity. Consider the typical federation patterns of Mastodon instances.
    4.  **Utilize Mastodon's Rate Limiting Mechanisms:** Configure rate limiting using the tools and libraries already integrated within Mastodon (like Rack::Attack). This ensures compatibility with Mastodon's application structure.
    5.  **Monitoring and Adjustment (Mastodon Specific):** Monitor rate limiting effectiveness and Mastodon instance performance, specifically focusing on federation-related metrics. Analyze Mastodon logs to identify DoS attempts targeting federation or legitimate Mastodon traffic being limited. Adjust rate limits within Mastodon's configuration.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Federated Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity):** Malicious Mastodon instances or actors within the fediverse could target your instance with federation requests, exploiting Mastodon's federation protocols to cause service disruption.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion from Misconfigured Instances (Medium Severity):**  Legitimate but poorly configured or overloaded Mastodon instances might send excessive federation requests, unintentionally impacting your Mastodon instance's performance due to the nature of Mastodon's federation.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Federated DoS Attacks:**  Significantly reduces the impact of DoS attacks targeting Mastodon's federation by limiting the rate of malicious requests processed by the Mastodon application, preserving resources for legitimate Mastodon federation and users.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion from Misconfigured Instances:**  Reduces the impact of unintentional resource exhaustion caused by other Mastodon instances, maintaining your instance's stability within the fediverse context.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Mastodon likely includes default rate limiting configurations using Rack::Attack or similar, but these might need tuning for optimal protection against federation-specific threats.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  More granular control over rate limiting *specifically for Mastodon federation endpoints* within the admin panel.  Potentially, dynamic rate limiting within Mastodon that adapts to federation traffic patterns.  Improved documentation *within the Mastodon project* on configuring federation-specific rate limits.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Filtering and Moderation for Federated Content](./mitigation_strategies/content_filtering_and_moderation_for_federated_content.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Content Moderation Policies for Mastodon Federated Content:** Extend your instance's moderation policies to explicitly address content received via Mastodon's federation, considering the unique context of the fediverse and Mastodon's content types (toots, media, etc.).
    2.  **Utilize Mastodon's Keyword Filters:** Configure keyword filters within Mastodon's admin panel. These filters are a built-in Mastodon feature and should be applied to federated content displayed within your Mastodon instance.
    3.  **Implement Media Content Analysis (Mastodon Integration):** Explore and implement media content analysis tools that can integrate with Mastodon's media handling processes. This would require either existing Mastodon plugins or custom development to work with Mastodon's architecture.
    4.  **Enhance Mastodon Reporting Mechanisms for Federated Content:** Ensure users can easily report federated content through Mastodon's reporting interface. The reporting system is a core Mastodon feature and needs to clearly handle federated content reports.
    5.  **Train Moderators on Mastodon Federated Content Moderation:** Train moderators on handling content from the Mastodon fediverse, understanding the context of toots from different instances, and using Mastodon's moderation tools effectively for federated content.
    6.  **Establish Escalation Procedures (Fediverse Context):** Define procedures for complex moderation cases involving federated content, potentially including communication with moderators of the originating Mastodon instance (while respecting Mastodon's data privacy considerations and federation protocols).

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exposure to Illegal or Harmful Content (High Severity):**  Mastodon federation can expose users to illegal or harmful content originating from other Mastodon instances in the fediverse.
        *   **Negative User Experience (Medium Severity):**  Exposure to spam, irrelevant toots, or content violating community norms from federated Mastodon instances can degrade the user experience on *your* Mastodon instance.
        *   **Increased Moderation Workload (Medium Severity):**  Federated content within Mastodon can increase the volume of content requiring moderation on your instance.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exposure to Illegal or Harmful Content:**  Reduces risk by using Mastodon's features and potential integrations to filter and moderate harmful content within the fediverse context.
        *   **Negative User Experience:**  Improves user experience on your Mastodon instance by reducing exposure to unwanted content from the fediverse.
        *   **Increased Moderation Workload:**  Helps manage moderation workload within Mastodon by using its built-in tools and potentially adding integrations for content analysis.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Mastodon has keyword filters and reporting mechanisms that are functional for federated content. Moderators can use Mastodon's moderation tools on federated content.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  More advanced content analysis tools *integrated with Mastodon's media handling*. Potentially, instance-level content filtering policies *within Mastodon's configuration* for specific fediverse instances. Better tools *within Mastodon's moderator interface* to understand the origin and context of federated content.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Mastodon Updates and Patch Management](./mitigation_strategies/regular_mastodon_updates_and_patch_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Mastodon Security Advisories:** Regularly check for security advisories released by the Mastodon project (via GitHub, official channels, security mailing lists). These advisories are specific to vulnerabilities found in the Mastodon software.
    2.  **Establish Update Process:** Create a process for promptly applying Mastodon updates, including security patches. This process should be tailored to your Mastodon deployment method (e.g., source, Docker, package manager).
    3.  **Test Updates in Staging (Recommended):** Before applying updates to your production Mastodon instance, test them in a staging environment that mirrors your production setup. This helps identify potential compatibility issues or regressions *within Mastodon itself* before production deployment.
    4.  **Apply Updates Methodically:** Apply updates to your production Mastodon instance during a planned maintenance window. Follow the update instructions provided by the Mastodon project.
    5.  **Verify Update Success:** After applying updates, verify that your Mastodon instance is functioning correctly and that the security patches have been applied as intended. Check Mastodon's version information and relevant logs.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Mastodon Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Failure to apply Mastodon security updates leaves your instance vulnerable to exploitation of publicly known vulnerabilities in the Mastodon software, potentially leading to data breaches, server compromise, or service disruption.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Mastodon Vulnerabilities:**  Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation by addressing known security flaws in the Mastodon codebase, protecting your instance and user data.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**  Responsibility of the instance administrator. Mastodon project provides update instructions and security advisories.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  No automated update mechanism *within Mastodon itself*. Update process is manual and requires administrator intervention. No built-in notifications *within Mastodon admin panel* about available security updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Instance Configuration and Hardening](./mitigation_strategies/secure_instance_configuration_and_hardening.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Mastodon Configuration Options:** Thoroughly review all available configuration options in Mastodon's configuration files (e.g., `.env.production`, `config/*.yml`). Understand the security implications of each setting.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Mastodon Features:** Disable any Mastodon features or functionalities that are not essential for your instance and could increase the attack surface. This might include specific API endpoints, optional features, or less secure protocols if alternatives are available within Mastodon.
    3.  **Harden Mastodon Specific Services:**  Apply hardening measures to services directly related to Mastodon, such as the web server (Puma, Nginx), database (PostgreSQL), and Redis. Follow security best practices *relevant to these technologies in the context of a Mastodon application*.
    4.  **Secure Mastodon Secrets and Keys:**  Properly secure Mastodon's secret keys, API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information. Use strong, randomly generated secrets and store them securely (e.g., environment variables, secure vault). Follow Mastodon's recommendations for secret management.
    5.  **Regular Security Audits of Mastodon Configuration:** Periodically review your Mastodon instance configuration to ensure it remains secure and aligned with security best practices.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Configuration Vulnerabilities in Mastodon (Medium to High Severity):**  Insecure or default Mastodon configurations can introduce vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Mastodon Instance (Medium to High Severity):**  Weak security configurations can make it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access to your Mastodon instance and its underlying systems.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Configuration Vulnerabilities in Mastodon:**  Reduces risk by ensuring Mastodon is configured securely, minimizing potential attack vectors arising from misconfiguration.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Mastodon Instance:**  Reduces risk by hardening the instance and making it more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Responsibility of the instance administrator. Mastodon documentation provides configuration guidance, but security hardening is largely left to the administrator.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  More comprehensive security hardening guides *specifically for Mastodon*.  Potentially, a security configuration checklist or automated security scanning tools *integrated with Mastodon* to help administrators identify and remediate configuration weaknesses.
