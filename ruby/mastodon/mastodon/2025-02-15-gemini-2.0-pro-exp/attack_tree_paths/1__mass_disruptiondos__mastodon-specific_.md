# Deep Analysis of Mastodon Attack Tree Path: Mass Disruption/DoS via Federation

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the identified attack path (Mass Disruption/DoS via Federation Exploits) within the Mastodon attack tree.  This involves:

*   Identifying specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors related to the ActivityPub protocol and relay configurations.
*   Assessing the feasibility and potential impact of these attacks.
*   Proposing concrete mitigation strategies and security recommendations to enhance Mastodon's resilience against these threats.
*   Prioritizing remediation efforts based on risk level.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following attack tree path:

1.  Mass Disruption/DoS (Mastodon-Specific)
    *   1.1 Exploit Federation Protocol Vulnerabilities
        *   1.1.1 ActivityPub Implementation Flaws
            *   1.1.1.1 Denial of Service via Malformed Activities
            *   1.1.1.3 Bypassing Rate Limiting for Federated Actions
    *   1.2 Abuse of Instance Configuration
        *   1.2.1 Exploiting Weakly Configured Relays (if used)
            *   1.2.1.1 Amplification Attacks via Open Relays

The analysis will consider the Mastodon codebase (as available on [https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon)), relevant documentation, and known vulnerabilities in similar ActivityPub implementations.  It will *not* cover client-side attacks, social engineering, or physical security.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examining the Mastodon source code, particularly the sections responsible for handling ActivityPub messages, rate limiting, and relay interactions.  This will involve searching for potential vulnerabilities such as:
    *   Insufficient input validation.
    *   Lack of resource limits (memory, CPU, database connections).
    *   Improper error handling.
    *   Logic flaws in rate limiting and relay management.
    *   Use of vulnerable libraries or dependencies.

2.  **Threat Modeling:**  Developing attack scenarios based on the identified vulnerabilities and assessing their potential impact.  This will involve considering:
    *   Attacker capabilities and motivations.
    *   The likelihood of successful exploitation.
    *   The potential damage to the Mastodon instance and its users.

3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Investigating known vulnerabilities in ActivityPub implementations and related technologies.  This will involve searching vulnerability databases (CVE, NVD), security advisories, and research papers.

4.  **Fuzzing (Conceptual):** While full-scale fuzzing is outside the scope of this document, we will *conceptually* describe how fuzzing could be used to identify vulnerabilities. This involves generating a large number of malformed or unexpected inputs and observing the system's response.

5.  **Best Practices Review:**  Comparing Mastodon's implementation against established security best practices for distributed systems and web applications.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

### 1.1 Exploit Federation Protocol Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]

#### 1.1.1 ActivityPub Implementation Flaws

##### 1.1.1.1 Denial of Service via Malformed Activities [HIGH RISK]

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   `app/lib/activitypub/` directory:  This is the core of Mastodon's ActivityPub handling.  We need to examine the parsing logic for each ActivityPub activity type (e.g., `Create`, `Announce`, `Follow`, `Delete`, etc.).  Specific files like `parser.rb`, `processor.rb`, and individual activity handlers are critical.
    *   Input validation:  Look for places where the size, type, and structure of incoming ActivityPub data are checked.  Are there limits on string lengths, array sizes, object nesting depth?  Are regular expressions used for validation, and if so, are they vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service)?
    *   Resource allocation:  How does Mastodon allocate memory and other resources when processing activities?  Are there checks to prevent excessive memory allocation?  Are database queries optimized to avoid performance bottlenecks?
    *   Error handling:  How does Mastodon handle errors during ActivityPub processing?  Does it gracefully recover from invalid input, or could an error lead to a crash or hang?  Are errors logged appropriately for debugging and auditing?
    *   Object processing: Examine how Mastodon processes `object` fields within activities.  Are there recursive functions that could be exploited with deeply nested objects?

*   **Threat Modeling:**
    *   **Scenario 1: Oversized Payload:** An attacker sends an `Announce` activity with a massive `object` field (e.g., a multi-gigabyte string).  The server attempts to load this entire string into memory, leading to memory exhaustion and a crash.
    *   **Scenario 2: Deeply Nested Objects:** An attacker sends a `Create` activity with a deeply nested `attributedTo` chain (e.g., hundreds of levels deep).  The server's recursive parsing logic consumes excessive stack space, leading to a stack overflow and a crash.
    *   **Scenario 3: ReDoS:** An attacker sends an activity with a specially crafted string that triggers a catastrophic backtracking scenario in a vulnerable regular expression used for validation.  This causes the server to spend a disproportionate amount of CPU time processing the request, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Scenario 4: Integer Overflow:** An attacker sends an activity with a numeric field that exceeds the maximum allowed value, leading to an integer overflow and unexpected behavior.
    *   **Scenario 5: Unhandled Activity Type:** An attacker sends a custom, unknown ActivityPub activity type. If Mastodon doesn't properly handle unknown types, this could lead to unexpected errors or vulnerabilities.

*   **Vulnerability Research:**
    *   Search for CVEs related to "ActivityPub", "DoS", "memory exhaustion", "ReDoS", and "input validation" in Mastodon and other ActivityPub implementations.
    *   Look for security advisories from other ActivityPub projects (e.g., Pleroma, Misskey).

*   **Fuzzing (Conceptual):**
    *   Develop a fuzzer that generates a wide range of malformed ActivityPub messages, varying the size, type, and structure of different fields.
    *   Send these messages to a test Mastodon instance and monitor its resource usage (CPU, memory, network) and error logs.
    *   Identify any inputs that cause crashes, hangs, or excessive resource consumption.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation at multiple levels (before parsing, during parsing, and before processing).  Validate the size, type, and structure of all incoming data.  Use well-tested and secure regular expressions.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce strict limits on the size of incoming requests, the size of individual fields, the depth of object nesting, and the number of database queries per request.
    *   **Robust Error Handling:** Implement graceful error handling to prevent crashes and hangs.  Log all errors with sufficient detail for debugging and auditing.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting (see 1.1.1.3) to prevent attackers from flooding the server with requests.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Use a WAF to filter out malicious requests before they reach the Mastodon server.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Keep all dependencies up-to-date and regularly scan for known vulnerabilities.

##### 1.1.1.3 Bypassing Rate Limiting for Federated Actions [HIGH RISK]

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   `app/models/rate_limit.rb`: This file likely contains the core rate-limiting logic.  Examine how rate limits are calculated, stored, and enforced.
    *   `app/controllers/concerns/rate_limited.rb`: This concern might be included in controllers that need rate limiting.  Check how it interacts with the `RateLimit` model.
    *   Redis or other caching mechanisms:  Mastodon likely uses Redis or another caching system to store rate limit counters.  Examine how this integration works and whether there are any potential race conditions or bypasses.
    *   IP address handling:  How does Mastodon determine the IP address of the requesting instance?  Is it vulnerable to IP spoofing or header manipulation (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For`)?
    *   Timestamp handling:  How are timestamps used in the rate-limiting logic?  Are they vulnerable to manipulation?
    *   Federated request identification: How does Mastodon identify incoming requests as federated requests, to apply the correct rate limits?

*   **Threat Modeling:**
    *   **Scenario 1: IP Spoofing:** An attacker uses a botnet or proxy network to send requests from many different IP addresses, circumventing per-IP rate limits.
    *   **Scenario 2: Header Manipulation:** An attacker manipulates the `X-Forwarded-For` header to make it appear as if requests are coming from different IP addresses.
    *   **Scenario 3: Timestamp Manipulation:** An attacker finds a way to manipulate the timestamps used in the rate-limiting logic, resetting the counters or making it appear as if requests are older than they are.
    *   **Scenario 4: Race Condition:** An attacker exploits a race condition in the rate-limiting logic to send multiple requests within the same time window, exceeding the allowed limit.
    *   **Scenario 5: Account Cycling:** An attacker creates multiple accounts on different Mastodon instances and uses them to send requests, circumventing per-account rate limits.

*   **Vulnerability Research:**
    *   Search for CVEs related to "rate limiting bypass", "IP spoofing", "header manipulation", and "race condition" in Mastodon and other web applications.

*   **Fuzzing (Conceptual):**
    *   Develop a fuzzer that sends a large number of requests from different IP addresses (simulated or real) and with varying headers and timestamps.
    *   Monitor the server's response and rate limit counters to identify any bypasses.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust IP Address Handling:** Use a reliable method to determine the true IP address of the requesting instance, taking into account proxies and load balancers.  Validate the `X-Forwarded-For` header carefully.
    *   **Secure Timestamp Handling:** Use a secure and reliable source of time (e.g., NTP).  Do not rely on client-provided timestamps.
    *   **Atomic Operations:** Use atomic operations (e.g., Redis `INCR`) to update rate limit counters, preventing race conditions.
    *   **Multiple Rate Limits:** Implement multiple layers of rate limiting, including per-IP, per-account, and global rate limits.
    *   **Account Verification:** Implement measures to prevent the creation of large numbers of fake accounts (e.g., CAPTCHAs, email verification).
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor rate limit violations and set up alerts to notify administrators of suspicious activity.
    *   **Consider Instance-Based Rate Limiting:** Instead of just IP-based, consider rate limiting based on the sending instance's domain, if feasible. This is harder to spoof.

#### 1.2 Abuse of Instance Configuration

##### 1.2.1 Exploiting Weakly Configured Relays (if used) [HIGH RISK]

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Documentation: Review Mastodon's documentation on relays to understand how they are intended to be used and configured.
    *   Configuration files: Examine the configuration files related to relays (e.g., `config/relay.yml`) to understand the available options and their security implications.
    *   Relay interaction code:  Identify the code that handles communication with relays.  How does Mastodon authenticate with relays?  How does it validate messages received from relays?
    *   Default settings: What are the default settings for relay configuration? Are they secure by default?

*   **Threat Modeling:**
    *   **Scenario 1: Amplification Attack:** An attacker sends a small number of requests to an open relay, which then amplifies those requests and forwards them to many other instances, overwhelming the target.
    *   **Scenario 2: Malicious Content Distribution:** An attacker uses an open relay to distribute spam, phishing links, or other malicious content to a large number of Mastodon users.
    *   **Scenario 3: Relay Poisoning:** An attacker compromises a relay and uses it to inject malicious data into the Mastodon network.

*   **Vulnerability Research:**
    *   Search for information on known attacks against Mastodon relays or similar relay systems.

*   **Fuzzing (Conceptual):**
    *   Set up a test Mastodon instance with an open relay.
    *   Send a variety of requests to the relay, varying the size, type, and content of the messages.
    *   Monitor the relay's behavior and the impact on other instances.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Relay Configuration:**  Provide clear and concise documentation on how to configure relays securely.  Recommend or require authentication for relays.
    *   **Access Control:**  Implement access control lists (ACLs) to restrict which instances can use a relay.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on relays to prevent amplification attacks.
    *   **Message Validation:**  Validate messages received from relays to ensure they are well-formed and do not contain malicious content.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Monitor relay activity and set up alerts to notify administrators of suspicious behavior.
    *   **Discourage Open Relays:** Strongly advise against running open relays without strong justification and security measures.  Provide clear warnings about the risks.
    *   **Relay Allowlist/Denylist:** Implement a system for allowing or denying specific relays based on their reputation or security posture.
    *   **Educate Administrators:** Provide training and resources to Mastodon administrators on how to securely configure and manage their instances, including relays.

## 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

This deep analysis has identified several high-risk vulnerabilities within the specified attack tree path.  The most critical areas of concern are:

*   **Malformed ActivityPub Activities:**  The potential for attackers to craft malicious ActivityPub messages that cause denial-of-service conditions due to insufficient input validation, lack of resource limits, and improper error handling.
*   **Rate Limiting Bypass:**  The possibility of attackers circumventing rate limits through various techniques, enabling them to flood the server with requests.
*   **Open Relay Abuse:**  The risk of attackers exploiting open or poorly secured relays to amplify attacks and distribute malicious content.

To mitigate these risks, the following recommendations are prioritized:

1.  **Immediate Action:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and resource limits for all ActivityPub activity processing. This is the *highest priority* and should be addressed immediately.
    *   Review and strengthen rate-limiting mechanisms, addressing potential bypasses related to IP spoofing, header manipulation, and race conditions.
    *   Provide clear guidance and warnings to administrators about the risks of open relays and strongly recommend secure configurations.

2.  **Short-Term Actions:**
    *   Conduct a thorough security audit of the ActivityPub handling code, focusing on the areas identified in this analysis.
    *   Develop and implement a comprehensive fuzzing strategy for ActivityPub processing.
    *   Improve monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity related to federation and relays.

3.  **Long-Term Actions:**
    *   Consider implementing a more robust relay management system with features like allowlists/denylists and reputation-based filtering.
    *   Explore the possibility of incorporating formal verification techniques to prove the correctness and security of critical code sections.
    *   Continuously monitor for new vulnerabilities and attack vectors related to ActivityPub and federation.
    *   Engage with the broader ActivityPub security community to share knowledge and best practices.

By implementing these recommendations, the Mastodon development team can significantly enhance the platform's resilience against denial-of-service attacks and other threats related to federation.  Regular security reviews and proactive vulnerability management are essential to maintaining a secure and reliable social network.
