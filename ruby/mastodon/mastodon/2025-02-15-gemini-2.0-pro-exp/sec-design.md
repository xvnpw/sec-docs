*   Maintaining a positive and safe user experience.
*   Ensuring the platform's stability and scalability.
*   Fostering a vibrant and diverse ecosystem of instances.
*   Protecting user privacy and data.
*   Decentralized governance and community ownership.

Business Goals:

*   Provide a viable, user-friendly alternative to centralized social media.
*   Empower users with control over their data and online experience.
*   Create a sustainable and resilient social network infrastructure.
*   Promote open-source development and community contributions.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Failure to attract and retain a critical mass of users.
*   Reputational damage due to security breaches, privacy violations, or moderation failures.
*   Scalability issues hindering performance and user experience.
*   Fragmentation of the network and lack of interoperability between instances.
*   Legal and regulatory challenges related to content moderation and data privacy.
*   Lack of funding and resources for ongoing development and maintenance.
*   Malicious attacks, including DDoS, spam, and coordinated disinformation campaigns.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on the provided GitHub repository and general knowledge of similar projects):

*   security control: Ruby on Rails framework: Provides built-in security features like protection against common web vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS, SQL injection). Implemented in the codebase.
*   security control: Devise gem: Handles user authentication, including password hashing and storage, session management, and account recovery. Implemented in the codebase.
*   security control: Two-factor authentication (2FA): Offers an additional layer of security for user accounts. Implemented in the codebase.
*   security control: Rate limiting: Helps prevent abuse and brute-force attacks. Implemented in the codebase and potentially at the infrastructure level.
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP): Mitigates XSS attacks by controlling the resources the browser is allowed to load. Implemented in the codebase and web server configuration.
*   security control: HTTPS: Encrypts communication between clients and servers. Implemented in the web server configuration and deployment infrastructure.
*   security control: Regular security audits and penetration testing: (Assumed) Conducted periodically to identify and address vulnerabilities. Described in security documentation (if available).
*   security control: Dependency vulnerability scanning: (Assumed) Tools like Bundler-audit or Dependabot are used to identify and update vulnerable dependencies. Implemented in the build process.
*   security control: Code review process: (Assumed) All code changes are reviewed by other developers before merging. Implemented in the development workflow.
*   security control: Moderation tools: Allow instance administrators to manage content and user behavior. Implemented in the codebase.
*   security control: Data sanitization and validation: Input from users is sanitized and validated to prevent injection attacks. Implemented in the codebase.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Decentralized nature: While a core feature, decentralization introduces challenges in enforcing consistent security policies and responding to incidents across all instances.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party libraries: Like any project, Mastodon relies on external libraries, which may contain vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: User-generated content: Moderating user-generated content is an ongoing challenge, and there's always a risk of malicious or inappropriate content slipping through.
*   accepted risk: Instance administrator competence: The security of individual Mastodon instances depends heavily on the competence and diligence of their administrators.
*   accepted risk: Open-source nature: While beneficial for transparency and community contributions, it also means that vulnerabilities are publicly visible.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a robust Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) with clear guidelines and procedures.
*   Conduct regular threat modeling exercises to proactively identify and address potential security risks.
*   Implement a bug bounty program to incentivize external security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.
*   Provide comprehensive security documentation and training for instance administrators.
*   Develop and maintain a centralized security incident response plan.
*   Implement more advanced intrusion detection and prevention systems.
*   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Strong password policies enforced.
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (already implemented).
    *   Secure session management.
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks.
    *   Secure account recovery mechanisms.
*   Authorization:
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user roles (e.g., users, moderators, administrators).
    *   Fine-grained control over access to resources and features.
    *   Proper authorization checks before performing sensitive actions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQL injection, etc.).
    *   Use of whitelisting rather than blacklisting where possible.
    *   Proper encoding of output to prevent XSS.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    *   Secure storage of sensitive data, including passwords (hashed and salted).
    *   Protection of data in transit using HTTPS.
    *   Proper key management practices.

## BUILD

The Mastodon build process involves several steps, from code changes to the creation of deployable artifacts (in this case, Docker images).

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Build Process
        A[Developer Workstation]
        B[Git Repository (GitHub)]
        C[CI Server (e.g., GitHub Actions)]
        D[Docker Registry]
        E[Dependency Cache]
        A -- Code Changes --> B
        B -- Trigger --> C
        C -- Fetch Code --> B
        C -- Use Dependencies --> E
        C -- Run Tests --> C
        C -- Build Docker Images --> C
        C -- Push Images --> D
    end
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer makes code changes on their local workstation.
2.  Changes are committed and pushed to the Git repository (GitHub).
3.  A push to the repository triggers the CI server (e.g., GitHub Actions).
4.  The CI server fetches the code from the repository.
5.  The CI server uses cached dependencies or downloads them.
6.  The CI server runs various checks:
    *   Linters (e.g., RuboCop for Ruby, ESLint for JavaScript) to enforce code style and identify potential errors.
    *   Security scanners (e.g., Brakeman for Ruby on Rails, npm audit for Node.js) to detect security vulnerabilities.
    *   Unit tests and integration tests to ensure code correctness.
7.  If all checks pass, the CI server builds Docker images for the different components (web, sidekiq, streaming).
8.  The built Docker images are pushed to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry).

Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   security control: Code review: All code changes are reviewed by other developers before merging.
*   security control: Linters: Enforce code style and identify potential errors.
*   security control: SAST (Static Application Security Testing): Security scanners (Brakeman, npm audit) are used to detect vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: Dependency vulnerability scanning: Tools like Bundler-audit or Dependabot are used to identify and update vulnerable dependencies.
*   security control: Automated testing: Unit tests and integration tests help ensure code correctness and prevent regressions.
*   security control: Signed commits (optional): Developers can sign their commits to verify their authenticity.
*   security control: Docker image signing (optional): Docker images can be signed to ensure their integrity and prevent tampering.

# RISK ASSESSMENT
