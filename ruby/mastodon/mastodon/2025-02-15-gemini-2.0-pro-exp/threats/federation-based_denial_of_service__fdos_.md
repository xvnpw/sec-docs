Okay, here's a deep analysis of the Federation-Based Denial of Service (FDoS) threat, tailored for the Mastodon development team, presented in Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: Federation-Based Denial of Service (FDoS) in Mastodon

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the FDoS threat against Mastodon instances, identify specific vulnerabilities within the Mastodon codebase and architecture, and propose concrete, actionable improvements to enhance resilience against this type of attack.  We aim to move beyond general mitigation strategies and pinpoint specific code locations and logic that require modification.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the FDoS threat as described.  It encompasses:

*   **Code Analysis:**  Examining the Mastodon codebase (Ruby on Rails application) to identify areas vulnerable to FDoS.  This includes, but is not limited to, the `app/workers/` directory, controllers handling ActivityPub requests, and database interaction logic.
*   **Architectural Review:**  Assessing how Mastodon's architecture (Puma/Nginx, Sidekiq, PostgreSQL, Redis) handles federated traffic and identifying potential bottlenecks.
*   **Mitigation Implementation:**  Proposing specific, code-level changes and configuration adjustments to improve Mastodon's resistance to FDoS attacks.
*   **Testing Considerations:**  Outlining testing strategies to validate the effectiveness of proposed mitigations.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Generic DDoS attacks unrelated to Mastodon's federation.
*   Security vulnerabilities outside the scope of FDoS.
*   Non-technical aspects like legal or policy responses.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Reiterate the threat model's description and impact to ensure a shared understanding.
2.  **Codebase Exploration:**  Use static code analysis techniques (e.g., `grep`, code browsing, dependency analysis) to identify relevant code sections.  Focus on:
    *   ActivityPub message processing (e.g., `app/controllers/api/v1/statuses_controller.rb`, `app/services/activitypub/`, `app/workers/`).
    *   Rate limiting implementations (if any).
    *   Database query patterns related to federated data.
    *   Error handling and logging related to incoming requests.
3.  **Architectural Analysis:**  Examine how Mastodon components interact during federated activity processing, identifying potential bottlenecks and single points of failure.
4.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Pinpoint specific code sections or architectural designs that contribute to FDoS vulnerability.
5.  **Mitigation Proposal:**  Suggest concrete code changes, configuration adjustments, and architectural improvements to address identified vulnerabilities.
6.  **Testing Recommendations:**  Outline testing strategies to validate the effectiveness of proposed mitigations.

## 2. Threat Model Review (Recap)

**Threat:** Federation-Based Denial of Service (FDoS)

**Description:**  Malicious instances flood the target instance with legitimate-appearing ActivityPub messages, overwhelming resources.

**Impact:** Denial of Service, resource exhaustion, increased costs.

**Affected Components:** Web server (Puma/Nginx), Sidekiq workers, PostgreSQL, Redis, network infrastructure.

**Risk Severity:** High

## 3. Codebase Exploration and Vulnerability Identification

This section details the findings from examining the Mastodon codebase.

### 3.1 ActivityPub Message Handling

The core vulnerability lies in how Mastodon processes incoming ActivityPub messages.  The following areas are critical:

*   **`app/controllers/inbox_controller.rb`:** This controller likely handles the initial reception of federated activities.  It needs to be scrutinized for:
    *   **Lack of early validation:**  Are messages validated *before* significant processing occurs?  Invalid or oversized messages should be rejected immediately.
    *   **Insufficient rate limiting:**  Are there checks to limit the rate of incoming requests from a single instance or IP address *at this early stage*?
    *   **Asynchronous processing without limits:**  Are tasks immediately queued to Sidekiq without considering the queue size or the origin of the request?

*   **`app/workers/` (Various Workers):**  Workers like `ProcessDeliveryWorker`, `ProcessInboxWorker`, and others responsible for processing federated activities are prime targets.  Key concerns:
    *   **Unbounded queue growth:**  Can a malicious instance flood the Sidekiq queues, leading to memory exhaustion and worker starvation?
    *   **Lack of per-instance resource limits:**  Are there mechanisms to limit the resources (CPU, memory, database connections) consumed by processing activities from a single instance?
    *   **Inefficient database queries:**  Are workers performing expensive database queries for each incoming message, potentially exacerbating the DoS?
    *   **Lack of retry limits and dead-letter queues:** Are failing jobs retried indefinitely, further consuming resources?

*   **`app/services/activitypub/`:** This directory contains services related to ActivityPub processing.  It's crucial to examine:
    *   **Object creation and validation:**  Are large or complex ActivityPub objects created and validated without limits, potentially leading to memory exhaustion?
    *   **External resource fetching:**  Are external resources (e.g., profile images, attachments) fetched without limits or timeouts, making the instance vulnerable to slowloris-type attacks?

### 3.2 Rate Limiting (Current State)

Mastodon *does* have some rate limiting, primarily focused on API usage by authenticated users.  However, this is insufficient for FDoS:

*   **`Rack::Attack`:** Mastodon uses `Rack::Attack` for some rate limiting.  This is typically configured in `config/initializers/rack_attack.rb`.  However, this is often applied *after* the request has already entered the Rails application and potentially triggered some processing.  It needs to be configured to be much more aggressive for unauthenticated, federated requests.
*   **Lack of per-instance rate limiting:**  Existing rate limiting often focuses on individual users or IP addresses.  There's a critical need for rate limiting *per federating instance*.

### 3.3 Database Interactions

*   **Inefficient queries:**  Federated activities often involve database lookups (e.g., finding existing accounts, statuses).  Inefficient queries (e.g., missing indexes, full table scans) can be exploited to amplify the impact of an FDoS attack.  The `app/models/` directory, particularly models related to accounts, statuses, and follows, should be reviewed for query optimization.
*   **Database connection exhaustion:**  A flood of requests can exhaust the database connection pool, preventing legitimate users from accessing the instance.

### 3.4 Error Handling and Logging

*   **Insufficient logging:**  Detailed logging of incoming federated requests, including the originating instance, request type, and processing time, is crucial for detecting and diagnosing FDoS attacks.  Current logging may not be granular enough.
*   **Lack of error rate monitoring:**  Monitoring the rate of errors related to federated activity processing can provide early warning of an attack.

## 4. Mitigation Proposal

This section outlines specific, actionable recommendations to mitigate the FDoS threat.

### 4.1 Enhanced Rate Limiting

*   **Per-Instance Rate Limiting (Critical):** Implement rate limiting *within the Mastodon application code* (e.g., in `InboxController` or a dedicated middleware) based on the originating instance's domain.  This should be configurable by administrators and should be aggressive by default.  This could involve:
    *   Using Redis to track request counts per instance within a sliding time window.
    *   Rejecting requests exceeding the limit with a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
    *   Providing a mechanism to temporarily or permanently "silence" or block instances exceeding limits.

*   **Early Rate Limiting with `Rack::Attack`:** Configure `Rack::Attack` to apply rate limits *before* the request reaches the Rails application, specifically targeting unauthenticated requests from federated instances.  This can act as a first line of defense.

*   **IP Address Rate Limiting (Secondary):**  While less effective against distributed attacks, maintain IP address rate limiting as a secondary measure.

### 4.2 Sidekiq Queue Management

*   **Per-Instance Queues (Ideal):**  Ideally, implement separate Sidekiq queues for each federating instance.  This would isolate the impact of a malicious instance to its own queue, preventing it from affecting other instances.  This is a significant architectural change.

*   **Queue Size Limits:**  Implement limits on the size of Sidekiq queues, particularly those processing federated activities.  Reject new jobs when the queue reaches a configurable threshold.

*   **Worker Resource Limits:**  Explore options for limiting the resources (CPU, memory) consumed by Sidekiq workers processing federated activities from a single instance.  This might involve using Sidekiq's concurrency settings or more advanced techniques like cgroups (if feasible).

*   **Retry Limits and Dead-Letter Queues:**  Ensure that failed jobs are retried a limited number of times and then moved to a dead-letter queue for investigation.

### 4.3 Input Validation and Sanitization

*   **Early Validation:**  Validate incoming ActivityPub messages *early* in the processing pipeline (e.g., in `InboxController`).  Reject invalid or oversized messages immediately.
*   **Object Size Limits:**  Enforce limits on the size of ActivityPub objects (e.g., post content, attachments) to prevent memory exhaustion.
*   **External Resource Fetching Limits:**  Implement timeouts and size limits when fetching external resources (e.g., profile images).

### 4.4 Database Optimization

*   **Query Optimization:**  Review and optimize database queries related to federated activities.  Ensure proper indexing and avoid full table scans.  Use tools like the `pg_stat_statements` extension in PostgreSQL to identify slow queries.
*   **Connection Pool Management:**  Monitor and tune the database connection pool size to ensure sufficient connections are available.

### 4.5 Enhanced Monitoring and Alerting

*   **Federated Activity Logging:**  Implement detailed logging of incoming federated requests, including the originating instance, request type, processing time, and any errors encountered.
*   **Error Rate Monitoring:**  Monitor the rate of errors related to federated activity processing.  Trigger alerts when the error rate exceeds a threshold.
*   **Resource Usage Monitoring:**  Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, database connections) and trigger alerts when anomalies are detected.
*   **Instance Blocking/Silencing Tools:**  Provide administrators with easy-to-use tools *within the Mastodon admin interface* to quickly block or silence problematic instances.

### 4.6 Code Examples (Illustrative)

**Example: Per-Instance Rate Limiting (Conceptual)**

```ruby
# app/controllers/inbox_controller.rb

class InboxController < ApplicationController
  before_action :rate_limit_instance

  def create
    # ... process ActivityPub message ...
  end

  private

  def rate_limit_instance
    instance_domain = extract_instance_domain(request.headers['Signature']) # Implement this method
    return unless instance_domain

    rate_limiter = InstanceRateLimiter.new(instance_domain)
    if rate_limiter.exceeded?
      render json: { error: 'Too many requests from this instance' }, status: :too_many_requests
      return
    end

    rate_limiter.increment
  end

  def extract_instance_domain(signature_header)
      #parse signature and return domain
      return ""
  end
end

# app/lib/instance_rate_limiter.rb (Conceptual)

class InstanceRateLimiter
  def initialize(instance_domain, limit: 100, window: 60) # Configurable limits
    @instance_domain = instance_domain
    @limit = limit
    @window = window
    @redis = Redis.current # Or your Redis connection
  end

  def exceeded?
    @redis.get(@instance_domain).to_i > @limit
  end

  def increment
    @redis.incr(@instance_domain)
    @redis.expire(@instance_domain, @window) # Set expiration for the counter
  end
end
```

**Example: Sidekiq Queue Size Limit (Conceptual)**

```ruby
# config/sidekiq.yml

:queues:
  - [federated_inbox, 5] # Limit the federated_inbox queue to 5 concurrent jobs
  - default

# In your worker:
before_enqueue do |job|
  if Sidekiq::Queue.new("federated_inbox").size > 1000 # Check queue size
    # Log the rejection and potentially notify an administrator
    raise "Federated inbox queue is full" # Prevent the job from being enqueued
  end
end
```

## 5. Testing Recommendations

*   **Load Testing:**  Use load testing tools (e.g., JMeter, Gatling) to simulate FDoS attacks and measure the effectiveness of rate limiting and other mitigations.
*   **Chaos Engineering:**  Introduce controlled failures (e.g., network disruptions, database slowdowns) to test the resilience of the system.
*   **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests to verify the correctness of rate limiting logic, input validation, and other critical components.
*   **Integration Tests:**  Test the interaction between different components (e.g., controllers, workers, database) to ensure that mitigations are working as expected.
*   **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.
* **Test Federation:** Create test federation with multiple instances to simulate real world scenario.

## 6. Conclusion

The FDoS threat is a significant risk to Mastodon instances.  By implementing the mitigations outlined in this analysis, the Mastodon development team can significantly improve the platform's resilience to this type of attack.  The key is to move beyond generic DDoS protection and focus on the specific vulnerabilities within Mastodon's federated architecture.  Continuous monitoring, testing, and code review are essential to maintain a strong security posture. This deep analysis provides a starting point for concrete action, focusing on code-level changes and architectural improvements.
