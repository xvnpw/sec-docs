# Threat Model Analysis for mastodon/mastodon

## Threat: [Malicious ActivityPub Payload Injection](./threats/malicious_activitypub_payload_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker on a remote federated instance crafts a malicious ActivityPub message (e.g., a `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`, `Follow`, `Announce`, etc. activity) containing a payload designed to exploit a vulnerability in the receiving Mastodon instance's ActivityPub processing logic. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in libraries used for JSON-LD parsing, object serialization/deserialization, or database interactions triggered by ActivityPub processing. The attacker aims to achieve remote code execution or data corruption.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Mastodon server, leading to complete instance compromise. Data corruption or deletion within the PostgreSQL database. Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** `lib/activitypub/` directory (specifically, processors within this directory like `lib/activitypub/processor.rb`, and any related models that handle ActivityPub data), JSON-LD parsing libraries (e.g., `json-ld` gem), ActiveRecord models interacting with ActivityPub data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation of *all* fields within incoming ActivityPub objects, checking data types, lengths, and formats against expected values.  Reject any unexpected or malformed data.
        *   **Sanitization:** Sanitize all data extracted from ActivityPub objects before using it in database queries, system commands, or other sensitive operations.  Use appropriate escaping techniques to prevent injection attacks.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the Mastodon codebase and its dependencies (especially JSON-LD and ActivityPub-related libraries) for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzz testing techniques to send a wide range of malformed and unexpected ActivityPub messages to the instance and monitor for crashes or unexpected behavior.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF with rules specifically designed to detect and block malicious ActivityPub payloads. *Note: While a WAF can help, it's a secondary defense; primary mitigation must be in the application code.*
        *   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of all ActivityPub processing logic, paying close attention to input validation, sanitization, and error handling.

## Threat: [Federation-Based Denial of Service (FDoS)](./threats/federation-based_denial_of_service__fdos_.md)

*   **Description:** Multiple malicious instances, potentially controlled by a single attacker or a botnet, coordinate to send a flood of legitimate-appearing ActivityPub messages (e.g., follows, boosts, posts, or even just pings) to the target Mastodon instance. The goal is to overwhelm the instance's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, database connections), making it unavailable to legitimate users.  This directly exploits Mastodon's federation mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), making the instance inaccessible to users. Resource exhaustion, potentially leading to increased hosting costs.
    *   **Affected Component:** Web server (Puma/Nginx), Sidekiq workers processing incoming ActivityPub messages (`app/workers/` directory, specifically those handling federated activities), PostgreSQL database, Redis cache, network infrastructure.  The core issue is how Mastodon handles incoming federated requests.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on incoming ActivityPub requests *within the Mastodon application code*, both per instance and per IP address. This should limit the number of requests allowed within a specific time window.  This is crucial to implement *within* Mastodon, not just at the network level.
        *   **Instance Blocking:** Provide administrators with tools *within Mastodon* to quickly and easily block problematic instances, either temporarily or permanently. This relies on Mastodon's administrative features.
        *   **Traffic Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic and server resource usage for anomalies that might indicate an FDoS attack.  This monitoring should integrate with Mastodon's logging.
        *   **Connection Limits:** Limit the number of concurrent connections from a single instance or IP address *within the application logic*.

## Threat: [Data Leakage via Federation](./threats/data_leakage_via_federation.md)

*   **Description:** Due to bugs in the ActivityPub implementation, or vulnerabilities in how Mastodon handles different visibility levels (public, unlisted, followers-only, direct), private information intended for a limited audience is inadvertently leaked to other instances or users on the Fediverse. This is a direct vulnerability in Mastodon's core functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Privacy violation for users. Data breach, potentially exposing sensitive information. Reputational damage to the instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** `app/models/status.rb` (and related models handling status visibility), `lib/activitypub/` directory (specifically, code related to generating and distributing ActivityPub objects based on visibility settings), controllers handling status creation and updates. This is entirely within Mastodon's code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thorough Testing:** Extensively test all privacy settings and their interactions with federation, including different visibility levels and combinations of settings. This testing must focus on Mastodon's specific implementation.
        *   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of all code related to privacy settings and ActivityPub object generation, paying close attention to how visibility is enforced. This is a direct code-level mitigation.
        *   **Default Privacy:** Set default privacy settings to the most restrictive option (e.g., followers-only) to minimize accidental data leakage. This is a configuration change within Mastodon.
        *   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct penetration testing to specifically target potential data leakage vulnerabilities *within Mastodon's federation logic*.

## Threat: [Job Queue Poisoning (Sidekiq)](./threats/job_queue_poisoning__sidekiq_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within Mastodon's code* (e.g., a lack of input validation in a feature that enqueues background jobs) to inject malicious jobs into the Sidekiq queue. These malicious jobs could then execute arbitrary code, modify data, or perform other harmful actions when processed by Sidekiq workers. The vulnerability lies in how Mastodon uses Sidekiq, not Sidekiq itself.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Sidekiq workers, potentially leading to complete instance compromise. Data corruption or deletion. Denial of Service (DoS) by consuming worker resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** Sidekiq workers, `app/workers/` directory (all worker classes), any code *within Mastodon* that enqueues jobs (e.g., controllers, models, services). The vulnerability is in the code that *calls* Sidekiq.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation *within Mastodon's code* *before* enqueuing any background jobs. Validate all parameters passed to jobs, checking data types, lengths, and formats. This is the primary mitigation.
        *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Ensure that only authorized users or services *within Mastodon* can enqueue jobs. This relies on Mastodon's authentication mechanisms.
        *   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of all code *within Mastodon* that interacts with Sidekiq, paying close attention to input validation and security.
        *   **Monitor Sidekiq Queues:** Monitor Sidekiq queues for suspicious activity, such as unexpected job types or a large number of failed jobs.
