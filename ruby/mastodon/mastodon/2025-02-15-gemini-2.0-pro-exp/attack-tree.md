## Attack Tree Path: [1. Mass Disruption/DoS (Mastodon-Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/1__mass_disruptiondos__mastodon-specific_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Federation Protocol Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in how Mastodon handles communication with other instances, particularly within the ActivityPub protocol.
    *   **1.1.1 ActivityPub Implementation Flaws**
        *   **1.1.1.1 Denial of Service via Malformed Activities [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Description:**  Crafting specially designed ActivityPub messages (activities) that cause the receiving Mastodon instance to crash, hang, or consume excessive resources.  This could involve oversized payloads, deeply nested objects, or data structures that trigger infinite loops or other errors in the parsing or processing logic.
            *   **Example:** Sending an "Announce" activity with a ridiculously large "object" field, or a "Create" activity with a deeply nested "attributedTo" chain.
        *   **1.1.1.3 Bypassing Rate Limiting for Federated Actions [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Description:**  Finding ways to circumvent the mechanisms that limit the number of requests an instance can send or receive from other instances.  This could involve exploiting flaws in the rate-limiting logic, using multiple IP addresses, or manipulating timestamps.
            *   **Example:**  Discovering that rate limiting is applied per IP address and using a botnet to send requests from many different IPs, or finding a way to reset the rate limit counter.
    *   **1.2 Abuse of Instance Configuration**
        *   **1.2.1 Exploiting Weakly Configured Relays (if used) [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Description:** Taking advantage of Mastodon instances that use open or poorly secured relays. Relays amplify messages across the network, and an open relay can be used to distribute malicious content or launch DoS attacks.
            *   **1.2.1.1 Amplification Attacks via Open Relays [HIGH RISK]**
                *   **Description:** Sending a relatively small number of requests to an open relay, which then amplifies those requests and forwards them to many other instances, overwhelming the target.
                *   **Example:**  Sending a single "Follow" request to an open relay, which then forwards that request to hundreds or thousands of other instances, effectively launching a distributed denial-of-service attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Targeted Account Takeover (Mastodon-Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/2__targeted_account_takeover__mastodon-specific_.md)

*   **2.1 Exploit Federation Trust [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:**  Attacks that leverage the trust relationships between federated Mastodon instances to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
    *   **2.1.1 Spoofing ActivityPub Messages from Trusted Instances [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  Creating forged ActivityPub messages that appear to originate from a trusted instance, allowing the attacker to impersonate users or perform actions on their behalf.
        *   **2.1.1.1 Compromising a Federated Instance's Signing Keys [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  Gaining access to the private cryptographic keys used by a Mastodon instance to sign its ActivityPub messages.  This allows the attacker to forge messages that will be accepted as authentic by other instances.
            *   **Example:**  Exploiting a server-side vulnerability to gain access to the filesystem and steal the private key file.
        *   **2.1.1.2 Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Signature Verification [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  Finding flaws in the way Mastodon instances verify the digital signatures on incoming ActivityPub messages.  This could allow an attacker to forge messages without having the correct private key.
            *   **Example:**  Discovering a bug in the signature verification code that allows an attacker to bypass the check, or finding a way to manipulate the public key used for verification.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Data Exfiltration of Sensitive Federation Data [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__data_exfiltration_of_sensitive_federation_data__high_risk_.md)

*   **3.1 Compromise Instance Database [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Gaining unauthorized access to the database that stores Mastodon instance data, including user information, posts, and federation data.
    *   **3.1.2 Gaining Unauthorized Database Access [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  Accessing the database through weak passwords, misconfigured access controls, or other vulnerabilities that don't require exploiting a specific database software flaw.
        *   **Example:**  Using the default database password, guessing a weak password, or exploiting a misconfigured firewall rule that allows direct access to the database port.
*   **3.2 Access Server Filesystem [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Gaining unauthorized access to the files and directories on the server hosting the Mastodon instance.
    *   **3.2.1 Exploiting Server-Side Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  Using vulnerabilities in the server software (e.g., web server, operating system) to execute arbitrary code or access files.  This could involve remote code execution (RCE), path traversal, or other exploits.
        *   **Example:**  Exploiting a known vulnerability in the web server software to upload a malicious script that allows the attacker to execute commands on the server.
    *   **3.2.2 Gaining Unauthorized Shell Access [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Obtaining a command-line shell on the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands and access any file.
        *   **Example:**  Compromising an SSH key, guessing a weak SSH password, or exploiting a vulnerability in a service that provides shell access.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Reputation Damage via Forged Content/Activity](./attack_tree_paths/4__reputation_damage_via_forged_contentactivity.md)

*   **4.2 Compromise a Federated Instance (see 2.1.1.1) [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** (Same as 2.1.1.1) Gaining full control over a federated instance, allowing the attacker to post content and interact with other instances as if they were the legitimate owner of that instance.
*   **4.3 Exploit Weaknesses in Signature Verification (see 2.1.1.2) [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** (Same as 2.1.1.2) Bypassing signature checks to forge activities, allowing widespread impersonation and content manipulation.
