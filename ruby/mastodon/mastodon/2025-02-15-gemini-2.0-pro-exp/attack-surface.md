# Attack Surface Analysis for mastodon/mastodon

## Attack Surface: [Federated ActivityPub Communication Abuse](./attack_surfaces/federated_activitypub_communication_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of the ActivityPub protocol used for inter-instance communication. This is *the* core attack vector specific to Mastodon and federated systems.
    *   **Mastodon Contribution:** Mastodon's entire federation model is built upon ActivityPub, making vulnerabilities in its implementation or handling directly impact the platform.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious `Create` activity designed to trigger a buffer overflow or other vulnerability in how a receiving Mastodon instance parses and processes the activity, potentially leading to remote code execution. Another example: forging a signed `Delete` activity to remove content from another instance without authorization.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, data corruption, information disclosure, potential remote code execution (RCE), reputation damage, spam distribution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Robust Input Validation:** Implement *extremely* strict validation of *all* ActivityPub message fields, including object structure, data types, lengths, and nested objects.  Assume all incoming data is potentially malicious.
            *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce strict limits on the size, depth, and complexity of ActivityPub objects to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
            *   **Secure Parsing:** Use secure, up-to-date JSON and (if applicable) XML parsing libraries, configured to prevent XXE and other parsing-related attacks.
            *   **Signature Verification:** Rigorously enforce HTTP Signature verification, including proper key management, algorithm agility, and replay attack prevention.
            *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement aggressive rate limiting on ActivityPub message processing, differentiated by activity type and source.
            *   **Fuzz Testing:** Extensive fuzz testing of ActivityPub parsing and processing logic is *essential*.
            *   **Security Audits:** Regular, in-depth security audits focused specifically on ActivityPub handling.
        *   **Users:** (Limited direct mitigation, relies heavily on instance administrators)
            *   **Instance Selection:** Choose to federate with instances known for *extremely* strong security practices and active development. This is crucial.
            *   **Report Suspicious Activity:** Immediately report any unusual activity to instance administrators.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Media Processing (Targeting Mastodon's Handling)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_media_processing__targeting_mastodon's_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Mastodon processes uploaded media files (images, videos, audio), specifically targeting Mastodon's integration with processing libraries.
    *   **Mastodon Contribution:** Mastodon's feature of allowing media uploads directly introduces this attack surface. The specific vulnerabilities will depend on the libraries used and how Mastodon interacts with them.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file that exploits a known vulnerability in ImageMagick, but the exploit is successful *because* of how Mastodon passes the image data to ImageMagick (e.g., insufficient sanitization or improper configuration).
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE), denial of service (DoS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Secure Library Integration:** Ensure that Mastodon interacts with media processing libraries (ImageMagick, FFmpeg, etc.) in a secure manner.  This includes proper input sanitization, secure configuration, and avoiding dangerous functions.
            *   **Sandboxing:** Isolate media processing within a tightly controlled sandbox environment to limit the impact of any successful exploits.
            *   **File Type Validation (Beyond Extensions):** Implement robust file type validation using "magic number" detection and other techniques, *not* relying solely on file extensions.
            *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce strict limits on the size, dimensions, and processing time of uploaded media.
            *   **Regular Updates:** Keep all media processing libraries *constantly* updated to the latest versions.
        *   **Users:** (Limited direct mitigation, relies on instance administrators)

## Attack Surface: [Background Job (Sidekiq) Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/background_job__sidekiq__exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attacking the Sidekiq background job processing system, specifically targeting how Mastodon uses it.
    *   **Mastodon Contribution:** Mastodon's reliance on Sidekiq for asynchronous tasks (including processing ActivityPub messages and media) makes this a direct attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker, through a vulnerability in ActivityPub processing, is able to inject a malicious job into the Sidekiq queue that executes arbitrary code with the privileges of the Mastodon worker process.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE), denial of service (DoS), data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Secure Job Input:** *Thoroughly* validate and sanitize *all* data used in background jobs, especially data originating from external sources (ActivityPub).
            *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the Sidekiq web interface and API.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Sidekiq worker processes with the minimum necessary privileges.
            *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce strict limits on the resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) that background jobs can consume.
            *   **Monitoring:** Implement robust monitoring of the Sidekiq queue and worker processes to detect suspicious activity.
            *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Sidekiq and all related gems updated to the latest versions.
        *   **Users:** (Limited direct mitigation, relies on instance administrators)
