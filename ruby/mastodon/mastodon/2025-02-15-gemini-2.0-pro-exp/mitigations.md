# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mastodon/mastodon

## Mitigation Strategy: [Instance Blocking/Limiting (Federation Management)](./mitigation_strategies/instance_blockinglimiting__federation_management_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Instance Blocking/Limiting

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Admin-Level Blocking:** Developers use Mastodon's built-in domain blocking features (`tootctl domains block`) and the web admin interface to manage a list of blocked instances. This prevents *all* communication with those instances.
    2.  **User-Level Blocking/Muting:** Users utilize Mastodon's built-in "Block Instance" and "Mute Instance" options on other users' profiles. This filters content at the individual user level.
    3.  **Federation Relay Restrictions (If Applicable):** If a relay is used, configure it (using its specific configuration methods â€“ this is *outside* of Mastodon itself) to only federate with a curated list of instances. This is a network-level control, not a Mastodon feature per se, but directly impacts Mastodon's federation.
    4.  **Content Filtering (Federated-Specific):** Within Mastodon's code (e.g., in `app/services/process_feed_entry_service.rb` or similar), add logic to apply *stricter* sanitization or filtering rules to content originating from federated instances compared to local content. This leverages Mastodon's existing content processing pipeline.
    5.  **Rate Limiting (Federated Actions):** Modify Mastodon's rate limiting configuration (likely within `config/initializers/rack_attack.rb` or a similar location, using `Rack::Attack`) to apply *different* rate limits to actions based on whether they originate from a local user or a federated instance. This uses Mastodon's existing request handling infrastructure.
    6.  **Reputation System (Instances - Exploratory):** Integrate with an *external* Mastodon-specific instance reputation service (if one exists) via its API.  Use the retrieved reputation scores to inform blocking/limiting decisions (either automatically or by presenting the information to administrators).
    7.  **Federation Policy:** Create and publish a clear federation policy on the instance's "About" page, outlining the criteria for blocking/limiting instances. This is a communication strategy, leveraging Mastodon's existing "About" page functionality.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Instances/Federation Attacks:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Data Poisoning/Manipulation:** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Spam from Federated Instances:** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Harassment from Federated Instances:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) from Federated Instances:** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:** (Same as before, as the threats and mitigation effectiveness haven't changed)
    *   **Malicious Instances/Federation Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Data Poisoning/Manipulation:** Risk moderately reduced.
    *   **Spam from Federated Instances:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Harassment from Federated Instances:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Examples, adjust to your specific project)
    *   **Admin-Level Blocking:** Implemented (using `tootctl` and web admin).
    *   **User-Level Blocking:** Implemented (standard Mastodon feature).
    *   **Basic Rate Limiting:** Implemented, but not federated-specific.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Examples, adjust to your specific project)
    *   **User-Level Muting of Instances:** May or may not be implemented (check Mastodon version).
    *   **Federation Relay Restrictions:** Not applicable (no relay).
    *   **Content Filtering (Federated-Specific):** Not implemented.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Federated Actions):** Needs refinement.
    *   **Reputation System:** Not implemented.
    *   **Federation Policy:** Draft exists, not published.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rapid Patching and Updates (Mastodon-Specific Code)](./mitigation_strategies/rapid_patching_and_updates__mastodon-specific_code_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rapid Patching and Updates (Mastodon-Specific)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to the official Mastodon security announcements (mailing list, GitHub releases). This is specific to tracking Mastodon vulnerabilities.
    2.  **Update Mastodon:** Regularly update the Mastodon codebase to the latest stable release, paying *close attention* to security releases. This directly addresses vulnerabilities in Mastodon's code.
    3.  **Dependency Auditing (Within Mastodon's Context):** Use `bundler-audit` and `npm audit` *specifically* within the Mastodon project directory to identify vulnerabilities in Mastodon's direct dependencies (Ruby gems and JavaScript packages). This focuses on the dependencies *used by Mastodon*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploits in Mastodon's Codebase:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Mastodon's Dependencies:** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploits in Mastodon's Codebase:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Mastodon's Dependencies:** Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Monitoring Security Advisories:** Implemented.
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Implemented (within the Mastodon project).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Fully Automated Updates:** Updates are semi-manual (staging environment exists, but deployment is manual).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Visibility Settings and Federation Awareness](./mitigation_strategies/visibility_settings_and_federation_awareness.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Visibility Settings and Federation Awareness
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Visibility Setting Explanations:** Within Mastodon's UI (e.g., in the compose box, user settings), provide *clear and concise* explanations of how each visibility setting (public, unlisted, followers-only, direct) interacts with federation. This leverages Mastodon's existing UI elements.
    2.  **Limited Federation for Sensitive Data (If Feasible):** Explore *modifications to the Mastodon codebase* to limit or prevent the federation of certain content types (e.g., direct messages) or posts with specific visibility settings. This is a *direct modification of Mastodon's federation logic*.  This is a *very* complex undertaking and may not be fully achievable due to the nature of ActivityPub.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintentional Data Exposure (Federation):** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintentional Data Exposure:** Risk moderately reduced (through user education and *potential* technical limitations).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Standard Mastodon Visibility Settings:** Implemented (built-in feature).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Enhanced Visibility Setting Explanations:** Could be improved with more detailed in-app help.
    *   **Limited Federation for Sensitive Data:** Not implemented (technically very challenging).
