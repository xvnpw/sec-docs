# Threat Model Analysis for mastodon/mastodon

## Threat: [Unpatched Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in Mastodon Frontend](./threats/unpatched_cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerability_in_mastodon_frontend.md)

- **Threat:** Unpatched Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in Mastodon Frontend
    - **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits an unpatched XSS vulnerability within Mastodon's frontend code (e.g., in the web interface for composing posts, viewing timelines, or user profiles). The attacker crafts malicious JavaScript code and injects it into a Mastodon post or profile field. When other users view this content through the official Mastodon web interface or a vulnerable application embedding Mastodon content without proper sanitization, the malicious script executes in their browsers.
    - **Impact:** Session hijacking of Mastodon users, redirection to malicious websites, theft of personal information, defacement of profiles, and potentially further attacks against other users.
    - **Affected Component:**
        - `mastodon/app/javascript` (Mastodon's frontend JavaScript code)
        - Specific components within the frontend responsible for rendering user-generated content (e.g., timeline rendering, post display components, profile rendering).
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Regularly update the Mastodon instance to the latest stable version, which includes security patches.
        - Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding within Mastodon's frontend code to prevent the injection and execution of malicious scripts.
        - Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
        - Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Mastodon frontend.

## Threat: [API Vulnerability Allowing Unauthorized Data Access](./threats/api_vulnerability_allowing_unauthorized_data_access.md)

- **Threat:** API Vulnerability Allowing Unauthorized Data Access
    - **Description:** An attacker discovers a vulnerability in Mastodon's API endpoints that allows them to bypass authorization checks and access data they should not have access to. This could involve accessing private posts, direct messages, user information, or server configuration details without proper authentication or authorization.
    - **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, violation of user privacy, potential for data breaches, and the ability for attackers to manipulate data or perform actions on behalf of other users.
    - **Affected Component:**
        - `mastodon/app/controllers/api/v1` (Mastodon's API controllers)
        - Specific API endpoints and the underlying authorization logic responsible for controlling access to resources.
        - `mastodon/lib/authorization` (Mastodon's authorization libraries and modules).
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement thorough authorization checks on all API endpoints, ensuring that users can only access data they are explicitly permitted to see.
        - Follow secure coding practices when developing and maintaining API endpoints, paying close attention to authorization logic.
        - Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Mastodon API.
        - Implement rate limiting and other security measures to prevent abuse of API endpoints.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability in Mastodon Backend](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerability_in_mastodon_backend.md)

- **Threat:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability in Mastodon Backend
    - **Description:** An attacker identifies a critical vulnerability in Mastodon's backend code that allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Mastodon instance. This could be due to insecure handling of user input, vulnerabilities in dependencies, or flaws in the application's logic. The attacker could exploit this vulnerability through various means, such as crafted API requests or malicious media uploads.
    - **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Mastodon server, allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, install malware, disrupt service, or pivot to other systems on the network.
    - **Affected Component:**
        - Various parts of the Mastodon backend, depending on the specific vulnerability. This could include:
            - `mastodon/app/workers` (background job processing)
            - `mastodon/app/services` (business logic services)
            - `mastodon/lib` (core libraries and utilities)
            - Dependencies used by Mastodon (e.g., Ruby on Rails, specific gems).
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Regularly update the Mastodon instance and its dependencies to patch known RCE vulnerabilities.
        - Implement secure coding practices to prevent the introduction of RCE vulnerabilities.
        - Employ input validation and sanitization on all data received by the backend.
        - Run Mastodon under a user with minimal privileges.
        - Implement security monitoring and intrusion detection systems to detect and respond to potential RCE attempts.
        - Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically looking for RCE vulnerabilities.
