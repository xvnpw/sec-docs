# Attack Surface Analysis for mastodon/mastodon

## Attack Surface: [Key Mastodon Attack Surface List (High & Critical - Mastodon Specific)

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious ActivityPub Payload Handling](./attack_surfaces/key_mastodon_attack_surface_list__high_&_critical_-_mastodon_specific____attack_surface_malicious_ac_8b5d84af.md)

*   **Description:**  Mastodon instances communicate and exchange data using the ActivityPub protocol. Maliciously crafted ActivityPub objects can exploit vulnerabilities in how Mastodon parses, processes, and stores this data.
    *   **How Mastodon Contributes:** Mastodon's core functionality relies on receiving and processing ActivityPub data from potentially untrusted remote instances. The complexity of the ActivityPub specification and its various object types increases the attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A remote instance sends a crafted `Note` object with a specially formatted `content` field that exploits a vulnerability in Mastodon's HTML sanitization library, leading to stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
    *   **Impact:**  XSS can lead to account takeover, information theft, and further propagation of malicious content. Other vulnerabilities could lead to denial of service or even remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all incoming ActivityPub data.
            *   Regularly update dependencies, especially libraries used for HTML sanitization and XML/JSON parsing.
            *   Employ secure coding practices to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
            *   Implement rate limiting and anomaly detection for incoming ActivityPub traffic.
        *   **Users/Administrators:**
            *   Stay updated with Mastodon releases and apply security patches promptly.
            *   Consider implementing stricter federation policies, potentially blocking or limiting interaction with instances known for malicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [**Attack Surface:** Media Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/attack_surface_media_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Mastodon allows users to upload various media types (images, videos, audio). Vulnerabilities in the libraries or processes used to handle these files can be exploited.
    *   **How Mastodon Contributes:** Mastodon integrates with media processing libraries (e.g., ImageMagick, ffmpeg) to generate thumbnails, transcode videos, and perform other operations. Vulnerabilities in these external libraries directly impact Mastodon.
    *   **Example:** A user uploads a specially crafted image file that exploits a vulnerability in ImageMagick, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Mastodon server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, or unauthorized access to the server's file system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Regularly update all media processing libraries to the latest versions with security patches.
            *   Implement sandboxing or containerization for media processing tasks to limit the impact of potential exploits.
            *   Perform thorough input validation on uploaded media file headers and content.
            *   Consider using secure alternatives to vulnerable libraries if available.
        *   **Users/Administrators:**
            *   Stay updated with Mastodon releases that include updates to media processing libraries.

## Attack Surface: [**Attack Surface:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Untrusted Federated Content](./attack_surfaces/attack_surface_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_untrusted_federated_content.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious scripts can be injected into content originating from federated instances and displayed to users on the local instance.
    *   **How Mastodon Contributes:** Mastodon renders content received from other instances. If this content is not properly sanitized, it can contain malicious JavaScript that executes in the context of a user's browser.
    *   **Example:** A user on a malicious remote instance crafts a post containing JavaScript that steals cookies or redirects users when viewed on the local Mastodon instance.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, information theft, defacement of the user interface, and propagation of malicious content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust server-side HTML sanitization for all content received from federated instances.
            *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
            *   Regularly review and update sanitization libraries.
        *   **Users/Administrators:**
            *   Be cautious when interacting with content from instances with questionable moderation policies.
            *   Consider blocking or limiting interaction with instances known for hosting malicious content.
