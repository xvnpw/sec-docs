# Project Design Document: Mastodon

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Prepared By:** AI Software Architect

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an enhanced architectural design of the Mastodon social networking platform. It aims to offer a more detailed understanding of the system's components, their interactions, and the overall data flow, specifically tailored for threat modeling purposes.

### 1.1. Purpose

The primary purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive and detailed architectural overview of Mastodon, enabling effective and targeted threat modeling. It identifies key components, data flows, and potential attack surfaces with greater specificity.

### 1.2. Scope

This document covers the core components of a single Mastodon instance, including its web application, database, background processing, media storage, search functionality, and real-time streaming. It provides a more in-depth look at the federation aspects, which are fundamental to Mastodon's distributed nature and security posture.

### 1.3. Audience

This document is intended for security engineers, threat modelers, developers, and operations personnel involved in the security assessment, development, and maintenance of Mastodon instances. The enhanced detail aims to provide a more actionable resource for these roles.

## 2. System Overview

Mastodon is a free, open-source, decentralized microblogging social network. It operates as a network of independent servers (instances) that can communicate with each other using the ActivityPub protocol. Users create accounts on specific instances and can interact with users on their own instance as well as users on other federated instances. This decentralized nature introduces unique security considerations.

## 3. Architectural Design

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of a single Mastodon instance with more descriptive component names:

## 4. Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates a more detailed data flow for a user posting a new "toot" and its federation:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "User"
        A["'User Web Browser/App'"]
    end
    subgraph "Local Mastodon Instance"
        B["'Web Application'"]

    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px

```

**Detailed Data Flow for Posting and Federating a Toot:**

1. **Submit Toot via API:** The user composes a new post (toot) and submits it through the web browser or mobile app, which sends an API request to the Web Application.
2. **Authenticate & Authorize:** The Web Application authenticates the user and authorizes the action.
3. **Validate Toot Content:** The Web Application validates the input (e.g., content length, media types, mentions, hashtags).
4. **Store Toot in DB:** The validated toot is stored in the local Database.
5. **Queue Federation Job:** The Web Application queues a background job for federating the new toot.
6. **Fetch Toot from DB:** The Background Jobs worker retrieves the toot from the Database.
7. **Prepare ActivityPub Object:** The Federation Service prepares an ActivityPub "Create" activity representing the toot. This includes signing the activity with the instance's private key.
8. **Sign & Send ActivityPub 'Create' Activity:** The Federation Service sends the signed ActivityPub object to the inboxes of followers on remote instances.
9. **Verify Signature & Authenticate:** The Remote Federation Service receives the activity, verifies the signature to ensure authenticity and non-repudiation, and authenticates the sending instance.
10. **Process & Store Activity in Remote DB:** The Remote Federation Service processes the activity and stores the toot in its local Database.
11. **Notify Remote Followers:** The Remote Federation Service notifies its local users who follow the originating user.
12. **Display Toot to Remote User:** The remote user sees the new toot in their timeline.

**Other Key Data Flows:**

*   **User Registration:** User submits registration details, Web Application validates, stores in Database, and sends verification email via SMTP.
*   **Following a Remote User:** Local user initiates follow, Web Application sends ActivityPub "Follow" activity to the remote instance, remote instance handles the request and updates its data.
*   **Fetching Timelines:** User requests timeline, Web Application queries local Database for relevant toots, potentially including federated toots.
*   **Media Upload:** User uploads media, Web Application stores in Media File Storage, Database is updated with media metadata.
*   **Real-time Updates:** Web Application pushes new activities to connected clients via the Real-time Stream Handler.

## 5. Security Considerations

This section outlines potential security considerations based on the architectural design, categorized for clarity. These will be further explored during the threat modeling process.

*   **Web Application Security:**
    *   **Authentication and Session Management:** Vulnerabilities in login mechanisms, session fixation, insecure cookie handling.
    *   **Authorization and Access Control:** Privilege escalation, bypassing access restrictions.
    *   **Input Validation and Output Encoding:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Command Injection, other injection attacks.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Exploiting trust in authenticated users.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention:** Denial of Service (DoS), brute-force attacks.
    *   **API Security:** Authentication and authorization for API endpoints, protection against API abuse.
*   **Database Security:**

    *   **Information Disclosure:** Exposing sensitive data stored in the cache.

## 6. Deployment Considerations

Mastodon instances can be deployed in various configurations, each with its own security implications:

*   **Single Server Deployment:** All components on one server. Simpler to manage but a single point of failure.
*   **Multi-Server Deployment:** Components are separated for scalability and resilience. Requires more complex configuration and security management.
*   **Containerized Deployment (Docker/Kubernetes):** Provides isolation and simplifies deployment but introduces container-specific security considerations.
*   **Cloud-Based Deployment:** Leveraging cloud services for infrastructure, storage, and databases. Security relies on the cloud provider's security measures and proper configuration.
