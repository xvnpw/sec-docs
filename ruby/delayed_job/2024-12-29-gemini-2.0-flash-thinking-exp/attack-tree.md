## Threat Model: Delayed Job Application - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Attacker's Goal:** To compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Delayed Job library or its integration.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application via Delayed Job [CRITICAL NODE]
    * Gain Unauthorized Access/Control [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]
            * Inject Malicious Payload during Job Creation [HIGH RISK PATH]
            * Modify Existing Job Payload in Storage [HIGH RISK PATH]
                * Gain Direct Database Access [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]
        * Exploit Code Execution via Job Processing [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]
            * Inject Malicious Code via Job Arguments [HIGH RISK PATH]
            * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Job Handler Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH]
    * Data Corruption via Malicious Jobs [HIGH RISK PATH]
    * Access Sensitive Data in Job Payloads via Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application via Delayed Job [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Achieving this means successfully exploiting one or more vulnerabilities within the Delayed Job integration to gain unauthorized access, disrupt functionality, or steal information.

* **Gain Unauthorized Access/Control [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This intermediate goal allows the attacker to perform actions they are not authorized to do. This can range from executing arbitrary code to manipulating data.

* **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Inject Malicious Payload during Job Creation [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a job with serialized arguments that contain malicious code. When the Delayed Job worker deserializes these arguments, the malicious code is executed on the server.
        * **Mechanism:** This exploits the inherent risks of deserialization, where untrusted data can be used to instantiate arbitrary objects and execute code if the serialization format (like Marshal or YAML) is not handled securely.
    * **Modify Existing Job Payload in Storage [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Gain Direct Database Access [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the database (e.g., SQL injection, weak credentials) to directly access and modify the stored job data. This allows them to alter the serialized arguments of existing jobs to inject malicious payloads.
            * **Mechanism:** By bypassing the application's logic and directly manipulating the database, the attacker can inject malicious code into jobs that will be executed by the worker.

* **Exploit Code Execution via Job Processing [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Inject Malicious Code via Job Arguments [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts job arguments that, when processed by the job handler code, lead to the execution of arbitrary code. This often involves exploiting vulnerabilities in how the job handler processes or interprets the input.
        * **Mechanism:** If the job handler doesn't properly sanitize or validate input, attackers can inject commands or scripts that will be executed by the server when the job is processed.
    * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Job Handler Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker targets known security vulnerabilities in the libraries or gems that the job handler code relies on.
        * **Mechanism:** If the application uses outdated or vulnerable dependencies, attackers can leverage known exploits to execute code through the job processing mechanism.

* **Data Corruption via Malicious Jobs [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker creates a job with the explicit intent of modifying or deleting critical data within the application's database or storage.
    * **Mechanism:** If the job handler associated with the malicious job has write access to sensitive data and lacks proper authorization checks or input validation, the attacker can manipulate the job's logic to corrupt or delete data.

* **Access Sensitive Data in Job Payloads via Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits deserialization vulnerabilities to gain access to the serialized data of jobs, which might contain sensitive information.
    * **Mechanism:** By intercepting or accessing the serialized job data (either during creation, in storage, or during transmission), and exploiting deserialization flaws, the attacker can extract sensitive information that was intended to be processed by the worker. This is particularly concerning if sensitive data is stored in job arguments without proper encryption.
