## Threat Model: Compromising Application via `mail` Gem Exploitation - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Attacker's Goal:** To compromise the application using the `mail` gem by exploiting weaknesses in how the application utilizes the gem or vulnerabilities within the gem itself, leading to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or service disruption.

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

```
└── Compromise Application via Mail Gem Exploitation
    └── Exploit Application's Misuse of Mail Gem
        ├── **Email Injection Attacks (OR)  <-- CRITICAL NODE**
        │   ├── **Header Injection  <-- HIGH-RISK PATH**
        │   │   └── Inject malicious headers (e.g., `Bcc`, `Cc`, `Reply-To`) through user input to send unauthorized emails or redirect replies.
        │   ├── **Body Injection  <-- HIGH-RISK PATH**
        │   │   └── Inject malicious content into the email body through user input, potentially leading to phishing attacks or information disclosure.
        ├── **Insecure Attachment Handling (OR)  <-- CRITICAL NODE**
        │   ├── **Execution of Attached Files  <-- HIGH-RISK PATH**
        │   │   └── Trick the application or users into executing malicious attachments received via email.

        │   ├── **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Email Content  <-- HIGH-RISK PATH**
        │   │   └── Send emails with malicious HTML or JavaScript that gets executed when the application displays the email content to users.

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Node: Email Injection Attacks**

*   **Description:** This critical node represents a class of vulnerabilities where an attacker can inject malicious content into email headers or bodies due to insufficient input validation and sanitization.
*   **Why it's Critical:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to manipulate the email sending process for various malicious purposes, including:
    *   Sending unauthorized emails (spam, phishing).
    *   Redirecting email replies to attacker-controlled addresses.
    *   Potentially bypassing security checks based on email headers.

**High-Risk Path: Header Injection**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts input that is used to construct email headers without proper sanitization. This allows them to inject arbitrary headers.
*   **Potential Actions:**
    *   Adding recipients to the `Bcc` or `Cc` fields to send emails to unintended targets.
    *   Modifying the `From` or `Reply-To` headers to spoof the sender's identity.
    *   Injecting headers that could bypass spam filters or other security mechanisms.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** Medium (Spam, phishing, information disclosure)

**High-Risk Path: Body Injection**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts input that is used to construct the email body without proper sanitization. This allows them to inject arbitrary content.
*   **Potential Actions:**
    *   Inserting phishing links or malicious content into the email body to trick recipients.
    *   Distributing malware links or attachments.
    *   Defacing or manipulating the intended message of the email.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Phishing, malware distribution, information disclosure)

**Critical Node: Insecure Attachment Handling**

*   **Description:** This critical node encompasses vulnerabilities related to how the application handles email attachments, including saving, processing, and presenting them to users.
*   **Why it's Critical:**  Attachments are a common vector for delivering malware and exploiting vulnerabilities. Insecure handling can lead to:
    *   Arbitrary file writes on the server.
    *   Execution of malicious code on the server or client-side.
    *   Exploitation of vulnerabilities in libraries used to process attachments.

**High-Risk Path: Execution of Attached Files**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends an email with a malicious attachment and tricks the application or its users into executing this attachment.
*   **Potential Actions:**
    *   Gaining arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
    *   Installing malware or ransomware.
    *   Compromising the user's account or system.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (relies on social engineering)
*   **Impact:** High (Malware infection, arbitrary code execution)

**Critical Node: Insecure Display of Email Content**

*   **Description:** This critical node focuses on vulnerabilities that arise when the application displays email content without proper sanitization and encoding, leading to client-side attacks.
*   **Why it's Critical:**  Displaying untrusted email content can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in the user's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Account compromise.
    *   Data theft.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.

**High-Risk Path: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Email Content**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends an email containing malicious HTML or JavaScript code. When the application displays this email to a user without proper sanitization, the malicious script is executed in the user's browser.
*   **Potential Actions:**
    *   Stealing session cookies and hijacking user accounts.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the application interface.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Account compromise, data theft, redirection to malicious sites)
