* **Resource Exhaustion through Unbounded Futures/Promises:**
    * **Description:** An attacker can trigger the creation of a large number of `Future` or `Promise` objects that never complete or are not properly managed, leading to memory exhaustion and potential denial of service.
    * **How Concurrent Ruby Contributes:** `concurrent-ruby` provides the mechanisms for creating and managing these asynchronous operations. If the application logic doesn't limit their creation or handle their lifecycle, it becomes vulnerable.
    * **Example:** A web endpoint that spawns a new `Future` for each incoming request without a limit. An attacker could send a flood of requests, creating an overwhelming number of `Future` objects.
    * **Impact:** Application slowdown, crashes due to out-of-memory errors, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement rate limiting on endpoints or functionalities that trigger the creation of asynchronous operations.
        * Set maximum limits on the number of concurrent `Future`s or `Promise`s that can be active.
        * Use timeouts for `Future`s and `Promise`s to prevent indefinite waiting.
        * Implement proper error handling and cleanup for asynchronous operations.

* **Denial of Service through Unbounded Actor Mailboxes:**
    * **Description:** An attacker can send a large number of messages to an `Actor`'s mailbox, overwhelming its processing capacity and potentially leading to memory exhaustion or unresponsiveness.
    * **How Concurrent Ruby Contributes:** `concurrent-ruby`'s `Actor` model uses mailboxes to queue messages. If the mailbox size is unbounded or too large, it can be exploited.
    * **Example:** An `Actor` responsible for processing user commands. An attacker could send a massive number of invalid or resource-intensive commands, filling the mailbox and preventing legitimate commands from being processed.
    * **Impact:** `Actor` becomes unresponsive, potentially impacting dependent parts of the application, leading to denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement mailbox size limits for `Actor`s.
        * Implement backpressure mechanisms to prevent message producers from overwhelming `Actor`s.
        * Implement message prioritization or filtering within the `Actor` to handle critical messages first.
        * Use timeouts for message processing within the `Actor`.

* **Race Conditions and Data Corruption in Concurrent Collections:**
    * **Description:** Incorrect usage of concurrent collections like `Concurrent::Hash` or `Concurrent::Array` without proper understanding of their thread-safety guarantees can lead to race conditions, resulting in data corruption or inconsistent state.
    * **How Concurrent Ruby Contributes:** `concurrent-ruby` provides these concurrent data structures. While thread-safe for many operations, complex sequences of operations might still require external synchronization.
    * **Example:** Multiple threads attempting to update the same entry in a `Concurrent::Hash` without proper locking, leading to lost updates or incorrect values.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, unexpected behavior, potential security vulnerabilities due to incorrect data.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully review the thread-safety guarantees of the specific concurrent collection being used.
        * Use atomic operations provided by `concurrent-ruby` (e.g., `AtomicBoolean`, `AtomicInteger`) for simple state updates.
        * Employ explicit locking mechanisms (e.g., `Mutex`, `ReentrantReadWriteLock`) for complex operations involving multiple steps on concurrent collections.
        * Design data structures and access patterns to minimize the need for complex synchronization.

* **Deadlocks due to Improper Synchronization:**
    * **Description:** Incorrect use of synchronization primitives like `Mutex` or `ReentrantReadWriteLock` can lead to deadlocks, where two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources.
    * **How Concurrent Ruby Contributes:** `concurrent-ruby` provides these synchronization primitives. Misuse of these primitives is a common source of deadlocks.
    * **Example:** Thread A acquires lock L1 and then tries to acquire lock L2. Thread B acquires lock L2 and then tries to acquire lock L1. Both threads are blocked indefinitely.
    * **Impact:** Application hangs, unresponsiveness, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Establish a clear order for acquiring locks to prevent circular dependencies.
        * Use timeouts when acquiring locks to prevent indefinite blocking.
        * Consider using higher-level concurrency abstractions that reduce the need for explicit locking.
        * Thoroughly test concurrent code for potential deadlocks.

* **Abuse of Scheduling Mechanisms for Malicious Actions:**
    * **Description:** If the application uses `ScheduledTask` or similar features to perform actions at specific times, vulnerabilities in the scheduling logic or the actions being scheduled could be exploited to trigger malicious activities.
    * **How Concurrent Ruby Contributes:** `concurrent-ruby` provides the `ScheduledTask` functionality. If not used securely, it can be abused.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains control over the scheduling mechanism and schedules a task to execute arbitrary code or modify sensitive data at a specific time.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized code execution, data manipulation, denial of service, or other malicious actions depending on the scheduled task.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure the mechanism for creating and managing scheduled tasks.
        * Validate and sanitize any input used to define scheduled tasks.
        * Implement proper authorization and authentication for scheduling operations.
        * Regularly review and audit scheduled tasks.

* **Vulnerabilities in Custom Actor Implementations:**
    * **Description:** If `Actor`s are used to handle sensitive data or perform critical operations, vulnerabilities in the actor's message handling logic or internal state management could be exploited.
    * **How Concurrent Ruby Contributes:** `concurrent-ruby` provides the `Actor` framework, but the security of individual `Actor` implementations is the responsibility of the developer.
    * **Example:** An `Actor` responsible for processing financial transactions has a vulnerability in its message handling logic that allows an attacker to manipulate transaction amounts.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, financial loss, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Apply secure coding practices when developing `Actor`s.
        * Implement thorough input validation and sanitization within `Actor` message handlers.
        * Follow the principle of least privilege for `Actor`s.
        * Regularly review and test `Actor` implementations for security vulnerabilities.
