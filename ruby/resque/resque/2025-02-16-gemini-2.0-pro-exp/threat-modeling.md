# Threat Model Analysis for resque/resque

## Threat: [Job Payload Spoofing](./threats/job_payload_spoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious job payload that mimics a legitimate job. They analyze legitimate payloads and construct their own, potentially with altered arguments to trigger unintended actions or access restricted data. The attacker submits this to the Resque queue *using Resque's enqueuing mechanisms*.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of unauthorized actions, potential data breaches, privilege escalation (if the spoofed job performs privileged operations).
    *   **Affected Component:**  `Resque.enqueue`, `Resque::Job.create` (and any custom methods built on these for enqueuing), Resque's internal job processing logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  High to Critical (depending on the nature of the spoofed job).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Rigorous validation of *all* job arguments. Use whitelists to define allowed data types, formats, and value ranges. Reject any non-conforming job.
        *   **Digital Signatures:** Use a cryptographic signature (e.g., HMAC) to sign job payloads. Workers verify the signature before processing, ensuring authenticity and integrity. This is *crucial* for preventing spoofing.
        *   **Job Argument Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data within job arguments, decrypting only within the worker.
        *   **Queue-Specific Permissions:** Use separate queues for different privilege levels, restricting who can enqueue to high-privilege queues *via Resque*.

## Threat: [Compromised Worker Execution (via Resque)](./threats/compromised_worker_execution__via_resque_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the worker code *that is triggered by processing a Resque job*. This is distinct from a general server compromise; the vulnerability is specifically within the code that handles Resque jobs (e.g., a code injection vulnerability in how the worker processes arguments from `Resque.enqueue`).
    *   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, data theft, data destruction, lateral movement.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Resque worker process, custom worker classes (the `perform` method and any code that processes job arguments passed through Resque).
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines *specifically within the worker code that handles Resque job data*. Avoid `eval`, sanitize inputs, use parameterized queries (if interacting with databases).
        *   **Dependency Management:** Regularly update all dependencies, *especially those used within the worker's `perform` method*.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run worker processes with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges. Never run workers as root.
        *   **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Isolate worker processes using sandboxing or containerization.
        *   **Input Validation (within Worker):** Even within the worker, *re-validate* all data received from job arguments before using it. Don't trust the enqueuing process implicitly.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure (Job Arguments via Resque)](./threats/information_disclosure__job_arguments_via_resque_.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data (passwords, API keys, PII) is included directly in job arguments *passed through `Resque.enqueue`*. An attacker gains access to this data through Resque's mechanisms (e.g., a compromised worker, flaws in Resque's handling of job data, or if the Resque web UI displays arguments). This is distinct from a general Redis data breach.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breach, unauthorized access to other systems, identity theft.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `Resque.enqueue`, `Resque::Job.create`, Resque's internal job storage and retrieval mechanisms, Resque web UI (if enabled and displaying arguments).
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Store Secrets in Arguments:** *Absolutely never* include sensitive data directly in job arguments passed to Resque.
        *   **Secure References:** Instead of passing sensitive data, pass a secure identifier or token that the worker can use to retrieve the data from a secure store.
        *   **Encryption:** If data *must* be passed in arguments (strongly discouraged), encrypt it before enqueuing via Resque and decrypt it only within the worker.
        *   **Secure Resque Web UI:** If using the Resque web UI, secure it with strong authentication and authorization. *Crucially*, configure it *not* to display job arguments.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (Queue Flooding via Resque API)](./threats/denial_of_service__queue_flooding_via_resque_api_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker uses the Resque API (`Resque.enqueue`, `Resque::Job.create`) to submit a large number of jobs, overwhelming workers and preventing legitimate jobs from processing. This focuses on the *abuse of Resque's intended functionality* for job submission.
    * **Impact:** Service disruption, delayed processing, potential resource exhaustion.
    * **Affected Component:** `Resque.enqueue`, `Resque::Job.create`, Resque's queue management, worker processes.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting *specifically on the API calls that enqueue jobs*. Limit the number of jobs a user/IP can submit within a time period.
        *   **Queue Prioritization:** Use multiple queues with priorities. Critical jobs go in a high-priority queue less susceptible to flooding.
        *   **Worker Scaling:** Auto-scale worker processes based on queue length and load.
        * **Job Argument Size Limits:** Enforce limits on the size of job arguments to prevent excessively large payloads via the Resque API.
