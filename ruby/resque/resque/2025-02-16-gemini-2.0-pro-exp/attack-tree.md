```

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Resque Itself](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_resque_itself.md)

This branch focuses on vulnerabilities within the Resque system itself or its dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.a. Manipulate Job Queue](./attack_tree_paths/1_a__manipulate_job_queue.md)

Attacker attempts to directly interact with the job queue.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.a.1. Inject Malicious Job [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_a_1__inject_malicious_job__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts a malicious job payload and injects it into the Resque queue.  If the worker processes this job without proper validation, it can lead to RCE.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (if input validation is weak or absent) / Low (if strong input validation and serialization are used).
*   **Impact:** High (RCE, complete system compromise).
*   **Effort:** Medium (requires crafting a malicious payload, understanding of Resque job format).
*   **Skill Level:** Medium (understanding of serialization, application logic, and potentially exploit development).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (anomalous job types or arguments might be detected by monitoring, but sophisticated payloads can be obfuscated).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.b. Abuse Redis Connection [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1_b__abuse_redis_connection__cn_.md)

This is a critical node because the Redis connection is fundamental to Resque's operation.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.b.1. Direct Redis Access [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_b_1__direct_redis_access__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains direct access to the Redis server, bypassing any application-level security. This often happens if Redis is exposed to the public internet or an internal network without authentication.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (if properly configured) / High (if Redis is exposed without authentication or with weak credentials).
*   **Impact:** High (complete control over the job queue, potential for RCE, data modification, and DoS).
*   **Effort:** Low (if exposed, tools like `redis-cli` can be used directly; no complex exploits needed).
*   **Skill Level:** Low (basic understanding of Redis and network scanning).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (unauthorized connections should be logged and alerted on by network monitoring and Redis itself).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Worker Logic [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_worker_logic__hr_.md)

This branch focuses on vulnerabilities within the application code that processes Resque jobs.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.a. Inject Malicious Job Data](./attack_tree_paths/2_a__inject_malicious_job_data.md)

The attacker leverages the job processing mechanism to deliver malicious input.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.a.1. Craft Malicious Payload [HR][CN]](./attack_tree_paths/2_a_1__craft_malicious_payload__hr__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker carefully designs the input data for a job to exploit a vulnerability in the worker's code. This could be SQL injection, command injection, path traversal, etc.  This is the *preparation* step for exploiting a vulnerability.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depends entirely on the application's input validation and the presence of vulnerabilities).
*   **Impact:** High (RCE, data breach, data modification – depends on the exploited vulnerability).
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (depends on the complexity of the vulnerability and the required payload).
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High (requires knowledge of web application vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, and potentially exploit development).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High (requires robust input validation, security auditing, and potentially Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules).

## Attack Tree Path: [2.a.2. Exploit Vulnerabilities [HR][CN]](./attack_tree_paths/2_a_2__exploit_vulnerabilities__hr__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the *execution* step where the crafted malicious payload triggers a vulnerability in the worker code.  The worker code unintentionally executes attacker-controlled code or performs unintended actions.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (directly correlated with the presence of vulnerabilities in the application code and the success of 2.a.1).
*   **Impact:** High (RCE, data breach, data modification – depends on the exploited vulnerability).
*   **Effort:**  Tightly coupled with 2.a.1.
*   **Skill Level:** Tightly coupled with 2.a.1.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High (depends on the type of vulnerability.  Code execution vulnerabilities are often harder to detect than, say, SQL injection).  Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and application-level logging are crucial.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.b. Manipulate Existing Job Data](./attack_tree_paths/2_b__manipulate_existing_job_data.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.b.1. Bypass Input Validation [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_b_1__bypass_input_validation__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker finds a way to circumvent the application's input validation mechanisms, allowing them to inject malicious data that would normally be blocked. This could involve encoding techniques, character set manipulation, or exploiting logic flaws in the validation code.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on the robustness and complexity of the input validation).
*   **Impact:** High (allows the attacker to proceed to 2.a.1 and 2.a.2).
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (requires a good understanding of the application's input validation logic).
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High (requires knowledge of common input validation bypass techniques).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High (requires thorough code review and testing of the input validation logic).
