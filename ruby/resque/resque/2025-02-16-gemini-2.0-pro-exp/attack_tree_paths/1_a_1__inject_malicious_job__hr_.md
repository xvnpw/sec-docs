Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.a.1. Inject Malicious Job [HR]

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Inject Malicious Job" attack vector against a Resque-based application, identify specific vulnerabilities that could enable this attack, propose concrete mitigation strategies, and establish detection mechanisms.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to enhance the application's security posture.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the scenario where an attacker successfully injects a malicious job into the Resque queue.  We will consider:

*   **Job Creation/Injection Points:**  How an attacker might introduce a job into the queue.  This includes examining all application entry points that interact with Resque.
*   **Job Payload Structure:**  The structure of Resque jobs and how malicious payloads can be crafted.  This includes understanding the serialization format (typically JSON) and how arguments are passed.
*   **Worker Vulnerabilities:**  How the worker processes jobs and the specific vulnerabilities within the worker code that could be exploited by a malicious job.  This includes examining input validation, sanitization, and the use of potentially dangerous functions.
*   **Resque Configuration:**  How Resque itself is configured, and whether any configuration settings could increase or decrease the risk of this attack.
*   **Underlying Infrastructure:** While not the primary focus, we'll briefly touch on how the underlying infrastructure (Redis server, operating system) could contribute to the attack's success or mitigation.

**Methodology:**

We will employ a combination of techniques:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will assume access to the application's source code and perform a thorough review of all code related to Resque job creation, queuing, and processing.  We'll look for common vulnerabilities and anti-patterns.
2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Hypothetical):**  While we won't be performing live penetration testing, we will *hypothetically* construct attack scenarios and payloads based on our code review findings.  This will help us understand the practical implications of the vulnerabilities.
3.  **Threat Modeling:** We will use the STRIDE threat model (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to systematically identify potential threats related to this attack vector.
4.  **Best Practices Review:** We will compare the application's implementation against established security best practices for Resque and similar queuing systems.
5.  **Documentation Review:** We will review any existing documentation related to the application's architecture, security considerations, and Resque usage.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

**2.1. Attack Vector Breakdown:**

The attack vector "Inject Malicious Job" can be broken down into these key steps:

1.  **Identify Injection Point:** The attacker must find a way to submit data that results in a job being added to the Resque queue.  This could be:
    *   **Direct API Endpoint:** An API endpoint designed to create jobs, but lacking proper authorization or input validation.
    *   **Indirect Injection:**  A vulnerability in another part of the application (e.g., a form submission) that triggers job creation as a side effect.
    *   **Compromised Credentials:**  The attacker gains access to credentials (e.g., API keys, user accounts) that allow them to legitimately create jobs.
    *   **Redis Access:** Direct access to the Redis instance used by Resque (e.g., through a misconfigured firewall or weak Redis authentication).  This allows the attacker to directly manipulate the queue.

2.  **Craft Malicious Payload:** The attacker creates a job payload designed to exploit a vulnerability in the worker.  This typically involves:
    *   **Understanding Job Format:**  Knowing the expected structure of a Resque job (class name, arguments).
    *   **Exploiting Deserialization:**  If the worker uses unsafe deserialization (e.g., `Marshal.load` in Ruby without proper precautions), the attacker can craft a payload that creates arbitrary objects or executes arbitrary code during deserialization.
    *   **Exploiting Application Logic:**  The attacker crafts arguments that, while seemingly valid, trigger unintended behavior in the worker's code (e.g., passing a specially crafted filename to a function that performs file operations).
    *   **Command Injection:**  If the worker executes shell commands based on job arguments, the attacker can inject malicious commands.
    *   **Code Injection:** If the worker uses `eval` or similar functions on job arguments, the attacker can inject arbitrary code.

3.  **Job Execution:** The Resque worker picks up the malicious job from the queue and executes it.  The success of the attack depends on the vulnerabilities present in the worker code.

**2.2. Potential Vulnerabilities (Code Review Focus):**

Based on common Resque usage patterns, here are some specific vulnerabilities we would look for during code review:

*   **Unsafe Deserialization:**
    *   Using `Marshal.load` without a whitelist of allowed classes.  This is a *major* vulnerability in Ruby.
    *   Using `YAML.load` with untrusted input.  YAML can also be used for code execution if not handled carefully.
    *   Using `JSON.parse` with a vulnerable `object_class` option.

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:**
    *   Not validating the `class` name of the job to ensure it's a known, safe worker class.
    *   Not validating the types and contents of the `args` array.  This is crucial to prevent command injection, code injection, and other logic flaws.
    *   Not sanitizing input before using it in potentially dangerous operations (e.g., file system access, database queries, shell commands).

*   **Dangerous Function Usage:**
    *   Using `eval`, `exec`, `system`, `backticks` (`` ` ``) with untrusted input.
    *   Using `send` or `method` with untrusted input to call arbitrary methods.
    *   Performing file operations (e.g., `File.open`, `FileUtils.cp`) with filenames or paths derived from untrusted input.
    *   Making external network requests (e.g., `Net::HTTP.get`) based on untrusted URLs.

*   **Lack of Authorization:**
    *   Allowing any user to enqueue jobs without proper authentication and authorization checks.
    *   Not restricting which users can enqueue which types of jobs.

*   **Redis Misconfiguration:**
    *   Redis server exposed to the public internet without a password.
    *   Redis server using a weak or default password.
    *   Lack of network segmentation, allowing attackers on the internal network to access the Redis server.

**2.3. Hypothetical Attack Scenarios:**

Let's consider a few hypothetical scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: Unsafe Deserialization (Marshal.load):**
    *   **Injection Point:** An API endpoint `/api/create_job` accepts a JSON payload with `class` and `args`.
    *   **Payload:** The attacker crafts a payload that uses `Marshal.dump` to serialize a malicious object that executes a shell command upon deserialization.
    *   **Vulnerability:** The worker uses `Marshal.load` to deserialize the job arguments without any restrictions.
    *   **Result:** RCE on the worker server.

*   **Scenario 2: Command Injection:**
    *   **Injection Point:** A web form allows users to upload files.  A Resque job is enqueued to process the uploaded file.
    *   **Payload:** The attacker uploads a file with a malicious filename like `"; rm -rf /; echo "owned`.
    *   **Vulnerability:** The worker code uses the filename directly in a shell command: `system("process_image #{filename}")`.
    *   **Result:** The attacker's command is executed, potentially deleting files on the server.

*   **Scenario 3: Code Injection (eval):**
    *   **Injection Point:** An API endpoint allows users to specify a "callback function" to be executed after a job completes.
    *   **Payload:** The attacker provides a malicious callback function string: `"; system('uname -a'); //"`.
    *   **Vulnerability:** The worker code uses `eval` to execute the callback function: `eval(callback_function)`.
    *   **Result:** The attacker's code is executed, revealing system information.

**2.4. Mitigation Strategies:**

Here are concrete mitigation strategies to address the identified vulnerabilities:

*   **Safe Deserialization:**
    *   **Never use `Marshal.load` with untrusted input.**  This is the most important recommendation.
    *   Use `JSON.parse` with a whitelist of allowed classes if you need to deserialize objects.  Consider using a gem like `safe_yaml` for YAML.
    *   Prefer simple data structures (hashes, arrays) for job arguments instead of complex objects.

*   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Whitelist allowed job classes.**  Maintain a list of valid worker classes and reject any jobs with unknown classes.
    *   **Validate the types and contents of all job arguments.**  Use strong typing and regular expressions to ensure arguments conform to expected formats.
    *   **Sanitize input before using it in any potentially dangerous operations.**  Use appropriate escaping functions for shell commands, SQL queries, etc.

*   **Avoid Dangerous Functions:**
    *   **Avoid `eval`, `exec`, `system`, and backticks whenever possible.**  If you must use them, ensure that all input is thoroughly validated and sanitized.
    *   Use safer alternatives whenever available (e.g., `Process.spawn` instead of `system`).
    *   Use parameterized queries for database interactions to prevent SQL injection.

*   **Implement Strong Authorization:**
    *   **Require authentication for all API endpoints that interact with Resque.**
    *   **Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict which users can enqueue which types of jobs.**

*   **Secure Redis Configuration:**
    *   **Always set a strong password for Redis.**
    *   **Bind Redis to a local interface (e.g., `127.0.0.1`) and use a firewall to restrict access.**
    *   **Consider using network segmentation to isolate the Redis server.**
    *   **Enable Redis authentication.**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   Run Resque workers with the minimum necessary privileges.  Don't run them as root.
    *   Limit the worker's access to the file system and network.

**2.5. Detection Mechanisms:**

*   **Monitoring:**
    *   Monitor Resque queues for unusual job types or argument patterns.
    *   Monitor worker logs for errors, exceptions, and suspicious activity.
    *   Monitor system resource usage (CPU, memory, network) for anomalies.

*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**
    *   Configure an IDS to detect known attack patterns related to Resque and Redis.

*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**
    *   Aggregate logs from Resque, Redis, and the application server in a SIEM system to correlate events and detect attacks.

*   **Static Code Analysis Tools:**
    *   Use static code analysis tools to automatically identify potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.

*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities.
