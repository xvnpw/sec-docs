# Deep Analysis: Resque Attack Path - Inject Malicious Job Data

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Inject Malicious Job Data" attack path within the context of a Resque-based application.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities, potential attack vectors, and, most importantly, concrete mitigation strategies to prevent or significantly reduce the risk of this attack.  This analysis will inform development decisions and security hardening efforts.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Resque Job Processing:**  How the application enqueues, dequeues, and processes jobs using the Resque library.
*   **Data Serialization/Deserialization:**  The methods used to serialize job data before enqueuing and deserialize it upon processing (e.g., JSON, YAML, Marshal).
*   **Job Payload Structure:**  The expected format and content of job data, including arguments and metadata.
*   **Worker Code:** The Ruby code within the Resque worker classes that actually executes the job logic.  This is the *target* of the malicious data.
*   **Redis Interaction:** How the application interacts with the Redis instance used by Resque, focusing on data input and retrieval.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:**  Mechanisms (if any) that control who can enqueue jobs.  This is crucial for limiting the attack surface.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Existing measures (or lack thereof) to validate and sanitize job data before processing.

This analysis *excludes* broader attacks on the Redis server itself (e.g., Redis RCE vulnerabilities), focusing instead on how malicious job data can exploit the *application's* logic.  We also exclude attacks that don't involve injecting malicious job data (e.g., denial-of-service attacks that flood the queue).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the application's codebase, focusing on:
    *   Resque worker class definitions (`perform` methods).
    *   Job enqueuing logic (where `Resque.enqueue` is called).
    *   Any custom serialization/deserialization logic.
    *   Input validation and sanitization routines.
    *   Error handling and logging related to job processing.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Optional, if feasible):**
    *   Set up a test environment with a controlled Redis instance.
    *   Craft malicious job payloads based on potential vulnerabilities identified in the code review.
    *   Enqueue these malicious jobs and observe the application's behavior.
    *   Monitor logs and system resources for signs of exploitation.

3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify specific attack scenarios based on the code review and dynamic analysis.  This involves considering:
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  What level of access does the attacker need (e.g., authenticated user, unauthenticated user, internal access)?
    *   **Attack Vectors:**  How can the attacker inject the malicious job data (e.g., through a web form, API endpoint, compromised dependency)?
    *   **Exploitation Techniques:**  What specific vulnerabilities can be exploited with malicious job data (e.g., code injection, command injection, deserialization vulnerabilities, denial of service)?
    *   **Impact:**  What is the potential damage (e.g., data breach, system compromise, service disruption)?

4.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Develop specific, actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.a. Inject Malicious Job Data

### 4.1. Potential Vulnerabilities and Attack Vectors

Based on the Resque architecture and common application patterns, here are the most likely vulnerabilities and attack vectors:

*   **4.1.1. Lack of Input Validation:**  This is the most common and critical vulnerability.  If the worker code blindly trusts the job data without validating its type, format, and content, it's highly susceptible to injection attacks.
    *   **Example:** A worker expects a job argument to be an integer representing a user ID.  If an attacker can inject a string containing malicious code (e.g., `'1; system("rm -rf /")'`), and the worker uses this string in a database query or shell command without proper escaping, it could lead to command injection.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Any input mechanism that allows an attacker to influence the data passed to `Resque.enqueue`. This could be a web form, an API endpoint, a message queue, or even data read from a compromised database.

*   **4.1.2. Deserialization Vulnerabilities:**  If the application uses an unsafe deserialization method (e.g., `Marshal.load` in Ruby without proper precautions, or vulnerable versions of libraries like `psych` for YAML), an attacker could craft a malicious serialized object that executes arbitrary code upon deserialization.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker could create a serialized Ruby object that, when deserialized by `Marshal.load`, executes a system command.  This is a classic "gadget chain" attack.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Similar to the lack of input validation, any point where attacker-controlled data is passed to `Resque.enqueue` and subsequently deserialized.

*   **4.1.3. Code Injection in Worker Logic:**  Even with some input validation, subtle flaws in the worker code can lead to code injection.  This is especially true if the worker uses dynamic code evaluation (e.g., `eval`, `instance_eval`) or string interpolation in sensitive contexts.
    *   **Example:**  A worker might use `eval` to dynamically call a method based on a job argument.  If the attacker can control this argument, they can inject arbitrary Ruby code.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Any input that influences the code path within the worker, particularly if it affects dynamic code evaluation or string interpolation.

*   **4.1.4. Weak Authentication/Authorization:**  If the mechanism for enqueuing jobs is not properly protected, an unauthenticated or low-privileged user could inject malicious jobs.
    *   **Example:**  An API endpoint that enqueues jobs might be exposed without requiring authentication, allowing anyone to submit jobs.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Direct access to the enqueuing mechanism (e.g., API endpoint, web interface) without proper authentication or authorization checks.

*   **4.1.5. Insufficient Error Handling:**  If the worker code doesn't handle errors gracefully, a malicious job could cause the worker to crash or enter an unstable state, potentially leading to a denial-of-service.
    *   **Example:** A job that causes an unhandled exception could repeatedly crash the worker, preventing legitimate jobs from being processed.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Any malicious input that triggers an unhandled exception or error condition within the worker.

* **4.1.6. Overly Permissive Redis Permissions:** While not directly related to *injecting* the data, if the Redis instance has overly permissive permissions (e.g., no password, accessible from the public internet), an attacker could directly manipulate the Resque queues, bypassing any application-level controls.
    * **Example:** An attacker with direct access to the Redis instance could use `LPUSH` to add malicious job data to a queue.
    * **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the Redis instance.

### 4.2. Mitigation Strategies

The following mitigation strategies address the vulnerabilities identified above:

*   **4.2.1. Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  This is the *most crucial* defense.  Implement rigorous validation for *all* job data, including:
    *   **Type Checking:**  Ensure that each argument is of the expected data type (e.g., integer, string, boolean, array).
    *   **Format Validation:**  Use regular expressions or other validation methods to ensure that the data conforms to the expected format (e.g., email address, date, URL).
    *   **Length Restrictions:**  Limit the length of string arguments to prevent excessively large inputs.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Values:**  If possible, define a whitelist of allowed values for specific arguments.
    *   **Sanitization:**  Escape or remove any potentially dangerous characters from string arguments, especially if they are used in database queries, shell commands, or HTML output.  Use appropriate escaping functions for the specific context (e.g., `CGI.escapeHTML`, database-specific escaping functions).
    * **Schema Validation:** Define a schema for the expected job data (e.g., using JSON Schema or a similar technology) and validate incoming job data against this schema.

*   **4.2.2. Safe Deserialization:**
    *   **Avoid `Marshal.load`:**  `Marshal.load` is inherently unsafe for untrusted data.  Prefer JSON or YAML (with safe loading options) for serialization.
    *   **Use `JSON.parse`:**  JSON is generally a safer serialization format than Marshal.  Use `JSON.parse(data, symbolize_names: true)` for parsing JSON data.
    *   **Use `YAML.safe_load`:**  If using YAML, *always* use `YAML.safe_load` (or `YAML.load` with the `permitted_classes` option in newer versions of Psych) to prevent arbitrary code execution.  Explicitly list the classes that are allowed to be deserialized.
    *   **Consider Protocol Buffers or MessagePack:**  These binary serialization formats can offer better performance and security than JSON or YAML.

*   **4.2.3. Secure Coding Practices in Workers:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Code Evaluation:**  Minimize or eliminate the use of `eval`, `instance_eval`, and similar methods.  If absolutely necessary, ensure that the input to these methods is *strictly* controlled and validated.
    *   **Use Parameterized Queries:**  When interacting with databases, always use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Avoid Shell Commands:**  If possible, avoid using shell commands.  If necessary, use a library like `Open3` to execute commands safely and escape all arguments properly.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the worker process runs with the minimum necessary privileges.  Don't run workers as root.

*   **4.2.4. Strong Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Require Authentication:**  Implement authentication for all mechanisms that allow enqueuing jobs (e.g., API endpoints, web interfaces).
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Implement RBAC to restrict access to enqueuing jobs based on user roles and permissions.  Only authorized users should be able to enqueue specific types of jobs.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from flooding the queue with malicious jobs.

*   **4.2.5. Robust Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   **Handle Exceptions:**  Implement proper exception handling in worker code to prevent crashes and ensure that errors are logged.
    *   **Log Job Data (Carefully):**  Log relevant information about job processing, including job IDs, arguments (after sanitization), and any errors encountered.  Be careful not to log sensitive data.
    *   **Monitor Logs:**  Regularly monitor logs for suspicious activity, such as failed jobs, unexpected errors, or unusual job data.

*   **4.2.6. Secure Redis Configuration:**
    *   **Require Authentication:**  Configure Redis to require a strong password.
    *   **Bind to Localhost:**  If Redis is only used by the local application, bind it to `127.0.0.1` to prevent external access.
    *   **Use a Firewall:**  Use a firewall to restrict access to the Redis port (default: 6379) to only authorized hosts.
    *   **Rename Dangerous Commands:** Consider renaming or disabling dangerous Redis commands (e.g., `FLUSHALL`, `CONFIG`) to prevent accidental or malicious misuse.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Regularly audit the Redis configuration and security settings.

* **4.2.7 Dependency Management:**
    * Keep Resque and all related gems (including Redis client libraries) up-to-date to patch any known vulnerabilities.
    * Use a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., Bundler-Audit, Snyk) to identify and address vulnerable dependencies.

### 4.3. Example Scenario and Mitigation

**Scenario:**

A Resque worker processes image resizing jobs.  The job data includes a `image_url` argument, which is expected to be a URL pointing to an image file.  The worker downloads the image from the URL and then uses ImageMagick to resize it.  The worker code uses the following (simplified) logic:

```ruby
class ImageResizeWorker
  @queue = :image_resize

  def self.perform(job_data)
    image_url = job_data['image_url']
    system("wget #{image_url} -O /tmp/image.jpg") # Vulnerable!
    system("convert /tmp/image.jpg -resize 500x500 /tmp/resized_image.jpg")
  end
end
```

**Vulnerability:**

The `system("wget #{image_url} -O /tmp/image.jpg")` line is vulnerable to command injection.  An attacker could inject a malicious URL like:

```
http://example.com/image.jpg; rm -rf /tmp/* #
```

This would cause the worker to execute the `rm -rf /tmp/*` command, deleting all files in the `/tmp` directory.

**Mitigation:**

1.  **Input Validation:**  Validate that `image_url` is a valid URL using a library like `Addressable::URI`.  Check the scheme (e.g., `http` or `https`), host, and path.  Reject URLs that contain suspicious characters or patterns.

2.  **Safe Shell Command Execution:**  Use `Open3.capture3` instead of `system` to execute the `wget` command.  Pass the URL as a separate argument to `wget`, preventing command injection:

    ```ruby
    require 'open3'

    class ImageResizeWorker
      @queue = :image_resize

      def self.perform(job_data)
        image_url = job_data['image_url']

        # Validate image_url (example using Addressable::URI)
        begin
          uri = Addressable::URI.parse(image_url)
          raise "Invalid URL scheme" unless %w[http https].include?(uri.scheme)
          # Add more validation as needed (e.g., whitelist allowed hosts)
        rescue Addressable::URI::InvalidURIError, RuntimeError => e
          Rails.logger.error("Invalid image URL: #{image_url} - #{e.message}")
          return # Or raise an exception, depending on error handling strategy
        end

        stdout, stderr, status = Open3.capture3("wget", "-O", "/tmp/image.jpg", image_url)

        if status.success?
          system("convert /tmp/image.jpg -resize 500x500 /tmp/resized_image.jpg")
        else
          Rails.logger.error("wget failed: #{stderr}")
        end
      end
    end
    ```

This revised code validates the URL and uses `Open3.capture3` to safely execute the `wget` command, preventing command injection.  It also includes basic error handling and logging.
