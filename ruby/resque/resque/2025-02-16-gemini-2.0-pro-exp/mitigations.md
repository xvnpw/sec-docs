# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for resque/resque

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Strict Input Validation and Whitelisting (Resque Argument Handling)](./mitigation_strategies/1__strict_input_validation_and_whitelisting__resque_argument_handling_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Resque entry points:** Focus specifically on the points where data is passed as arguments to `Resque.enqueue` or `Resque::Job.create`.
    2.  **Define allowed input (per job):** For *each* argument of *each* Resque job class, create a precise specification of allowed data (type, format, length, allowed values, character set).
    3.  **Implement pre-enqueue validation:** Use a validation library or custom logic *before* calling `Resque.enqueue`.  This is the critical point.
    4.  **Reject invalid input:** If validation fails, *do not* enqueue the job.  Return an error or log the failure.
    5.  **Worker-side re-validation:** As a defense-in-depth, *re-validate* the arguments within the `perform` method of the Resque job class *after* they are retrieved from Redis.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Code Injection/RCE (Severity: Critical):** Prevents malicious code from being injected into Resque job arguments and executed by the worker. This is *directly* related to how Resque handles arguments.
    *   **Data Corruption (Severity: High):** Prevents invalid data from being processed by Resque jobs.
    *   **Logic Errors (Severity: Medium):** Reduces unexpected behavior within Resque jobs due to malformed input.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Injection/RCE:** Risk significantly reduced (nearly eliminated with correct implementation).
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Logic Errors:** Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic validation before enqueuing `CreateUserJob`, but not consistently applied to all jobs.
    *   No re-validation within worker jobs.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing validation for `ProcessImageJob` arguments.
    *   Missing re-validation within *all* worker jobs.
    *   Inconsistent use of a validation library.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Argument Serialization and Deserialization (Resque Data Handling)](./mitigation_strategies/2__argument_serialization_and_deserialization__resque_data_handling_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use JSON:** Serialize complex Resque arguments (objects, arrays) into JSON strings before enqueuing.
    2.  **Serialize before `Resque.enqueue`:** Perform serialization *immediately* before calling `Resque.enqueue`.
    3.  **Deserialize in `perform`:** Within the `perform` method of the Resque job class, deserialize the JSON string back into the original data structure.
    4.  **Re-validate after deserialization:** *Immediately* after deserialization, re-validate the data using the rules from Mitigation Strategy #1.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Code Injection/RCE (Severity: Critical):** Reduces the attack surface by ensuring only safe, serialized data is passed through Resque/Redis.
    *   **Data Type Mismatches (Severity: Medium):** Helps prevent errors caused by incorrect data types in Resque arguments.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Injection/RCE:** Risk significantly reduced (especially with strict input validation).
    *   **Data Type Mismatches:** Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Inconsistent serialization. `SendEmailJob` receives a `User` object directly (a risk).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent serialization/deserialization for *all* complex arguments.
    *   Re-validation after deserialization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Job Prioritization (Resque Queue Management)](./mitigation_strategies/3__job_prioritization__resque_queue_management_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify critical jobs:** Determine which Resque jobs are essential for core application functionality.
    2.  **Use Resque priority queues:** Use different queue names (e.g., `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`) when calling `Resque.enqueue`.
    3.  **Configure workers:** Configure Resque workers to process jobs from higher-priority queues first (e.g., `QUEUE=critical,high,medium,low` rake resque:work).
    4.  **Monitor queue performance:** Monitor the performance of each priority queue.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Ensures critical Resque jobs are processed even under heavy load, maintaining essential functionality. This is a *direct* use of Resque's queueing mechanism.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Severity: Medium):** Improves responsiveness of critical features handled by Resque.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Reduces the impact of attacks on critical services provided by Resque jobs.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Improves user experience for critical features.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   All jobs use a single `default` queue. No prioritization.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need to identify critical jobs and implement priority queues using Resque's features.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Job Timeout (Resque Job Execution Control)](./mitigation_strategies/4__job_timeout__resque_job_execution_control_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Estimate maximum execution time:** For each Resque job class, estimate the maximum reasonable execution time.
    2.  **Set timeouts (Resque option):** Use the `:timeout` option when creating jobs with `Resque::Job.create(queue, klass, *args, timeout: seconds)`.  This is a *direct* Resque feature.  Alternatively (less preferred), use `Timeout::timeout` *within* the `perform` method, but this is less reliable.
    3.  **Handle timeouts:** Implement error handling within the Resque job's `on_failure` hook (or a custom failure backend) to deal with timed-out jobs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Prevents long-running or stuck Resque jobs from consuming resources indefinitely.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):** Prevents excessive resource use by Resque workers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Reduces the impact of attacks using long-running jobs.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Reduces the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No timeouts are set for any Resque jobs.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Timeouts need to be implemented for *all* Resque jobs, preferably using Resque's built-in `:timeout` option.

## Mitigation Strategy: [5. Job ID Integrity (Custom Solution, Resque-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/5__job_id_integrity__custom_solution__resque-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate hash:** Before calling `Resque.enqueue`, generate a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the job arguments *and* the Resque job ID (which you'll need to obtain after enqueueing, perhaps by inspecting the return value or using a custom hook).
    2.  **Include hash:** Store this hash *along with* the job data in Redis.  This might require modifying how you enqueue jobs or using a Resque plugin.
    3.  **Verify in worker:** Inside the `perform` method, recompute the hash using the received arguments and the job ID (accessible via `self.job_id` within the job class).
    4.  **Compare and reject:** Compare the recomputed hash with the stored hash. If they don't match, reject the job (raise an exception, log an error).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Job Manipulation (Severity: High):** Detects if an attacker has modified the arguments or ID of a Resque job *while it's in the queue*. This is specific to the Resque workflow.
    *   **Replay Attacks (Severity: Medium):** Can help detect replays (if the job ID is part of the hash).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Job Manipulation:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Replay Attacks:** Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No job ID integrity checks.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   This requires a custom implementation, likely involving modifications to how jobs are enqueued and processed, potentially using Resque hooks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [6. Idempotency (Resque Job Design)](./mitigation_strategies/6__idempotency__resque_job_design_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify non-idempotent jobs:** Determine which Resque jobs perform operations that are *not* inherently idempotent.
    2.  **Implement within `perform`:** Implement idempotency mechanisms *within the `perform` method* of the Resque job class.  This often involves:
        *   **Unique constraint keys (database):** Use database constraints to prevent duplicates.
        *   **Conditional logic (Redis/database checks):** Check if the operation has already been performed (e.g., by checking for a record in the database or a flag in Redis) *before* executing it.
        *   **Transaction IDs (stored in Redis):** Use unique IDs to track operations and prevent re-execution.
    3.  **Test:** Thoroughly test the idempotency of your Resque jobs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Replay Attacks (Severity: Medium):** Prevents replay attacks from causing unintended side effects within Resque jobs.
    *   **Data Corruption (Severity: High):** Prevents duplicate data or inconsistent state due to Resque jobs running multiple times.
    *   **Logic Errors (Severity: Medium):** Reduces unexpected behavior from multiple executions of Resque jobs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Replay Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Logic Errors:** Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partial idempotency in some jobs (`CreateUserJob`), but not consistently applied.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic review and implementation of idempotency in all relevant Resque jobs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [7. Job Expiration (Custom Solution, Resque-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/7__job_expiration__custom_solution__resque-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine expiration:** For each Resque job type, determine a reasonable expiration time.
    2.  **Store timestamps (Redis):** When enqueuing a job (using `Resque.enqueue` or a custom wrapper), store a timestamp in Redis (e.g., as a separate key associated with the job ID or as part of the job data itself).
    3.  **Cleanup process (Resque worker or scheduled task):** Create a *separate* process (either a dedicated Resque worker that *only* handles expirations, or a scheduled task outside of Resque) that periodically:
        *   Queries Redis for jobs and their timestamps.
        *   Removes expired jobs from the Resque queue (using `Resque.remove_queue` or by directly manipulating Redis data).
    4.  **Handle expired jobs:** Log expired jobs or take other appropriate actions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Stale Job Execution (Severity: Medium):** Prevents old, irrelevant Resque jobs from being executed.
    *   **Resource Waste (Severity: Low):** Prevents expired jobs from consuming Resque queue space.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Stale Job Execution:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Resource Waste:** Risk slightly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No job expiration mechanism.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Requires a custom implementation, likely involving a separate process to monitor and remove expired jobs from Redis. This is directly tied to Resque's data storage.
