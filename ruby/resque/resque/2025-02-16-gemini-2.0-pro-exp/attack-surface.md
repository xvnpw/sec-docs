# Attack Surface Analysis for resque/resque

## Attack Surface: [1. Unauthenticated/Weakly Authenticated Redis Access](./attack_surfaces/1__unauthenticatedweakly_authenticated_redis_access.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain direct access to the Redis instance used by Resque.
*   **Resque Contribution:** Resque fundamentally relies on Redis for job queuing and management. Its functionality is *directly* tied to the security of the Redis instance.  Resque *uses* Redis; it doesn't inherently secure it.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers the Redis instance is exposed on the public internet with no password. They connect using `redis-cli` and issue `KEYS *` to list all keys, then `GET` to retrieve sensitive data from job payloads.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data exfiltration (sensitive job data).
    *   Data modification (altering job parameters).
    *   Denial of Service (flushing Redis).
    *   Potential RCE (within Redis itself, if vulnerable).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Require Authentication:** Enforce strong password authentication for Redis. Use Redis ACLs for fine-grained access control.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Redis on a private network, accessible only to authorized application servers and workers.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Restrict access to the Redis port (default 6379) to trusted IP addresses only.
    *   **TLS Encryption:** Encrypt communication between Resque workers and Redis using TLS.

## Attack Surface: [2. Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/2__deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how Resque workers deserialize job data from Redis.
*   **Resque Contribution:** Resque *dictates* the need for serialization and deserialization of job data to and from Redis. The choice of serialization format and the deserialization process on the worker are directly influenced by Resque's design.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects a job with a maliciously crafted JSON payload that, when deserialized using a vulnerable library *chosen because of Resque's data handling*, triggers arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the worker.
    *   Denial of Service (crashing the worker).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Safe Deserialization:** Use secure and up-to-date deserialization libraries. Avoid `YAML.load` with untrusted input; use `YAML.safe_load`. If using a custom serializer, rigorously vet it.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate the structure and content of job payloads *before* deserialization, if feasible. This is a defense-in-depth measure.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run workers with minimal necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [3. Job Injection](./attack_surfaces/3__job_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers directly insert malicious jobs into the Resque queue.
*   **Resque Contribution:** Resque's *core function* is to manage a job queue. If an attacker can write to this queue (often via the Redis connection), they can control what the workers execute. This is a direct consequence of Resque's design.
*   **Example:** An attacker, having gained access to Redis, uses `LPUSH` to add a new job to a queue. This job contains parameters that, when processed by the worker, execute a shell command (exploiting a vulnerability *in the worker code*, but triggered by the injected job).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) via vulnerable worker code.
    *   Unauthorized data manipulation.
    *   Denial of Service (flooding the queue).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Redis Access:** (Same mitigations as for Unauthenticated Redis Access â€“ this is the primary defense).
    *   **Job Signing (Advanced):** Implement digital signatures for jobs to ensure only authorized jobs are processed. This adds complexity but significantly increases security.
    *   **Application-Level Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate at which jobs can be enqueued (a mitigating, not preventative, measure).

## Attack Surface: [4. Resque Web UI Exposure](./attack_surfaces/4__resque_web_ui_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** The Resque web interface is exposed without proper authentication or authorization.
*   **Resque Contribution:** Resque *provides* the optional web UI. Its security is crucial if enabled, and it's a direct part of the Resque package.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers the Resque web UI is accessible on a public URL without a password. They can then view all queued jobs, retry failed jobs, and potentially delete queues.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Full control over job queues.
    *   Information disclosure (sensitive job data).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Require strong authentication for the web UI.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict access to the web UI to a trusted internal network.
    *   **Authorization:** Implement role-based access control within the UI.
