# Threat Model Analysis for resque/resque

## Threat: [Code Injection via Unsafe Job Arguments](./threats/code_injection_via_unsafe_job_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with the ability to enqueue jobs crafts job arguments containing malicious code that gets executed by the worker process *through Resque's job processing mechanism*. This is especially dangerous if workers use `eval()` or similar functions on job arguments without proper sanitization within the job's code that Resque invokes.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on worker machines, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Resque workers (specifically the code that processes job arguments *as invoked by Resque*).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never use `eval()` or similar unsafe functions on job arguments within your Resque job code.**
    *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all job arguments within your worker code before using them.
    *   Use well-defined data structures for job arguments and avoid passing executable code.
    *   Implement input validation at the enqueueing stage to prevent malicious arguments from being added.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion by Malicious Jobs](./threats/resource_exhaustion_by_malicious_jobs.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker enqueues jobs *through Resque* that are designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network) on the worker machines. This can starve other jobs of resources and potentially crash the worker processes that Resque manages.
*   **Impact:** Worker instability, delayed processing of legitimate jobs managed by Resque, and potential system crashes.
*   **Affected Component:** Resque workers (specifically the processes executing the malicious jobs *managed by Resque*).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement timeouts for job execution within your Resque worker code.
    *   Monitor worker resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity related to Resque workers.
    *   Implement mechanisms to kill long-running or resource-intensive jobs within your Resque job processing logic or through Resque's monitoring tools.
    *   Consider using resource limits (e.g., cgroups, Docker resource constraints) for the processes running Resque workers.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Job Arguments or Processing](./threats/information_disclosure_via_job_arguments_or_processing.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information is included in job arguments *passed to Resque* or is accessed and potentially logged or exposed during job processing *within the Resque worker*. An attacker gaining access to worker logs could then retrieve this information.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, such as API keys, credentials, personal information, or business secrets handled by Resque jobs.
*   **Affected Component:** Resque workers (if sensitive data is accessed and potentially logged or leaked during processing within Resque jobs).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in job arguments passed to Resque. Use secure methods like environment variables, dedicated secrets management systems, or encrypted payloads.
    *   Implement secure logging practices within your Resque worker code, ensuring sensitive data is not logged.
    *   Restrict access to worker logs.
    *   Regularly audit your Resque worker code for potential information leaks.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Resque or its Dependencies](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_resque_or_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Resque itself or its direct dependencies (like the Redis client it uses) might contain security vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit *when interacting with Resque's API or internal mechanisms*.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution within the Resque process, denial of service affecting Resque's functionality, or information disclosure related to Resque's internal state.
*   **Affected Component:** Resque library, Redis client library used by Resque.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Resque and all its direct dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `bundler-audit` (for Ruby).
    *   Monitor security advisories specifically for Resque and its core dependencies.
