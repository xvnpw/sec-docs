# Attack Surface Analysis for resque/resque

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Redis Instance](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_redis_instance.md)

**Description:** The Redis instance used by Resque is accessible without proper authentication or authorization.

**How Resque Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Resque relies entirely on Redis for queue management and data persistence. If Redis is open, the core of Resque's operation is exposed.

**Example:** An attacker connects to the Redis instance on the default port without a password and uses Redis commands to inspect job queues, inject malicious jobs, or delete existing jobs.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the background job processing system, potential data breaches, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution within worker processes.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Require Authentication: Configure Redis to require a strong password using the `requirepass` directive.
* Network Segmentation: Restrict network access to the Redis instance to only authorized hosts (e.g., application servers, worker servers). Use firewalls or network policies.
* Disable Unnecessary Commands: Use the `rename-command` directive in Redis to disable potentially dangerous commands like `FLUSHALL`, `KEYS`, `CONFIG`.
* Use TLS/SSL: Encrypt communication between Resque and Redis using TLS/SSL.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via Job Arguments](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_job_arguments.md)

**Description:**  Untrusted data passed as arguments to Resque jobs is not properly sanitized or validated by the worker, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.

**How Resque Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Resque's design involves passing data as arguments to worker classes. If the worker code doesn't handle this data securely, it becomes a vector for injection attacks.

**Example:** A job is enqueued with an argument like `system("rm -rf /")` or a serialized object containing malicious code. When the worker processes this job, the unsanitized argument is executed, leading to system compromise.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the worker server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and lateral movement within the network.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Strict Input Validation: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all job arguments within the worker code.
* Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure worker processes run with the minimum necessary privileges to perform their tasks.
* Avoid Dynamic Execution of Arguments:  Do not directly execute or interpret job arguments as code. Use predefined logic and parameters.
* Secure Deserialization Practices: If job arguments involve serialization, use secure serialization libraries and avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources without verification.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Jobs](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_jobs.md)

**Description:** An attacker enqueues jobs that are designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network), leading to denial of service or performance degradation.

**How Resque Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Resque's core function is to process jobs. If the system doesn't have mechanisms to limit or control resource consumption per job, it's vulnerable to this attack.

**Example:** An attacker enqueues a large number of jobs that perform computationally intensive tasks or make excessive external API calls, overwhelming the worker pool and potentially the Redis instance.

**Impact:** Denial of service, performance degradation, increased infrastructure costs, and potential cascading failures in dependent systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Job Timeouts: Implement timeouts for job execution to prevent runaway processes.
* Resource Limits: Configure resource limits (e.g., memory limits, CPU quotas) for worker processes.
* Queue Prioritization and Throttling: Implement mechanisms to prioritize important jobs and throttle the processing of less critical or potentially malicious jobs.
* Monitoring and Alerting: Monitor resource usage of worker processes and the Redis instance to detect and respond to resource exhaustion attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Queues](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_queues.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information is included in job arguments or job metadata stored in Redis, making it vulnerable to exposure if the Redis instance is compromised.

**How Resque Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Resque stores job data in Redis. If developers are not careful about the data they include in jobs, it can become a target for attackers.

**Example:** Job arguments contain API keys, user credentials, or personally identifiable information (PII) that an attacker can access by compromising the Redis instance.

**Impact:** Data breaches, privacy violations, and reputational damage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid Storing Sensitive Data Directly:  Do not include sensitive data directly in job arguments. Instead, pass identifiers and retrieve sensitive data from secure storage when the job is processed.
* Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data before including it in job arguments or metadata.
* Secure Redis Instance: As mentioned before, securing the Redis instance is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to job data.
