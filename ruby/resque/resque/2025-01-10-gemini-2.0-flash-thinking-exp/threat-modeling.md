# Threat Model Analysis for resque/resque

## Threat: [Unsafe Deserialization of Job Arguments](./threats/unsafe_deserialization_of_job_arguments.md)

**Description:** If job arguments are serialized and deserialized using insecure methods (e.g., `eval` or pickle in Python without proper safeguards) *within Resque's worker process*, an attacker could craft malicious serialized payloads that execute arbitrary code when deserialized by the worker. This directly leverages how Resque handles job data.

**Impact:** Full compromise of worker nodes, potential access to sensitive data, ability to pivot to other systems on the network.

**Affected Resque Component:** Worker process, specifically the code *within Resque* responsible for deserializing job arguments.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using insecure deserialization methods. Resque users should configure their job serialization carefully.
* Explicitly define the classes that can be deserialized for job arguments (whitelisting). This needs to be implemented in the application's job setup when using Resque.
* Consider using safer serialization formats like JSON, which Resque supports.

## Threat: [Redis Data Tampering](./threats/redis_data_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Redis instance used by Resque and directly modifies job data, queue metadata, or other stored information. While the *access* is an external factor, the *impact on Resque* is direct, as it relies on the integrity of this data. This allows manipulation of Resque's core functionality.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code by altering job arguments that Resque workers will process, disruption of job processing managed by Resque, deletion of jobs from Resque queues, potential information disclosure by accessing job data stored by Resque.

**Affected Resque Component:** Redis data store (used by Resque for queue management).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication (e.g., `requirepass`) and authorization (e.g., ACLs) for Redis. This is crucial for protecting Resque's data store.
* Restrict network access to the Redis instance to only authorized hosts.
* Consider using TLS encryption for connections to Redis.

## Threat: [Redis Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/redis_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the Resque queues with a massive number of jobs, overwhelming the Redis instance. While the *source* of the flood might be external, the *impact on Resque's operation* is direct, as it depends on Redis availability.

**Impact:** Application slowdown because Resque can't enqueue or dequeue jobs, job processing delays managed by Resque, potential application unavailability due to Redis failure that impacts Resque.

**Affected Resque Component:** Redis data store (fundamental to Resque's operation).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Monitor Redis resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.
* Consider using Redis Cluster for increased capacity and resilience, which directly benefits Resque's scalability.
* While application-level rate limiting is important, securing Redis itself is a core Resque mitigation.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Job Handler Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_job_handler_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Job handler code *executed by Resque workers* may rely on third-party libraries with known security vulnerabilities. An attacker could craft malicious jobs that exploit these vulnerabilities during execution on the worker. This directly affects the security of the Resque worker environment.

**Impact:** Potential for remote code execution *within the Resque worker process*, data breaches accessible to the worker, or other security compromises depending on the vulnerability.

**Affected Resque Component:** Worker process, specifically the third-party libraries used within the job handler code *executed by Resque*.

**Risk Severity:** High (can be critical depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update all dependencies used in job handlers. This is a critical responsibility for developers using Resque.
* Implement a process for vulnerability scanning and patching of dependencies.
* Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Resque Web UI](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_resque_web_ui.md)

**Description:** If the Resque Web UI (provided by `Resque::Server`) is exposed without proper authentication and authorization, attackers could gain access to monitor job queues, view job details, and potentially perform administrative actions (depending on the UI's capabilities). This is a vulnerability within Resque's provided tooling.

**Impact:** Information disclosure about Resque job activity and application workload, potential manipulation of job queues (if the UI allows it), denial of service by deleting or pausing jobs *within Resque*.

**Affected Resque Component:** `Resque::Server` (the web UI component).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for the Resque Web UI (e.g., using HTTP Basic Auth, OAuth, or other authentication mechanisms).
* Restrict access to the Web UI to authorized personnel only.
* Consider deploying the Web UI on a separate, secured network or behind a VPN.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Resque Web UI](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_resque_web_ui.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Resque Web UI (provided by `Resque::Server`) could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts that are executed in the browsers of users accessing the UI. This is a vulnerability within Resque's provided tooling.

**Impact:** Session hijacking of users accessing the Resque Web UI, credential theft related to the UI, redirection to malicious sites from the UI context, defacement of the Web UI.

**Affected Resque Component:** `Resque::Server` (the web UI component), specifically the view templates.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure the Resque Web UI is up-to-date and any reported XSS vulnerabilities are patched *in Resque itself*.
* Implement proper output encoding and sanitization within the Web UI templates to prevent the injection of malicious scripts.
* Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on cookies used by the Web UI.
