## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Redis Vulnerabilities Introduced by Resque Usage -> Gain Unauthorized Access to Redis -> Manipulate Resque Queues and Data in Redis -> Inject Malicious Job Payloads](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_redis_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_resque_usage_-_gain_unauthorized_access_to_redis_-_manip_be179654.md)

This path outlines a scenario where an attacker first gains access to the underlying Redis database due to weak security, and then uses this access to inject malicious jobs into the Resque queues. This directly leads to the potential for code execution on worker processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Resque Worker Vulnerabilities -> Trigger Execution of Malicious Code within a Worker Process -> Leverage Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Job Payloads](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_resque_worker_vulnerabilities_-_trigger_execution_of_malicious_code_within_a_worker_process__8485a4ac.md)

This path focuses on the direct exploitation of deserialization vulnerabilities within the worker processes. If job payloads contain serialized data that is not securely handled during deserialization, attackers can inject malicious code that will be executed when the worker processes the job.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Resque Worker Vulnerabilities -> Trigger Execution of Malicious Code within a Worker Process -> Exploit Dependencies Used by Worker Processes](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_resque_worker_vulnerabilities_-_trigger_execution_of_malicious_code_within_a_worker_process__af637864.md)

This path highlights the risk of using vulnerable third-party libraries within the job handlers. If the dependencies used by the worker processes have known security flaws, attackers can craft job payloads that exploit these vulnerabilities, leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Resque Worker Vulnerabilities -> Trigger Execution of Malicious Code within a Worker Process -> Exploit Code Injection Flaws in Job Handlers](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_resque_worker_vulnerabilities_-_trigger_execution_of_malicious_code_within_a_worker_process__4bcbb3aa.md)

This path describes a situation where the developers of the job handlers have made the mistake of directly interpreting user-supplied data as code. Attackers can then inject malicious code through the job payload, which will be executed by the worker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Resque's Job Enqueueing Process -> Control the Job Payload Being Enqueued](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_resque's_job_enqueueing_process_-_control_the_job_payload_being_enqueued.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities in the process by which jobs are added to the Resque queue. If the system responsible for enqueuing jobs is compromised or lacks proper input validation, attackers can inject malicious payloads directly into the queue, which will then be processed by the workers.
