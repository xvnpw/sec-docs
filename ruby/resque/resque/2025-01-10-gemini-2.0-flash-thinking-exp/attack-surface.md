# Attack Surface Analysis for resque/resque

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Redis Instance](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_redis_instance.md)

**Description:** The Redis instance used by Resque is accessible without proper authentication or authorization.

**How Resque Contributes:** Resque relies on Redis as its message broker. If Redis is insecure, the entire queuing system is vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the Redis instance running on the default port without a password. They use Redis commands to inspect job queues and find sensitive user data within job arguments.

**Impact:** Data breach, manipulation of job queues leading to denial of service or execution of malicious tasks, potential full system compromise via Redis command execution.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Require authentication (using `requirepass` in Redis configuration).
*   Bind Redis to specific internal network interfaces or use a firewall to restrict access.
*   Avoid exposing the Redis port directly to the internet.
*   Regularly update Redis to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Data in Job Payloads](./attack_surfaces/malicious_data_in_job_payloads.md)

**Description:** Untrusted or unsanitized data is included in job arguments and later processed by worker processes.

**How Resque Contributes:** Resque allows arbitrary data to be passed as arguments to jobs. If not handled carefully, this can be a vector for attack.

**Example:** An attacker submits a job with a crafted string in the arguments. The worker process uses this string in a system command without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on worker servers, data corruption, privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all job arguments before processing them in the worker.
*   Avoid using dynamic code execution (e.g., `eval`) on job arguments.
*   Use parameterized queries or safe APIs when interacting with databases or external systems based on job arguments.
*   Implement input validation on the enqueueing side to restrict the types and formats of allowed job arguments.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Job Enqueueing](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_job_enqueueing.md)

**Description:**  Attackers can add arbitrary jobs to the Resque queues without proper authorization.

**How Resque Contributes:** Resque's enqueueing mechanism needs to be protected to prevent unauthorized access.

**Example:** An attacker discovers an unprotected endpoint that allows enqueuing jobs. They inject numerous resource-intensive jobs, causing a denial of service.

**Impact:** Denial of service, execution of unintended or malicious tasks, potential resource exhaustion.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement proper authentication and authorization for all job enqueueing mechanisms.
*   Use API keys, tokens, or session management to verify the identity of the enqueuing entity.
*   Rate-limit enqueueing requests to prevent abuse.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via Job Arguments in Workers](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_job_arguments_in_workers.md)

**Description:** Worker processes execute code based on unsanitized job arguments.

**How Resque Contributes:** Resque workers execute the code defined in job handlers with the provided arguments.

**Example:** A job handler uses `system()` or a similar function with a job argument directly. An attacker enqueues a job with a malicious command in the argument, leading to remote code execution on the worker.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on worker servers, full compromise of the worker environment.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never directly execute code based on untrusted job arguments.
*   Use safe APIs and libraries that prevent command injection.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all job arguments.
*   Consider running worker processes with minimal privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion by Malicious Jobs](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_by_malicious_jobs.md)

**Description:** Attackers enqueue jobs designed to consume excessive resources on worker servers.

**How Resque Contributes:** Resque allows the execution of arbitrary code within worker processes, making them susceptible to resource exhaustion attacks.

**Example:** An attacker enqueues a job that initiates an infinite loop or allocates a large amount of memory, causing the worker process to crash or consume excessive resources.

**Impact:** Denial of service, performance degradation of worker processes and potentially the entire application infrastructure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement timeouts for job execution.
*   Monitor resource usage of worker processes and implement alerts for unusual activity.
*   Set resource limits (e.g., memory limits, CPU limits) for worker processes using containerization or operating system features.
*   Implement job prioritization to ensure critical jobs are processed even under load.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Job Payloads](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_job_payloads.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information is included in job payloads without proper encryption.

**How Resque Contributes:** Resque transmits job arguments through Redis, making them potentially accessible if Redis is compromised.

**Example:** Job arguments contain unencrypted personal data. An attacker gains access to the Redis instance and reads the contents of the queues, exposing this sensitive information.

**Impact:** Data breach, privacy violations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid including sensitive information directly in job payloads.
*   If sensitive information is necessary, encrypt it before enqueuing and decrypt it within the worker process.
*   Consider using secure storage mechanisms and passing references or identifiers in the job payload instead of the actual data.
