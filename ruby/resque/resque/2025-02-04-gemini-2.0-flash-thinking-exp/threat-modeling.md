# Threat Model Analysis for resque/resque

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Redis Queues](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_redis_queues.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the Redis instance could read job data stored in queues. This data might include sensitive information like API keys, user credentials, or personal data embedded within job arguments or payloads. Attackers could use Redis commands like `KEYS`, `GET`, `LRANGE` to extract this data.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data, potential identity theft, financial loss, regulatory fines.
*   **Resque Component Affected:** Redis Backend (queues, job data storage).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Redis Access Control:** Implement strong authentication (`requirepass`) and network access controls (firewall, ACLs) for Redis.
    *   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data before enqueueing and decrypt within the worker.
    *   **Minimize Sensitive Data in Jobs:** Avoid passing sensitive data directly as job arguments; use identifiers instead.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Audit Redis configuration and access logs.

## Threat: [Job Argument Injection](./threats/job_argument_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate job enqueueing to inject malicious data into job arguments. When workers process these jobs, the injected data could be interpreted as code or commands, leading to unintended actions.
*   **Impact:** Code execution on workers, data corruption, application logic bypass, potential for privilege escalation.
*   **Resque Component Affected:** Job Enqueueing Process, Worker `perform` method, Job Classes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all job arguments at enqueueing.
    *   **Parameterization:** Use parameterized queries/commands within job code instead of embedding arguments directly.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run worker processes with minimal necessary privileges.
    *   **Code Review:** Regularly review job code and enqueueing logic for injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Redis](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_redis.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized network access to the Redis instance used by Resque, exploiting misconfigurations, weak passwords, or network vulnerabilities. They can then view, modify, or delete jobs, and potentially access sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data integrity compromise, denial of service, unauthorized job manipulation, potential full system compromise.
*   **Resque Component Affected:** Redis Backend, Network Connectivity to Redis.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Redis Authentication:** Set a strong password using `requirepass`.
    *   **Network Segmentation and Firewalls:** Isolate Redis on a private network and restrict access via firewalls.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Redis Commands:** Use `rename-command` to disable dangerous Redis commands.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly audit Redis security and conduct penetration testing.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Job Enqueueing](./threats/unauthorized_job_enqueueing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses authorization checks and enqueues arbitrary jobs into Resque queues. This could be through API vulnerabilities or direct access to the enqueueing mechanism. Maliciously enqueued jobs can consume resources, execute unintended code, or cause denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, resource exhaustion, execution of unintended/malicious code, potential data corruption.
*   **Resque Component Affected:** Job Enqueueing Process, Application API, Resque `enqueue` function.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authorization for Enqueueing:** Implement robust authentication and authorization for job enqueueing endpoints.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on job enqueueing.
    *   **Input Validation on Enqueueing:** Validate data submitted during job enqueueing.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor job enqueueing rates for anomalies.

## Threat: [Redis Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/redis_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker targets the Redis instance with a DoS attack, making it unavailable. As Resque depends on Redis, job processing halts.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, application downtime, loss of background processing capabilities, potential data loss.
*   **Resque Component Affected:** Redis Backend, Dependency on Redis Availability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Redis Hardening:** Follow Redis security best practices to harden against DoS attacks.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Traffic Shaping:** Implement network-level rate limiting and traffic shaping.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor Redis performance for DoS indicators.
    *   **Redundancy and High Availability (Consider):** Deploy Redis in a high-availability configuration.

## Threat: [Malicious Job Code Execution](./threats/malicious_job_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Job code, if not properly reviewed or from untrusted sources, could contain malicious code. Workers executing these jobs will run the malicious code with worker privileges.
*   **Impact:** Worker compromise, unauthorized access to internal resources, data breach, lateral movement, potential full system compromise.
*   **Resque Component Affected:** Job Code, Worker `perform` method, Job Classes.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Job Code Development Practices:** Implement secure coding and thorough code reviews for jobs.
    *   **Static Code Analysis:** Use static code analysis tools on job code.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run worker processes with minimal privileges.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Carefully manage and update job dependencies.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Code Loading (If Possible):** Minimize dynamic code loading from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Job Code or Worker Environment](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_job_code_or_worker_environment.md)

*   **Description:** Job code or the worker environment relies on vulnerable third-party libraries. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code on worker machines.
*   **Impact:** Worker compromise, unauthorized access, data breach, lateral movement, potential full system compromise.
*   **Resque Component Affected:** Worker Environment, Job Dependencies, Ruby Gems, System Libraries.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning and Management:** Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., Bundler Audit, Snyk).
    *   **Regular Dependency Updates:** Regularly update dependencies to secure versions.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Implement SCA in the development pipeline.
    *   **Worker Environment Hardening:** Harden the worker environment by minimizing software and applying security patches.
