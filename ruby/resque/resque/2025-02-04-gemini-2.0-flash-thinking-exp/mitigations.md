# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for resque/resque

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Deserialization Practices (Prefer JSON and Safe YAML Loading)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_deserialization_practices__prefer_json_and_safe_yaml_loading_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Default to JSON:** Configure Resque to use JSON as the default serialization format. JSON is generally safer than YAML for deserialization vulnerabilities. Check your Resque configuration and ensure JSON is specified. In Ruby, this often involves ensuring your `Resque.redis` connection is configured to use JSON serialization (which is often the default, but verify).
2.  **Safe YAML Loading (If YAML is necessary):** If you must use YAML for specific jobs or configurations within Resque (though generally discouraged for job data):
    *   **Use `YAML.safe_load`:** Always use the safe loading methods provided by your YAML library (e.g., `YAML.safe_load` in Ruby). Avoid using `YAML.load` or similar unsafe methods within your Resque job code if you process YAML data.
    *   **Restrict YAML Usage:** Limit the use of YAML within Resque to configurations or data where its specific features are genuinely required, and avoid it for job arguments if possible.
3.  **Regularly Review Dependencies:** Keep your YAML library (if used) updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements. Ensure your `resque` gem and its dependencies are also up to date.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Unsafe deserialization, especially of YAML, can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if attackers can control the serialized job data.

**Impact:**
*   Deserialization Vulnerabilities: High Risk Reduction - Using JSON or safe YAML loading methods significantly reduces the risk of RCE via deserialization within Resque jobs.

**Currently Implemented:** Yes - Resque is configured to use JSON for job serialization. YAML is not used for job data serialization within Resque itself.

**Missing Implementation:**  N/A - Currently using JSON. However, ongoing awareness is needed to prevent developers from introducing unsafe YAML loading practices within Resque jobs or configurations in the future. Code reviews should specifically check for unsafe YAML usage within Resque-related code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Job Class Whitelisting](./mitigation_strategies/job_class_whitelisting.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Create a Whitelist:** Define a list of explicitly allowed Resque job classes that your application is designed to execute. This list should be maintained and updated as new job classes are added or removed. Store this whitelist in a configuration file or environment variable accessible to your Resque workers.
2.  **Implement Whitelist Check in Worker:**  In your Resque worker initialization or within a base class for your Resque jobs, implement a check to verify if the class name of an incoming job is present in the whitelist. This check should happen *before* the job's `perform` method is executed.
3.  **Reject Unwhitelisted Jobs:** If a job class is not found in the whitelist, reject the job and log an alert.  Do not execute the job's `perform` method. Consider moving rejected jobs to a dead-letter queue (if you have implemented one) or simply discarding them after logging.
4.  **Automate Whitelist Updates:** Integrate the whitelist management into your deployment process so that updates to the whitelist are automatically deployed with code changes. Ensure the whitelist is version-controlled along with your application code.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Arbitrary Job Execution (High Severity):** Attackers could inject malicious job classes into the Resque queue and potentially achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) if workers execute them without validation.

**Impact:**
*   Arbitrary Job Execution: High Risk Reduction - Effectively prevents the execution of unauthorized or malicious job classes by Resque workers, significantly reducing the risk of RCE via job injection.

**Currently Implemented:** No - Job class whitelisting is not currently implemented in Resque workers. Workers execute any job class that is enqueued, as long as the class is loadable by the worker environment.

**Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement job class whitelisting directly within the Resque worker initialization process or job processing logic. This will require modifying worker startup scripts or application code to include the whitelist check. A base class for Resque jobs could be created to enforce this check. The whitelist itself needs to be defined and managed (e.g., in a configuration file or environment variable).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Queue Monitoring and Alerting](./mitigation_strategies/queue_monitoring_and_alerting.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define Resque-Specific Monitoring Metrics:** Identify key metrics specific to Resque queues and workers to monitor:
    *   Queue Length per queue: Track the number of jobs in each Resque queue defined in your application.
    *   Processing Rate: Monitor the rate at which Resque workers are processing jobs across all queues.
    *   Failed Jobs Rate: Track the number of failed Resque jobs and the rate of failures. Resque provides mechanisms to track failed jobs.
    *   Worker Status: Monitor the status of Resque workers (e.g., number of active workers, idle workers, workers with errors). Resque Web UI or monitoring gems can provide this data.
2.  **Implement Monitoring Tools:**  Utilize tools that can monitor Resque metrics. Resque Web UI provides basic monitoring. For more robust monitoring, consider using gems that integrate with monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus exporters for Resque, plugins for Datadog/New Relic).
3.  **Set Up Resque-Specific Alerts:** Configure alerts based on thresholds for Resque metrics. For example:
    *   Alert if a specific queue length exceeds a defined limit.
    *   Alert if the overall processing rate drops below a threshold.
    *   Alert if the failed job rate exceeds a certain percentage.
    *   Alert if the number of active workers drops below a minimum.
4.  **Alerting Channels:** Configure appropriate alerting channels (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty) to notify operations or development teams of Resque-related alerts.
5.  **Incident Response Plan for Resque Issues:** Develop an incident response plan specifically for Resque-related security or operational alerts.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Monitoring Resque queues can help detect and respond to DoS attacks that flood the queue with jobs, impacting Resque's performance.
*   **Queue Poisoning (Medium Severity):** Monitoring failed job rates and queue patterns can help detect unusual activity indicative of potential queue poisoning attempts targeting Resque.
*   **System Instability related to Resque (Medium Severity):** Monitoring helps identify performance bottlenecks or resource issues within the Resque system itself (e.g., worker starvation, queue backlogs).

**Impact:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium Risk Reduction - Resque-specific monitoring provides early warning of potential DoS attacks targeting the job queue, allowing for faster response and mitigation within the Resque context.
*   Queue Poisoning: Medium Risk Reduction - Monitoring Resque job failures and queue behavior can aid in detecting and investigating potential queue poisoning attempts aimed at disrupting job processing.
*   System Instability related to Resque: Medium Risk Reduction - Resque monitoring helps proactively identify and address performance issues within the job processing system, preventing instability and potential security impacts related to job execution delays or failures.

**Currently Implemented:** Partial - Basic queue monitoring is available through Resque Web UI, which is occasionally checked manually. No automated alerting is configured specifically for Resque metrics.

**Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement automated monitoring and alerting specifically for Resque queues and workers. This requires integrating Resque with a monitoring system and configuring alerts for key Resque metrics. Consider using Resque monitoring gems or exporters to facilitate this integration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Queue Size Limits and Backpressure](./mitigation_strategies/queue_size_limits_and_backpressure.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Set Resque Queue Size Limits (Application Level):** Implement queue size limits at the Resque application level. Before enqueuing a job, check the current length of the target Resque queue using `Resque.size(queue_name)`. 
2.  **Define Queue Size Thresholds:** Determine appropriate maximum queue sizes for each Resque queue based on your system's capacity and expected workload. These thresholds should be configurable.
3.  **Implement Backpressure Mechanisms at Enqueue Time:** When the queue size exceeds the defined threshold, implement backpressure to prevent further job enqueueing. This can involve:
    *   **Rejecting New Jobs:**  Prevent the enqueue operation and return an error to the enqueueing application or service.
    *   **Applying Delay/Retry:** Implement a delay or retry mechanism at the enqueueing point. Instead of immediately rejecting, wait for a short period and re-check the queue size before attempting to enqueue again.
    *   **Circuit Breaker Pattern for Enqueueing:** Implement a circuit breaker pattern to temporarily halt job enqueueing when queues are overloaded, allowing the system to recover.
4.  **Monitoring Queue Sizes (for Limits):** Monitor Resque queue sizes programmatically within your application to enforce the limits and trigger backpressure mechanisms.
5.  **Alerting on Queue Limits (Optional, but Recommended):** Set up alerts to notify operations teams when Resque queues are approaching or exceeding size limits, indicating potential overload or DoS conditions.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Queue Flooding (Medium Severity):** Resque queue size limits and backpressure prevent unbounded queue growth, mitigating DoS attacks that aim to exhaust Resque queue resources and worker capacity.
*   **System Instability due to Resque Overload (Medium Severity):** Limiting Resque queue sizes prevents excessive memory usage by Redis (used by Resque) and potential worker overload, improving system stability specifically within the Resque job processing context.

**Impact:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS) via Queue Flooding: Medium Risk Reduction - Resque-level queue size limits and backpressure effectively prevent queue flooding within the Resque system, mitigating DoS attacks targeting the job queue.
*   System Instability due to Resque Overload: Medium Risk Reduction - Improves the stability of the Resque job processing system by preventing queue overload and potential resource exhaustion within the Resque context.

**Currently Implemented:** No - Resque queue size limits and backpressure mechanisms are not explicitly implemented at the application level. Resque queues can grow without application-level control until Redis resources are exhausted or performance degrades.

**Missing Implementation:** Need to implement Resque queue size limits and backpressure mechanisms within the application code that enqueues Resque jobs. This involves adding queue size checks before enqueueing and implementing backpressure logic (reject, delay, circuit breaker). Configuration for queue size thresholds is also required.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Queue Prioritization and Job Scheduling (within Resque)](./mitigation_strategies/queue_prioritization_and_job_scheduling__within_resque_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define Job Priorities and Queues:** Categorize your Resque jobs based on priority (e.g., high, medium, low). Create separate Resque queues for each priority level (e.g., `high_priority_queue`, `medium_priority_queue`, `low_priority_queue`).
2.  **Enqueue Jobs to Priority Queues:** Modify your application code to enqueue jobs into the appropriate priority queue based on their criticality. Use `Resque.enqueue_to(queue_name, JobClass, *args)` to enqueue to specific queues.
3.  **Configure Worker Queue Priority:** When starting Resque workers, specify the order of queues they should process, prioritizing higher-priority queues. For example, start workers with `QUEUE=high_priority_queue,medium_priority_queue,low_priority_queue`. Workers will process jobs from `high_priority_queue` first, then `medium_priority_queue`, and finally `low_priority_queue` when higher priority queues are empty.
4.  **Job Scheduling (Resque Scheduler Gem - Optional):** If you need more advanced scheduling capabilities within Resque (e.g., delayed jobs, recurring jobs), consider using the `resque-scheduler` gem. This gem allows you to schedule jobs for execution at specific times or intervals within the Resque framework. Ensure you understand the security implications of using scheduled jobs, especially if job arguments or scheduling logic is user-controlled.
5.  **Monitor Priority Queue Performance:** Monitor the performance of each priority queue to ensure prioritization is working as intended and high-priority jobs are being processed promptly. Track queue lengths and processing times for each priority level.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) Impact Mitigation (Medium Severity):** Resque queue prioritization ensures that critical jobs are processed even under heavy load or potential DoS conditions affecting the Resque system, mitigating the impact on critical application functions handled by Resque.
*   **Business Logic DoS within Resque (Medium Severity):** Prioritization within Resque prevents less important jobs from delaying the processing of critical business operations that rely on Resque, mitigating business logic DoS scenarios specifically within the job processing context.
*   **Resource Starvation for Critical Resque Jobs (Medium Severity):** Resque queue prioritization prevents resource starvation for critical jobs within the Resque system by ensuring they are processed before less important jobs when worker resources are contended.

**Impact:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS) Impact Mitigation: Medium Risk Reduction - Resque queue prioritization reduces the impact of DoS on critical functions handled by Resque by ensuring high-priority jobs are processed even under load within the job processing system.
*   Business Logic DoS within Resque: Medium Risk Reduction - Prevents business logic DoS scenarios specifically within the Resque job processing context by prioritizing critical operations handled by jobs.
*   Resource Starvation for Critical Resque Jobs: Medium Risk Reduction - Prevents critical Resque jobs from being starved of processing resources by less important jobs within the Resque system.

**Currently Implemented:** No - Resque queue prioritization and job scheduling are not currently implemented. All jobs are enqueued into a single default queue and workers process jobs from this queue without priority differentiation.

**Missing Implementation:** Need to implement Resque queue prioritization. This involves defining job priorities, creating and configuring multiple Resque queues for different priorities, and updating worker startup scripts to specify the queue processing order. Application code needs to be modified to enqueue jobs into the appropriate priority queues. Consider using `resque-scheduler` for advanced scheduling if needed, but evaluate its security implications.
