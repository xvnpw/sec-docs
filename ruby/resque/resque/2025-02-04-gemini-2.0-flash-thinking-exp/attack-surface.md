# Attack Surface Analysis for resque/resque

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Redis Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_redis_access.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of the underlying Redis instance to unauthorized access.
*   **Resque Contribution:** Resque relies on Redis for all queue operations and data storage. Misconfigured or unsecured Redis instances used by Resque become a direct and critical attack vector.
*   **Example:** A Resque setup uses a Redis instance with no password and is accessible from the public internet. An attacker scans for open Redis instances, finds the Resque Redis, and connects.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (job data), job manipulation (deletion, injection), Denial of Service (Redis overload, queue deletion).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Require Authentication:** Configure Redis with a strong password using the `requirepass` directive.
    *   **Network Isolation:**  Restrict Redis access to only necessary hosts (e.g., application servers, worker machines) using firewall rules or network segmentation. Avoid exposing Redis directly to the public internet.
    *   **Use Secure Network Channels:** If Redis access traverses untrusted networks, consider using TLS encryption for Redis connections.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Job Deserialization (Marshal Vulnerability)](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_job_deserialization__marshal_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of Ruby's `Marshal.load` vulnerability when deserializing job arguments, leading to Remote Code Execution.
*   **Resque Contribution:** Resque, by default, uses `Marshal.load` to deserialize job arguments when workers process jobs. If job arguments are attacker-controlled, this becomes a critical vulnerability inherent to Resque's default behavior.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious Ruby object serialized using `Marshal.dump`. They inject a job into the Resque queue with this malicious serialized object as an argument. When a worker processes this job, `Marshal.load` deserializes the object, executing arbitrary code on the worker machine.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on worker machines, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid `Marshal` for Deserialization:**  **Strongly recommended.**  Switch to a safer serialization format like JSON for job arguments. Resque allows customization of the serializer. Implement a custom serializer/deserializer using JSON or another secure format.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** If `Marshal` *must* be used (discouraged), rigorously validate and sanitize all job arguments before they are enqueued to prevent injection of malicious serialized objects. This is extremely difficult to do reliably for `Marshal` and is not a recommended primary mitigation.

## Attack Surface: [Resque Web UI - Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/resque_web_ui_-_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  Unauthorized access to the Resque Web interface due to missing or weak authentication and authorization.
*   **Resque Contribution:** Resque Web, a component of the Resque ecosystem, provides a web-based interface. If enabled and exposed without proper security, it directly introduces an attack surface.
*   **Example:** Resque Web is deployed and accessible without any authentication. An attacker accesses the Resque Web URL and gains full control over job queues, workers, and potentially sensitive application information exposed through the UI.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, job queue manipulation, potential disruption of application functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Authentication and Authorization:**  **Crucial.**  Enable authentication for Resque Web. Use a strong authentication mechanism (e.g., password-based authentication, OAuth, or integrate with existing application authentication). Implement proper authorization to control which users can access Resque Web and what actions they can perform.
    *   **Network Isolation:** Restrict access to Resque Web to only authorized users and networks (e.g., internal networks, VPN). Avoid exposing Resque Web directly to the public internet.

## Attack Surface: [Resque Web UI - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/resque_web_ui_-_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** XSS vulnerabilities in the Resque Web interface allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Resque Contribution:**  Vulnerabilities within the Resque Web codebase, a part of the Resque project, directly introduce XSS risks.
*   **Example:** Resque Web has an XSS vulnerability in the queue name display. An attacker creates a queue with a malicious name containing JavaScript. When an administrator views this queue in Resque Web, the malicious JavaScript is executed in their browser, potentially stealing their session cookie.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, defacement of Resque Web for other users.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Security Updates:** Keep Resque Web and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches, which often include fixes for XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding in Resque Web:** If contributing to Resque Web or customizing it, ensure proper input sanitization and output encoding are implemented to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) header for Resque Web to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities by restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources.
