## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Redis Infrastructure [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_redis_infrastructure__critical_node_.md)

Attack Vector Description: This path focuses on compromising the Redis instance that Resque relies on. Redis is a key component, and if an attacker gains control over it, they can manipulate Resque's queues, data, and potentially gain code execution.
    * Potential Impact: Full compromise of the Resque application, data breaches, denial of service, and potentially wider infrastructure compromise if Redis is not properly isolated.
    * Recommended Mitigations:
        * Secure Redis with strong authentication (`requirepass`).
        * Implement network access controls (firewall, `bind` configuration) to restrict access to Redis only from trusted sources (Resque workers, enqueueing application).
        * Regularly update Redis to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Restrict or disable dangerous Redis commands (e.g., `EVAL`, `MODULE LOAD`, `CONFIG`) using `rename-command` if not absolutely necessary.
        * Monitor Redis access logs for suspicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Gain Access to Redis Instance](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__gain_access_to_redis_instance.md)

Attack Vector Description: This is the initial step in exploiting Redis infrastructure. Attackers attempt to connect to the Redis instance.
    * Potential Impact:  Once access is gained, attackers can proceed with various Redis exploitation techniques, leading to data manipulation, command execution, or denial of service.
    * Recommended Mitigations:
        * **This is directly addressed by securing Redis as described above.**  Focus on authentication and network access controls as primary mitigations.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Redis Unauthenticated Access (Default Configuration)](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__redis_unauthenticated_access__default_configuration_.md)

Attack Vector Description:  Many Redis installations, especially in development or testing environments, are left with default configurations that do not require authentication. Attackers can directly connect to these instances if they are exposed to the network.
    * Potential Impact:  Immediate and full access to Redis data and commands, leading to all the impacts described under "Exploit Redis Infrastructure". This is a very high-impact vulnerability due to ease of exploitation.
    * Recommended Mitigations:
        * **Absolutely avoid default configurations in production and even staging environments.**
        * **Immediately enable `requirepass` in Redis configuration and set a strong, unique password.**
        * **Ensure Redis is not exposed to the public internet.** Use firewalls and `bind` configuration to restrict access to trusted networks and hosts.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Resque Worker Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__exploit_resque_worker_vulnerabilities.md)

Attack Vector Description: This path targets vulnerabilities within the Resque worker processes themselves. These vulnerabilities can arise from how Resque handles job processing, especially deserialization and dependency management.
    * Potential Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE) on worker servers, denial of service, and potentially lateral movement within the application infrastructure if workers have access to other systems.
    * Recommended Mitigations:
        * **Prioritize mitigating Job Deserialization Vulnerabilities (see below).**
        * Implement robust error handling in job classes to prevent worker crashes.
        * Implement resource limits for worker processes (CPU, memory, time) to mitigate DoS attempts.
        * Regularly audit and update dependencies in the worker environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Job Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Ruby `Marshal.load` is default serializer in Resque)](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__job_deserialization_vulnerabilities__ruby__marshal_load__is_default_7c319dfc.md)

Attack Vector Description: Resque, by default, uses `Marshal.load` in Ruby to deserialize job arguments. `Marshal.load` is known to be unsafe and can be exploited to achieve Remote Code Execution if an attacker can inject a malicious serialized payload into a job queue.
    * Potential Impact:  Remote Code Execution (RCE) on worker servers. This is a critical vulnerability as it allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the worker machines.
    * Recommended Mitigations:
        * **Critically important: Replace `Marshal.load` with a safer serialization format.** JSON or `Oj` (with safe mode enabled) are strongly recommended alternatives.
        * If `Marshal.load` *must* be used (which is highly discouraged), implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization of job arguments *before* serialization and deserialization. This is complex and error-prone, making format replacement the preferred solution.
        * Consider sandboxing worker processes to limit the impact of potential RCE, although this is a defense-in-depth measure and not a primary mitigation for the unsafe deserialization itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Remote Code Execution (RCE) on Worker Server (via Deserialization)](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__remote_code_execution__rce__on_worker_server__via_deserialization_.md)

Attack Vector Description: This is the direct consequence of exploiting the `Marshal.load` vulnerability. By crafting a malicious serialized payload and injecting it into a Resque queue, an attacker can force a worker to deserialize it, leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the worker process.
    * Potential Impact: Full control over the worker server, ability to steal secrets, pivot to other systems, disrupt operations, and potentially compromise the entire application and infrastructure.
    * Recommended Mitigations:
        * **Mitigations for Job Deserialization Vulnerabilities directly prevent this RCE.**  Replacing `Marshal.load` is the primary and most effective mitigation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Dependency Vulnerabilities in Worker Environment](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__dependency_vulnerabilities_in_worker_environment.md)

Attack Vector Description: Resque workers rely on Ruby gems and other dependencies. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, and if those vulnerabilities are exploitable during job processing, attackers can compromise the worker environment.
    * Potential Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE), denial of service, or other unexpected behavior depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * Recommended Mitigations:
        * **Establish a robust dependency management process.**
        * Regularly audit and update Ruby gems using tools like `bundler-audit`.
        * Subscribe to security advisories for Ruby and relevant gems.
        * Consider using dependency scanning tools in your CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect vulnerable dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Remote Code Execution (RCE) (via Dependency Vulnerability)](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__remote_code_execution__rce___via_dependency_vulnerability_.md)

Attack Vector Description: This is the outcome of exploiting a vulnerability in a dependency used by Resque workers. If a vulnerable gem is used in a way that is triggered during job execution, an attacker can exploit the gem's vulnerability to achieve RCE.
    * Potential Impact:  Similar to RCE via deserialization, full control over the worker server and potential wider compromise.
    * Recommended Mitigations:
        * **Mitigations for Dependency Vulnerabilities directly prevent this RCE.**  Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning are key.
