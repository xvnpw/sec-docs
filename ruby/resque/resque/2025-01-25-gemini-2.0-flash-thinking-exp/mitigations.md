# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for resque/resque

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for Resque Job Arguments](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for_resque_job_arguments.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Resque Job Argument Handling:** Review your Resque job classes and pinpoint where job arguments, passed when jobs are enqueued via Resque, are used within the job's `perform` method or other processing logic.
        2.  **Implement Validation Logic *Before* Enqueuing:** In your application code, *before* you call `Resque.enqueue` or similar methods to add jobs to Resque queues, add validation logic. This validation should check the type, format, and allowed values of each argument you intend to pass to the Resque job.
            *   **Example:** If a job expects an integer ID, validate that the provided argument is indeed an integer and within an acceptable range. If it expects a string, validate its format and length.
        3.  **Sanitize Input Data *Before* Enqueuing:**  Sanitize job arguments *before* they are passed to `Resque.enqueue`. This means removing or escaping potentially harmful characters or code that could be misinterpreted during job processing or later use of the data.
            *   **Example:** If a job argument is used to construct a filename, sanitize it to prevent path traversal attacks. If it's used in a string that might be logged, sanitize to prevent log injection.
        4.  **Error Handling on Validation Failure:** If validation fails at the point of enqueuing, do *not* enqueue the job. Instead, log the validation error and handle it appropriately in your application (e.g., return an error to the user, retry with corrected data, etc.).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Code Injection via Resque Job Arguments (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code as job arguments that could be executed when Resque workers process the job. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on worker servers *via Resque*.
        *   **Data Integrity Issues via Malformed Arguments (Medium Severity):** Prevents jobs from processing invalid or unexpected data, which could lead to application errors, incorrect data updates, or inconsistent states *due to Resque job processing*.
        *   **Downstream System Exploitation via Unvalidated Arguments (Medium to High Severity):** If job arguments are passed to external systems (databases, APIs, etc.) without validation, it can prevent exploitation of those systems *through Resque job execution*.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High Risk Reduction:** Significantly reduces the risk of injection attacks and data integrity issues stemming from malicious or malformed data passed through Resque jobs.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   **Location:** Application codebase, specifically in the sections where Resque jobs are enqueued and potentially within job classes themselves (though validation should ideally happen *before* enqueueing).
        *   **Status:** *Example: Basic validation exists for user IDs passed to some Resque jobs, but string arguments are not consistently sanitized before enqueueing.* (Replace with your actual status).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Example: Missing validation for arguments in `ProcessOrderJob` and `SendEmailJob`. No sanitization implemented for job arguments used in file operations within `GenerateReportJob`.** (Replace with specific missing areas).
        *   Inconsistent validation practices across different parts of the application that enqueue Resque jobs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resque Job Class Whitelisting](./mitigation_strategies/resque_job_class_whitelisting.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Define a Resque Job Class Whitelist:** Create a definitive list of all Resque job classes that your application legitimately uses and that your Resque workers are authorized to execute. This whitelist should be maintained and updated as your application evolves.
        2.  **Implement Whitelist Check in Resque Workers:** Modify your Resque worker setup to include a check against this whitelist *before* attempting to process any incoming job. This check should occur as early as possible in the worker's job processing lifecycle.
        3.  **Reject Non-Whitelisted Jobs:** If a Resque worker receives a job for a class that is *not* on the whitelist, the worker should refuse to execute the job.  Instead, it should log a security warning indicating an attempt to process an unauthorized job class and potentially move the job to a dead-letter queue for investigation.
        4.  **Enforce Whitelist in All Worker Environments:** Ensure that this job class whitelisting is consistently enforced across all Resque worker environments (production, staging, development).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Job Class Enqueueing (Critical Severity):**  This is the primary threat mitigated. By whitelisting, you prevent an attacker from enqueuing jobs of arbitrary classes (including classes they might craft themselves with malicious code) and having your Resque workers execute them. This directly addresses a critical vulnerability point in Resque's design if not properly controlled.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Critical Risk Reduction:** Provides a very strong and direct defense against arbitrary code execution attacks targeting Resque job processing.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   **Location:** Resque worker initialization code or within a custom Resque plugin/middleware used by workers.
        *   **Status:** *Example: Resque job class whitelisting is implemented in production workers, but not in staging or development. The whitelist is defined in a configuration file but is not regularly reviewed.* (Replace with your actual status).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Example: Whitelisting needs to be implemented in staging and development worker environments.  Establish a process for regularly reviewing and updating the job class whitelist as new jobs are added or old ones are removed.** (Replace with missing areas).
        *   Whitelist enforcement is not consistently applied to all worker processes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Resque Job Serialization (Prefer JSON over `Marshal` if possible)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_resque_job_serialization__prefer_json_over__marshal__if_possible_.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Review Resque Serialization Configuration:** Check how your Resque client and workers are configured for job serialization.  By default, older versions of Resque and Ruby's `Marshal` might be used.
        2.  **Switch to JSON Serialization:**  If possible, configure Resque to use JSON (or another safer serialization format) instead of `Marshal`.  Many Resque client libraries allow you to specify the serializer. JSON is generally considered safer as it is less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities compared to `Marshal`.
        3.  **If `Marshal` Must Be Used (Proceed with Caution):** If you have a compelling reason to continue using `Marshal` (e.g., compatibility with a large number of existing jobs and changing serialization is too risky), be acutely aware of the risks.
            *   **Minimize Deserialization of Untrusted Data:**  Avoid deserializing job arguments that originate from untrusted sources if possible.
            *   **Regularly Update Ruby and Resque:** Keep your Ruby and Resque versions updated to benefit from any security patches related to `Marshal` or deserialization.
            *   **Consider Sandboxing/Isolation:** If using `Marshal`, explore running Resque workers in more isolated environments (containers, VMs) to limit the impact of potential deserialization exploits.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Resque Job Processing (High to Critical Severity if using `Marshal`):**  Directly mitigates risks associated with insecure deserialization, particularly the known vulnerabilities in Ruby's `Marshal`.  Exploiting `Marshal` deserialization flaws in Resque job arguments could lead to arbitrary code execution on Resque worker servers *when jobs are processed*.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High to Critical Risk Reduction (if switching from `Marshal` to JSON):**  Significantly reduces the risk of deserialization attacks targeting Resque job processing, especially by moving away from the more vulnerable `Marshal` format.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   **Location:** Resque client configuration, Resque worker initialization.
        *   **Status:** *Example: Resque is currently using the default `Marshal` serialization.  JSON serialization has not been configured.* (Replace with your actual status).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Example: Need to configure Resque client and workers to use JSON serialization.  Test compatibility with existing jobs to ensure a smooth transition.  Document the change in serialization format for developers.** (Replace with missing areas).
        *   No plan to migrate away from `Marshal` despite the known security risks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authentication and Authorization for Resque Web UI (if enabled)](./mitigation_strategies/authentication_and_authorization_for_resque_web_ui__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Enable Authentication for Resque Web UI:** If you are using `resque-web` or a similar web interface to monitor and manage your Resque queues and workers, ensure that authentication is enabled.  *Never expose the Resque Web UI without authentication, especially to the public internet.*
            *   **Configure Authentication Method:** `resque-web` often supports basic HTTP authentication. Configure this or integrate with a more robust authentication system if needed (e.g., application-level authentication, OAuth).
        2.  **Implement Authorization in Resque Web UI:**  Beyond authentication, implement authorization to control what actions users can perform within the Resque Web UI based on their roles or permissions.
            *   **Restrict Sensitive Actions:** Limit actions like deleting jobs, pausing queues, killing workers, or modifying Resque settings to only authorized administrator users.  Read-only access should be provided to users who only need to monitor Resque status.
        3.  **Secure Credential Management for Web UI Access:**  Manage credentials for accessing the Resque Web UI securely. Avoid hardcoding credentials in configuration files. Use environment variables or secure secrets management.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Resque Management Interface (High Severity via Resque Web UI):** Prevents unauthorized individuals from accessing the Resque Web UI and gaining visibility into sensitive Resque operations, job data, and worker status.  Unauthenticated access to the Web UI is a direct Resque-related vulnerability.
        *   **Malicious Manipulation of Resque Queues and Workers via Web UI (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from using the Web UI to perform actions that could disrupt application functionality, cause data loss, or lead to denial of service *by manipulating Resque queues and workers*.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Medium to High Risk Reduction:** Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access and malicious actions performed through the Resque Web UI, protecting your Resque infrastructure.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   **Location:** Resque Web UI configuration, potentially application-level authentication middleware if integrated.
        *   **Status:** *Example: Resque Web UI is currently accessible without any authentication. Authorization is not implemented to restrict actions within the UI.* (Replace with your actual status).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Example: Authentication needs to be enabled for the Resque Web UI in all environments where it is deployed.  Implement role-based authorization to control actions within the Web UI.  Establish secure credential management for Web UI access.** (Replace with missing areas).
        *   No plan to secure the Resque Web UI, leaving it publicly accessible.
