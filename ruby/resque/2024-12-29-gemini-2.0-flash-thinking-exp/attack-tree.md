Threat Model: Resque Application - High-Risk Sub-Tree

Objective: Compromise the application using Resque by executing arbitrary code on the application server.

Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

* **CRITICAL NODE: Gain Access to Redis Instance:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Exploit Weak Redis Authentication:** Attackers attempt to connect to the Redis instance using default or easily guessable passwords, or if no password is set.
        * **Exploit Network Vulnerabilities to Access Redis Port:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations like exposed Redis ports on the internet or insufficient firewall rules to gain network access to the Redis instance.
    * **Why it's Critical:** Successful compromise of this node enables multiple other high-risk attacks, including executing arbitrary Redis commands and directly manipulating job data.

* **HIGH-RISK PATH: Execute Malicious Redis Commands:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **`CONFIG SET` to load malicious modules or modify settings:** Attackers use the `CONFIG SET` command to load malicious Redis modules or modify settings in a way that allows code execution on the server.
        * **`EVAL` or `EVALSHA` with Lua scripts to execute arbitrary code:** Attackers use the `EVAL` or `EVALSHA` commands to execute arbitrary Lua scripts on the Redis server, which can be leveraged to compromise the application server.
    * **Why it's High-Risk:** Successful execution of these commands directly leads to the ability to run arbitrary code on the server.

* **HIGH-RISK PATH: Manipulate Resque Jobs -> Inject Malicious Job Data:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Directly modify job data in Redis (requires Redis access):** Attackers who have gained access to Redis directly modify the data associated with Resque jobs to inject malicious payloads.
        * **Exploit vulnerabilities in the application's job creation process:** Attackers exploit flaws in how the application creates Resque jobs, such as using unsanitized user input in job arguments, to inject malicious data.
    * **Why it's High-Risk:** Injecting malicious data into job arguments can lead to various vulnerabilities when the worker processes the job, including command injection, SQL injection, or other forms of code execution.

* **HIGH-RISK PATH: Manipulate Resque Jobs -> Trigger Execution of Malicious Job:**
    * **Attack Vectors:** Once malicious job data or a malicious job class is injected, the attacker relies on the normal Resque worker process to pick up and execute the compromised job.
    * **Why it's High-Risk:** This is the final step in the job manipulation attack, leading to the execution of the attacker's payload.

* **HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Job Arguments -> Inject Malicious Serialized Objects into Job Arguments:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Directly modify job data in Redis (requires Redis access):** Attackers with Redis access inject malicious serialized objects directly into the job arguments stored in Redis.
        * **Exploit vulnerabilities in the application's job creation process:** Attackers exploit flaws in how the application serializes data for job arguments, allowing them to inject malicious serialized objects.
    * **Why it's High-Risk:** Injecting malicious serialized objects can lead to remote code execution when the Resque worker deserializes the object, especially if "gadget chains" exist in the application's dependencies.

* **HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Job Arguments -> Trigger Deserialization of Malicious Object:**
    * **Attack Vectors:** The attacker relies on the Resque worker to deserialize the previously injected malicious object during the normal job processing.
    * **Why it's High-Risk:** Successful deserialization of a malicious object can directly lead to arbitrary code execution on the worker process and potentially the application server.
