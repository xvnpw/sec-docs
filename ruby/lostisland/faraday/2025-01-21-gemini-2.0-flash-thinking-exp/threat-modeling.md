# Threat Model Analysis for lostisland/faraday

## Threat: [HTTP Header Injection](./threats/http_header_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious HTTP headers by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application constructs headers using Faraday. This might involve injecting newline characters or other control characters into header values, allowing the attacker to add arbitrary headers to the request. This can lead to various attacks, such as HTTP Response Splitting (if the injected headers influence the response), cache poisoning, or session hijacking.

**Impact:**  Compromising the security of the application or its users by manipulating HTTP communication. This could lead to redirection to malicious sites, execution of arbitrary scripts in the user's browser, or unauthorized access to user sessions.

**Faraday Component Affected:** `Faraday::Request::Headers`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never directly use user-provided data to set HTTP headers without strict validation and sanitization.
*   Use Faraday's built-in methods for setting standard headers instead of manually constructing header strings.
*   Implement a whitelist approach for allowed headers if dynamic header setting is necessary.
*   Ensure that the underlying HTTP adapter used by Faraday properly handles header encoding and prevents injection.

## Threat: [Request Body Manipulation via Unsanitized Input](./threats/request_body_manipulation_via_unsanitized_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the request body by injecting malicious content if the application doesn't properly sanitize data before including it in the request body sent via Faraday. This is particularly relevant when sending data in structured formats like JSON or XML. The attacker aims to inject malicious payloads that could be interpreted as commands or data by the target server.

**Impact:**  Data manipulation on the target server, potentially leading to code execution, data breaches, or other vulnerabilities on the remote system. The severity depends on how the target server processes the request body.

**Faraday Component Affected:** `Faraday::Request::Body`, `Faraday::Request::Json`, `Faraday::Request::Multipart` (depending on the request type and middleware used).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always sanitize and validate data before including it in the request body.
*   Use secure serialization libraries and ensure they are configured correctly to prevent injection attacks.
*   Avoid directly concatenating user input into the request body string.
*   Implement server-side validation to verify the integrity and format of the request body.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Settings of Faraday Adapters](./threats/insecure_default_settings_of_faraday_adapters.md)

**Description:** The underlying HTTP adapter used by Faraday (e.g., `Net::HTTP`, `HTTPClient`) might have insecure default settings. For example, SSL certificate verification might be disabled by default in some adapters, or overly permissive timeout values might be set. An attacker could exploit these insecure defaults to perform man-in-the-middle attacks or cause denial of service.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS (if SSL verification is disabled), or vulnerability to denial-of-service attacks due to long timeouts.

**Faraday Component Affected:** `Faraday::Connection` (specifically the adapter configuration).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Explicitly configure Faraday to use secure settings for the chosen adapter, such as enabling SSL certificate verification (`ssl: { verify: true }`) and setting appropriate timeouts (`request: { timeout: ..., open_timeout: ... }`).
*   Regularly review the security recommendations for the specific adapter being used.
*   Consider using Faraday's built-in options for managing SSL certificates and verifying hostnames.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of SSL/TLS Settings in Faraday](./threats/misconfiguration_of_ssltls_settings_in_faraday.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configuring Faraday's SSL/TLS settings can weaken the security of HTTPS connections. This includes disabling certificate verification, using weak ciphers, or not enforcing TLS versions. An attacker could exploit these misconfigurations to perform man-in-the-middle attacks and intercept sensitive data.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS, such as authentication credentials or personal information.

**Faraday Component Affected:** `Faraday::Connection` (specifically the `ssl` option).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure SSL certificate verification is enabled and configured correctly (`ssl: { verify: true }`).
*   Use strong and up-to-date TLS protocols and ciphers.
*   Consider using Faraday's built-in options for managing SSL certificates and verifying hostnames.
*   Avoid disabling SSL verification in production environments.
