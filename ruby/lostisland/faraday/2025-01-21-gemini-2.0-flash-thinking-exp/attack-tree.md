## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Manipulation Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_manipulation_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** Attackers aim to control or inject malicious data into the HTTP requests made by the application using Faraday. This can target various parts of the request, such as headers and the URL.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Headers (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_headers__high-risk_path_.md)

**Mechanism:** The application allows attacker-controlled data to be used in request headers via Faraday without proper sanitization or validation.
**Impact:** Bypassing authentication mechanisms, session hijacking by injecting session IDs, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via response headers, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) by manipulating `Host` or other relevant headers.
**Mitigation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any data used in request headers. Utilize Faraday's built-in header manipulation features securely, avoiding direct string concatenation of user input. Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Request URL (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_request_url__high-risk_path_.md)

**Mechanism:** The application allows attacker-controlled data to influence the request URL constructed by Faraday. This can involve manipulating path parameters, query parameters, or even the base URL.
**Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) allowing access to internal network resources or external services, potentially leading to data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers or further exploitation of internal systems.
**Mitigation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all components of the URL before using them in Faraday requests. Implement whitelisting for allowed target domains and paths. Avoid directly concatenating user input into URLs. Use URL parsing libraries to construct URLs safely.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if applicable) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_applicable___critical_node_.md)

**Description:** If the application uses Faraday to receive and deserialize data (e.g., JSON, XML, or other formats), a malicious server can send a crafted response containing a payload that, when deserialized, leads to arbitrary code execution on the application server.
**Mechanism:** Faraday receives a serialized response from an untrusted source. The application then deserializes this data without proper validation, allowing the attacker's malicious payload to be executed.
**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the application server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and service disruption.
**Mitigation:** Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources whenever possible. If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization methods and libraries. Implement strict validation of the structure and content of deserialized objects before using them. Consider using alternative data exchange formats that are less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses in Faraday (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses_in_faraday__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** Insecure configuration of the Faraday library can introduce vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. This includes using insecure default settings or inadvertently exposing sensitive configuration information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Default Settings (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_default_settings__high-risk_path_.md)

**Mechanism:** Faraday's default settings might be insecure, such as having overly permissive TLS configurations, insecure proxy configurations, or disabled security features.
**Impact:** Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks due to weak TLS settings, exposure of sensitive data if traffic is routed through insecure proxies.
**Mitigation:** Review and configure Faraday's settings according to security best practices. Enforce strong TLS configurations (e.g., minimum TLS version, strong cipher suites). Securely configure proxy settings and validate proxy servers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposure of Faraday Configuration (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exposure_of_faraday_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

**Mechanism:** The application inadvertently exposes Faraday's configuration details, such as API keys, credentials, or sensitive URLs, in logs, error messages, or configuration files accessible to attackers.
**Impact:** Compromise of external services that Faraday interacts with, unauthorized access to resources protected by the exposed credentials.
**Mitigation:** Securely manage and store sensitive configuration data using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions. Avoid logging sensitive information. Implement proper access controls for configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Faraday (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_faraday__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** Faraday relies on underlying HTTP libraries and potentially other adapters or middleware. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited through Faraday.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying HTTP Libraries (e.g., Net::HTTP, HTTPClient) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_http_libraries__e_g___nethttp__httpclient___high-risk_path_.md)

**Mechanism:** Faraday uses underlying HTTP libraries to perform network requests. These libraries might have known vulnerabilities, such as request smuggling, header injection vulnerabilities, or vulnerabilities in handling specific HTTP features.
**Impact:** Various attacks depending on the specific vulnerability in the underlying library, including request smuggling leading to unauthorized access or data manipulation, header injection enabling further attacks.
**Mitigation:** Keep Faraday and all its dependencies, including the underlying HTTP libraries, updated to the latest versions. Regularly monitor security advisories for these dependencies and promptly apply patches. Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
