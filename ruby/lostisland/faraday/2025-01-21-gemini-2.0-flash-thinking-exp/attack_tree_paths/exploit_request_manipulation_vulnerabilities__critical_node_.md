### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Request Manipulation Vulnerabilities

This section delves into the specifics of how an attacker could exploit request manipulation vulnerabilities in an application using Faraday.

**4.1. URL Manipulation:**

* **Description:** Attackers can manipulate the URL used in the Faraday request, potentially leading to unintended access, data retrieval, or execution of actions on different resources.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Path Injection:**  Injecting malicious characters or paths into the URL path segment. This could lead to accessing unauthorized resources on the target server or even traversing the file system if the backend application is vulnerable.
        * **Example:**  If the application constructs a URL like `conn.get("/users/#{user_id}")` and `user_id` is directly taken from user input without validation, an attacker could provide `../admin` to potentially access admin resources.
    * **Query Parameter Injection:**  Injecting or modifying query parameters to alter the behavior of the backend application. This could lead to data filtering bypasses, privilege escalation, or execution of unintended functions.
        * **Example:**  If the application uses `conn.get("/search?q=#{search_term}")` and `search_term` is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject SQL injection payloads or other malicious code.
    * **Fragment Manipulation:** While less common for direct server-side impact, manipulating the URL fragment could potentially affect client-side JavaScript behavior if the target URL is later used in a web context.
* **Impact:**
    * **Unauthorized Access:** Accessing resources or functionalities that the attacker should not have access to.
    * **Data Breach:** Retrieving sensitive data by manipulating query parameters or paths.
    * **Remote Code Execution (Indirect):** In some cases, manipulating the URL could trigger vulnerabilities in the backend application leading to remote code execution.
* **Faraday's Role:** Faraday provides methods for constructing URLs, including setting the path and query parameters. The vulnerability lies in how the application *uses* these methods and whether it properly sanitizes and validates user-provided data before incorporating it into the URL.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided data before using it to construct URLs. Use allow-lists for expected values and escape or reject invalid characters.
    * **Parameterized Queries/Routes:**  If the backend supports it, use parameterized queries or routes to avoid direct string concatenation of user input into the URL.
    * **URL Encoding:** Ensure proper URL encoding of special characters to prevent misinterpretation by the server.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure the application only has the necessary permissions to access the required resources.

**4.2. Header Manipulation:**

* **Description:** Attackers can manipulate HTTP headers to influence the server's behavior, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Adding Malicious Headers:** Injecting headers that can exploit vulnerabilities in the server or intermediary proxies.
        * **Example:** Injecting `X-Forwarded-For` with a spoofed IP address to bypass IP-based access controls.
        * **Example:** Injecting `Host` header to potentially target a different virtual host or bypass security checks.
    * **Modifying Existing Headers:** Altering the values of existing headers to achieve malicious goals.
        * **Example:** Modifying the `Content-Type` header to bypass content validation on the server.
        * **Example:** Modifying the `User-Agent` header to impersonate a different client or bypass rate limiting.
    * **Removing Critical Headers:** Removing headers that are essential for security or proper functionality.
        * **Example:** Removing security headers like `Content-Security-Policy` if the application allows direct control over headers.
* **Impact:**
    * **Bypassing Security Controls:** Circumventing authentication, authorization, or other security mechanisms.
    * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Manipulating headers like `Host` or custom headers to make the server send requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.
    * **Cache Poisoning:** Manipulating headers that influence caching behavior to serve malicious content to other users.
* **Faraday's Role:** Faraday allows setting custom headers using the `headers` option in request methods or through middleware. The vulnerability arises when the application allows untrusted input to directly control these header values.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Restrict Header Control:**  Limit the application's ability to set or modify sensitive headers based on user input.
    * **Header Allow-listing:**  Only allow setting a predefined set of safe headers.
    * **Sanitize Header Values:**  If dynamic header values are necessary, sanitize them to prevent injection of malicious characters.
    * **Use Faraday Middleware for Header Management:** Implement middleware to enforce specific header policies and prevent unauthorized modifications.

**4.3. HTTP Method Manipulation:**

* **Description:** While less common in typical application usage with Faraday, attackers might attempt to manipulate the HTTP method used for a request.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Method Spoofing:**  Changing the intended HTTP method (e.g., from `GET` to `POST` or `DELETE`) to trigger different server-side actions. This is more relevant if the backend application relies solely on the HTTP method for authorization.
    * **Using Unexpected Methods:**  Employing less common HTTP methods (e.g., `PUT`, `PATCH`, `OPTIONS`) that might not be properly handled or secured by the backend.
* **Impact:**
    * **Data Modification or Deletion:**  Using methods like `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE` on resources where only `GET` was intended.
    * **Bypassing Security Checks:**  Exploiting inconsistencies in how different HTTP methods are handled by the backend.
* **Faraday's Role:** Faraday explicitly defines methods for each common HTTP verb (`get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, etc.). Direct manipulation of the method is less likely unless the application is dynamically constructing requests based on user input.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict Method Handling on the Backend:**  The backend application should strictly enforce which HTTP methods are allowed for each resource and action.
    * **Avoid Dynamic Method Selection:**  Minimize scenarios where the application dynamically chooses the HTTP method based on user input.
    * **Use Faraday's Specific Method Calls:**  Encourage the use of Faraday's dedicated methods (`get`, `post`, etc.) instead of constructing requests with arbitrary methods.

**4.4. Request Body Manipulation:**

* **Description:** Attackers can manipulate the data sent in the request body, potentially leading to data injection, command injection, or other vulnerabilities.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Data Injection:** Injecting malicious data into the request body, especially if the backend application doesn't properly validate or sanitize it.
        * **Example:** Injecting SQL injection payloads into JSON or XML data sent in the request body.
        * **Example:** Injecting cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads into form data.
    * **Parameter Tampering:** Modifying the values of existing parameters in the request body to alter the application's behavior.
    * **Format Manipulation:** Changing the format of the request body (e.g., from JSON to XML) to exploit parsing vulnerabilities on the server.
* **Impact:**
    * **Data Corruption:** Modifying or deleting data on the backend.
    * **Remote Code Execution:**  In some cases, injecting malicious data into the request body can lead to command injection vulnerabilities on the server.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts that are later rendered by the client.
* **Faraday's Role:** Faraday handles the serialization of request bodies based on the `Content-Type` header and the provided data. The vulnerability lies in how the application constructs the request body and whether it includes untrusted data without proper encoding or sanitization.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data before including it in the request body.
    * **Output Encoding:**  Properly encode data when rendering it on the client-side to prevent XSS.
    * **Content-Type Enforcement:**  Ensure the `Content-Type` header accurately reflects the format of the request body and that the backend application expects and handles that format correctly.
    * **Use Secure Serialization Libraries:**  Utilize libraries that are designed to prevent common serialization vulnerabilities.
