## Deep Analysis of HTTP Header Injection Threat

**Introduction:**

The HTTP Header Injection vulnerability poses a significant risk to applications that dynamically construct HTTP headers, especially when user-provided data is involved. By injecting malicious characters, attackers can manipulate the structure and content of HTTP requests or responses, leading to various security breaches. In the context of an application using the Faraday gem, understanding how Faraday handles headers and where vulnerabilities might arise is crucial.

**Vulnerability Mechanics:**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the ability to insert control characters, primarily carriage return (`\r`) and line feed (`\n`), into HTTP header values. These characters are used to delimit headers in HTTP messages. By injecting `\r\n`, an attacker can effectively terminate the current header and introduce new, attacker-controlled headers.

**How it Relates to Faraday:**

Faraday provides a convenient way to build and send HTTP requests. The `Faraday::Request::Headers` object is used to manage the headers of a request. If an application directly uses user-provided data to set header values without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example Scenario:**

Consider the following simplified (and vulnerable) code snippet:

```ruby
require 'faraday'

user_agent = params[:user_agent] # User input from a web request

conn = Faraday.new(url: 'https://example.com') do |faraday|
  faraday.adapter Faraday.default_adapter
end

response = conn.get do |req|
  req.headers['User-Agent'] = user_agent
end
```

If an attacker provides the following input for `params[:user_agent]`:

```
MyBrowser\r\nX-Malicious-Header: Injected Value
```

The resulting HTTP request headers would look like this:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: MyBrowser
X-Malicious-Header: Injected Value
```

This demonstrates how the injected `\r\n` sequence allows the attacker to add an arbitrary header (`X-Malicious-Header`).

**Attack Vectors in Detail:**

*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** This is a critical consequence where the attacker injects headers that manipulate the HTTP response. By injecting headers like `Content-Type` and `Content-Length`, the attacker can effectively inject arbitrary content into the response body. This can be used for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by injecting malicious JavaScript that will be executed in the user's browser.

    *   **Faraday's Role:** If the injected headers influence how the *server* constructs its response, Faraday, as the client, will receive and potentially process this manipulated response. While Faraday itself doesn't directly cause response splitting, it's the vehicle through which the manipulated response is received.

*   **Cache Poisoning:** Attackers can inject headers that influence how intermediary caches (like CDNs or proxy servers) store the response. By injecting headers like `Cache-Control`, they can force the cache to store a malicious response, which will then be served to other users.

    *   **Faraday's Role:** Faraday sends the request with the injected headers. If these headers manipulate the caching behavior of intermediary servers, subsequent requests made by Faraday or other clients might receive the poisoned response.

*   **Session Hijacking:** Injecting the `Set-Cookie` header allows the attacker to set arbitrary cookies in the user's browser. This can be used to steal or manipulate user sessions, granting unauthorized access to their accounts.

    *   **Faraday's Role:** If the application uses Faraday to make requests that might be influenced by attacker-controlled data used in header construction, the injected `Set-Cookie` header in the *response* (resulting from the manipulated request) can compromise user sessions.

**Impact Assessment:**

The impact of a successful HTTP Header Injection attack can be severe:

*   **Confidentiality:**  Exposure of sensitive information through manipulated responses or unauthorized access due to session hijacking.
*   **Integrity:**  Modification of data or application behavior through injected content or manipulated caching.
*   **Availability:**  Denial of service through cache poisoning, where legitimate users receive incorrect or malicious content.
*   **Reputation Damage:**  Loss of user trust and damage to the application's reputation due to security breaches.

**Faraday Component Affected: `Faraday::Request::Headers`**

The `Faraday::Request::Headers` component is the direct point of interaction for setting and managing HTTP headers within a Faraday request. Vulnerabilities arise when data used to populate these headers is not properly sanitized or validated before being passed to this component.

**Reinforcement and Expansion of Mitigation Strategies:**

The provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point. Let's expand on them:

*   **Never directly use user-provided data to set HTTP headers without strict validation and sanitization:**
    *   **Actionable Recommendation:** Implement robust input validation on all user-provided data that could potentially influence HTTP headers. This includes explicitly checking for and removing control characters like `\r` and `\n`. Use regular expressions or built-in sanitization functions provided by the application's framework.
    *   **Example:**  Instead of directly assigning `params[:user_agent]`, sanitize it:
        ```ruby
        user_agent = params[:user_agent].gsub(/[\r\n]/, '')
        ```

*   **Use Faraday's built-in methods for setting standard headers instead of manually constructing header strings:**
    *   **Actionable Recommendation:** Leverage Faraday's API for setting common headers. This often involves using methods like `req.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'` instead of string concatenation. Faraday's internal handling of these methods is generally safer.
    *   **Example:**  For setting the `Content-Type`, use:
        ```ruby
        req.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
        ```
        Avoid:
        ```ruby
        req.headers['Content-Type: application/json'] # Vulnerable to injection
        ```

*   **Implement a whitelist approach for allowed headers if dynamic header setting is necessary:**
    *   **Actionable Recommendation:** If the application requires setting headers dynamically based on user input, define a strict whitelist of allowed header names and values. Only allow headers that are explicitly permitted.
    *   **Example:**
        ```ruby
        allowed_headers = { 'X-Custom-ID' => /^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$/ } # Example whitelist

        user_provided_header_name = params[:header_name]
        user_provided_header_value = params[:header_value]

        if allowed_headers.key?(user_provided_header_name) && user_provided_header_value.match?(allowed_headers[user_provided_header_name])
          req.headers[user_provided_header_name] = user_provided_header_value
        else
          # Log the attempt and reject the header
          Rails.logger.warn "Attempted header injection: #{user_provided_header_name}: #{user_provided_header_value}"
        end
        ```

*   **Ensure that the underlying HTTP adapter used by Faraday properly handles header encoding and prevents injection:**
    *   **Actionable Recommendation:** While the application code is the primary point of defense, understanding the capabilities of the underlying adapter (e.g., `Net::HTTP`, `Typhoeus`) is important. Review the adapter's documentation to understand how it handles header encoding and if it provides any built-in protection against header injection. Consider testing with different adapters to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Testing:**  Experiment with injecting control characters when using different Faraday adapters to observe their behavior.

**Additional Recommendations:**

*   **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on areas where user input interacts with HTTP header construction.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid granting unnecessary permissions to modify HTTP headers. If a specific functionality doesn't require dynamic header setting, avoid implementing it.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct mitigation for header injection, implementing a strong CSP can help mitigate the impact of successful HTTP Response Splitting attacks by limiting the sources from which the browser can load resources.
*   **Framework-Level Protections:**  Utilize security features provided by the application's web framework (e.g., Rails, Django) that might offer some level of protection against header injection.

**Conclusion:**

The HTTP Header Injection threat is a serious vulnerability that can have significant consequences for applications using Faraday. By understanding the mechanics of the attack, the role of the `Faraday::Request::Headers` component, and implementing robust mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation. A defense-in-depth approach, combining input validation, secure coding practices, and awareness of the underlying HTTP adapter, is crucial for protecting the application and its users from this critical threat. Continuous vigilance and regular security assessments are essential to maintain a secure application.
