# Attack Surface Analysis for lostisland/faraday

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can induce the application to make HTTP requests to arbitrary destinations, potentially internal resources or external services.
*   **How Faraday Contributes:** Faraday is the mechanism through which the application makes these outbound HTTP requests. If the target URL for Faraday is constructed based on user-controlled input without proper validation, an attacker can manipulate it.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further exploitation of internal services, denial of service against internal or external targets.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/http_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers into requests made by the application.
*   **How Faraday Contributes:** If the application allows user input to directly influence the headers sent by Faraday (e.g., through a configuration option or by directly manipulating the `headers` attribute), an attacker can inject malicious headers.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cache poisoning, bypassing security controls on the target server, cross-site scripting (if the target server reflects the injected header).
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** The application's Faraday configuration allows for insecure TLS/SSL connections, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **How Faraday Contributes:** Faraday provides options to configure TLS settings, including disabling certificate verification or using insecure protocols. If these options are used inappropriately, the application's communication can be compromised.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS, potential for data manipulation, and impersonation of the application or the target server.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
