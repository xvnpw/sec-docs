## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Dependency Audits and Updates for Faraday and Adapters](./mitigation_strategies/regular_dependency_audits_and_updates_for_faraday_and_adapters.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Automated Dependency Scanning for Faraday:** Integrate tools like `bundler-audit` (for Ruby) or equivalent into your project's CI/CD pipeline specifically targeting Faraday and its adapter dependencies.
    2.  **Focus on Faraday and Adapter Updates:** Prioritize updates for Faraday and its adapters when vulnerabilities are reported.
    3.  **Test Faraday Integrations After Updates:** After updating Faraday or adapters, run integration tests that specifically exercise Faraday client code to ensure compatibility and no regressions.
    4.  **Pin Faraday and Adapter Versions:** Explicitly define Faraday and adapter versions in your dependency manifest (e.g., `Gemfile`) to control updates and prevent unexpected changes.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerable Faraday Library (High Severity):** Exploits directly within Faraday code.
        *   **Vulnerable Faraday Adapters (High Severity):** Exploits in libraries used by Faraday adapters (e.g., `net-http`, `patron`).
        *   **Dependency Confusion/Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Malicious versions of Faraday or adapters being introduced if not carefully managed.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Vulnerable Faraday Library:** High risk reduction. Directly addresses vulnerabilities in the core library.
        *   **Vulnerable Faraday Adapters:** High risk reduction. Addresses vulnerabilities in the underlying HTTP clients Faraday uses.
        *   **Dependency Confusion/Supply Chain Attacks:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the risk of using compromised dependency versions.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We use `bundler-audit` in CI, but it's a general scan, not specifically focused on Faraday.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Configure `bundler-audit` or similar tools to specifically highlight Faraday and adapter vulnerabilities.  Implement automated alerts for Faraday/adapter vulnerabilities.  Improve integration test coverage for Faraday client code after dependency updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Middleware Vetting and Minimization in Faraday Connections](./mitigation_strategies/strict_middleware_vetting_and_minimization_in_faraday_connections.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Security Review of Faraday Middleware:**  Conduct mandatory security code reviews for all custom Faraday middleware and carefully vet third-party middleware before integration.
    2.  **Minimize Faraday Middleware Usage:**  Only include middleware in Faraday connections that are strictly necessary for the intended functionality. Remove any unnecessary middleware to reduce attack surface.
    3.  **Document Faraday Middleware Security Implications:**  For each middleware used in Faraday, document its purpose, configuration, and any potential security implications or risks within the context of Faraday requests.
    4.  **Regularly Audit Faraday Middleware Stack:** Periodically review the middleware stack in Faraday connections and remove or update any outdated or insecure middleware.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious Faraday Middleware (High Severity):**  Compromised middleware within the Faraday request pipeline.
        *   **Vulnerable Faraday Middleware (Medium Severity):**  Exploitable vulnerabilities in middleware used in Faraday.
        *   **Information Leakage via Faraday Middleware (Medium Severity):** Middleware unintentionally logging or exposing sensitive data from Faraday requests/responses.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Malicious Faraday Middleware:** High risk reduction. Prevents introduction of malicious components into the Faraday request flow.
        *   **Vulnerable Faraday Middleware:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the chance of using vulnerable middleware in Faraday.
        *   **Information Leakage via Faraday Middleware:** Medium risk reduction. Helps prevent accidental data leaks through middleware logging or processing.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Custom middleware for Faraday undergoes code review, but third-party Faraday middleware is less rigorously vetted.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Formalize a mandatory security review process specifically for *all* Faraday middleware (custom and third-party). Create a dedicated section in middleware documentation focusing on security within the Faraday context. Implement a yearly security audit of the Faraday middleware stack.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Faraday Adapter Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_faraday_adapter_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Secure Faraday Adapters:** Select Faraday adapters (like `net-http`) known for their security and active maintenance. Avoid adapters with known security issues or lack of updates.
    2.  **Configure TLS/SSL in Faraday Adapters:** Explicitly configure the chosen Faraday adapter to enforce TLS 1.2 or higher for HTTPS connections.  Utilize Faraday's adapter configuration options to set strong cipher suites if possible (adapter dependent).
    3.  **Enable Certificate Verification in Faraday Adapters:** Ensure SSL/TLS certificate verification is enabled and correctly configured within the Faraday adapter settings to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
    4.  **Review Faraday Adapter Security Options:** Regularly review the security-related configuration options available for the chosen Faraday adapter and apply best practices.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks via Faraday (High Severity):**  Exploiting weak TLS/SSL configurations in Faraday adapters.
        *   **Server Impersonation via Faraday (Medium Severity):**  Bypassing certificate verification in Faraday adapter settings.
        *   **Adapter-Specific Vulnerabilities in Faraday (Medium Severity):** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the chosen Faraday adapter.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks via Faraday:** High risk reduction. Enforcing strong TLS/SSL in Faraday is crucial for secure communication.
        *   **Server Impersonation via Faraday:** High risk reduction. Certificate verification in Faraday ensures connection to legitimate servers.
        *   **Adapter-Specific Vulnerabilities in Faraday:** Medium risk reduction. Choosing secure adapters and staying updated mitigates adapter-level risks.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We use `net-http` adapter. Certificate verification is enabled by default in `net-http`. TLS version enforcement within Faraday adapter configuration is not explicitly set.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Explicitly configure Faraday's `net-http` adapter (or chosen adapter) to enforce TLS 1.2+ and strong cipher suites if configurable through Faraday. Document the specific Faraday adapter security configurations. Regularly review adapter security options in Faraday documentation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Request and Response Handling within Faraday](./mitigation_strategies/secure_request_and_response_handling_within_faraday.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Error Handling for Faraday Requests:** Implement robust `begin...rescue` blocks around Faraday requests to catch exceptions. Log errors appropriately but avoid logging sensitive request/response data directly through Faraday's logging mechanisms.
    2.  **Implement Faraday Request Timeouts:** Configure connection and request timeouts within Faraday connection settings to prevent indefinite hangs and resource exhaustion when interacting with slow or unresponsive APIs via Faraday.
    3.  **Control Redirects in Faraday:**  Configure Faraday's redirect following behavior. Limit the number of redirects Faraday will automatically follow. For sensitive operations, consider disabling automatic redirects in Faraday and handling them explicitly based on validation of the redirect location within your application logic.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure via Faraday Logging (Medium Severity):**  Accidental logging of sensitive data by Faraday's default or configured logging.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Faraday (Medium Severity):**  Resource exhaustion due to Faraday requests hanging indefinitely on slow APIs.
        *   **Redirect-Based Attacks via Faraday (Medium Severity):**  Uncontrolled redirects followed by Faraday potentially leading to phishing or security bypasses.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure via Faraday Logging:** Medium risk reduction. Prevents accidental leakage through Faraday's logging.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Faraday:** Medium risk reduction. Timeouts in Faraday improve resilience against slow APIs.
        *   **Redirect-Based Attacks via Faraday:** Medium risk reduction. Controlling redirects in Faraday mitigates redirect-related risks.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic error handling around Faraday requests exists. Request timeouts are generally configured in Faraday connections. Redirect behavior is at Faraday's default settings (following redirects).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Review and refine error handling around Faraday requests to ensure no sensitive data is logged by Faraday or in application error logs related to Faraday requests.  Document Faraday timeout configurations.  Review and configure Faraday's redirect settings, potentially limiting redirects or disabling automatic redirects for sensitive contexts and implementing explicit handling.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Credential Management for Faraday Connections](./mitigation_strategies/secure_credential_management_for_faraday_connections.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Securely Inject Credentials into Faraday Requests:**  When using Faraday to interact with authenticated APIs, ensure API keys or credentials are securely injected into Faraday requests (e.g., using headers, query parameters, or request bodies) without hardcoding them in the application. Utilize environment variables or secrets management systems to retrieve credentials.
    2.  **Use HTTPS for Faraday Connections with Credentials:**  Always use HTTPS for Faraday connections that transmit credentials or sensitive data to ensure confidentiality and integrity during transmission.
    3.  **Configure Faraday for Authentication Middleware (if applicable):** If using authentication middleware with Faraday (e.g., for OAuth), ensure it is correctly configured and securely handles token storage and refresh within the Faraday request lifecycle.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Credential Exposure in Faraday Requests (High Severity):**  Accidentally exposing API keys or credentials in Faraday request configurations or logs.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Faraday Credential Transmission (High Severity):**  Intercepting credentials transmitted over insecure (non-HTTPS) Faraday connections.
        *   **Unauthorized Access via Compromised Faraday Credentials (High Severity):**  Attackers gaining access to APIs using leaked or compromised credentials used in Faraday requests.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Credential Exposure in Faraday Requests:** High risk reduction. Secure credential injection prevents accidental leaks.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Faraday Credential Transmission:** High risk reduction. HTTPS for Faraday connections protects credential transmission.
        *   **Unauthorized Access via Compromised Faraday Credentials:** High risk reduction. Secure credential management in Faraday reduces the risk of unauthorized API access.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. API keys are generally retrieved from environment variables and used in Faraday requests. HTTPS is used for sensitive API interactions.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Formalize and document the process for securely injecting credentials into Faraday requests.  Ensure consistent use of HTTPS for all Faraday connections involving credentials.  If using authentication middleware with Faraday, thoroughly review its configuration and security aspects.  Conduct developer training on secure credential handling within Faraday.
