# Threat Model Analysis for lostisland/faraday

## Threat: [Threat: Request Spoofing via Custom Middleware](./threats/threat_request_spoofing_via_custom_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in the application's *custom* Faraday middleware allows an attacker to manipulate the outgoing HTTP request.  This is *not* about a third-party library, but code the application developers wrote. The attacker might inject headers, modify the request body, or change the URL to impersonate a legitimate user or system, bypassing authentication or authorization checks on the *external* service Faraday is connecting to.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the external service, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or execution of unauthorized actions on the *external* service.  The attacker gains privileges they shouldn't have on the *target* of the Faraday request.
*   **Faraday Component Affected:** Custom Faraday Middleware (specifically, the `call` method and how it manipulates the `env[:request]` object).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Within the middleware, rigorously validate *any* data that influences the request (headers, body, URL parameters).  Use whitelists, not blacklists.
    *   **Secure Header Handling:**  Be extremely cautious when modifying or adding HTTP headers, especially security-related headers like `Authorization`, `Cookie`, or custom headers.
    *   **Code Review & SAST:**  Mandatory code reviews focusing on the middleware's security.  Use Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools to automatically scan for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** The middleware should *only* have the absolute minimum permissions needed to modify the request.

## Threat: [Threat: Request Tampering via Third-Party Middleware](./threats/threat_request_tampering_via_third-party_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses a *vulnerable or malicious third-party* Faraday middleware.  This is a supply chain risk.  The attacker exploits a known vulnerability in the middleware, or the middleware itself is intentionally designed to tamper with requests.  The middleware modifies the outgoing HTTP request (headers, body, URL) to the attacker's advantage.
*   **Impact:**  Data corruption on the external service, unauthorized actions performed on the external service, bypassing security controls of the external service.  The attacker can potentially inject malicious data into the request.
*   **Faraday Component Affected:** Third-party Faraday Middleware (the `call` method is the critical point).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Vetting and Selection:**  *Only* use well-known, actively maintained, and reputable Faraday middleware from trusted sources.  Avoid obscure or unmaintained libraries.
    *   **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use tools like Bundler Audit or Snyk to *automatically* and *continuously* scan for known vulnerabilities in all dependencies, including Faraday middleware.
    *   **Immediate Patching:**  Apply security updates to middleware *immediately* upon release.  Automate this process if possible.
    *   **Least Privilege (Middleware Choice):** Choose middleware that does the *minimum* necessary.  Avoid overly complex middleware with unnecessary features.

## Threat: [Threat: Response Tampering via Custom Middleware](./threats/threat_response_tampering_via_custom_middleware.md)

*    **Description:** A vulnerability in *custom* Faraday middleware allows modification of the *response* received from the external service *before* the main application logic processes it. The attacker might alter the response body, headers, or status code. This is distinct from general response handling vulnerabilities; it's specifically about malicious actions *within* the Faraday middleware.
*    **Impact:** The application receives and processes manipulated data, potentially leading to incorrect behavior. While XSS and RCE are possible, they are primarily application-level vulnerabilities *resulting from* the tampered response, not direct Faraday threats. The core impact here is that Faraday delivers incorrect data to the application.
*    **Faraday Component Affected:** Custom Faraday Middleware. The `call` method and specifically the handling of the `env[:response]` object within the middleware.
*    **Risk Severity:** High
*    **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *    **Code Review:** Thoroughly review the middleware code, paying close attention to how the response is processed and modified. Focus on any modifications to `env[:response]`.
    *    **Response Validation (Within Middleware):** While the application should also validate responses, the middleware should perform *initial* checks to ensure the response hasn't been tampered with in unexpected ways *before* passing it on. This might involve checking for expected headers or basic data structure integrity.
    *    **Minimize Modifications:** The middleware should modify the response as *little as possible*.  Avoid unnecessary transformations or manipulations.
    *    **SAST Tools:** Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the middleware's response handling.

## Threat: [Threat: Unintentional Proxy Exposure](./threats/threat_unintentional_proxy_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Faraday is configured to use a proxy server, and this configuration is either incorrect, insecure, or inadvertently exposed.  This could be due to misconfigured environment variables (`http_proxy`, `https_proxy`), hardcoded proxy settings, or a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject proxy settings. The attacker can then intercept and potentially modify the traffic between the application and the external service.
*   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attack, allowing the attacker to eavesdrop on sensitive data (API keys, credentials, request/response data) and potentially modify the traffic.
*   **Faraday Component Affected:** `Faraday::Connection` options related to proxy configuration (specifically the `proxy` option and how it's set, including via environment variables).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Configuration Management:**  *Never* hardcode proxy settings, especially credentials.  Use a secure configuration management system (e.g., environment variables managed securely, a secrets management service).
    *   **Environment Variable Protection:**  If using environment variables, ensure they are set securely and are not accessible to unauthorized users or processes.
    *   **Proxy Authentication:**  If the proxy requires authentication, use strong, unique credentials and store them securely.
    *   **Code Review:**  Review any code that configures Faraday's proxy settings to ensure they are not exposed or vulnerable to injection.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** If possible, place the application and proxy server in a separate, protected network segment.
