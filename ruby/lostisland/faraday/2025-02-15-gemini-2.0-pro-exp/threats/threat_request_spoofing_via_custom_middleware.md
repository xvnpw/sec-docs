# Deep Analysis: Request Spoofing via Custom Faraday Middleware

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the "Request Spoofing via Custom Middleware" threat, identify specific vulnerabilities within the application's custom Faraday middleware, and propose concrete, actionable remediation steps to mitigate the risk.  We aim to provide the development team with a clear understanding of *how* an attacker could exploit this vulnerability and *what* specific code changes are necessary.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on custom Faraday middleware implemented within the application.  It does *not* cover vulnerabilities in third-party Faraday middleware or the Faraday library itself.  The scope includes:

*   All custom Faraday middleware classes and modules.
*   The `call` method within each middleware.
*   Any helper methods or functions used by the middleware to modify the request.
*   The `env[:request]` object and how it's manipulated.
*   Interaction with external services that are the targets of Faraday requests.
*   Any configuration or environment variables that influence the middleware's behavior.

We explicitly *exclude* the following:

*   Faraday's built-in middleware.
*   Other parts of the application that are not directly related to making outbound HTTP requests via Faraday.
*   Vulnerabilities in the external services themselves (though we consider how our middleware might enable exploitation of those services).

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  A manual, line-by-line examination of the custom middleware code, focusing on:
    *   Data flow: How data enters the middleware, how it's processed, and how it affects the outgoing request.
    *   Input validation:  Where and how input is validated (or not validated).
    *   Header manipulation:  How headers are added, modified, or removed.
    *   URL and body modification:  How the request URL and body are constructed and potentially altered.
    *   Error handling:  How errors are handled and whether they could leak information or create exploitable conditions.
    *   Adherence to secure coding principles (e.g., least privilege, defense in depth).

2.  **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**  We will utilize SAST tools (e.g., Brakeman, RuboCop with security-focused rules, Semgrep) to automatically scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities related to request spoofing, injection, and insecure header handling.  The SAST tool configuration will be tailored to specifically target Faraday middleware.

3.  **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) (Conceptual):** While a full DAST scan is outside the immediate scope, we will *conceptually* outline how a DAST tool or penetration tester might attempt to exploit this vulnerability.  This will inform our code review and SAST analysis.

4.  **Threat Modeling Review:** We will revisit the original threat model to ensure that our analysis aligns with the identified threat and its potential impact.

5.  **Documentation Review:** We will review any existing documentation related to the custom middleware, including design documents, comments in the code, and API specifications.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1. Potential Vulnerability Points

Based on the threat description, the following are key areas of concern within the custom Faraday middleware:

*   **`env[:request]` Manipulation:** The `call` method's primary function is to modify the `env[:request]` object.  Any vulnerability here directly translates to a request spoofing risk.  Specific sub-points:
    *   **`env[:request_headers]`:**  Incorrect handling of headers is the most likely vector for attack.  Attackers might:
        *   Inject malicious `Authorization` headers to impersonate other users.
        *   Overwrite `Cookie` headers to hijack sessions.
        *   Add custom headers that trigger unexpected behavior in the external service.
        *   Remove security-related headers that the external service relies on.
    *   **`env[:url]`:**  Modifying the URL could redirect the request to a malicious server or to an unintended endpoint on the legitimate server.
    *   **`env[:body]`:**  If the middleware modifies the request body, an attacker could inject malicious data that the external service processes.  This is particularly dangerous if the external service expects a specific data format (e.g., XML, JSON) and is vulnerable to injection attacks.
    *   **Conditional Logic:**  Any conditional logic within the middleware that determines *how* the request is modified is a potential vulnerability point.  Attackers might try to manipulate the conditions to trigger unintended code paths.
    *   **External Data Sources:** If the middleware uses data from external sources (e.g., databases, environment variables, user input) to construct the request, those sources must be thoroughly validated.

*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  The most common root cause of request spoofing is insufficient or absent input validation.  The middleware must *never* trust any data that influences the request without rigorous validation.

*   **Overly Permissive Middleware:**  The middleware should only modify the request in the *specific* ways that are absolutely necessary.  Any unnecessary modification increases the attack surface.

*   **Hardcoded Secrets:**  If the middleware uses hardcoded secrets (e.g., API keys, tokens) to authenticate with the external service, those secrets could be exposed if the middleware is compromised.

### 2.2. Example Attack Scenarios

Here are some concrete examples of how an attacker might exploit this vulnerability:

*   **Scenario 1: Authorization Header Injection:**
    *   The middleware adds an `Authorization` header based on a user ID retrieved from a session.
    *   The middleware does *not* validate that the user ID is a valid integer.
    *   An attacker provides a crafted user ID (e.g., `1; DROP TABLE users; --`) that is directly inserted into the `Authorization` header.
    *   The external service (if vulnerable to SQL injection) might execute the malicious SQL.

*   **Scenario 2: Cookie Hijacking:**
    *   The middleware forwards the user's cookies to the external service.
    *   The middleware does *not* validate or sanitize the cookie values.
    *   An attacker injects a malicious cookie value (e.g., a stolen session ID) that overwrites the legitimate cookie.
    *   The external service authenticates the attacker as the victim.

*   **Scenario 3: URL Redirection:**
    *   The middleware constructs the request URL based on a parameter provided by the user.
    *   The middleware does *not* validate that the parameter is a valid URL or path.
    *   An attacker provides a malicious URL (e.g., `https://attacker.com/evil.php`) that redirects the request to their server.
    *   The attacker's server can then capture sensitive data or return a malicious response.

*   **Scenario 4: Body Manipulation (JSON Injection):**
    *   The middleware constructs a JSON request body based on user input.
    *   The middleware does *not* properly escape the user input before inserting it into the JSON.
    *   An attacker provides malicious JSON (e.g., `{"id": 1, "admin": true}`) that modifies the request in an unintended way.
    *   The external service might grant the attacker administrative privileges.

### 2.3. Code Review Checklist (Specific to Faraday Middleware)

This checklist should be used during the manual code review:

*   **[ ]** Does the middleware use any external data to modify the request?  If so, is that data *always* validated using a whitelist approach?
*   **[ ]** Does the middleware modify the `env[:request_headers]`?  If so:
    *   **[ ]** Are any security-related headers (`Authorization`, `Cookie`, etc.) modified?
    *   **[ ]** Is there a clear and documented reason for modifying each header?
    *   **[ ]** Is it possible for an attacker to inject or overwrite headers?
    *   **[ ]** Are header values properly encoded and escaped?
*   **[ ]** Does the middleware modify the `env[:url]`?  If so:
    *   **[ ]** Is the URL constructed from a trusted source?
    *   **[ ]** Is it possible for an attacker to redirect the request?
    *   **[ ]** Are URL parameters properly encoded?
*   **[ ]** Does the middleware modify the `env[:body]`?  If so:
    *   **[ ]** Is the body constructed from a trusted source?
    *   **[ ]** Is the body properly encoded and escaped (e.g., using a JSON library)?
    *   **[ ]** Is it possible for an attacker to inject malicious data into the body?
*   **[ ]** Does the middleware use any conditional logic to modify the request?  If so:
    *   **[ ]** Are the conditions based on trusted data?
    *   **[ ]** Is it possible for an attacker to manipulate the conditions?
*   **[ ]** Does the middleware use any hardcoded secrets?  If so, those secrets should be moved to a secure configuration store.
*   **[ ]** Does the middleware log any sensitive information?  If so, the logging should be reviewed and potentially redacted.
*   **[ ]** Does the middleware handle errors gracefully?  Error messages should not reveal sensitive information.
*   **[ ]** Does the middleware adhere to the principle of least privilege?  It should only have the minimum necessary permissions.
*   **[ ]** Is the purpose of the middleware clearly documented?
*   **[ ]** Are there any TODOs or FIXME comments in the code that indicate potential security issues?

### 2.4. SAST Tool Configuration

The following SAST tools and configurations are recommended:

*   **Brakeman:** Run Brakeman with the `-z` flag (check for all vulnerabilities) and specifically look for warnings related to:
    *   `Command Injection`
    *   `Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)` (relevant if the middleware handles HTML)
    *   `Header Injection`
    *   `Redirect`
    *   `SQL Injection` (relevant if the middleware interacts with a database)
    *   `Unsafe Reflection`

*   **RuboCop:** Use RuboCop with a security-focused configuration.  Enable the following cops (and any others related to request security):
    *   `Security/Eval`
    *   `Security/JSONLoad`
    *   `Security/MarshalLoad`
    *   `Security/Open`
    *   `Security/YAMLLoad`
    *   `Security/InsecureArgument`

*   **Semgrep:** Create custom Semgrep rules to specifically target Faraday middleware vulnerabilities.  For example:
    ```yaml
    rules:
      - id: faraday-middleware-header-injection
        patterns:
          - pattern: |
              class $MIDDLEWARE < Faraday::Middleware
                def call(env)
                  env[:request_headers][$HEADER] = $VALUE
                  ...
                end
              end
          - pattern-not: |
              class $MIDDLEWARE < Faraday::Middleware
                def call(env)
                  $VALUE = whitelist_function($VALUE)
                  env[:request_headers][$HEADER] = $VALUE
                  ...
                end
              end
        message: "Potential header injection in Faraday middleware.  Ensure '$VALUE' is properly validated."
        languages: [ruby]
        severity: ERROR
    ```
    (This is a simplified example; more sophisticated rules would be needed to cover all potential vulnerabilities.)

### 2.5. Remediation Steps

Based on the analysis, the following remediation steps are recommended:

1.  **Implement Strict Input Validation:**
    *   Use whitelists for all data that influences the request.  For example, if the middleware adds a header based on a user role, define a whitelist of allowed roles:
        ```ruby
        ALLOWED_ROLES = ['user', 'admin', 'editor'].freeze

        def add_role_header(env, role)
          return unless ALLOWED_ROLES.include?(role)
          env[:request_headers]['X-User-Role'] = role
        end
        ```
    *   Use regular expressions to validate data formats (e.g., URLs, email addresses).
    *   Use type checking to ensure that data is of the expected type (e.g., integer, string).
    *   Never directly insert user-provided data into the request without validation.

2.  **Secure Header Handling:**
    *   Avoid modifying security-related headers unless absolutely necessary.
    *   If you must modify headers, use a dedicated library or helper function to ensure proper encoding and escaping.
    *   Never trust user-provided header values.
    *   Consider using a "header allowlist" to restrict the headers that the middleware can modify.

3.  **Safe URL and Body Construction:**
    *   Use a URL builder library to construct URLs safely.
    *   Use a JSON library (e.g., `JSON.generate`) to construct JSON bodies.
    *   Never concatenate strings to build URLs or bodies.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   Review the middleware's responsibilities and remove any unnecessary functionality.
    *   Ensure that the middleware only has the minimum necessary permissions to modify the request.

5.  **Code Review and SAST:**
    *   Make code reviews and SAST scans mandatory for all changes to the middleware.
    *   Use the checklist provided above during code reviews.
    *   Address all warnings and errors reported by SAST tools.

6.  **Secure Configuration:**
    *   Store any secrets (API keys, tokens) in a secure configuration store (e.g., environment variables, a secrets management service).
    *   Never hardcode secrets in the middleware.

7.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Handle errors gracefully and avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages.
    *   Log errors securely, redacting any sensitive data.

8.  **Documentation:**
    *   Clearly document the purpose of the middleware and how it modifies the request.
    *   Document any assumptions or limitations.

9. **Testing:**
    * Add unit tests that specifically test the security of the middleware. These tests should include:
        *   Valid inputs that should result in expected request modifications.
        *   Invalid inputs that should be rejected or result in safe default behavior.
        *   Edge cases and boundary conditions.
        *   Attempts to inject malicious data.

By implementing these remediation steps, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of request spoofing via custom Faraday middleware and protect the application and its users from unauthorized access and data breaches.

This detailed analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the threat, potential vulnerabilities, and concrete steps to mitigate the risk. It emphasizes the importance of secure coding practices, thorough validation, and the use of security tools to identify and address vulnerabilities in custom Faraday middleware. Remember to adapt the SAST tool configurations and code examples to your specific project and environment.
