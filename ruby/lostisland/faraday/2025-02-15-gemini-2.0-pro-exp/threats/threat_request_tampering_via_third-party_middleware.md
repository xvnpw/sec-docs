# Deep Analysis: Request Tampering via Third-Party Faraday Middleware

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Request Tampering via Third-Party Middleware" threat, identify specific attack vectors, and develop concrete, actionable recommendations for the development team to mitigate this risk effectively.  This goes beyond the high-level threat model description to provide practical guidance.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the risk introduced by third-party Faraday middleware used within the application.  It covers:

*   **Vulnerable Middleware:**  Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in legitimate, but outdated or poorly coded, middleware.
*   **Malicious Middleware:**  The use of intentionally malicious middleware designed to tamper with requests.
*   **Impact on Faraday:** How the `call` method of the middleware is the critical point of attack.
*   **Impact on the Application:**  The consequences of request tampering for the application and its interaction with external services.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Detailed, practical steps to reduce the risk.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities in Faraday itself (these are separate threats).
*   Vulnerabilities in the application's core code *unrelated* to middleware.
*   Threats originating from the external services the application interacts with.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis employs the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Decomposition:** Breaking down the threat into smaller, more manageable components (attack vectors, vulnerable code paths).
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  Analyzing how a vulnerable or malicious middleware might interact with Faraday's request processing.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Examining known vulnerability patterns in HTTP client libraries and middleware.
4.  **Best Practices Review:**  Identifying and recommending industry best practices for secure dependency management and middleware usage.
5.  **Tooling Recommendations:**  Suggesting specific tools and techniques to aid in mitigation.

## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1. Attack Vectors

A malicious or vulnerable Faraday middleware can tamper with requests in several ways:

*   **Header Manipulation:**
    *   **Adding Headers:** Injecting malicious headers (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For` to spoof IP addresses, custom headers to trigger debug modes or bypass authentication on the external service).
    *   **Modifying Headers:** Altering existing headers (e.g., changing the `Authorization` header to use a compromised token, modifying `Content-Type` to cause parsing errors).
    *   **Removing Headers:** Deleting essential headers (e.g., removing security tokens, CSRF tokens).

*   **Body Modification:**
    *   **Data Injection:** Adding malicious payloads to the request body (e.g., injecting SQL code, XSS payloads, or commands if the external service is vulnerable).
    *   **Data Alteration:** Modifying existing data in the request body (e.g., changing parameters in a financial transaction, altering user IDs).
    *   **Data Removal:** Deleting parts of the request body, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors on the external service.

*   **URL Manipulation:**
    *   **Parameter Tampering:** Modifying query parameters in the URL (e.g., changing IDs, amounts, or flags).
    *   **Path Manipulation:**  Altering the request path to access unauthorized resources or trigger unintended actions on the external service.
    *   **Redirection:**  Changing the entire URL to redirect the request to a malicious server controlled by the attacker.

*   **Timing Attacks:** While less direct tampering, a malicious middleware could introduce delays to probe for timing vulnerabilities in the external service.

### 4.2. Faraday's `call` Method and Vulnerability

The core of Faraday middleware lies in its `call` method.  This method receives an `env` object (a Faraday::Env), which contains all the information about the outgoing request.  A vulnerable or malicious middleware can modify this `env` object before passing it along the middleware stack (or before sending the request).

```ruby
# Example of a MALICIOUS middleware
class MaliciousMiddleware < Faraday::Middleware
  def call(env)
    # Modify the request headers
    env.request_headers['Authorization'] = 'Bearer attacker_token'

    # Modify the request body (assuming it's JSON)
    if env.request_headers['Content-Type'] == 'application/json'
      body = JSON.parse(env.body)
      body['malicious_field'] = 'attacker_data'
      env.body = JSON.dump(body)
    end

    # Modify the URL
    env.url.query = 'attacker_param=value'

    @app.call(env) # Pass the modified env to the next middleware/adapter
  end
end
```

This example demonstrates how easily a middleware can alter the request.  The `@app.call(env)` line is crucial; it's how the modified request propagates.  A vulnerable middleware might have similar modifications, but due to unintentional bugs or security flaws.

### 4.3. Impact on the Application

The consequences of successful request tampering can be severe:

*   **Data Corruption:**  The external service receives and processes manipulated data, leading to inconsistent or incorrect data in its systems.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:**  The attacker can perform actions on the external service that they are not authorized to do (e.g., deleting data, transferring funds, accessing private information).
*   **Bypassing Security Controls:**  The attacker can circumvent security measures implemented by the external service (e.g., authentication, authorization, input validation).
*   **Reputational Damage:**  If the application is compromised and used to attack external services, it can damage the reputation of the application's developers and owners.
*   **Legal and Financial Consequences:**  Data breaches and unauthorized actions can lead to legal liability and financial penalties.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The mitigation strategies outlined in the threat model are a good starting point, but we need to expand on them:

*   **4.4.1. Vetting and Selection (Enhanced):**

    *   **Source Code Review:**  If possible, *review the source code* of the middleware before using it.  Look for red flags like:
        *   Poor coding practices (e.g., lack of input validation, insecure handling of sensitive data).
        *   Obfuscated or overly complex code.
        *   Unnecessary network connections or data exfiltration.
        *   Hardcoded credentials or secrets.
    *   **Community Reputation:**  Check the middleware's reputation within the Ruby community.  Look for:
        *   Number of downloads and stars on GitHub.
        *   Active issue tracker with responsive maintainers.
        *   Positive reviews and recommendations from trusted sources.
        *   Absence of reported security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Maintainer Verification:**  Verify the identity and trustworthiness of the middleware's maintainers.  Look for established developers with a good track record.
    *   **License Review:** Ensure the middleware uses a permissive open-source license that allows for modification and redistribution.

*   **4.4.2. Dependency Vulnerability Scanning (Automated):**

    *   **Bundler Audit:** Integrate `bundler-audit` into your CI/CD pipeline.  This tool checks your `Gemfile.lock` against a database of known vulnerabilities.  Configure it to fail the build if any vulnerabilities are found.
        ```bash
        bundle audit check --update
        ```
    *   **Snyk:** Use Snyk (or a similar tool) for more comprehensive vulnerability scanning.  Snyk can scan your entire project, including dependencies, and provide detailed reports and remediation advice.  It also offers integrations with various CI/CD platforms.
    *   **GitHub Dependabot:** Enable Dependabot on your GitHub repository.  It automatically creates pull requests to update vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Regular Scans:**  Schedule regular vulnerability scans, even if you don't have a CI/CD pipeline.  This ensures you catch any new vulnerabilities that are discovered.

*   **4.4.3. Immediate Patching (Automated):**

    *   **Automated Updates:**  Use tools like Dependabot or Renovate to automatically create pull requests for dependency updates.
    *   **CI/CD Integration:**  Integrate dependency updates into your CI/CD pipeline.  Ensure that tests are run automatically after updating dependencies to catch any regressions.
    *   **Monitoring:**  Monitor security advisories and mailing lists for the middleware you use.  Be prepared to apply patches immediately, even outside of your regular release cycle.

*   **4.4.4. Least Privilege (Middleware Choice - Expanded):**

    *   **Functionality Audit:**  Carefully evaluate the features of each middleware.  Choose the one that provides *only* the functionality you need.  Avoid middleware with excessive features or permissions.
    *   **Custom Middleware:**  If no existing middleware meets your exact needs, consider writing a *small, focused, custom middleware* instead of using a large, complex one.  This gives you more control and reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Middleware Composition:**  If you need multiple features, consider using multiple small, single-purpose middleware instead of one large, multi-purpose middleware.  This improves modularity and reduces the impact of a vulnerability in any single middleware.

*   **4.4.5. Request Logging and Monitoring:**

    *   **Detailed Logging:** Log all outgoing requests, including headers, body, and URL.  This provides an audit trail that can be used to detect and investigate any suspicious activity.  Be mindful of logging sensitive data and comply with privacy regulations.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Implement monitoring systems that can detect unusual patterns in outgoing requests.  This can help identify potential tampering attempts.
    *   **Alerting:**  Configure alerts to notify you of any detected anomalies or security vulnerabilities.

* **4.4.6 Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * Even though the threat is focused on *outgoing* requests, ensure that any data used to construct those requests (and that might be influenced by user input) is properly validated and sanitized *before* it reaches the Faraday middleware. This prevents attackers from indirectly influencing the middleware's behavior through malicious input.

### 4.5. Tooling Recommendations

*   **Bundler Audit:**  For basic vulnerability scanning of Ruby dependencies.
*   **Snyk:**  For comprehensive vulnerability scanning and dependency management.
*   **GitHub Dependabot:**  For automated dependency updates on GitHub.
*   **Renovate:**  Another option for automated dependency updates (supports more platforms than Dependabot).
*   **Brakeman:**  A static analysis security scanner for Ruby on Rails applications (can help identify potential vulnerabilities that could indirectly lead to request tampering).
*   **OWASP ZAP:**  A web application security scanner that can be used to test for various vulnerabilities, including request tampering (though it's more focused on incoming requests).
