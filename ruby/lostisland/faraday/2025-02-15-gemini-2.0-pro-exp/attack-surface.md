# Attack Surface Analysis for lostisland/faraday

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Connection Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_connection_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  Misconfiguration of Faraday's connection settings, specifically SSL/TLS verification, exposes the application to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
*   **Faraday Contribution:** Faraday provides the options for configuring connection behavior, including SSL/TLS. Incorrect settings directly lead to the vulnerability.
*   **Example:**  Disabling SSL verification (`ssl: { verify: false }`) or using an insecure adapter without proper SSL/TLS configuration.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can intercept and modify communication, stealing sensitive data (credentials, API keys) or injecting malicious content.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Always enable SSL/TLS verification (`ssl: { verify: true }`). Specify trusted CA certificates. Use secure adapters and keep them updated.  Never disable verification in production. Regularly review Faraday's SSL/TLS configuration. Use configuration validation.

## Attack Surface: [Request Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/request_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious HTTP headers into requests made *through* Faraday.
*   **Faraday Contribution:** Faraday's API allows modification of request headers.  This is the direct mechanism of the attack.
*   **Example:**  Injecting a `Host` header to redirect to a malicious server, or injecting headers to bypass authentication.
*   **Impact:**  Redirection to malicious sites, bypassing security controls, session hijacking, data theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Strictly validate and sanitize *all* input used to set request headers via Faraday. Use a whitelist approach. Avoid directly constructing headers from user input.

## Attack Surface: [Request Body Injection (Non-GET)](./attack_surfaces/request_body_injection__non-get_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious content into the body of requests (POST, PUT, PATCH) sent *via* Faraday.
*   **Faraday Contribution:** Faraday's API allows setting the request body. This is the direct mechanism used for the injection.
*   **Example:**  Injecting malicious XML or JSON to exploit parser vulnerabilities on the target server.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution (RCE), data corruption, denial of service, data theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Strictly validate and sanitize the request body set through Faraday, based on the expected content type. Use schema validation (e.g., JSON Schema). Avoid direct use of user input; use parameterized data or object serialization.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies (Adapters & Middleware)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies__adapters_&_middleware_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Faraday's adapters or third-party middleware directly used with Faraday.
*   **Faraday Contribution:** Faraday *relies* on these external components.  A vulnerability in an adapter or middleware *is* a vulnerability in the Faraday-using application.
*   **Example:**  An outdated `Net::HTTP` adapter with a known vulnerability, or a vulnerable custom Faraday middleware.
*   **Impact:**  Varies (depending on the vulnerability), but can range from information disclosure to RCE.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Keep *all* Faraday adapters and middleware up-to-date. Regularly run dependency vulnerability scanners. Carefully vet third-party middleware. Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool.
