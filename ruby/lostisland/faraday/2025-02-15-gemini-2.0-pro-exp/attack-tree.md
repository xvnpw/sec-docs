## Attack Tree Path: [1. Middleware Exploits](./attack_tree_paths/1__middleware_exploits.md)

**1. Middleware Exploits**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.a. Custom Middleware Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/1_a__custom_middleware_vulnerability.md)

*   **1.a. Custom Middleware Vulnerability**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.a.1. RCE via Custom MW [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_a_1__rce_via_custom_mw__critical_.md)

    *   **1.a.1. RCE via Custom MW [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in custom-written Faraday middleware to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could be due to flaws like command injection, unsafe evaluation of user input, or insecure handling of file uploads.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends heavily on the quality of custom code)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Full server compromise)
        *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding and exploiting the vulnerability)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Depends on logging and intrusion detection systems)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Rigorous code review of all custom middleware.
            *   Static analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities.
            *   Dynamic analysis (fuzzing) to test for unexpected behavior.
            *   Follow secure coding practices, avoiding dangerous functions and validating all input.
            *   Principle of least privilege: Ensure middleware operates with minimal necessary permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.a.2. Data Leakage via Custom MW [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_a_2__data_leakage_via_custom_mw__high_risk_.md)

    *   **1.a.2. Data Leakage via Custom MW [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** Sensitive data is unintentionally exposed through the custom middleware. This could happen through error messages, logging of sensitive information, or insecure data handling practices.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Accidental exposure is common)
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depends on the sensitivity of the leaked data)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (May be as simple as observing error messages)
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (May be visible in logs or responses)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Carefully review error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information.
            *   Implement strict data sanitization and validation.
            *   Avoid logging sensitive data. If necessary, use secure logging practices and redact sensitive information.
            *   Enforce data access controls within the middleware.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.b. Known Middleware Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/1_b__known_middleware_vulnerability.md)

*   **1.b. Known Middleware Vulnerability**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.b.1. CVE in Popular MW (e.g., Rack) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_b_1__cve_in_popular_mw__e_g___rack___high_risk_.md)

    *   **1.b.1. CVE in Popular MW (e.g., Rack) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a publicly known vulnerability (CVE) in a popular Faraday middleware gem (or a gem used *as* middleware, like Rack).
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (If using outdated versions; High if unpatched after CVE release)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Depends on the specific CVE)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Public exploits often available)
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate (Script kiddies can use public exploits)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (Signature-based detection, vulnerability scanners)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Keep all middleware gems up-to-date.
            *   Use dependency checking tools (e.g., `bundler-audit`, Dependabot) to identify and remediate known vulnerabilities.
            *   Regularly review the middleware stack for unnecessary or outdated components.
            *   Implement a robust patching process to quickly address newly discovered vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Core Faraday Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3__core_faraday_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **3. Core Faraday Vulnerabilities**

## Attack Tree Path: [3.b. Response Processing Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/3_b__response_processing_vulnerability.md)

*   **3.b. Response Processing Vulnerability**

## Attack Tree Path: [3.b.1. Unsafe Deserialization [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_b_1__unsafe_deserialization__critical_.md)

    *   **3.b.1. Unsafe Deserialization [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Faraday (or, more likely, a middleware) uses an unsafe deserialization method (like `YAML.load` in Ruby) on untrusted data received in a response. This allows an attacker to inject malicious objects that can lead to arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (If developers follow best practices; Medium if they don't)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploits are often straightforward)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected with static analysis and dynamic testing)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Absolutely avoid unsafe deserialization methods.**
            *   Use safe alternatives: `JSON.parse` for JSON, `YAML.safe_load` for YAML.
            *   If you *must* use a potentially unsafe deserialization method, implement strict whitelisting of allowed classes and thoroughly validate the input before deserialization.
            *   Consider using a more secure serialization format if possible.
