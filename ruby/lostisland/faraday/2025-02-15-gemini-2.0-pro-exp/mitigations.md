# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for lostisland/faraday

## Mitigation Strategy: [Request/Response Middleware for Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/requestresponse_middleware_for_sanitization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create a Custom Faraday Middleware Class:**  Define a new Ruby class that inherits from `Faraday::Middleware`.
    2.  **Implement the `call` Method:** This method receives the request environment (`env`).
    3.  **Inspect Request Headers:** Access `env.request_headers`. Redact or remove sensitive headers (e.g., `Authorization`, `Cookie`). Use a whitelist.
    4.  **Inspect Request Body (Carefully):** If `env.request_body` exists and `Content-Type` is structured (e.g., `application/json`), parse it *safely*. Redact sensitive fields. Handle parsing errors.
    5.  **Call the Next Middleware:** Use `@app.call(env)`.
    6.  **Inspect Response (in `on_complete`):** Use `.on_complete` on `@app.call(env)`'s result. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the response.
    7.  **Register the Middleware:** Use `conn.use YourMiddlewareClass` when creating your Faraday connection. Position it strategically (before logging).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintentional Exposure of Sensitive Data in Requests:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Data Leakage via Logging:** (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintentional Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Data Leakage via Logging:** Significantly reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in `app/middleware/sensitive_data_redactor.rb`. Redacts `Authorization` header.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Response header redaction.
    *   Request/response body redaction.
    *   Not used by all Faraday connections.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Redirects (`follow_redirects`)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_redirects___follow_redirects__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Faraday Connections:** Locate all Faraday connection configurations.
    2.  **Configure `follow_redirects`:** If enabled, set `limit` to a reasonable value (e.g., 3 or 5).
    3.  **Disable if Unnecessary:** If following redirects isn't needed, disable it.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Open Redirects (via `follow_redirects`):** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Redirect Loops:** (Severity: Low)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Open Redirects:** Reduces risk.
    *   **DoS via Redirect Loops:** Eliminates risk of infinite loops.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Some connections have limits, but not all.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent application to all connections.
    *   Some connections might use default (unlimited) redirects.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Choose and Configure Secure Adapters](./mitigation_strategies/choose_and_configure_secure_adapters.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Adapter Options:** Examine Faraday adapters (Net::HTTP, Typhoeus, Excon) and documentation.
    2.  **Prefer Secure Defaults:** Choose adapters known for security. Net::HTTP (with TLS) is a good default.
    3.  **Configure TLS Properly:** Use TLS 1.2+ with strong cipher suites. Avoid insecure versions/ciphers. This is done *within* the Faraday adapter configuration.
    4.  **Avoid Custom Adapters (Unless Necessary):** If creating a custom adapter, follow security best practices (TLS, input validation).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Insecure Adapter Configuration:** (Severity: Medium to High)
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (if TLS is misconfigured):** (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Insecure Adapter Configuration:** Reduces risk.
    *   **MITM Attacks:** Significantly reduces risk with correct TLS.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Primarily uses Net::HTTP.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit TLS configuration (ciphers, minimum version) is inconsistent.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce SSL/TLS Certificate Verification](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_ssltls_certificate_verification.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate Faraday Connections:** Find all configurations.
    2.  **Explicitly Enable Verification:** Set `ssl: { verify: true }` for *all* connections, especially in production. Make it explicit.
    3.  **Use Test Certificates:** In development/testing, use self-signed certs or a local CA, *not* disabling verification. Configure Faraday to trust them.
    4.  **Consider Certificate Pinning (Advanced):** Explore pinning (may require custom middleware/adapter features). This is configured *through* Faraday (or its adapter).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **MITM Attacks:** Eliminates risk with correct implementation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Verification is enabled by default in most connections.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Not all connections explicitly set `ssl: { verify: true }`.
    *   No use of test certificates; verification is sometimes disabled.
    *   No certificate pinning.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Set Reasonable Timeouts](./mitigation_strategies/set_reasonable_timeouts.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate Faraday Connections:** Find all configurations.
    2.  **Configure Timeouts:** Set `conn.options.timeout` (overall) and `conn.options.open_timeout` (connection open) to reasonable values (seconds).
    3.  **Consider Per-Endpoint Timeouts:** For different services, set timeouts per-request: `request.options.timeout` and `request.options.open_timeout`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Slow Requests:** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Slow Requests:** Significantly reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Some connections have timeouts, but not all.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent application to all connections.
    *   Some might use default (long) timeouts.
    *   No per-endpoint timeouts.
