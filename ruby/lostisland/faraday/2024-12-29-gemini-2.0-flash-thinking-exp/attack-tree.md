Threat Model: Compromising Application Using Faraday HTTP Client - High-Risk Sub-Tree

Attacker's Goal: To compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Faraday HTTP client library.

High-Risk Sub-Tree:

Compromise Application via Faraday
├── OR: Exploit Request Manipulation [HIGH-RISK PATH]
│   ├── AND: Perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) [HIGH-RISK PATH]
│   │   ├── 2. Find input parameters that influence the target URL in Faraday's request. [CRITICAL NODE]
│   ├── AND: Inject Malicious Headers [HIGH-RISK PATH]
│   │   ├── 1. Identify application logic that allows user-controlled input to be used as HTTP headers in Faraday requests. [CRITICAL NODE]
├── OR: Exploit Faraday Configuration Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH]
│   ├── AND: Exploit Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]
│   │   ├── 1. Identify if the application allows configuration of Faraday's TLS/SSL settings. [CRITICAL NODE]

Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

High-Risk Path: Exploit Request Manipulation
  Attack Vectors:
    * Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):
      - Critical Node: Find input parameters that influence the target URL in Faraday's request.
        - Description: The attacker identifies a user-controllable input that is used to construct the URL for a Faraday request.
        - Potential Impact: Enables the attacker to make requests to internal resources, potentially accessing sensitive data or interacting with internal services.
    * Inject Malicious Headers:
      - Critical Node: Identify application logic that allows user-controlled input to be used as HTTP headers in Faraday requests.
        - Description: The attacker finds a way to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into requests made by Faraday.
        - Potential Impact: Can lead to various issues like IP spoofing, bypassing authentication, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the target server based on the injected headers.

High-Risk Path: Exploit Faraday Configuration Weaknesses
  Attack Vectors:
    * Exploit Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration:
      - Critical Node: Identify if the application allows configuration of Faraday's TLS/SSL settings.
        - Description: The attacker discovers that the application allows modification of Faraday's TLS/SSL settings.
        - Potential Impact: If the attacker can disable certificate verification or force the use of insecure TLS versions, they can perform man-in-the-middle attacks, intercepting and potentially modifying sensitive communication.

Critical Nodes Breakdown:

Critical Node: Find input parameters that influence the target URL in Faraday's request.
  - Associated High-Risk Path: Exploit Request Manipulation -> Perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  - Description: This is the pivotal point for SSRF attacks. If successful, the attacker gains control over the destination of Faraday's requests.
  - Mitigation Focus: Strict input validation and sanitization of URL parameters used in Faraday requests. Implement allow-lists for permitted hosts.

Critical Node: Identify application logic that allows user-controlled input to be used as HTTP headers in Faraday requests.
  - Associated High-Risk Path: Exploit Request Manipulation -> Inject Malicious Headers
  - Description: Identifying this logic is the key to injecting malicious headers.
  - Mitigation Focus: Avoid directly using user input in HTTP headers. If necessary, implement rigorous sanitization and validation.

Critical Node: Identify if the application allows configuration of Faraday's TLS/SSL settings.
  - Associated High-Risk Path: Exploit Faraday Configuration Weaknesses -> Exploit Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration
  - Description: This node represents the point where an attacker can potentially weaken the security of Faraday's HTTPS connections.
  - Mitigation Focus: Securely manage Faraday's TLS/SSL configuration. Do not allow external influence on these settings. Enforce strong TLS versions and certificate verification.
