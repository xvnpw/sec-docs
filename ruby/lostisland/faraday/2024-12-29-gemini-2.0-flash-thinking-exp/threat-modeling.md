### High and Critical Faraday-Specific Threats

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle Request Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic and modifies the HTTP request sent by Faraday before it reaches its destination. This might involve changing request parameters, headers, or the request body. This is directly relevant to Faraday's role in constructing and sending requests.
    *   **Impact:**  The remote server might receive malicious or incorrect data, leading to unintended actions, data corruption, or security breaches on the remote system. The application might also operate on false assumptions based on the tampered request.
    *   **Affected Faraday Component:** `Faraday::Connection` (responsible for sending requests), potentially affected by any middleware that modifies the request.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS for all Faraday connections.
        *   Verify SSL/TLS certificates of the remote servers.
        *   Consider certificate pinning for highly sensitive connections.
        *   Be cautious when disabling SSL verification for debugging or development purposes, and ensure it's re-enabled in production.

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle Response Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic and modifies the HTTP response sent by the remote server before it reaches the application using Faraday. This could involve altering response headers, status codes, or the response body. This directly involves Faraday's role in receiving and processing responses.
    *   **Impact:** The application might process malicious or incorrect data, leading to vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), data breaches, or incorrect application behavior.
    *   **Affected Faraday Component:** `Faraday::Response` (responsible for handling responses), potentially affected by any middleware that processes the response.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS for all Faraday connections.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on data received through Faraday.
        *   Consider using digital signatures or message authentication codes (MACs) for critical data exchanges if the external service supports it.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Faraday Adapters
    *   **Description:** The underlying HTTP library used by a Faraday adapter (e.g., Net::HTTP, Patron, HTTPClient) might contain security vulnerabilities. This directly impacts Faraday users as they rely on these adapters.
    *   **Impact:**  The application could inherit vulnerabilities from the adapter, potentially leading to remote code execution, denial of service, or other security breaches.
    *   **Affected Faraday Component:** Specific adapter implementations (e.g., `Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp`, `Faraday::Adapter::Typhoeus`), the underlying HTTP library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Faraday and Adapters updated.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Faraday and the underlying HTTP libraries used by its adapters.
        *   Consider adapter security when choosing.

*   **Threat:** Malicious or Vulnerable Middleware
    *   **Description:**  A developer might use custom or third-party Faraday middleware that contains vulnerabilities or malicious code. This middleware directly interacts with Faraday's request/response cycle.
    *   **Impact:**  Malicious middleware could leak sensitive information, modify requests or responses in harmful ways, or introduce other security flaws into the application's communication flow.
    *   **Affected Faraday Component:** `Faraday::RackBuilder` (for adding middleware), individual middleware components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review middleware code.
        *   Use trusted middleware sources.
        *   Keep middleware updated.
        *   Implement input validation in middleware.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via User-Controlled URLs
    *   **Description:** If the application allows user-provided input to directly influence the URLs accessed by Faraday, an attacker could potentially force the application to make requests to internal or unintended external resources. This directly involves how Faraday constructs and sends requests based on provided URLs.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could gain access to internal services, read sensitive data, or perform actions on behalf of the application.
    *   **Affected Faraday Component:** `Faraday::Connection` (URL construction).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate user input.
        *   Implement a whitelist of allowed hosts/URLs.
        *   Avoid direct user input in URLs.
