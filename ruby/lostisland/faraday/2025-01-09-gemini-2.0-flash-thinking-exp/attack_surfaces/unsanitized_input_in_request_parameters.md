## Deep Dive Analysis: Unsanitized Input in Request Parameters (Faraday Context)

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Unsanitized Input in Request Parameters" attack surface within the context of applications utilizing the `faraday` Ruby HTTP client library.

**1. Understanding the Attack Surface:**

The core vulnerability lies in the application's failure to properly sanitize or encode user-provided input before incorporating it into HTTP requests constructed using `faraday`. This means that data originating from potentially malicious sources (e.g., user forms, API responses, external databases) is directly used to build URLs, headers, or request bodies.

**2. Faraday's Role in Exacerbating the Risk:**

`Faraday` is a powerful and flexible HTTP client library designed to be adaptable to various needs. This flexibility, while a strength, becomes a potential weakness when developers directly manipulate request components with unsanitized input.

* **Dynamic Request Construction:** `Faraday` allows developers to dynamically build requests, including:
    * **URL Construction:**  Appending paths, query parameters.
    * **Header Manipulation:** Setting custom headers.
    * **Body Construction:**  Creating request bodies in various formats (JSON, XML, form data).
* **Ease of Use (Potential Pitfall):**  The straightforward nature of `faraday`'s API can inadvertently lead to developers directly embedding user input without realizing the security implications.
* **Middleware Flexibility:** While middleware can be used for sanitization, it also presents an opportunity for vulnerabilities if not configured or implemented correctly.

**3. Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Vector:**

Let's examine how unsanitized input can be exploited in different parts of a `faraday` request:

**a) URL Manipulation:**

* **Mechanism:** Directly concatenating user input into the URL path or query parameters.
* **Faraday Code Example (Vulnerable):**
   ```ruby
   require 'faraday'
   require 'uri'

   user_input = params[:target_url] # Imagine user provides: "example.com/../../admin"
   conn = Faraday.new(url: "https://api.vulnerable-site.com")
   response = conn.get("/data/#{user_input}")
   ```
* **Exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the URL to access unauthorized resources or bypass security controls. In the example above, the attacker could potentially access `https://api.vulnerable-site.com/admin`.
* **Specific Threats:**
    * **Path Traversal:** Accessing files or directories outside the intended scope.
    * **URL Redirection:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    * **Bypassing Access Controls:** Circumventing authentication or authorization checks.

**b) HTTP Header Injection:**

* **Mechanism:** Injecting newline characters (`\r\n`) into header values, allowing attackers to insert arbitrary headers.
* **Faraday Code Example (Vulnerable):**
   ```ruby
   require 'faraday'

   user_agent = params[:user_agent] # Imagine user provides: "MyAgent\r\nInjected-Header: MaliciousValue"
   conn = Faraday.new(url: "https://target-site.com") do |f|
     f.headers['User-Agent'] = user_agent
   end
   response = conn.get("/")
   ```
* **Exploitation:** Attackers can inject malicious headers to manipulate the server's behavior or the client's interpretation of the response.
* **Specific Threats:**
    * **Session Hijacking:** Injecting `Set-Cookie` headers to steal or manipulate session cookies.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting headers like `Content-Type` or custom headers that influence how the browser renders the response.
    * **Cache Poisoning:** Injecting headers that affect caching mechanisms.

**c) Request Body Injection:**

* **Mechanism:** Injecting malicious data into the request body, particularly when constructing structured data like JSON or XML.
* **Faraday Code Example (Vulnerable - JSON):**
   ```ruby
   require 'faraday'
   require 'json'

   username = params[:username] # Imagine user provides: '"; malicious_key":"malicious_value"'
   data = { name: username, email: "user@example.com" }
   conn = Faraday.new(url: "https://api.target.com")
   response = conn.post('/users', data.to_json, 'Content-Type' => 'application/json')
   ```
* **Exploitation:**  Attackers can manipulate the structure or content of the request body, potentially leading to:
* **Specific Threats:**
    * **Data Manipulation:** Modifying data on the server in unintended ways.
    * **SQL Injection (Indirect):** If the backend server processes the unsanitized data and uses it in database queries.
    * **Command Injection (Indirect):** If the backend server processes the unsanitized data and uses it in system commands.

**4. Impact Scenarios (Elaborated):**

* **HTTP Header Injection:** Can lead to session hijacking, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, cache poisoning, and bypassing security controls. An attacker might inject a `Set-Cookie` header to steal a user's session or inject a malicious script through a manipulated `Content-Type` header.
* **URL Redirection:** Attackers can redirect users to phishing sites or other malicious destinations, potentially stealing credentials or spreading malware.
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** If user input influences the target URL, attackers can force the server to make requests to internal resources or external services, potentially exposing sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions.
* **Data Exfiltration/Modification:**  Unsanitized input in request bodies can lead to the modification or leakage of sensitive data on the server-side.
* **Bypass Security Controls:** Attackers can craft malicious requests that bypass web application firewalls (WAFs) or other security measures by injecting specific characters or patterns.
* **Logging and Monitoring Issues:** Injected data can corrupt logs, making it difficult to track attacks or identify malicious activity.

**5. Mitigation Strategies (Faraday-Specific Implementation):**

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** This is the most crucial step. Always validate and sanitize user input before using it in `faraday` requests.
    * **Whitelisting:** Define allowed characters or patterns and reject any input that doesn't conform.
    * **Blacklisting (Less Effective):** Identify and remove known malicious characters or patterns.
    * **Regular Expression Matching:** Use regex to enforce input formats.
* **Proper Encoding:** Encode user input appropriately before including it in URLs or headers.
    * **URL Encoding:** Use `URI.encode_www_form_component` for query parameters and URL paths.
    * **Header Encoding:** While direct encoding might not always be necessary for standard headers, be mindful of special characters and consider encoding if needed.
* **Using Faraday's Built-in Methods:** Leverage `faraday`'s features for handling parameters and headers securely.
    * **`params` Option:** Use the `params` option in `get`, `post`, etc., to automatically handle URL encoding of query parameters.
      ```ruby
      conn.get('/search', params: { query: user_input })
      ```
    * **`headers` Option:** Use the `headers` option to set headers. `faraday` will generally handle basic encoding, but be cautious with user-provided values.
      ```ruby
      conn.get('/', headers: { 'X-Custom-Header' => sanitized_input })
      ```
* **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements (Conceptual):** While not directly applicable to HTTP requests in the same way as database queries, the principle applies. Avoid directly embedding user input into request bodies. Instead, structure your data and let `faraday` handle the serialization.
    * **JSON Encoding:** Use `to_json` on a Ruby hash to create the request body.
    * **Form Encoding:** Use the `request.body = URI.encode_www_form(data)` approach for form data.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP) and Other Security Headers:** While not a direct mitigation for unsanitized input, implementing strong security headers can help mitigate the impact of successful attacks, such as XSS.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities related to unsanitized input.

**6. Specific Considerations for Faraday:**

* **Middleware for Sanitization:** Develop or utilize `faraday` middleware to automatically sanitize or validate request parameters and headers before they are sent. This provides a centralized and reusable approach.
* **Connection Adapters:** Be aware that different `faraday` connection adapters might have subtle differences in how they handle requests. While less likely to be a direct source of unsanitized input vulnerabilities, understanding the underlying adapter can be beneficial.
* **Configuration:** Ensure that `faraday` is configured with secure defaults and avoid unnecessary or insecure configurations.

**7. Conclusion:**

The "Unsanitized Input in Request Parameters" attack surface is a critical security concern for applications using `faraday`. The library's flexibility, while powerful, requires developers to be vigilant about properly handling user input. By implementing robust input validation, sanitization, and encoding techniques, and by leveraging `faraday`'s built-in features securely, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of these vulnerabilities and build more resilient applications. Continuous security awareness and regular testing are essential to maintain a secure application environment.
