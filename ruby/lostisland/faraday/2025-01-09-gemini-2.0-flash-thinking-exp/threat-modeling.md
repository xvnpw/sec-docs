# Threat Model Analysis for lostisland/faraday

## Threat: [Header Injection](./threats/header_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject malicious HTTP headers by manipulating user-controlled input that is directly used to construct Faraday requests. This is done by including newline characters (`\r\n`) followed by the malicious header and its value.

**Impact:**
*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** The attacker can inject arbitrary content into the HTTP response, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by injecting JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser.
*   **Session Fixation:** The attacker can inject a `Set-Cookie` header to force a specific session ID onto a user, potentially hijacking their session.
*   **Bypassing Security Controls:**  Malicious headers can be used to bypass authentication or authorization checks on the target server.

**Affected Faraday Component:** `Faraday::Request` (specifically the methods for setting headers, e.g., `headers[]=` or `options[:headers]`)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user-provided input before using it to set HTTP headers. Remove or encode newline characters (`\r` and `\n`).
*   **Use Faraday's Parameterized Request Features:** When possible, use Faraday's built-in mechanisms for setting parameters instead of directly manipulating header strings.

## Threat: [URL Manipulation leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./threats/url_manipulation_leading_to_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

**Description:** An attacker can manipulate user-controlled input that is used to construct the target URL in a Faraday request. By crafting malicious URLs, they can force the application to make requests to unintended internal or external resources.

**Impact:**
*   **Access to Internal Resources:** The attacker can access internal services or resources that are not publicly accessible, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing further attacks.
*   **Port Scanning:** The attacker can use the application as a proxy to scan internal networks and identify open ports and running services.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can force the application to send sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker can overload internal services or external targets by making a large number of requests through the application.

**Affected Faraday Component:** `Faraday::Connection` (specifically the methods for creating requests, e.g., `get`, `post`, and the logic for constructing the full URL).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust validation on all user-provided input used to construct URLs. Use whitelisting to allow only known and safe URL patterns or hosts.
*   **URL Sanitization:** Sanitize URLs to remove potentially malicious characters or components.

## Threat: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./threats/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

**Description:** The application might be configured to disable SSL certificate verification or use weak TLS versions/ciphers in Faraday's SSL options. This allows attackers to perform Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Interception:** Attackers can intercept sensitive data exchanged between the application and the remote server, such as API keys, credentials, or personal information.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify the intercepted data before it reaches either the application or the remote server.
*   **Impersonation:** Attackers can impersonate either the application or the remote server.

**Affected Faraday Component:** `Faraday::Connection` (specifically the `ssl` option passed during connection initialization).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enable and Enforce Certificate Verification:** Ensure that `ssl: { verify: true }` is set in the Faraday connection options.
*   **Use Strong TLS Versions and Ciphers:** Configure Faraday to use secure TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or higher) and strong cipher suites.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Faraday Adapters](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_faraday_adapters.md)

**Description:** Faraday relies on adapters (e.g., `Net::HTTP`, `Patron`, `Typhoeus`) to make HTTP requests. Vulnerabilities in these underlying adapters can be exploited through Faraday.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the adapter. It could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Faraday Component:** `Faraday::Adapter` (specifically the chosen adapter, e.g., `Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp`).

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep Faraday and Adapters Updated:** Regularly update Faraday and its adapter dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to Faraday and its adapters.

## Threat: [Middleware Vulnerabilities](./threats/middleware_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Faraday's middleware architecture allows for custom processing of requests and responses. Vulnerabilities in custom or third-party middleware can introduce security flaws.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the middleware. It could lead to information disclosure, authentication bypass, or denial of service.

**Affected Faraday Component:** `Faraday::Middleware` (specifically the vulnerable middleware).

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Middleware Development:** Follow secure coding practices when developing custom middleware. Thoroughly review and test middleware for potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Use Trusted Middleware:** Only use middleware from trusted sources and ensure they are regularly updated.
