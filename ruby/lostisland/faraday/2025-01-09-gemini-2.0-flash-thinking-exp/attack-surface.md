# Attack Surface Analysis for lostisland/faraday

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Adapter Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_adapter_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information (API keys, tokens, credentials) or insecure settings are directly embedded in the Faraday adapter configuration.
    *   **How Faraday Contributes:** Faraday's configuration allows for the direct setting of headers, parameters, and connection options, which can inadvertently include sensitive data or insecure defaults.
    *   **Example:**  Hardcoding an API key directly in the `Faraday.new` block when setting headers for authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or compromised accounts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store sensitive information in environment variables and access them securely within the application.
        *   Use secure configuration management tools or services to manage and inject sensitive settings.
        *   Never hardcode sensitive credentials directly in the code.
        *   Grant only necessary permissions to the application and its Faraday client.

## Attack Surface: [Unsanitized Input in Request Parameters](./attack_surfaces/unsanitized_input_in_request_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** User-provided input is directly used to construct request URLs, headers, or bodies without proper sanitization or encoding.
    *   **How Faraday Contributes:** Faraday's flexibility allows developers to dynamically construct requests, making it susceptible if input handling is not secure.
    *   **Example:**  Constructing a URL by directly concatenating user input without encoding, potentially leading to HTTP Header Injection or URL manipulation.
    *   **Impact:** HTTP Header Injection, URL Redirection, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if the input influences the target URL, or other injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate and sanitize all user-provided input before using it in Faraday requests.
        *   Use appropriate encoding functions (e.g., URL encoding) for request parameters.
        *   If constructing request bodies with structured data, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent injection.
        *   Use Faraday's built-in methods for setting parameters and headers to ensure proper encoding.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization of Response Bodies](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_of_response_bodies.md)

*   **Description:** The application automatically deserializes response bodies (e.g., JSON, XML) without validating the source or content, potentially leading to code execution.
    *   **How Faraday Contributes:** Faraday handles response parsing based on configured middleware. If insecure deserialization middleware is used or if custom parsing is implemented without proper checks, it becomes a risk.
    *   **Example:** Using a vulnerable JSON parsing library or implementing custom XML parsing without protection against XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Employ well-vetted and up-to-date deserialization libraries.
        *   Validate the structure and content of deserialized data before using it.
        *   Verify the `Content-Type` header of the response to ensure it matches the expected format.
        *   Only deserialize data that is actually needed.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Chain Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_chain_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in Faraday's dependencies (adapters, middleware, other gems).
    *   **How Faraday Contributes:** Faraday relies on a chain of dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited through the Faraday interface.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the `net-http` adapter or a specific middleware used by the application.
    *   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including RCE, information disclosure, and DoS.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Faraday and all its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.
        *   Use tools to scan your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Be aware of the security posture of the dependencies you are using.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Faraday is configured to disable SSL certificate verification or use outdated and insecure TLS versions.
    *   **How Faraday Contributes:** Faraday provides options to configure TLS/SSL settings for its HTTP requests. Incorrect configuration weakens the security of the connection.
    *   **Example:** Disabling `ssl.verify` in the Faraday connection options, making the application vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, allowing attackers to intercept and potentially modify communication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure SSL certificate verification is enabled and properly configured.
        *   If using custom certificate authorities, configure them correctly.
        *   Configure Faraday to use the latest and most secure TLS versions (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher).
        *   Only disable certificate verification in exceptional and controlled circumstances, with a thorough understanding of the risks.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Responses](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_responses.md)

*   **Description:**  Raw HTTP responses containing sensitive information (authentication tokens, API keys, PII) are logged or stored without proper filtering.
    *   **How Faraday Contributes:** Faraday retrieves and provides access to the full HTTP response, including headers and body. If this raw data is handled insecurely, it can lead to exposure.
    *   **Example:** Logging the entire HTTP response object, which might contain an authorization token in a header.
    *   **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive information, potentially leading to account compromise or data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mechanisms to filter out sensitive information from logs and storage.
        *   Log only necessary information and be mindful of what is being recorded.
        *   Ensure logging mechanisms are secure and access is restricted.
