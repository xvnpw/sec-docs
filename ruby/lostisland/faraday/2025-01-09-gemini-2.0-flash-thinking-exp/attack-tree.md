## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Faraday Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_faraday_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Insecure Default Settings
    *   Disable SSL Certificate Verification **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   Use Insecure HTTP Protocol **[CRITICAL NODE]**
*   Misconfigured Proxy Settings
    *   Use Attacker-Controlled Proxy **[CRITICAL NODE]**
*   Leaked API Keys/Credentials in Faraday Configuration **[CRITICAL NODE]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Disable SSL Certificate Verification](./attack_tree_paths/disable_ssl_certificate_verification.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application is configured to bypass SSL certificate verification for Faraday requests.
**Mechanism:** This allows for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks where an attacker can intercept and modify communication between the application and the remote server.
**Potential Impact:**
*   Interception of sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS.
*   Theft of authentication credentials.
*   Modification of request and response data.
*   Injection of malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use Insecure HTTP Protocol](./attack_tree_paths/use_insecure_http_protocol.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application is configured to make Faraday requests over plain HTTP instead of HTTPS.
**Mechanism:** All communication is unencrypted and can be easily intercepted by anyone on the network path.
**Potential Impact:**
*   Exposure of all transmitted data, including sensitive information and credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use Attacker-Controlled Proxy](./attack_tree_paths/use_attacker-controlled_proxy.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application is configured to use an HTTP proxy server controlled by the attacker.
**Mechanism:** All Faraday requests are routed through the attacker's proxy, allowing them to inspect, modify, or block the traffic.
**Potential Impact:**
*   Full control over outgoing requests and incoming responses.
*   Data interception and modification.
*   Potential for injecting malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaked API Keys/Credentials in Faraday Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/leaked_api_keyscredentials_in_faraday_configuration.md)

**Attack Vector:** API keys or other sensitive credentials required for Faraday to interact with external services are directly embedded in the application's code or configuration.
**Mechanism:** Attackers who gain access to the application's codebase or configuration can extract these credentials.
**Potential Impact:**
*   Unauthorized access to the external services associated with the leaked credentials.
*   Data breaches on the external services.
*   Financial losses if the compromised services involve payments.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Faraday Request Construction Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_faraday_request_construction_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   Unvalidated User Input in Request URL/Headers/Body
    *   Injection via Request Parameters/Headers/Body **[CRITICAL NODE]**

**Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates user-controlled input that is used to construct the URL, headers, or body of an HTTP request made by Faraday.
**Mechanism:** By injecting malicious URLs or data, the attacker can force the application to make requests to unintended targets.
**Potential Impact:**
*   Access to internal network resources that are not publicly accessible.
*   Reading sensitive configuration files or internal data.
*   Executing commands on internal systems if the targeted internal service is vulnerable.
*   Potentially using the application as a proxy to attack other external systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

The core vulnerability allowing arbitrary request generation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injection via Request Parameters/Headers/Body](./attack_tree_paths/injection_via_request_parametersheadersbody.md)

Allows for more sophisticated attacks by injecting data that might be interpreted as commands or code by the target.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Faraday Response Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_faraday_response_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Insecure Deserialization of Response Data **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   Vulnerable Deserialization Libraries Used by Faraday or Application

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Deserialization of Response Data](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_deserialization_of_response_data.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application deserializes data received in Faraday responses (e.g., JSON, XML) using vulnerable libraries or without proper validation.
**Mechanism:** An attacker can craft a malicious response containing code that will be executed when the application deserializes it.
**Potential Impact:**
*   Remote code execution on the application server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Faraday Middleware Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_faraday_middleware_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Vulnerable Faraday Middleware **[CRITICAL NODE potential]**
    *   Third-Party Middleware with Known Vulnerabilities

**Attack Vector:** The application uses third-party Faraday middleware that contains known security vulnerabilities.
**Mechanism:** Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities, which could range from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the specific flaw in the middleware.
**Potential Impact:**
*   Information disclosure if the middleware vulnerability allows access to sensitive data.
*   Remote code execution on the application server if the middleware vulnerability allows it.
*   Bypassing security controls implemented by the vulnerable middleware.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Faraday Middleware](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_faraday_middleware.md)

The presence of vulnerable middleware is the key enabler for this attack path. The impact is highly dependent on the specific vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Faraday Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_faraday_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Vulnerable HTTP Adapter **[CRITICAL NODE potential]**
    *   Known Vulnerabilities in Underlying HTTP Libraries
*   Vulnerable Faraday Core Dependencies **[CRITICAL NODE potential]**

**Attack Vector:** Faraday relies on underlying HTTP adapter libraries (like `Net::HTTP` or `HTTPClient`) or other core dependencies that have known security vulnerabilities.
**Mechanism:** Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities in the dependencies, which can have a wide range of impacts depending on the specific flaw.
**Potential Impact:**
*   Information disclosure from vulnerabilities in the HTTP adapter.
*   Remote code execution on the application server if the dependency vulnerability allows it.
*   Denial of service if the vulnerability leads to crashes or resource exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable HTTP Adapter](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_http_adapter.md)

Compromised HTTP handling can have severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Faraday Core Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_faraday_core_dependencies.md)

Vulnerabilities in core libraries can affect the fundamental functionality and security of Faraday.
