## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Faraday [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_faraday__high-risk_path_.md)

**1. Exploit Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Faraday [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
*   **Exploitation in Faraday Context:** An attacker manipulates the URL that the application uses with Faraday to make HTTP requests. If user-controlled input is used to construct the URL without proper validation, the attacker can inject malicious URLs. Faraday will then execute these requests on behalf of the server.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Access to Internal Resources:** Attacker can force the application to access internal network resources (databases, internal APIs, services) that are not publicly accessible.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Attacker can use the application as a proxy to exfiltrate sensitive data from internal or external resources to attacker-controlled servers.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **1.1. Control Faraday Request URL [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is the entry point for SSRF. If the attacker can control the URL, the path is open for exploitation.
        *   **1.1.1. Parameter Injection in URL [CRITICAL NODE]:**  The most common way to control the URL is through parameter injection. If the application directly uses user input to build the URL string without sanitization, injection is possible.
    *   **1.2.1. Access Internal Resources [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  A primary goal of SSRF is to access internal systems.
    *   **1.2.2. Data Exfiltration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Another high-impact outcome of SSRF is data theft.
*   **Critical Actions (Mitigation):**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE - ACTION: Input Validation]:**  Sanitize and validate *all* user-controlled inputs used to construct Faraday request URLs. Use parameterized queries or URL builders to avoid direct string concatenation.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE - ACTION: Network Segmentation, Rate Limiting]:** Implement network segmentation to limit the application's access to internal resources. Use strict allow-lists for allowed destination hosts/networks. Rate limit Faraday requests to detect and mitigate abuse.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE - ACTION: Input Validation, Least Privilege]:** Enforce the principle of least privilege. The application user making Faraday requests should have minimal necessary permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Faraday Configuration Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_faraday_configuration_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**4. Exploit Faraday Configuration Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Insecure Configuration of Faraday leading to various vulnerabilities.
*   **Exploitation in Faraday Context:** Faraday offers various configuration options. If these are not set securely, it can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **4.1.1. Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, Data Interception.
        *   **Exploitation:** If TLS/SSL is disabled or configured with weak settings (e.g., certificate verification disabled, weak ciphers), attackers can intercept and potentially modify communication between the application and external servers.
        *   **Impact:** Confidentiality and integrity of data in transit are compromised.
    *   **4.1.2. Verbose Logging of Sensitive Data [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Information Disclosure, Credential Compromise.
        *   **Exploitation:** If Faraday's logging is configured to be too verbose, it might log sensitive data like API keys, authentication tokens, or request/response bodies into application logs.
        *   **Impact:** Sensitive information leakage, potential credential theft leading to further compromise.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **4.1. Insecure Faraday Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]:** The root cause of configuration-related vulnerabilities.
    *   **4.1.1. Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:** A specific high-impact configuration issue.
    *   **4.1.2. Verbose Logging of Sensitive Data [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:** Another specific high-impact configuration issue.
*   **Critical Actions (Mitigation):**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE - ACTION: Secure Config Management]:** Enforce strong TLS/SSL configurations. *Always* enable certificate verification in production. Use strong cipher suites. Implement secure logging practices. Avoid logging sensitive data. Securely manage proxy configurations if used.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE - ACTION: Config Audit, Hardening]:** Regularly review and audit Faraday configuration. Follow security hardening guidelines for Faraday and its dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Faraday's Dependencies (Adapters) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_faraday's_dependencies__adapters___high-risk_path_.md)

**5. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Faraday's Dependencies (Adapters) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in Faraday's HTTP adapter libraries (e.g., `net/http`, `patron`, `typhoeus`).
*   **Exploitation in Faraday Context:** Faraday relies on adapters to perform the actual HTTP communication. If these adapters have vulnerabilities, they can be exploited through Faraday.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **5.2.1. Code Execution in Adapter [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Remote Code Execution (RCE).
        *   **Exploitation:** A vulnerability in the adapter might allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending specially crafted requests or responses through Faraday that trigger the adapter vulnerability.
        *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, complete control over the application server.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **5. Faraday Uses Vulnerable Adapter [CRITICAL NODE]:** The prerequisite for exploiting adapter vulnerabilities.
    *   **5.2.1. Code Execution in Adapter [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:** The most severe outcome of adapter vulnerabilities.
*   **Critical Actions (Mitigation):**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE - ACTION: Dependency Update Management]:** Regularly update Faraday and *all* its adapter dependencies to the latest versions. Patch management is crucial.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE - ACTION: Dependency Scanning]:** Implement dependency scanning tools and processes to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in Faraday's dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Vulnerable Faraday Middleware](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_vulnerable_faraday_middleware.md)

**3. Exploit Vulnerable Faraday Middleware (Code Injection in Middleware) [HIGH-RISK PATH - if RCE]:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities, specifically code injection, in custom or third-party Faraday middleware.
*   **Exploitation in Faraday Context:** Faraday's middleware architecture allows developers to add custom logic to request/response processing. If middleware code is vulnerable, it can be exploited.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **3.2.1. Code Injection in Middleware [HIGH-RISK PATH - if RCE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Remote Code Execution (RCE).
        *   **Exploitation:** If middleware code improperly handles or processes request or response data, it might be vulnerable to code injection. An attacker could manipulate requests or responses to inject and execute arbitrary code on the server.
        *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, complete control over the application server.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **3.2.1. Code Injection in Middleware [HIGH-RISK PATH - if RCE]:** The high-impact outcome of middleware vulnerabilities.
*   **Critical Actions (Mitigation):**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE - ACTION: Middleware Security Audit, Update]:** Thoroughly review and audit *all* custom middleware code for vulnerabilities, especially injection flaws. Keep third-party middleware updated to the latest versions. Perform security testing on middleware.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE - ACTION: Secure Middleware Dev, Dependency Audit]:** Implement secure coding practices for custom middleware development. Regularly audit and update middleware dependencies used within middleware.
