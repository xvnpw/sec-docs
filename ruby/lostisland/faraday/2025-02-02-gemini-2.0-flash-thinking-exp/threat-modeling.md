# Threat Model Analysis for lostisland/faraday

## Threat: [Vulnerable HTTP Adapter](./threats/vulnerable_http_adapter.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable HTTP Adapter
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities present in the HTTP adapter chosen for Faraday (e.g., `Net::HTTP`, `Patron`, `Excon`). By sending crafted requests through Faraday, they can trigger adapter vulnerabilities leading to remote code execution, or significant information disclosure on the application server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Remote code execution on the application server.
    *   **High:** Information disclosure of sensitive data from the application server.
*   **Faraday Component Affected:** Adapter Module (e.g., `Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp`, `Faraday::Adapter::Patron`, `Faraday::Adapter::Excon`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific adapter vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Faraday adapters updated to the latest versions.
    *   Choose actively maintained and reputable adapters known for security.
    *   Regularly monitor security advisories for the HTTP adapters in use.

## Threat: [Malicious or Vulnerable Middleware](./threats/malicious_or_vulnerable_middleware.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious or Vulnerable Middleware
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities within a Faraday middleware component, or uses a deliberately malicious middleware. This allows them to manipulate requests and responses processed by Faraday, potentially leading to remote code execution within the application's request handling, or exfiltration of sensitive data processed by the middleware.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Remote code execution if the middleware vulnerability allows it.
    *   **High:** Data leakage of sensitive information handled by the middleware.
    *   **High:** Request manipulation leading to critical security breaches on target services.
*   **Faraday Component Affected:** Middleware Stack (`Faraday::Builder`, individual Middleware classes)
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the middleware and vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully vet and audit all middleware components, especially third-party or custom ones.
    *   Prefer well-established and trusted middleware libraries with good security track records.
    *   Implement robust input validation and output encoding within custom middleware.
    *   Regularly update middleware dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Faraday Configuration - Disabled SSL/TLS Verification](./threats/insecure_faraday_configuration_-_disabled_ssltls_verification.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Faraday Configuration - Disabled SSL/TLS Verification
*   **Description:** An attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack because SSL/TLS verification is disabled in Faraday's configuration. This allows them to intercept and decrypt HTTPS traffic between the application and external services, potentially stealing credentials, sensitive data, or modifying communications in transit.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Complete exposure of sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS.
    *   **Critical:** Full manipulation of data exchanged with external services, leading to severe application compromise.
*   **Faraday Component Affected:** `Faraday::Connection` configuration options (`ssl` option, specifically `verify` option)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always enable and strictly enforce SSL/TLS certificate verification.**
    *   Ensure `ssl: { verify: true }` or equivalent is explicitly set in Faraday connection configuration.
    *   Utilize trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) for verification.

## Threat: [Insecure Faraday Configuration - Weak TLS Version](./threats/insecure_faraday_configuration_-_weak_tls_version.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Faraday Configuration - Weak TLS Version
*   **Description:** An attacker forces the Faraday connection to downgrade to a weak or outdated TLS version (e.g., TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1) if these are still enabled in Faraday's configuration or allowed by the server. This allows them to exploit known vulnerabilities in these older TLS protocols to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the communication.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Exposure of sensitive data due to exploitation of TLS vulnerabilities in older versions.
    *   **High:** Increased susceptibility to Man-in-the-Middle attacks due to weakened encryption and known protocol weaknesses.
*   **Faraday Component Affected:** `Faraday::Connection` configuration options (`ssl` option, specifically `version` option)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure Faraday to exclusively use strong and up-to-date TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3).
    *   Explicitly disable support for older, vulnerable TLS versions in Faraday configuration.
    *   Regularly review and update TLS configuration to align with security best practices.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Faraday Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_faraday_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable Faraday Dependencies
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits known security vulnerabilities in libraries that Faraday depends on, either directly or indirectly through its middleware or adapters. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution within the application process, or allow for significant information disclosure, depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Remote code execution due to a vulnerability in a Faraday dependency.
    *   **High:** Information disclosure originating from vulnerable dependencies used by Faraday.
*   **Faraday Component Affected:** Dependency Management (Gemfile, Gemfile.lock, transitive dependencies)
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific dependency and vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit and update Faraday and *all* of its dependencies, including transitive dependencies.
    *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to proactively identify known vulnerabilities in Faraday's dependency tree.
    *   Actively monitor security advisories related to Faraday and its dependencies and promptly apply necessary patches and updates.
