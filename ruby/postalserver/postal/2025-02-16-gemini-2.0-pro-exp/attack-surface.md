# Attack Surface Analysis for postalserver/postal

## Attack Surface: [1. SMTP Authentication Bypass/Weakness](./attack_surfaces/1__smtp_authentication_bypassweakness.md)

*Description:* Unauthorized sending of emails through Postal by bypassing or exploiting weak SMTP authentication.
*How Postal Contributes:* Postal's *core* function is sending email via SMTP; its authentication mechanism is a *direct* and critical security control.
*Example:* An attacker uses a brute-forced SMTP credential to send spam through the Postal server.
*Impact:* Complete compromise of email sending; reputational damage; blacklisting.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong, unique passwords.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for SMTP.
    *   **Rate Limiting & Account Lockout:** Prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   **Regular Credential Rotation:** Rotate SMTP credentials.
    *   **IP Whitelisting:** Restrict SMTP access to trusted IPs.
    *   **Disable Unused Authentication Methods:** Remove weak authentication.
    *   **Security Audits:** Audit the SMTP authentication code.
    *   **Monitor Logs:** Watch for suspicious authentication activity.

## Attack Surface: [2. Email Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/2__email_header_injection.md)

*Description:* Manipulation of email headers to spoof senders or redirect replies.
*How Postal Contributes:* Postal *directly* constructs and sends emails, including headers. Flaws in *its* header handling are the vulnerability.
*Example:* An attacker adds a fake `From` header to impersonate a legitimate sender.
*Impact:* Phishing; data theft; reputational damage.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate/sanitize all data used for headers (whitelist approach).
    *   **Encoding:** Properly encode header values.
    *   **Library Usage:** Use well-vetted email libraries for header construction.
    *   **Regular Expression Review:** Carefully review regex used for validation.
    *   **Testing:** Test with malicious header inputs.

## Attack Surface: [3. API Abuse (if applicable)](./attack_surfaces/3__api_abuse__if_applicable_.md)

*Description:* Exploitation of Postal's API to send unauthorized emails or bypass limits.
*How Postal Contributes:* If Postal has an API, *that API's code* is the direct attack surface.
*Example:* A leaked API key is used to send spam, exceeding limits.
*Impact:* Spam; reputational damage; resource exhaustion.
*Risk Severity:* **High** (if an API exists)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Secure API Key Management:** Treat API keys as highly sensitive.
    *   **API Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate keys.
    *   **Rate Limiting (API-Specific):** Strict rate limiting on API requests.
    *   **Input Validation (API):** Validate all API input.
    *   **Authorization:** Proper authorization for API users.
    *   **Auditing:** Log all API requests.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all data from the API.

## Attack Surface: [4. Rate Limiting/Abuse Prevention Bypass](./attack_surfaces/4__rate_limitingabuse_prevention_bypass.md)

*Description:* Circumventing Postal's mechanisms to prevent sending excessive emails.
*How Postal Contributes:* Postal *should* implement these; bypassing them is a *direct* attack on *Postal's code*.
*Example:* Exploiting a flaw in rate limiting to send emails faster than allowed.
*Impact:* Spam; denial-of-service; blacklisting.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Robust Rate Limiting:** Use multiple factors (IP, sender, recipient).
    *   **IP Address Tracking:** Track and throttle IPs.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual sending.
    *   **Regular Review:** Adjust rate limiting rules.

## Attack Surface: [5. Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/5__dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Postal.
*How Postal Contributes:* Postal *directly* depends on these libraries; their vulnerabilities become Postal's.
*Example:* A vulnerable Ruby gem used by Postal allows code execution.
*Impact:* Varies, but can be complete server compromise.
*Risk Severity:* **High** to **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep all dependencies up-to-date.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use scanners to find known issues.
    *   **Dependency Pinning:** Pin versions (balance with updates).
    *   **Security Alerts:** Subscribe to alerts for dependencies.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run Postal with minimal privileges.
