Okay, let's create a design document for the Postal project, focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Postal is an open-source mail server.  It aims to provide a complete and functional mail server solution, replacing commercial offerings like SendGrid or Mailgun.  This implies a focus on reliability, scalability, and data privacy.  The target audience includes businesses of all sizes, from small startups to larger enterprises, as well as individual users who want more control over their email infrastructure.

Business Priorities:

*   Provide a reliable and functional mail server.
*   Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user email data.
*   Offer a cost-effective alternative to commercial mail services.
*   Maintain a strong reputation for security and privacy.
*   Foster a vibrant open-source community.
*   Provide easy to use and well documented solution.

Business Goals:

*   Become a leading open-source mail server solution.
*   Attract a large and active user base.
*   Gain adoption by businesses of all sizes.
*   Continuously improve the software based on user feedback.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data breaches leading to exposure of sensitive email data.
*   Service disruptions causing email delivery failures.
*   Reputational damage due to security vulnerabilities or privacy violations.
*   Inability to scale to meet the demands of a growing user base.
*   Lack of adoption due to complexity or poor documentation.
*   Compromise of the mail server, leading to its use for spam or phishing campaigns.
*   Legal and regulatory non-compliance (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on the GitHub repository and general knowledge of mail servers):

*   security control: Web application firewall (WAF) capabilities, potentially through a reverse proxy like Nginx or a dedicated WAF solution. (Not explicitly mentioned in the repository, but standard practice for web applications).
*   security control: TLS/SSL encryption for all communication channels (SMTP, IMAP, HTTP). (Mentioned in documentation and configuration examples).
*   security control: Authentication mechanisms for SMTP, IMAP, and the web interface. (Mentioned in documentation).
*   security control: SPF, DKIM, and DMARC support for email authentication and anti-spoofing. (Mentioned in documentation).
*   security control: Rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks. (Mentioned in documentation).
*   security control: Input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting). (Implied, but should be explicitly verified in the codebase).
*   security control: Regular security updates and patching. (Implied by the active development and release cycle).
*   security control: Access controls to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality. (Implied by the user and administrative roles).
*   security control: Logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents. (Mentioned in documentation).
*   security control: Data sanitization and escaping to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. (Implied, but should be explicitly verified in the codebase).
*   security control: Use of a database with appropriate security configurations (e.g., parameterized queries, strong passwords, limited privileges). (Implied, but should be explicitly verified).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Complexity of configuration may lead to misconfigurations by users, potentially exposing the server to vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party libraries and dependencies, which may introduce vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Open-source nature of the project means that vulnerabilities may be discovered and exploited before patches are available.
*   accepted risk: Potential for zero-day exploits against the underlying operating system, mail server software, or other components.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a comprehensive security auditing program, including regular penetration testing and code reviews.
*   Provide detailed security hardening guides and best practices for users.
*   Implement a bug bounty program to incentivize security researchers to report vulnerabilities.
*   Integrate with intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS).
*   Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for administrative access.
*   Implement data loss prevention (DLP) measures to prevent sensitive data from leaving the system.
*   Use a dedicated, hardened operating system for the mail server.
*   Implement network segmentation to isolate the mail server from other systems.
*   Regularly review and update the threat model for the project.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All users must be authenticated before accessing the system.
    *   Strong password policies must be enforced.
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication should be considered.
    *   Administrative accounts must have separate, strong credentials.
*   Authorization:
    *   Access to resources must be granted based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   Users should only have access to the data and functionality they need.
    *   Administrative roles should be clearly defined and enforced.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All input from users and external systems must be validated to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Input validation should be performed on both the client-side and server-side.
    *   Use a whitelist approach to input validation whenever possible.
*   Cryptography:
    *   All sensitive data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.
    *   Strong cryptographic algorithms and key lengths must be used.
    *   Key management practices must be secure.
    *   TLS/SSL certificates must be properly managed and renewed.
*   Auditing:
    *   All security-relevant events must be logged.
    *   Logs must be securely stored and protected from tampering.
    *   Logs should be regularly reviewed for suspicious activity.

## DEPLOYMENT

Possible Deployment Solutions:

1.  Single Server Deployment: All Postal components (web interface, API, SMTP server, IMAP server, message queue, worker processes, database) are deployed on a single server. This is the simplest option, suitable for small deployments.
2.  Multi-Server Deployment: Components are distributed across multiple servers. This provides better scalability and resilience. For example, the database could be on a separate server, and multiple worker processes could be running on different machines.
3.  Containerized Deployment (Docker): Postal components are packaged as Docker containers and deployed using Docker Compose or Kubernetes. This offers portability, scalability, and ease of management.
4.  Cloud-Based Deployment (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure): Postal is deployed on a cloud platform using virtual machines, containers, or managed services. This provides scalability, resilience, and access to cloud-specific features.

Chosen Solution (for detailed description): Containerized Deployment (Docker) using Docker Compose. This is a common and recommended approach for Postal.

## BUILD

The Postal project utilizes a combination of build processes, primarily centered around Ruby (for the core application) and Node.js (for frontend assets).  While the repository doesn't explicitly define a CI/CD pipeline in a standard file (like .github/workflows), the documentation and project structure suggest the following:

Build Process:

1.  Developer commits code changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  Ruby dependencies are managed using Bundler (Gemfile and Gemfile.lock).  `bundle install` is likely used to install these dependencies.
3.  Node.js dependencies are managed using npm or yarn (package.json and package-lock.json or yarn.lock). `npm install` or `yarn install` is used to install these.
4.  Frontend assets (JavaScript, CSS) are likely compiled and minified using a build tool like Webpack or Parcel (though this isn't explicitly shown in the repository root, it's common practice).
5.  Database migrations are managed using a migration system (likely part of the Ruby framework).
6.  Docker images are built using Dockerfiles.  There are likely separate Dockerfiles for the different components (web, worker, etc.).
7.  The `docker-compose.yml` file orchestrates the building and linking of the various Docker containers.

Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   Dependency Management: Bundler and npm/yarn help manage dependencies and ensure consistent versions.  Tools like `bundler-audit` and `npm audit` can be used to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   Static Code Analysis: Linters (like Rubocop for Ruby and ESLint for JavaScript) are likely used (though not explicitly enforced in the repository) to identify potential code quality and security issues.
*   Database Migrations: A controlled migration process helps ensure database schema changes are applied consistently and securely.
*   Docker Images: Building from source using Dockerfiles allows for greater control over the environment and reduces the risk of using pre-built images with unknown contents.
*   Containerization: Docker provides isolation between the different components of the application, limiting the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
