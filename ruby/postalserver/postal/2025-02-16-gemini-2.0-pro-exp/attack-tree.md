## Attack Tree Path: [1. Unauthorized Email Sending/Relaying](./attack_tree_paths/1__unauthorized_email_sendingrelaying.md)

*   **[[1.1 SMTP Abuse]]**
    *   Description: The attacker exploits weaknesses related to SMTP server configuration and authentication to send unauthorized emails.
    *   **[[1.1.1 Credentials Leak]]**
        *   Description: The attacker obtains valid SMTP credentials (username/password) through various means, such as:
            *   Misconfigured environment variables.
            *   Exposed configuration files.
            *   Social engineering attacks.
            *   Compromised third-party services.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: High (Can send spam/phishing, damage reputation)
        *   Effort: Low (If credentials are found)
        *   Skill Level: Low
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Might be detected through SMTP logs or unusual email activity)

*   **[[1.2 API Abuse]]**
    *   Description: The attacker leverages vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the Postal API to send unauthorized emails.
    *   **[[1.2.1 API Key Leak]]**
        *   Description: The attacker gains access to a valid Postal API key with sufficient permissions to send emails.  This could occur through:
            *   Insecure storage of the API key (e.g., in code repositories, configuration files).
            *   Compromised developer accounts.
            *   Social engineering.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: High (Can send emails, access data)
        *   Effort: Low (If the key is found)
        *   Skill Level: Low
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (API logs might show unusual activity)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Data Exfiltration/Modification](./attack_tree_paths/2__data_exfiltrationmodification.md)

*   **[[2.1 DB Access]]**
    *   Description: The attacker gains unauthorized access to the Postal database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data.
    *   **[[2.1.1 SQL Injection Vulnerability]]**
        *   Description: The attacker exploits a SQL injection vulnerability in Postal's code to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could happen if:
            *   Input validation and sanitization are insufficient.
            *   Parameterized queries are not used consistently.
        *   Likelihood: Low (Postal *should* use parameterized queries, but vulnerabilities can still exist)
        *   Impact: Very High (Complete control over the database)
        *   Effort: High (Requires finding and exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability)
        *   Skill Level: High
        *   Detection Difficulty: High (Unless specific database monitoring or intrusion detection systems are in place)
    *   **[[2.1.2 Direct Database Access]]**
        *   Description: The attacker bypasses Postal's security controls and connects directly to the database server. This could be due to:
            *   The database server being exposed to the internet.
            *   Weak or default database credentials.
            *   Misconfigured firewall rules.
        *   Likelihood: Low (If database security is properly configured)
        *   Impact: Very High (Complete control over the database)
        *   Effort: Low (If weak credentials or exposed ports are found)
        *   Skill Level: Low/Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Network monitoring might detect unusual connections)

*   **[[2.2 API Data Exfiltration]]**
    *   Description: The attacker uses the Postal API to extract sensitive data.
    *   **[[2.2.1 API Key Leak]]**
        *   Description: (Same as 1.2.1) The attacker gains access to a valid Postal API key, which they then use to access data through the API.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: High (Can access sensitive data depending on API key permissions)
        *   Effort: Low (If the key is found)
        *   Skill Level: Low
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (API logs might show unusual requests)
