# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for postalserver/postal

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Configuration (within Postal)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_spf__dkim__and_dmarc_configuration__within_postal_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **DKIM (Postal-Specific):** Within Postal's configuration (`postal.yml` or the web interface), ensure DKIM signing is enabled for *all* outgoing emails.  Generate and manage DKIM keys *within Postal*. Use strong key lengths (2048-bit or higher). Regularly rotate DKIM keys through Postal's interface or configuration management. Ensure the private keys are stored securely by Postal and are *never* exposed.
    2.  **SPF & DMARC (Coordination):** While the records themselves are DNS entries, Postal's configuration should inform *what* goes into those records.  Postal's IP address(es) must be accurately reflected in the SPF record.  Postal's DKIM selector must be used in the DKIM DNS record.
    3. **Postal's Sending Domains:** Use Postal's interface to manage the list of allowed sending domains. This list should be kept up-to-date and consistent with your DNS records.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Email Spoofing (Outbound):** Severity: **High**.
    *   **Phishing (Outbound):** Severity: **High**.
    *   **Reputation Damage:** Severity: **Medium**.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Email Spoofing:** Risk reduction: **High**.
    *   **Phishing:** Risk reduction: **High**.
    *   **Reputation Damage:** Risk reduction: **Medium-High**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   DKIM: Fully implemented (2048-bit keys, rotated annually) *within Postal*.
    *   SPF/DMARC Coordination: Partially implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Ensure Postal's configuration is the "source of truth" for SPF and DMARC settings, and that changes are reflected in DNS.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sender Domain Verification (within Postal)](./mitigation_strategies/sender_domain_verification__within_postal_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Postal's Verification Mechanism:** Utilize Postal's built-in domain verification features. This likely involves configuring Postal to require either email verification (sending a confirmation email to an address at the domain) or DNS verification (checking for a specific TXT record).
    2.  **Enforcement:** Configure Postal to *strictly enforce* domain verification.  Ensure there are *no* settings or workarounds that allow users to send from unverified domains. This should be a global setting within Postal, not a per-user option.
    3. **Postal's Domain List:** Regularly review the list of verified domains *within Postal's interface* to ensure they are still valid and authorized. Remove any domains that are no longer in use or are no longer authorized.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Email Spoofing (Outbound):** Severity: **High**.
    *   **Phishing (Outbound):** Severity: **High**.
    *   **Abuse by Malicious Users:** Severity: **Medium**.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Email Spoofing:** Risk reduction: **High**.
    *   **Phishing:** Risk reduction: **High**.
    *   **Abuse by Malicious Users:** Risk reduction: **Medium**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Email verification is used, but it's not strictly enforced for all users within Postal.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Enforce domain verification for *all* users and sender domains *within Postal's configuration*, without exception.
    *   Regularly audit the list of verified domains *within Postal*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Outbound Rate Limiting (within Postal)](./mitigation_strategies/outbound_rate_limiting__within_postal_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Postal's Rate Limiting Settings:** Use Postal's built-in rate limiting features (configured in `postal.yml` or through the web interface).
    2.  **Configure Limits:** Set specific limits for:
        *   **Per User/Account:** Limit emails per user per hour/day.
        *   **Per Sender Domain:** Limit emails per domain per hour/day.
        *   **Per Sending IP (If Supported):** If Postal supports it, limit per sending IP.
    3.  **Postal's Logging:** Configure Postal to log rate limiting events.
    4.  **Alerting (within Postal):** If Postal has built-in alerting for rate limit violations, configure it.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Spam Outbreaks:** Severity: **High**.
    *   **Phishing Campaigns:** Severity: **High**.
    *   **Reputation Damage:** Severity: **Medium**.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Severity: **Low**.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Spam Outbreaks:** Risk reduction: **High**.
    *   **Phishing Campaigns:** Risk reduction: **High**.
    *   **Reputation Damage:** Risk reduction: **Medium**.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduction: **Low-Medium**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic rate limiting is implemented per user within Postal, but not per sender domain or IP address.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement rate limiting per sender domain and, if supported by Postal, per IP address *within Postal's configuration*.
    *   Refine per-user rate limits.
    *   Configure Postal's built-in alerting (if available) for rate limit violations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Open Relay (within Postal)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_open_relay__within_postal_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Postal Configuration Review:** Thoroughly examine Postal's configuration files (`postal.yml` and any related files) to ensure there are *absolutely no* settings that enable open relay functionality.  Specifically, look for and disable any options related to unauthenticated relaying, anonymous access, or relaying for external domains.
    2.  **Authentication Enforcement:**  Within Postal's configuration, ensure that authentication (username/password or API key) is *mandatory* for all SMTP connections originating from outside your trusted network (which should be defined within Postal, if possible).
    3. **Testing (External, but informed by Postal):** While the *testing* is external, the *configuration* to prevent open relay is entirely within Postal.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Spam Relay Abuse:** Severity: **Critical**.
    *   **Reputation Damage:** Severity: **High**.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Severity: **Medium**.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Spam Relay Abuse:** Risk reduction: **Critical**.
    *   **Reputation Damage:** Risk reduction: **High**.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduction: **Medium**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Believed to be fully implemented within Postal's configuration, but needs regular verification.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Regularly audit Postal's configuration to ensure open relay remains disabled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [API Key Management (within Postal)](./mitigation_strategies/api_key_management__within_postal_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Postal's API Key Interface:** Use Postal's built-in interface for managing API keys.
    2.  **Least Privilege (within Postal):** When creating API keys *within Postal*, grant *only* the necessary permissions.  Create separate keys for different applications, each with the minimum required access.
    3.  **Rotation (within Postal):** Use Postal's interface to regularly rotate API keys.  Revoke old keys after new keys are deployed.
    4.  **Monitoring (within Postal):** If Postal provides API key usage logs or statistics, monitor them for suspicious activity.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised API Key:** Severity: **High**.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Severity: **High**.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Severity: **Medium**.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised API Key:** Risk reduction: **High**.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduction: **High**.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduction: **Medium-High**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   API keys are used, but not all applications have separate keys within Postal.  Rotation is not consistently performed through Postal's interface.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Create separate API keys for all applications *within Postal*, with least privilege.
    *   Implement regular API key rotation *using Postal's features*.
    *   Utilize Postal's API key monitoring capabilities (if available).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates (of Postal)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates__of_postal_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Update Mechanism:** Use Postal's recommended update mechanism (e.g., `postal upgrade`, Docker image updates, package manager).
    2.  **Schedule:** Establish a regular schedule for updating the Postal *software itself*.
    3. **Testing:** Before applying updates to the production Postal instance, test them in a staging environment that mirrors the production setup.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Severity: **High**.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Indirectly):** Severity: **Medium**.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduction: **High**.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Indirectly):** Risk reduction: **Low-Medium**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Updates are performed, but not on a regular schedule.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Establish a regular update schedule for the Postal software.
    *   Improve the patching process, including testing in a staging environment *before* updating the production Postal instance.
