# Threat Model Analysis for postalserver/postal

## Threat: [Compromise of the Postal Server Instance](./threats/compromise_of_the_postal_server_instance.md)

*   **Description:** If the specific instance of Postal being used (self-hosted or managed) is compromised due to vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure, operating system, or Postal software itself, attackers could gain access to sensitive email data, API keys, or potentially use it as a platform for further attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, reputational damage, potential compromise of the application itself if credentials or sensitive data are leaked from Postal.
    *   **Affected Postal Component:** Entire Postal Server Instance (including database, configuration files, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow Postal's security best practices for deployment and maintenance.
        *   Regularly update Postal to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Secure the underlying infrastructure where Postal is hosted (e.g., strong passwords, firewall rules, regular security audits).
        *   If using a managed Postal service, ensure the provider has robust security measures in place.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Postal Software](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_postal_software.md)

*   **Description:** Undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities within the Postal software itself could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability, including data breaches, denial of service, or remote code execution on the Postal server.
    *   **Affected Postal Component:** Various modules and functions within the Postal software depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical, High, or Medium depending on the vulnerability). *(Included here as it can be critical)*
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay informed about security advisories for Postal.
        *   Promptly apply security updates released by the Postal development team.
        *   Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) in front of the Postal instance to mitigate some types of attacks.
        *   Regularly review Postal's changelogs and security announcements.

## Threat: [Webhook Forgery Leading to Data Manipulation](./threats/webhook_forgery_leading_to_data_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts fake webhook requests mimicking Postal's structure and sends them to the application's webhook endpoint. Without proper verification *on the Postal side* (if such a vulnerability exists in Postal's webhook sending mechanism), the application might process this forged data as legitimate.
    *   **Impact:** Manipulation of application state, triggering unintended actions, potential security vulnerabilities if webhook data is used to make critical decisions.
    *   **Affected Postal Component:** Postal Webhooks (the mechanism for sending event notifications).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Critically important:** Implement robust verification of webhook signatures provided by Postal. This ensures the request genuinely originated from Postal.
        *   Ensure the webhook endpoint is only accessible to Postal's servers (e.g., through IP whitelisting or network segmentation).

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information via Postal's Logging or Storage](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_via_postal's_logging_or_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Postal's internal logging mechanisms or data storage might inadvertently expose sensitive information (e.g., email content, recipient data, API keys) if not properly secured or configured. An attacker gaining access to the Postal server could exploit this.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, privacy violations, potential for targeted attacks based on revealed information.
    *   **Affected Postal Component:** Postal Logging System, Postal Database.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Review Postal's logging configuration and ensure sensitive information is not logged unnecessarily or is properly anonymized/redacted.
        *   Implement strong access controls for the Postal database and log files.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest within the Postal database.
