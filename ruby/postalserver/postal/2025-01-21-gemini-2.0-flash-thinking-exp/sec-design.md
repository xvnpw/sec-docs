## 4. Data Flow

This section details the typical data flow for sending and receiving emails within the Postal architecture.

### 4.1. Sending an Email

1. **Email Submission:** An Email Sender (A) submits an email to the Inbound SMTP Server (F) using the SMTP protocol.
2. **Reception and Processing:** The Inbound SMTP Server (F) receives the email, performs checks (authentication if required, recipient verification, spam and virus filtering), and if accepted, enqueues the message in the Message Queue (H).
3. **Message Processing:** A Worker Process (L) retrieves the message from the Message Queue (H).
4. **Data Storage:** The Worker Process (L) stores the email metadata and content in the Database (I) and any attachments in the Storage (J).
5. **Delivery:** The Worker Process (L) uses the Outbound SMTP Server (G) to deliver the email to the Email Recipient's (B) mail server using the SMTP protocol.

### 4.2. Receiving an Email

1. **Email Reception:** An external mail server (A) delivers an email to the Inbound SMTP Server (F) of the Postal instance using the SMTP protocol.
2. **Reception and Processing:** The Inbound SMTP Server (F) receives the email, performs checks (recipient verification, spam and virus filtering), and if accepted, enqueues the message for delivery to the appropriate mailbox in the Message Queue (H).
3. **Message Processing:** A Worker Process (L) retrieves the message from the Message Queue (H).
4. **Data Storage:** The Worker Process (L) stores the email metadata and content in the Database (I) and any attachments in the Storage (J).
5. **User Access:** The Email Recipient (B) can access the email through the Web UI (D) or via an external email client (not detailed here, but would interact with the Database and Storage).

## 5. Security Considerations (Initial)

This section provides an initial overview of security considerations. A dedicated threat model will further analyze these and identify potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Robust mechanisms are crucial for all components, including the Web Interface, API (using API keys), SMTP servers (SMTP AUTH), and CLI tool.
*   **Data Protection:** Sensitive data (user credentials, email content, API keys) must be encrypted both at rest and in transit (TLS).
*   **Network Security:** Firewalls and network segmentation are necessary to restrict access and limit the impact of potential breaches.
*   **Input Validation:** Rigorous validation of all user inputs and external data is essential to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, command injection, etc.).
*   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement these measures to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks on various endpoints (API, SMTP).
*   **Logging and Auditing:** Comprehensive logging of system activity, security events, and API access is vital for monitoring and incident response.
*   **Dependency Management:** Regularly update dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure Configuration:** Default configurations should be secure, and administrators should be guided on secure configuration practices.
*   **Protection against Email Spoofing:** Implement and enforce SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.

## 6. Assumptions and Constraints

*   The underlying operating system and network infrastructure are assumed to be reasonably secure.
*   The design assumes the use of standard email protocols (SMTP).
*   Specific implementation details of external services (e.g., spam filters, virus scanners) are considered external to the core Postal architecture.

## 7. Future Considerations

*   Integration with more sophisticated anti-spam and anti-virus solutions.
*   Support for additional authentication methods (e.g., OAuth 2.0).
*   Enhanced monitoring and alerting capabilities with integration into external monitoring systems.
*   Improved scalability and high availability through clustering and load balancing.
*   More granular role-based access control.
*   Implementation of Content Security Policy (CSP) for the Web Interface.
*   Regular security audits and penetration testing.
