## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Postal's Sending Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_postal's_sending_functionality.md)

This path focuses on compromising the application by exploiting weaknesses in how Postal sends emails.

*   **Critical Node: Bypass Authentication/Authorization for Sending**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Exploiting insecure API key generation or management, allowing an attacker to obtain valid API keys without authorization.
        *   Exploiting missing or weak authentication checks in the Postal API endpoints used for sending emails.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in OAuth or other authentication mechanisms used by Postal, potentially allowing token theft or bypass.
        *   Exploiting weaknesses in SMTP authentication if the application directly interacts with Postal's SMTP server or an integrated one.

*   **Critical Node: Manipulate Email Content to Exploit Application**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Injecting malicious JavaScript or HTML (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS) into the email body, which could be executed when the application renders or processes the email.
        *   Injecting operating system commands or code into email content that is later processed by the application in an insecure manner (Command Injection).
        *   Injecting malicious headers to manipulate email routing, bypass security checks (like SPF/DKIM), or influence how the receiving application processes the email.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the template engine used by Postal (if dynamic email content is generated), allowing the injection of malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Postal's Receiving Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_postal's_receiving_functionality.md)

This path focuses on compromising the application by exploiting weaknesses in how Postal receives and processes emails.

*   **Critical Node: Bypass Authentication/Authorization for Receiving**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Exploiting insecure API key management for inbound webhooks, allowing unauthorized entities to send fake webhook requests.
        *   Exploiting missing or weak authentication checks for inbound webhook endpoints.
        *   Exploiting weaknesses in SMTP authentication if Postal directly exposes an SMTP server for receiving emails.

*   **Critical Node: Manipulate Received Email Content to Exploit Application**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Injecting malicious JavaScript or HTML into the received email body, which could be executed when the application renders or processes the email.
        *   Injecting operating system commands or code into received email content that is later processed by the application in an insecure manner.
        *   Injecting malicious headers to manipulate how the application routes or processes the received email.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles email attachments, such as path traversal vulnerabilities allowing writing to arbitrary locations or execution of malicious files.

*   **Critical Node: Exploit Inbound Webhook Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Forging webhook requests to trigger unintended actions within the application, potentially creating, modifying, or deleting data.
        *   Exploiting the lack of proper signature verification for webhook requests, allowing attackers to send malicious requests that appear legitimate.
        *   Causing a Denial of Service (DoS) by flooding the webhook endpoint with a large number of requests, overwhelming the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Postal's Management Interface](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_postal's_management_interface.md)

This path focuses on gaining control of Postal through its administrative interface.

*   **Critical Node: Gain Unauthorized Access to the Management Interface**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Exploiting default or weak credentials for administrative accounts.
        *   Performing brute-force attacks against login forms to guess passwords.
        *   Exploiting weak password policies that allow easily guessable passwords.
        *   Exploiting authorization vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and gain access to administrative functionalities.
        *   Exploiting common web application vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), or SQL Injection in the management interface.

*   **Critical Node: Modify Postal Configuration to Compromise Application**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Changing SMTP settings to redirect outgoing emails to an attacker-controlled server, potentially intercepting sensitive information or conducting further phishing attacks.
        *   Modifying webhook configurations to send sensitive data to an attacker's server or to trigger malicious actions in other systems.
        *   Disabling security features like rate limiting, making the system more vulnerable to abuse.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Postal's API](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_postal's_api.md)

This path focuses on directly interacting with Postal's API to cause harm.

*   **Critical Node: Bypass Authentication/Authorization for API Access**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Exploiting insecure API key generation, allowing attackers to create valid API keys.
        *   Exploiting insecure storage or transmission of API keys, allowing attackers to steal them.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in OAuth or other authentication mechanisms used to secure the API.
