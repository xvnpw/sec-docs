# Attack Surface Analysis for postalserver/postal

## Attack Surface: [Weak Administrative Panel Authentication](./attack_surfaces/weak_administrative_panel_authentication.md)

**Description:**  The administrative panel of Postal lacks strong authentication mechanisms, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of default credentials.

**How Postal Contributes:** Postal provides a web-based administrative interface for managing the mail server. If this interface is not secured properly, it becomes a primary entry point for attackers.

**Example:** An attacker attempts to log in to the Postal admin panel using common default credentials or by brute-forcing passwords. Successful login grants full control over the mail server.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the mail server, allowing attackers to read, send, and delete emails, modify configurations, and potentially pivot to other systems.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong password policies for administrator accounts.
*   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrator logins.
*   Disable or change default administrator credentials immediately after installation.
*   Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.
*   Consider IP whitelisting or limiting access to the admin panel to specific networks.

## Attack Surface: [SMTP Open Relay Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/smtp_open_relay_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** Postal is misconfigured to act as an open relay, allowing anyone on the internet to send emails through the server, potentially for spam or phishing.

**How Postal Contributes:** Postal is an SMTP server, and its configuration determines whether it will relay emails from unauthorized sources. Incorrect configuration exposes this vulnerability.

**Example:** Spammers use the misconfigured Postal server to send out a large volume of unsolicited emails, damaging the server's reputation and potentially leading to blacklisting.

**Impact:** Server blacklisting, reputation damage, resource exhaustion, and potential legal repercussions due to misuse.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure Postal is configured to only relay emails for authenticated users or from explicitly allowed networks/domains.
*   Regularly review and audit relay settings.
*   Implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to prevent spoofing and improve email deliverability.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Administrative Panel](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_the_administrative_panel.md)

**Description:** The Postal administrative panel contains vulnerabilities that allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other administrators.

**How Postal Contributes:** Postal's web interface, if not properly sanitized, can allow the storage or reflection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Example:** An attacker injects a malicious script into a Postal organization name. When another administrator views the organization details, the script executes, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.

**Impact:** Account takeover of administrators, potential data breaches, and further compromise of the mail server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and output encoding/escaping for all user-supplied data in the admin panel.
*   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
*   Regularly scan the admin panel for XSS vulnerabilities.
