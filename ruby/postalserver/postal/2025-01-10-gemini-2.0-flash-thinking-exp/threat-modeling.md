# Threat Model Analysis for postalserver/postal

## Threat: [Compromised API Keys for Sending](./threats/compromised_api_keys_for_sending.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the API keys used by the application to authenticate with Postal for sending emails. They might achieve this through insecure storage, interception of network traffic, or by compromising the application server. Once obtained, the attacker can use these keys to send emails through the Postal instance.

**Impact:**
*   Reputation damage to the organization due to spam or malicious emails originating from their infrastructure.
*   Phishing attacks targeting users or other organizations, potentially leading to data breaches or financial loss.
*   Blacklisting of the organization's sending IP addresses and domains, severely impacting legitimate email deliverability.
*   Increased costs associated with excessive email sending.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Header Injection Attacks](./threats/header_injection_attacks.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the application's email sending functionality where user-provided data is not properly sanitized before being used to construct email headers. This allows them to inject arbitrary headers, which Postal will then process and send.

**Impact:**
*   Spoofing of sender addresses, making it appear that emails are coming from legitimate sources.
*   Adding unintended recipients to emails, leading to privacy breaches.
*   Manipulating email routing, potentially redirecting emails to attacker-controlled servers.
*   Circumventing spam filters by injecting specific headers.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Processing of Malicious Attachments (Inbound Webhooks)](./threats/processing_of_malicious_attachments__inbound_webhooks_.md)

**Description:** If the application automatically processes attachments from emails received via Postal's inbound webhooks without proper security measures, malicious attachments could compromise the application server or the systems it interacts with. This threat directly involves how the application interacts with data provided by Postal.

**Impact:**
*   Malware infection of the application server or connected systems.
*   Data exfiltration from the application server.
*   Denial of service by exploiting vulnerabilities in attachment processing libraries.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Compromise of Postal Admin Credentials](./threats/compromise_of_postal_admin_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the administrative credentials for the Postal instance. This could be through brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, phishing, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the Postal web interface.

**Impact:**
*   Full control over the Postal instance, allowing the attacker to send and receive emails as any user.
*   Access to sensitive email data and configuration settings.
*   Modification of Postal settings, potentially creating backdoors or disabling security features.
*   Potential compromise of the underlying server if the attacker gains shell access.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the Postal Software Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_postal_software_itself.md)

**Description:** Unpatched security vulnerabilities exist within the Postal software. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service directly on the Postal server.

**Impact:**
*   Remote code execution on the Postal server.
*   Information disclosure, including sensitive email data and configuration settings.
*   Denial of service, making the email server unavailable.
*   Potential compromise of the underlying operating system.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)

## Threat: [Exposure of Postal Management Interface](./threats/exposure_of_postal_management_interface.md)

**Description:** The Postal management interface is accessible from the public internet without proper authentication or access controls. This makes it a target for attackers attempting to gain unauthorized access to the Postal system itself.

**Impact:**
*   Brute-force attacks on administrative credentials.
*   Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the management interface.
*   Potential takeover of the Postal instance if attackers gain administrative access.

**Risk Severity:** High
