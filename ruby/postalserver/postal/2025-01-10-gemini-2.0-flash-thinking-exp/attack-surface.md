# Attack Surface Analysis for postalserver/postal

## Attack Surface: [Web Interface Authentication Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/web_interface_authentication_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in how Postal authenticates users to its administrative web interface, potentially allowing unauthorized access.
*   **How Postal Contributes:** Postal provides the web interface and manages its authentication mechanisms. Flaws in its implementation directly expose this surface.
*   **Example:**  An attacker brute-forces default credentials for the administrator account or exploits a lack of rate limiting on the login page.
*   **Impact:**  Full control over the Postal server, including the ability to view, modify, and delete emails, manage users, and potentially compromise the underlying system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for all Postal users.
    *   Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts.
    *   Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms on the login page to prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   Regularly review and update Postal to the latest version to patch known authentication vulnerabilities.
    *   Restrict access to the Postal web interface to trusted networks or IP addresses.

## Attack Surface: [SMTP Relay Abuse](./attack_surfaces/smtp_relay_abuse.md)

*   **Description:**  Postal being misconfigured as an open relay, allowing attackers to send unsolicited emails through the server.
*   **How Postal Contributes:** Postal functions as an SMTP server and its configuration determines whether it will relay emails for unauthorized senders.
*   **Example:** Spammers use the Postal server to send out phishing emails or spam, potentially leading to the server's IP address being blacklisted.
*   **Impact:**  Damage to the server's reputation, blacklisting of the IP address, and potential legal repercussions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure Postal to only relay emails for authenticated users or authorized domains.
    *   Implement Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) records to verify the legitimacy of outgoing emails.
    *   Monitor SMTP logs for suspicious activity and unauthorized relay attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Message Queue Vulnerabilities (if applicable)](./attack_surfaces/message_queue_vulnerabilities__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**  Security weaknesses in the message queue system (e.g., RabbitMQ) used by Postal for asynchronous tasks.
*   **How Postal Contributes:** Postal relies on the message queue for internal communication and task processing. Vulnerabilities in the queue directly impact Postal's security.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the message queue and can read, modify, or delete messages, potentially disrupting email delivery or gaining access to sensitive information.
*   **Impact:**  Disruption of email flow, potential data breaches, and manipulation of internal processes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the message queue with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   Restrict access to the message queue to only authorized Postal components.
    *   Regularly update the message queue software to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor the message queue for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Flaws (if Postal exposes an API)](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_flaws__if_postal_exposes_an_api_.md)

*   **Description:**  Weaknesses in how Postal authenticates and authorizes access to its API endpoints.
*   **How Postal Contributes:** Postal's API design and implementation determine the security of its programmatic access.
*   **Example:**  An attacker exploits a lack of proper API key validation or authorization checks to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions via the API.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to manage Postal resources, potential data breaches, and the ability to disrupt email services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust API authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
    *   Enforce strict authorization checks to ensure users can only access resources they are permitted to.
    *   Use HTTPS for all API communication to protect against eavesdropping.
    *   Implement rate limiting and input validation on API endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

*   **Description:**  Accidental exposure of sensitive configuration files or environment variables containing credentials or API keys.
*   **How Postal Contributes:** Postal's configuration management practices determine where and how sensitive information is stored and accessed.
*   **Example:** Database credentials or API keys used by Postal are stored in plaintext in a publicly accessible configuration file or are leaked through error messages.
*   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the Postal server and potentially other connected systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store sensitive configuration data securely using environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions.
    *   Ensure configuration files are not publicly accessible and have appropriate file permissions.
    *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly in the application code.
    *   Regularly audit configuration settings for potential security weaknesses.
