  "threatName": "Processing of Malicious Attachments (Inbound Webhooks)",
  "description": "If the application automatically processes attachments from emails received via Postal's inbound webhooks without proper security measures, malicious attachments could compromise the application server or the systems it interacts with. This threat directly involves how the application interacts with data provided by Postal.",
  "impact": [
    "Malware infection of the application server or connected systems.",
    "Data exfiltration from the application server.",
    "Denial of service by exploiting vulnerabilities in attachment processing libraries."
  ],
  "riskSeverity": "High",
  "detailedAnalysis": {
    "attackVectors": [
      "**Direct Execution:** Attaching executable files (.exe, .bat, .sh) that, when executed on the server, can install malware or establish backdoors.",
      "**Office Documents with Macros:** Embedding malicious macros within Microsoft Office documents (.doc, .xls, .ppt) that execute arbitrary code when opened or if macros are enabled.",
      "**Archive Exploits (Zip Bombs):** Using highly compressed archive files (.zip, .tar.gz) that, when extracted, consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory, disk space), leading to denial of service.",
      "**Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Processing Libraries:** Crafting malicious files (e.g., image files, PDF documents) to exploit known vulnerabilities in the libraries used by the application to process these file types, potentially leading to remote code execution.",
      "**HTML Files with Malicious JavaScript:** Attaching HTML files containing embedded JavaScript that, when rendered by a vulnerable browser or processing engine, can execute malicious scripts.",
      "**Polymorphic Malware:** Utilizing malware that can change its code to evade signature-based detection.",
      "**File Inclusion Vulnerabilities:** Crafting filenames or content that, when processed by the application, could lead to the inclusion of arbitrary files from the server's file system."
    ],
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "**Lack of Attachment Scanning:** The application does not employ any form of malware scanning or antivirus checks on the received attachments.",
      "**Unsafe File Storage:** Attachments are stored in a location accessible by the web server without proper access controls, allowing potential execution of malicious code.",
      "**Direct Execution of Attachments:** The application attempts to directly execute attachments based on their file extension or content type without proper sandboxing or isolation.",
      "**Vulnerable Processing Libraries:** The application relies on outdated or vulnerable libraries for processing attachments (e.g., image processing, PDF parsing).",
      "**Insufficient Input Validation:** Lack of validation on attachment metadata (filename, content-type) can be exploited to bypass security measures or trigger unexpected behavior.",
      "**Missing Resource Limits:** The application does not enforce limits on the size or number of attachments processed, making it vulnerable to zip bomb attacks.",
      "**Lack of Sandboxing:** Attachment processing occurs within the main application environment, allowing malicious code to directly compromise the server.",
      "**Inadequate Logging and Monitoring:** Insufficient logging of attachment processing activities hinders the ability to detect and respond to malicious activity.",
      "**Trusting Postal's Data Implicitly:** While Postal is a reputable service, the application should not inherently trust all data received through its webhooks."
    ],
    "impactBreakdown": {
      "malwareInfection": "Successful execution of malicious attachments can lead to the installation of malware on the application server. This malware could establish backdoors, steal credentials, or disrupt services.",
      "dataExfiltration": "Malicious attachments could be designed to exfiltrate sensitive data from the application server by accessing and uploading files or establishing communication channels with external servers.",
      "denialOfService": "Exploiting vulnerabilities in attachment processing libraries or using resource-intensive attachments (zip bombs) can lead to CPU exhaustion, memory exhaustion, or disk space exhaustion, causing application crashes and service disruption."

  "mitigationStrategies": [
    {
      "strategy": "**Implement Robust Attachment Scanning:**",
      "details": "Integrate a reputable antivirus or malware scanning solution (e.g., ClamAV, VirusTotal API) to scan all incoming attachments before any further processing. Ensure regular updates to the scanning definitions. Consider sandboxed scanning for enhanced security."
    },
    {
      "strategy": "**Secure Attachment Storage and Handling:**",
      "details": "Store attachments in a dedicated, isolated directory with restricted access permissions. Prevent direct execution of files from this directory by the web server. Rename attachments upon receipt to prevent potential execution based on the original filename. Verify the declared content-type against the actual content using magic number analysis."
    },
    {
      "strategy": "**Secure Processing Practices:**",
      "details": "Avoid directly executing attachments based on their file extension. If processing is necessary, perform it within a secure, isolated sandbox environment (e.g., using containers or virtual machines). Apply the principle of least privilege to processes handling attachments. Consider user-initiated processing instead of automatic processing where feasible."
    },
    {
      "strategy": "**Input Validation and Sanitization:**",
      "details": "Sanitize attachment filenames to remove potentially dangerous characters or escape sequences. Implement content-type whitelisting, only allowing processing of specific, expected attachment types. Reject or quarantine attachments with unexpected or suspicious content types. Enforce strict limits on the maximum size of attachments."
    },
    {
      "strategy": "**Secure Libraries and Dependencies:**",
      "details": "Keep all libraries used for attachment processing (e.g., image processing, PDF parsing) up-to-date with the latest security patches. Regularly audit and assess these libraries for known vulnerabilities. Consider using alternative, more secure libraries if necessary."
    },
    {
      "strategy": "**Resource Limits and Rate Limiting:**",
      "details": "Implement resource limits on CPU, memory, and disk space usage for attachment processing tasks to prevent denial-of-service attacks. Implement rate limiting on the inbound webhook endpoint to prevent attackers from overwhelming the system with malicious attachments."
    },
    {
      "strategy": "**Security Headers and Content Security Policy (CSP):**",
      "details": "Configure appropriate security headers (e.g., `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Strict-Transport-Security`) to mitigate certain types of attacks. If the application renders any content related to attachments, implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent the execution of malicious scripts."
    },
    {
      "strategy": "**Logging and Monitoring:**",
      "details": "Implement comprehensive logging of all activities related to inbound webhooks and attachment processing, including timestamps, filenames, content types, scan results, and any errors. Implement real-time monitoring of these logs for suspicious patterns or anomalies. Set up alerts for critical events, such as failed malware scans or processing errors."
    },
    {
      "strategy": "**Postal Integration Security:**",
      "details": "If Postal provides a mechanism for signing webhook requests, implement verification to ensure the requests are genuinely from Postal and haven't been tampered with. Regularly review Postal's security documentation and best practices for handling inbound webhooks."
    },
    {
      "strategy": "**Developer Training and Awareness:**",
      "details": "Educate developers about the risks associated with processing untrusted data and the importance of secure coding practices when handling attachments from external sources."
