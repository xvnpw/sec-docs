## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Postal [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_postal__critical_node_.md)

**Compromise Application via Postal:** This is the ultimate attacker goal. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application through weaknesses in or related to the Postal email server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Postal Software [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_postal_software__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Vulnerabilities in Postal Software:** This represents a direct attack on the Postal software itself. Success at this node allows the attacker to bypass intended security controls and potentially gain administrative access or execute arbitrary code on the Postal server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_start_.md)

**Exploit Known Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Unpatched Security Flaws -> Identify and exploit CVEs in Postal version:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific version of Postal being used. They then leverage existing exploit code or develop their own to target these weaknesses.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to various outcomes, including remote code execution, privilege escalation, or data breaches on the Postal server. This, in turn, can be used to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unpatched Security Flaws [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unpatched_security_flaws__high_risk_path_.md)

**Exploit Known Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Unpatched Security Flaws -> Identify and exploit CVEs in Postal version:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific version of Postal being used. They then leverage existing exploit code or develop their own to target these weaknesses.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to various outcomes, including remote code execution, privilege escalation, or data breaches on the Postal server. This, in turn, can be used to compromise the application.

**Exploit Known Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Default Credentials or Weak Configurations -> Access admin panel using default credentials:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in to the Postal administration panel using common default credentials (e.g., `admin/password`) or easily guessable passwords.
    *   **Impact:** Gaining access to the admin panel provides full control over the Postal server, allowing attackers to manipulate settings, view emails, and potentially further compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access admin panel using default credentials [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/access_admin_panel_using_default_credentials__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Access admin panel using default credentials:** This is a highly critical node because it represents a very simple and direct attack vector. If default credentials are not changed, an attacker can easily gain full administrative control over the Postal server.

**Exploit Known Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Default Credentials or Weak Configurations -> Access admin panel using default credentials:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in to the Postal administration panel using common default credentials (e.g., `admin/password`) or easily guessable passwords.
    *   **Impact:** Gaining access to the admin panel provides full control over the Postal server, allowing attackers to manipulate settings, view emails, and potentially further compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Application's Interaction with Postal [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_application's_interaction_with_postal__critical_node__high_risk_path_start_.md)

**Abuse Application's Interaction with Postal:** This critical node highlights vulnerabilities in how the application integrates with and uses the Postal service. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses to manipulate email sending, potentially impacting the application's functionality or security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure API Usage (Application Side) [HIGH RISK PATH START, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_api_usage__application_side___high_risk_path_start__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Insecure API Usage (Application Side):** This critical node focuses on how the application interacts with Postal's API. Weaknesses in how the application uses the API, such as improper authentication or lack of input validation, can be exploited to compromise the application.

**Abuse Application's Interaction with Postal -> Exploit Insecure API Usage (Application Side) -> API Key Compromise -> Steal or guess API keys used by the application:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to discover or guess the API keys used by the application to authenticate with Postal. This could involve techniques like:
        *   Analyzing the application's codebase or configuration files.
        *   Intercepting network traffic between the application and Postal.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application stores or manages API keys.
