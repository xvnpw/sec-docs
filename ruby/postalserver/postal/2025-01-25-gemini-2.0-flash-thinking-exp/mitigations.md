# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for postalserver/postal

## Mitigation Strategy: [Change Default Credentials](./mitigation_strategies/change_default_credentials.md)

### 1. Change Default Credentials

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Change Default Credentials
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access Postal Configuration:** Locate Postal's configuration files (e.g., `postal.yml`, environment variables) or access the Postal web interface if default credentials still allow login.
    2.  **Identify Default Accounts:** Pinpoint default usernames and passwords for:
        *   Postal web interface administrator account (check Postal documentation for defaults).
        *   Default SMTP user accounts (if any are pre-configured in Postal).
        *   Potentially database credentials if default settings were used during Postal installation (though less common in production).
    3.  **Generate Strong Passwords:** Create strong, unique passwords for each identified account. Use a password manager for secure generation and storage.
    4.  **Update Postal Configuration:** Modify Postal's configuration files or use the web interface to replace all default credentials with the newly generated strong passwords. Ensure these changes are persisted.
    5.  **Verify Login:** Test logging in to the Postal web interface and SMTP authentication using the new credentials to confirm the changes are effective.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Default Credential Exploitation (High Severity):** Attackers exploiting well-known default credentials to gain immediate administrative access to Postal, leading to full control, data breaches, and email abuse.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Default Credential Exploitation:** High risk reduction. Directly eliminates the vulnerability of easily guessable default credentials in Postal.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Web interface password was changed, but SMTP user default passwords and database default password (if applicable) might still exist.

### 13. Implement Feedback Loops (FBLs) with Postal

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Feedback Loops (FBLs) with Postal
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify FBL Programs:** Identify major email providers (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo, Microsoft) that offer feedback loop (FBL) programs. FBLs provide reports of spam complaints from recipients.
    2.  **Register Postal Sending Domains for FBLs:** Register your sending domains used with Postal for FBL programs with relevant email providers. This typically involves verifying domain ownership and configuring reporting endpoints.
    3.  **Configure Postal to Process FBL Reports:** Configure Postal to receive and process FBL reports from email providers. Postal might have built-in features for FBL integration or require custom configuration to handle FBL data.
    4.  **Monitor FBL Data within Postal:** Monitor the FBL data received by Postal. Analyze spam complaint rates and identify users or sending patterns that are generating complaints.
    5.  **Take Action Based on FBL Data:** Based on FBL data analysis, take appropriate actions to address spam complaints. This might include:
        *   Investigating and addressing the root cause of spam complaints (e.g., issues with email content, sending practices, user behavior).
        *   Suspending or disabling accounts generating high spam complaint rates.
        *   Improving email sending practices to reduce spam complaints.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Damage to Sending Reputation due to Spam Complaints via Postal (Medium to High Severity):** High spam complaint rates can negatively impact your sending domain and IP reputation, leading to deliverability issues and blacklisting. FBLs help identify and address the sources of spam complaints.
    *   **Undetected Spamming Activity via Postal (Medium Severity):** Without FBLs, you might be unaware of spam complaints generated by your email sending through Postal, hindering your ability to address abuse and maintain a good sending reputation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Damage to Sending Reputation due to Spam Complaints via Postal:** Medium to High risk reduction. FBLs help proactively manage sending reputation by identifying and addressing spam complaints.
    *   **Undetected Spamming Activity via Postal:** Medium risk reduction. Provides visibility into spam complaints, enabling detection and mitigation of spamming activity.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. FBL programs are likely not registered, and Postal is not configured to process FBL reports.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Register sending domains for FBL programs with major email providers. Configure Postal to receive and process FBL reports. Implement monitoring and analysis of FBL data within Postal and establish a process for acting on FBL feedback.
