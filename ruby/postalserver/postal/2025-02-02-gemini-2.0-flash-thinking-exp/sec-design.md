# BUSINESS POSTURE

Postal is a self-hosted mail server solution designed for developers and businesses who require a robust and feature-rich platform for sending and receiving emails. The primary business goal is to provide an alternative to cloud-based email sending services, offering greater control, privacy, and potentially cost-effectiveness for users who prefer to manage their own email infrastructure.

Business priorities include:
- Reliability and stability of the mail server to ensure consistent email delivery.
- Feature completeness to meet the diverse needs of users, including SMTP, web interface, API, and management tools.
- Performance and scalability to handle varying email volumes.
- Security to protect user data and prevent misuse of the mail server.
- Ease of deployment and management to lower the barrier to entry for self-hosting.

Most important business risks:
- Data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive email data.
- Service disruption due to misconfiguration, attacks, or infrastructure failures, leading to email delivery issues and business impact.
- Reputation damage if the mail server is used for spam or malicious activities due to inadequate security controls.
- Compliance violations if data privacy regulations are not met.
- Complexity of self-hosting and management leading to user dissatisfaction and churn.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: HTTPS for web interface and API access (standard practice for web applications).
- security control: Authentication and authorization for web interface and API access (user accounts, roles, permissions).
- security control: Input validation on web interface and API endpoints to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
- security control: Rate limiting to mitigate brute-force attacks and abuse.
- security control: Regular software updates to patch vulnerabilities in dependencies and the Postal application itself.
- security control: Configuration options for TLS/SSL settings for SMTP and other protocols.
- security control: DKIM, SPF, and DMARC support to improve email deliverability and prevent spoofing.
- security control: Security scanning of dependencies (likely through standard dependency management tools).
- accepted risk: Reliance on underlying operating system and infrastructure security.
- accepted risk: Security configuration is the responsibility of the user/administrator.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implement a robust logging and monitoring system for security events.
- security control: Provide security hardening guidelines for deployment environments.
- security control: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access to the web interface and API.
- security control: Regularly review and update security configurations based on best practices and threat landscape.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: Secure authentication mechanisms for web interface users (passwords, potentially SSO).
    - requirement: API authentication (API keys, tokens).
    - requirement: SMTP authentication (username/password, SASL).
- Authorization:
    - requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) for web interface and API to manage permissions.
    - requirement: Authorization checks at all critical access points in the application.
    - requirement: Principle of least privilege applied to user roles and system components.
- Input validation:
    - requirement: Comprehensive input validation for all user-supplied data across web interface, API, and SMTP.
    - requirement: Protection against common injection attacks (SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting).
    - requirement: Input sanitization and encoding to prevent output encoding vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: Use of strong encryption algorithms for sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    - requirement: Secure storage of cryptographic keys and secrets.
    - requirement: Proper implementation of TLS/SSL for all network communication.
    - requirement: Hashing of passwords using strong one-way hash functions with salt.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Email sending and receiving: Ensuring reliable and secure email communication for users and applications.
- System availability and integrity: Maintaining the operational status and correct functioning of the Postal system.
- Data confidentiality and privacy: Protecting sensitive email content and user data from unauthorized access and disclosure.
- Reputation: Preventing misuse of the mail server for spam or malicious activities that could damage the reputation of the Postal system and its users.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Email content: Highly sensitive, contains personal and business communications. Requires confidentiality and integrity.
- User credentials (passwords, API keys): Highly sensitive, used for authentication and authorization. Requires confidentiality and integrity.
- Configuration data: Sensitive, contains settings that could impact security and functionality. Requires integrity and confidentiality.
- Logs: Potentially sensitive, may contain user activity and system events. Requires integrity and confidentiality.
- Email queues: Potentially sensitive, may contain email content in transit. Requires integrity and confidentiality.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the expected scale of deployment (number of users, email volume)?
- What are the specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)?
- What is the organization's risk appetite?
- Are there any existing security policies or standards that need to be followed?
- What is the budget and timeline for implementing security controls?
- What are the preferred technologies for security controls (e.g., specific SAST/DAST tools, SIEM system)?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a secure and reliable self-hosted mail server solution. Security and reliability are high priorities.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Basic security controls are assumed to be in place (HTTPS, authentication, input validation). There is a need to enhance security posture with more proactive and automated security measures.
- DESIGN: A containerized deployment using Docker Compose on a single server is a reasonable starting point for design consideration. The system is composed of standard components for a mail server (web interface, API, SMTP server, message queue, database). The build process can be automated using CI/CD pipelines like GitHub Actions.
