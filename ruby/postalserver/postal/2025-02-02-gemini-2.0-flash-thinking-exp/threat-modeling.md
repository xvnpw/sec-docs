    *   Full control over Postal server configuration.
    *   Access to all emails stored in Postal.
    *   Ability to create/delete domains and users.
    *   Potential for data breaches, denial of service, and reputational damage.
*   **Postal Component Affected:** Postal Web Interface (specifically authentication modules)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Postal to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement strong input validation and output encoding to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Enforce strong password policies for web interface users.
    *   Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for web interface access if available or implementable.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the web interface.

## Threat: [API Key Compromise](./threats/api_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains a valid Postal API key through various means (e.g., insecure storage, exposed logs, network interception, social engineering). They then use this key to access the Postal API and perform actions as an authorized user.

    *   Unauthorized sending of emails (spam, phishing).
    *   Access to email logs and metadata.
    *   Modification or deletion of email sending configurations.
    *   Potential for reputational damage and service disruption.
*   **Postal Component Affected:** Postal API, API Key Management
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store API keys securely (e.g., using environment variables, secrets management systems, encrypted storage).
    *   Rotate API keys regularly.
    *   Implement API key access control and restrict permissions based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity.
    *   Avoid embedding API keys directly in client-side code or public repositories.
    *   Use HTTPS for all API communication to prevent interception.

## Threat: [Email Data Breach via Database Access](./threats/email_data_breach_via_database_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the database used by Postal to store emails (e.g., through SQL injection, database misconfiguration, compromised database credentials). They then exfiltrate sensitive email content and attachments.

*   **Description:** Postal's SMTP server is not properly configured to enforce TLS/STARTTLS encryption for email communication. Attackers perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack to intercept unencrypted email traffic between Postal and other mail servers or clients, capturing email content and credentials.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive email content in transit.
    *   Compromise of email account credentials if transmitted unencrypted.
    *   Loss of confidentiality and potential data breaches.
*   **Postal Component Affected:** Postal SMTP Server, TLS/STARTTLS Configuration
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce TLS/STARTTLS for all SMTP connections (both incoming and outgoing).
    *   Use strong TLS cipher suites and disable weak or outdated ones.
    *   Ensure valid and properly configured TLS certificates are used.
    *   Regularly check SMTP server configuration for TLS/STARTTLS enforcement.
    *   Educate users to only connect to Postal using secure SMTP protocols (STARTTLS).
