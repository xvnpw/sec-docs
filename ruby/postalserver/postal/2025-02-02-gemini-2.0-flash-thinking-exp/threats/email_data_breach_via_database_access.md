### 4. Deep Analysis of Email Data Breach via Database Access

#### 4.1. Threat Description Breakdown

The "Email Data Breach via Database Access" threat describes a scenario where an attacker successfully gains unauthorized access to the database used by Postal to store email data. This access allows the attacker to exfiltrate sensitive information, including email content, attachments, sender/recipient details, and potentially user credentials or other metadata stored in the database.

**Attacker Motivation:** The primary motivation for an attacker in this scenario is likely **data theft** for various purposes, including:

*   **Financial Gain:** Selling stolen data on the dark web, using it for phishing campaigns, or extortion.
*   **Espionage:**  Gaining access to confidential business communications, intellectual property, or personal information for competitive advantage or nation-state level espionage.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Leaking sensitive emails publicly to harm the organization's reputation or cause embarrassment.
*   **Disruption:**  Deleting or modifying email data to disrupt operations or cause data loss (though data exfiltration is the primary focus of this threat).

**Attack Stages:**  The attack can be broken down into the following stages:

1.  **Reconnaissance:** The attacker gathers information about the target application (Postal instance), its infrastructure, and potential vulnerabilities. This might involve port scanning, vulnerability scanning, and analyzing publicly available information about Postal.
2.  **Vulnerability Exploitation:** The attacker identifies and exploits a vulnerability that allows them to gain unauthorized access to the database. This could be through:
    *   **SQL Injection:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Postal's code that allow execution of malicious SQL queries.
    *   **Database Misconfiguration:** Exploiting insecure database configurations such as default credentials, publicly exposed database ports, or weak access controls.
    *   **Credential Compromise:** Obtaining valid database credentials through phishing, brute-force attacks, or insider threats.
    *   **Operating System/Network Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system or network infrastructure to gain access to the database server.
3.  **Database Access and Exfiltration:** Once access is gained, the attacker navigates the database, identifies tables containing email data, and exfiltrates the sensitive information. This might involve using database management tools or custom scripts to dump data.
4.  **Post-Exploitation (Optional):**  The attacker might attempt to maintain persistence for future access, cover their tracks by deleting logs, or further compromise the system.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors

Several attack vectors could lead to unauthorized database access in a Postal deployment:

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   If Postal's codebase contains vulnerabilities that allow for SQL injection, attackers could craft malicious SQL queries through input fields or API endpoints.
    *   Successful SQL injection could bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms, granting direct access to the database.
    *   Even read-only SQL injection can be devastating for data exfiltration.
*   **Database Misconfiguration:**
    *   **Default Credentials:** Using default database credentials (username/password) is a critical vulnerability.
    *   **Publicly Exposed Database Port:**  If the database port (e.g., 5432 for PostgreSQL, 3306 for MySQL) is directly exposed to the internet without proper firewall rules, attackers can attempt to connect directly.
    *   **Weak Access Controls:**  Insufficiently restrictive firewall rules or database access controls that allow unauthorized network access to the database server.
    *   **Unnecessary Services Enabled:** Running unnecessary database services or features that increase the attack surface.
*   **Compromised Database Credentials:**
    *   **Weak Passwords:** Using weak or easily guessable database passwords.
    *   **Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force:**  Attempting to guess database credentials through automated attacks.
