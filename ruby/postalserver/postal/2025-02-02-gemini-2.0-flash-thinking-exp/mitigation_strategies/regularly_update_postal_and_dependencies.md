    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **High**. Regular updates are the primary defense against known Postal vulnerabilities.  Prompt patching significantly reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Impact:** **High Risk Reduction**.  Successfully implemented, this strategy drastically reduces the risk of attackers exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in Postal itself.

*   **Exploitation of Dependency Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity):**
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **Medium to High**.  Updating dependencies is crucial, but effectiveness depends on the comprehensiveness of dependency management and testing.  Compatibility issues can sometimes delay dependency updates.
    *   **Impact:** **Medium to High Risk Reduction**.  Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure and libraries used by Postal.  The impact is slightly less direct than patching Postal itself, but still critical.

#### 4.3. Current Implementation Analysis

*   **Currently Implemented:**  The team has *a process* for updating Postal and dependencies, indicating some level of awareness and effort. However, the process is described as "not strictly scheduled" and "not as prompt as it should be," especially for security updates. Dependency updates are performed but lack coordination with Postal updates.
*   **Missing Implementation:** The key missing elements are:
    *   **Rigorous Schedule:** Lack of a defined and enforced schedule for both Postal and dependency updates, particularly for security patches.
    *   **Promptness:**  Insufficient speed in applying security updates after they are available.
    *   **Coordination:**  Lack of coordinated updates between Postal and its dependencies, potentially leading to compatibility issues or missed vulnerabilities.
    *   **Formalized Monitoring:**  Potentially informal or ad-hoc monitoring of Postal releases and security advisories.
