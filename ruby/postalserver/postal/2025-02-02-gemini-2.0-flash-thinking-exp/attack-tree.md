## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Postal Web Interface Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_postal_web_interface_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The web interface of Postal is a primary entry point for attackers. It exposes administrative functionalities and configuration options. Vulnerabilities here can lead to full control over the Postal instance and the application using it.
*   **Specific Attack Types:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Exploit Authentication Flaws [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Weak Password Policy:** If Postal allows weak passwords, attackers can use brute-force or dictionary attacks to gain access.
            *   **Session Hijacking:** If session management is flawed, attackers can steal or predict session tokens to impersonate legitimate users.
            *   **2FA Bypass (if implemented poorly):** If two-factor authentication is in place but has implementation flaws, attackers might find ways to bypass it.
    *   **Authorization Bypass [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Elevate Privileges [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Exploiting flaws in role-based access control (RBAC) to gain higher privileges than intended. This could involve manipulating user roles, exploiting missing authorization checks, or finding loopholes in the RBAC logic.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Stored XSS [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code that is stored within Postal (e.g., in email content, templates, settings) and executed when other users view the affected data.
        *   **Reflected XSS [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into URLs or form inputs that is immediately reflected back to the user's browser without proper sanitization, leading to script execution.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Modify Postal settings, create admin users, send emails [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Tricking a logged-in administrator into unknowingly performing actions by submitting malicious requests from a different website or application. This can be used to change configurations, create new admin accounts, or send unauthorized emails.
    *   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Access or modify resources of other users/organizations [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Exploiting predictable or guessable resource identifiers (like IDs in URLs) to access or modify resources belonging to other users or organizations without proper authorization checks.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Web Interface [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Application-level DoS [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Overwhelming the web server with a large number of requests, causing it to become unresponsive and denying service to legitimate users.
        *   **Resource exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Exploiting inefficient web endpoints or functionalities to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth), leading to service degradation or failure.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Postal Service Vulnerabilities (SMTP, IMAP, POP3) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_postal_service_vulnerabilities__smtp__imap__pop3___critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Postal provides email services through SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 protocols. Vulnerabilities in the implementation or configuration of these services can be exploited to compromise the application.
*   **Specific Attack Types:**
    *   **SMTP Protocol Exploits [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **SMTP Relay Abuse [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** If Postal is misconfigured as an open relay, attackers can use it to send spam or phishing emails, damaging the reputation of the application and Postal server.
        *   **Authentication Weaknesses in SMTP [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Weak Password Policies:** Similar to web interface, weak passwords for SMTP accounts can be brute-forced.
            *   **Insecure Authentication Mechanisms:** Using outdated or insecure authentication methods for SMTP can make it easier for attackers to intercept credentials.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via SMTP [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Flooding SMTP service [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Overwhelming the SMTP service with a flood of connection requests or invalid commands, causing it to become unresponsive and disrupting email sending and receiving.
    *   **IMAP/POP3 Protocol Exploits [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Authentication Weaknesses in IMAP/POP3 [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Brute-force or dictionary attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Attempting to guess user credentials for IMAP/POP3 accounts to gain access to emails.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via IMAP/POP3 [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Flooding IMAP/POP3 service [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Overwhelming the IMAP/POP3 service with connection requests or invalid commands, disrupting email access.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Postal Configuration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_postal_configuration_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Misconfigurations during deployment or insecure default settings can create significant vulnerabilities.
*   **Specific Attack Types:**
    *   **Misconfiguration by Application Deployer [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Exposing configuration files [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Accidentally making configuration files (like `.env` files containing secrets) publicly accessible through web server misconfiguration or incorrect permissions.
        *   **Incorrectly configured network access controls [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Opening up admin ports or services to the public internet due to firewall or network configuration errors.
        *   **Running Postal with insufficient resource limits [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Deploying Postal with inadequate resources, making it vulnerable to resource exhaustion DoS attacks.
    *   **Lack of Security Updates [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Running outdated Postal version [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Failing to apply security updates to Postal itself, leaving known vulnerabilities exploitable.
