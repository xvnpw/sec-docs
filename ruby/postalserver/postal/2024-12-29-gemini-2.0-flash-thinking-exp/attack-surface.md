Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Postal, with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Open Relay Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** An SMTP server configured as an open relay allows anyone on the internet to send emails through it.
    *   **Postal's Contribution:** As a full-fledged SMTP server, Postal inherently provides the functionality that, if misconfigured, can lead to an open relay.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses your Postal instance to send spam or phishing emails, potentially leading to your server being blacklisted.
    *   **Impact:** Server blacklisting, reputation damage, resource abuse, potential legal repercussions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:**  Strictly configure relaying restrictions within Postal. Only allow authenticated users or specific networks to relay emails. Regularly review and audit relay settings.

*   **Attack Surface:** SMTP Header Injection
    *   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate email headers by injecting arbitrary content, potentially leading to spoofing or bypassing security measures.
    *   **Postal's Contribution:** Postal's handling of email composition and processing could have vulnerabilities if it doesn't properly sanitize or validate header information.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a `bcc:` header to secretly send copies of emails to unintended recipients or spoofs the `From:` address to impersonate someone else.
    *   **Impact:** Email spoofing, phishing attacks, information disclosure, bypassing spam filters.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all email header fields. Use libraries that automatically handle header encoding and escaping. Avoid directly constructing headers from user-provided input.

*   **Attack Surface:** Web Interface Authentication and Authorization Flaws
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Postal authenticates users or controls access to different features within its web interface.
    *   **Postal's Contribution:** Postal provides a web interface for managing its functionalities. Flaws in its authentication or authorization mechanisms are direct vulnerabilities introduced by Postal.
    *   **Example:** An attacker bypasses the login process or exploits a privilege escalation vulnerability to gain administrative access to Postal.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the email server, access to sensitive data (emails, configurations), ability to send and receive emails on behalf of others.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication). Enforce principle of least privilege for user roles. Regularly audit and test authentication and authorization logic. Protect against common web vulnerabilities like brute-force attacks.
        *   **Users:** Use strong, unique passwords for all Postal accounts. Enable multi-factor authentication if available.

*   **Attack Surface:** Message Queue Access Control Issues
    *   **Description:** If the message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ) used by Postal is not properly secured, unauthorized access could lead to manipulation of email flow.
    *   **Postal's Contribution:** Postal relies on a message queue for asynchronous processing of emails. Misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in the queue's security directly impact Postal's security.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the message queue and can read email content, inject malicious emails, or disrupt the delivery process.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, integrity compromise of emails, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Secure the message queue with strong authentication and authorization. Restrict access to only necessary Postal components. Use encrypted connections for communication with the message queue. Regularly update the message queue software.

*   **Attack Surface:** API Endpoint Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Security flaws in Postal's API endpoints that allow unauthorized access or manipulation of data.
    *   **Postal's Contribution:** Postal likely exposes an API for programmatic interaction. Vulnerabilities in these endpoints are specific to Postal's implementation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits an API endpoint to retrieve sensitive information about users or domains without proper authorization, or uses an insecure endpoint to modify server settings.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modifications, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust authentication and authorization for all API endpoints. Validate all input data. Protect against common API vulnerabilities like injection attacks and broken object-level authorization. Enforce rate limiting to prevent abuse.

*   **Attack Surface:** Command Injection via Administrative Interface
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the web interface where user-supplied input is used to execute system commands without proper sanitization.
    *   **Postal's Contribution:** If Postal's administrative interface allows users to input data that is then used in system commands, it introduces this risk.
    *   **Example:** An administrator enters a malicious string in a domain configuration field that gets executed as a system command, allowing the attacker to gain shell access.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Never directly use user input in system commands. If necessary, use parameterized commands or secure libraries that prevent command injection. Implement strict input validation and sanitization.
