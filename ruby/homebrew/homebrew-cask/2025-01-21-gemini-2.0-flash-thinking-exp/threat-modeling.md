# Threat Model Analysis for homebrew/homebrew-cask

## Threat: [Malicious Cask Definition](./threats/malicious_cask_definition.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a seemingly legitimate Cask definition that, upon installation, executes malicious code. This could involve downloading and installing malware, modifying system configurations, or exfiltrating data. The attacker might distribute this malicious Cask through a compromised third-party tap or by tricking users into adding a malicious tap.
    *   **Impact:** System compromise, data breach, installation of unwanted software, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Cask` definition file (the Ruby file describing the application and installation process).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only use Casks from the official Homebrew Cask repository or well-established and trusted "taps".
        *   Implement a process to review Cask definitions before incorporating them into any automated installation process.
        *   Consider using checksum verification for downloaded files within the Cask definition to ensure integrity.
        *   Regularly update Homebrew and Homebrew Cask to benefit from security fixes and updated Cask definitions.

## Threat: [Compromised Cask Repository ("Tap")](./threats/compromised_cask_repository__tap_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of a third-party "tap" (a repository of Cask definitions). They can then inject malicious Cask definitions or modify existing ones to distribute malware or compromise systems when users install applications from that compromised tap.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread distribution of malware, compromise of multiple systems relying on the compromised tap.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Tap` (the Git repository hosting Cask definitions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and select third-party taps, considering their reputation, maintainership, and security practices.
        *   Monitor the activity and changes within used taps for suspicious or unexpected modifications.
        *   Consider mirroring or vendoring necessary Cask definitions to reduce reliance on external repositories.
        *   Implement a system to notify users if a tap they are using is known to be compromised.

## Threat: [Malicious Installation Scripts within Casks](./threats/malicious_installation_scripts_within_casks.md)

*   **Description:** Cask definitions can include arbitrary installation scripts (e.g., shell scripts) that are executed during the installation process. An attacker could craft a Cask with scripts that perform harmful actions beyond simply installing the intended application, such as modifying system files, installing backdoors, or stealing credentials.
    *   **Impact:** System compromise, privilege escalation, data theft, persistent malware installation.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Installer` module within `brew-cask` and the embedded scripts within the `Cask` definition.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review the installation scripts within Cask definitions before using them, especially for Casks from third-party taps.
        *   Implement security policies that restrict the execution of arbitrary scripts during the installation process where possible.
        *   Consider using tools that analyze Cask definitions for potentially malicious or suspicious scripts.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation during Installation](./threats/privilege_escalation_during_installation.md)

*   **Description:** The installation process initiated by Homebrew Cask often requires elevated privileges (e.g., `sudo`). A vulnerability in Homebrew Cask itself or a malicious Cask definition could exploit this requirement to gain unauthorized root access or perform actions with elevated privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive data and system resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core `brew-cask` executable and the `Installer` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Homebrew and Homebrew Cask updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Minimize the need for `sudo` during the application's runtime after installation.
        *   Implement robust access control mechanisms on the system to limit the impact of potential privilege escalation.

## Threat: [Compromised Download Sources](./threats/compromised_download_sources.md)

*   **Description:** Even with a legitimate Cask definition, the download URL specified in the Cask could be compromised, leading to the download of a malicious file instead of the intended application. This could happen if the upstream application's download server is compromised.
    *   **Impact:** Installation of malware, even when using a seemingly legitimate Cask definition.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Download` functionality within `brew-cask` and the `url` attribute within the `Cask` definition.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded files using checksums or signatures provided in the Cask definition or by the upstream developer.
        *   Prefer Casks that use HTTPS for download URLs to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded file during transit.
