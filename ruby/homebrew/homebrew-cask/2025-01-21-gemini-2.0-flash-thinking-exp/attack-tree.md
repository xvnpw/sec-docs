## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Cask Formula](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_cask_formula.md)

**Description:** Attackers identify and exploit weaknesses within the Cask formula itself. This could involve flaws in the logic, insecure handling of URLs, or missing security checks.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution during the installation process with the privileges of the user running the `brew install` command.

**Mitigation:**
*   Implement rigorous code review processes for all contributions to Homebrew Cask.
*   Utilize automated static analysis tools to scan for potential vulnerabilities in formulas.
*   Enforce secure coding guidelines for formula creation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Upstream Source of Formula](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_upstream_source_of_formula.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the source repository where Cask formulas are stored (e.g., the `homebrew-cask` GitHub repository).

**Impact:** This allows attackers to directly modify formulas, injecting malicious code that will be distributed to all users installing applications using those compromised formulas. This is a severe supply chain attack.

**Mitigation:**
*   Implement strong access controls and multi-factor authentication for all maintainers with write access.
*   Regularly audit access logs and monitor for suspicious activity on the repository.
*   Enforce code signing for formula updates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise CDN or Hosting Provider of the Application](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_cdn_or_hosting_provider_of_the_application.md)

**Description:** Attackers compromise the Content Delivery Network (CDN) or the hosting infrastructure where the application's installation files (DMGs, PKGs, etc.) are stored.

**Impact:** Attackers can replace legitimate application files with malicious ones, leading users to unknowingly install compromised software. This is another critical supply chain attack.

**Mitigation:**
*   Ensure strong security measures are in place for the application's CDN and hosting provider.
*   Utilize checksums and digital signatures to verify the integrity of downloaded artifacts *before* installation.
*   Implement monitoring and alerting for unauthorized changes to hosted files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Homebrew Cask's Infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_homebrew_cask's_infrastructure.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the servers, repositories, or systems that make up the Homebrew Cask infrastructure itself.

**Impact:** This is the most severe compromise, potentially allowing attackers to modify Cask formulas, the Homebrew Cask tool itself, or redirect downloads, affecting a vast number of users.

**Mitigation:**
*   Implement robust security measures for all Homebrew Cask infrastructure components.
*   Enforce multi-factor authentication for all administrators and developers.
*   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
*   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Downloaded Artifact](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_downloaded_artifact.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Identify Cask with Weak Download Verification:** Attackers analyze Cask formulas to find those that do not use HTTPS or lack strong checksums/signatures for verifying downloaded files.
*   **Intercept and Replace Downloaded Artifact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Download Connection:** Attackers intercept the network connection between the user and the download server, replacing the legitimate file with a malicious one. This is more feasible if the download uses HTTP instead of HTTPS or has weak TLS configurations.
    *   **[[Compromise CDN or Hosting Provider of the Application]]**: (Covered above as a Critical Node, but part of this High-Risk Path).
    *   **DNS Spoofing to Redirect Download:** Attackers manipulate DNS records to redirect the user's download request to a server hosting a malicious file.

**Impact:** Users unknowingly download and install a compromised application, potentially leading to malware infection, data theft, or system compromise.

**Mitigation:**
*   Enforce HTTPS for all download URLs in Cask formulas.
*   Mandate and verify strong checksums (SHA256 or higher) for all downloaded artifacts.
*   Encourage the use of digital signatures for application packages.
*   Educate users about the importance of verifying download sources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Privilege Escalation During Installation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_privilege_escalation_during_installation.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Identify Cask Requiring Elevated Privileges:** Attackers identify Cask formulas for applications that require `sudo` or installation in system directories, indicating the need for elevated privileges during installation.
*   **Inject Malicious Commands into Installation Process:**
    *   **Exploit vulnerabilities in the application's installer package (PKG):** Attackers exploit flaws in the application's installer package to inject and execute malicious commands with elevated privileges.
    *   **Manipulate environment variables used during installation:** Attackers manipulate environment variables that are used by the installer script, potentially leading to the execution of unintended commands with elevated privileges.
    *   **Exploit race conditions during installation:** Attackers exploit timing vulnerabilities during the installation process to execute malicious commands before security measures can be applied.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with root privileges, granting them full control over the system.

**Mitigation:**
*   Minimize the need for elevated privileges during application installation.
*   Carefully audit installation scripts and packages for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized command execution during privileged operations.
*   Consider using containerization or sandboxing to limit the impact of installation processes.
