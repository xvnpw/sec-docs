# Attack Surface Analysis for homebrew/homebrew-cask

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Cask Repositories (Taps)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_cask_repositories__taps_.md)

**Description:** Homebrew Cask relies on external Git repositories called "taps" to discover and download application definitions (Casks). If a tap is compromised, malicious Casks can be introduced.

**How Homebrew Cask Contributes:** Cask directly uses the information within these taps to locate and install applications. It inherently trusts the content of the taps added by the user.

**Example:** An attacker gains control of a popular third-party tap and adds a Cask for a widely used application that downloads and executes a cryptominer during installation. Users installing this application via the compromised tap unknowingly install the malware.

**Impact:**  Installation of malware, data theft, system compromise, unauthorized access.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Users:** Only add trusted and well-maintained taps. Verify the authenticity and reputation of tap maintainers. Regularly review added taps and remove any that are no longer needed or seem suspicious.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Cask Definitions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_cask_definitions.md)

**Description:** Even within legitimate taps, individual Cask definitions can be crafted to execute malicious code during the installation process.

**How Homebrew Cask Contributes:** Cask executes the instructions defined within the Cask file, including `install`, `uninstall`, and `postflight` stanzas, which can contain arbitrary shell commands.

**Example:** A seemingly legitimate Cask for a text editor includes a `postflight` script that downloads and executes a keylogger after the application is installed.

**Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary code with user privileges, data theft, system modification, installation of malware.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Users:** Carefully review Cask definitions before installation, especially the `install`, `uninstall`, and `postflight` stanzas. Be wary of Casks that download additional scripts or execute complex commands.

## Attack Surface: [Execution of Arbitrary Scripts During Installation](./attack_surfaces/execution_of_arbitrary_scripts_during_installation.md)

**Description:** Cask allows for the execution of arbitrary shell scripts during various stages of the installation process (e.g., `postflight`).

**How Homebrew Cask Contributes:** Cask directly executes these scripts with the user's privileges. A malicious Cask can leverage this to perform harmful actions.

**Example:** A Cask for a game includes a `postflight` script that modifies system configuration files to disable security features.

**Impact:**  System modification, privilege escalation, installation of malware, data manipulation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Users:** Carefully examine the `install`, `uninstall`, and `postflight` stanzas in Cask definitions before installation. Be wary of scripts that perform actions beyond simple application setup.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the Homebrew Cask Application Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_homebrew_cask_application_itself.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities within the `brew cask` command-line tool itself could be exploited.

**How Homebrew Cask Contributes:**  The `brew cask` tool is the entry point for interacting with Cask. Vulnerabilities in its code could allow for arbitrary code execution or other malicious actions.

**Example:** A command injection vulnerability exists in the `brew cask` tool. An attacker crafts a malicious Cask definition that, when processed by a vulnerable version of `brew cask`, executes arbitrary commands on the user's system.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Users:** Keep Homebrew and Homebrew Cask updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
