**Techniques:**

*   **Social Engineering Reviewers:**  Tricking reviewers into approving a malicious PR through social engineering tactics, such as impersonation, urgency, or appealing to trust.
*   **Subtle Malicious Code:**  Hiding malicious code in a way that is difficult to detect during a cursory code review, relying on reviewer fatigue or inattention.
*   **Timing Attacks:** Submitting malicious PRs during off-peak hours or when reviewers are less likely to be vigilant.
*   **Exploiting Reviewer Trust:**  Building trust with reviewers over time by contributing legitimate PRs, and then exploiting that trust to get a malicious PR merged.
*   **Compromised Reviewer Accounts:**  Compromising the accounts of reviewers to approve malicious PRs directly.

**Impact:**

*   **Successful injection of malicious casks:** Bypassing code review allows malicious casks to be merged into the repository, leading to malware distribution.
*   **Erosion of trust in the review process:** Successful bypass undermines the effectiveness of the code review process and reduces confidence in the security of the repository.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strengthen Code Review Process:**

*   **Dependency Poisoning:** Modifying dependencies in existing casks to point to malicious or vulnerable versions.
*   **Backdooring Legitimate Applications:**  Replacing the legitimate application download with a backdoored version.

**Impact:**

*   **Widespread malware distribution:**  Modifying popular casks can lead to widespread malware distribution to users who update or reinstall them.
*   **Silent updates:** Users may unknowingly receive malicious updates without realizing their systems are compromised.
