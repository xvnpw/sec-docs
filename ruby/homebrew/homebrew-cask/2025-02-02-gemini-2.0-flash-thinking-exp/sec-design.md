# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Provide a user-friendly command-line interface for installing and managing macOS applications (packages distributed as binaries).
 - Simplify the installation process for macOS applications, making it consistent and automated.
 - Offer a wide range of applications available for installation through a centralized repository.
 - Maintain a reliable and stable system for application management.
- Business Risks:
 - Introduction of malicious software through compromised casks, leading to user system compromise.
 - Casks failing to install or uninstall correctly, causing system instability or data loss.
 - Availability and reliability of application download sources, impacting user experience.
 - Reputation damage due to security incidents or unreliable application management.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Checksums (SHA-256) for downloaded application binaries, implemented in cask formulae.
 - security control: Community review of cask formulae through pull requests on GitHub, described in the contribution guidelines.
 - security control: Homebrew infrastructure for hosting and distributing cask formulae, assumed to have standard security measures.
 - security control: Code signing of Homebrew Cask CLI tool, assumed to be standard practice for macOS applications.
- Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk: Reliance on external application vendors and their download sources, which may be compromised or unreliable.
 - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in application binaries themselves, which are outside the scope of Homebrew Cask to control.
 - accepted risk: Risk of malicious casks being introduced despite community review, due to human error or sophisticated attacks.
- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Automated vulnerability scanning of cask formulae for potential security issues (e.g., using linters or static analysis tools).
 - security control: Enhanced cask review process with dedicated security reviewers and checklists.
 - security control: Implement a system for reporting and quickly addressing malicious or vulnerable casks.
 - security control: User education and warnings about the risks of installing applications from untrusted sources, even through Homebrew Cask.
 - security control: Consider signing cask formulae themselves to ensure integrity and authenticity.
- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication: Not directly applicable to Homebrew Cask itself, as it relies on user's macOS user account for permissions.
 - Authorization: Homebrew Cask operates with user's permissions on macOS. Casks may require administrator privileges for installation, which is handled by macOS security prompts.
 - Input Validation: Cask formulae need robust validation to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior during parsing and execution. Validation should be performed on cask syntax, URLs, checksums, and installation scripts.
 - Cryptography: Checksums (SHA-256) are used for verifying downloaded application binaries. Consider using signatures for cask formulae to ensure authenticity and integrity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Application installation and management on macOS for users.
 - Maintaining the reputation and trustworthiness of Homebrew Cask as a reliable tool.
 - Ensuring the security and stability of user systems when using Homebrew Cask.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Integrity of user systems: High sensitivity. Malicious casks can compromise the entire system.
 - Availability of user systems: Medium sensitivity. Faulty casks can cause instability.
 - User data (indirectly): Low to Medium sensitivity. While Homebrew Cask doesn't directly handle user data, compromised applications installed through it could access user data. Cask formulae themselves are public data.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What is the detailed process for reviewing and approving new cask formulae and updates?
 - Are there any automated security scans performed on cask formulae or the Homebrew Cask CLI codebase?
 - Is there a formal incident response plan for handling reports of malicious or vulnerable casks?
 - How are checksums for application binaries generated and verified? Is this process documented and auditable?
 - Is there any mechanism for users to report potentially malicious casks or security vulnerabilities?
 - Are cask formulae signed to ensure their integrity and authenticity beyond community review?
 - What security measures are in place for the Homebrew Core infrastructure that hosts cask formulae?
- Assumptions:
 - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a convenient and reliable application management tool for macOS users, with a strong emphasis on community contributions and a balance between ease of use and security.
 - SECURITY POSTURE: Security relies heavily on community review and checksum verification. There is an awareness of supply chain risks associated with external application sources. Security controls are primarily focused on preventing malicious casks from being introduced.
 - DESIGN: Homebrew Cask is designed as an extension to Homebrew Core, leveraging its infrastructure and package management principles. The architecture is relatively simple, focused on downloading, verifying, and installing applications based on community-maintained formulae. Deployment is user-side on macOS systems. Build process is likely automated using CI/CD pipelines.
