# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for homebrew/homebrew-cask

## Mitigation Strategy: [Formula Auditing and Review](./mitigation_strategies/formula_auditing_and_review.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Formula Auditing and Review
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify the Cask Formula:** Before installing any cask using `brew install <cask_name>`, find the corresponding formula file by using `brew info <cask_name>` or browsing the `homebrew-cask` GitHub repository.
    2.  **Examine the Formula Content:** Open the formula file and carefully review:
        *   **`url` field:** Verify `https://` and reputable source.
        *   **`sha256` or `sha512` checksum fields:** Ensure checksums are present.
        *   **`appcast` field (if present):** Verify `https://` and legitimate update feed.
        *   **Source of the Formula (Tap):** Prefer official `homebrew-cask` tap or trusted community taps.
    3.  **Evaluate Trustworthiness:** Assess formula and application source based on URL, checksums, and tap source.
    4.  **Proceed with Installation (or not):** Install if safe, otherwise investigate or choose alternative.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Malicious Package Installation (High Severity)
    *   Compromised Application Download (Medium Severity)
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks during Download (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious Package Installation: High reduction
    *   Compromised Application Download: Medium reduction
    *   MitM Attacks during Download: Low to Medium reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented (manual developer action).
*   **Missing Implementation:** Systematically integrated process, automated tools for formula analysis.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Checksum Verification Enforcement](./mitigation_strategies/checksum_verification_enforcement.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Checksum Verification Enforcement
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Ensure Checksum Presence in Formulae:** Always include `sha256` or `sha512` checksums in cask formulae.
    2.  **Verify Checksum Verification is Enabled:** Ensure `homebrew-cask` checksum verification is active (default).
    3.  **Observe Verification Output:** Check for checksum verification messages during `brew install <cask_name>`.
    4.  **Handle Checksum Mismatches:** If mismatch occurs, **do not proceed**, investigate, and re-download or report.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Compromised Application Download (High Severity)
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks during Download (Medium Severity)
    *   Download Corruption (Low Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromised Application Download: High reduction
    *   MitM Attacks during Download: Medium reduction
    *   Download Corruption: High reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented by default in `homebrew-cask`.

    1.  **Prioritize HTTPS URLs in Formulae:** Choose casks with `https://` download URLs.
    2.  **Avoid HTTP URLs:**  Actively avoid casks using `http://` download links.
    3.  **Investigate HTTP Casks:** Check for HTTPS alternatives or updated casks.
    4.  **Consider Alternatives:** If no HTTPS option, download directly from official HTTPS website if available.
    5.  **Report HTTP Casks (Optional):** Suggest HTTPS update to cask maintainers.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks during Download (High Severity)
    *   Information Disclosure (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks during Download: High reduction
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented as best practice, not enforced by `homebrew-cask`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Enforcement in `homebrew-cask`, automated warnings for HTTP casks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Cask Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_cask_updates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Cask Updates
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Regular Update Schedule:** Update casks regularly (weekly/bi-weekly or more frequent for security updates).
    2.  **Use `brew upgrade --cask` Command:** Execute `brew upgrade --cask` to update all outdated casks.
    3.  **Review Update Output:** Check output for updated casks and failures. Investigate failures.
    4.  **Consider Automated Updates (with Caution):** Automate updates for less critical environments, test thoroughly after.
    5.  **Test After Updates:** Test applications after updates, especially in critical environments.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity)
