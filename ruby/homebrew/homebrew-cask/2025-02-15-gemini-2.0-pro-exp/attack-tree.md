## Attack Tree Path: [*[Execute Arbitrary Code on User's System]* (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/_execute_arbitrary_code_on_user's_system___critical_node_.md)

Description: This is the attacker's ultimate objective.  Successful execution of arbitrary code means the attacker gains control over the user's system, with the privileges of the user running the application. This allows for data theft, malware installation, further network exploitation, and other malicious activities.
Likelihood: Medium - While not trivial, various attack vectors exist that can lead to code execution.
Impact: Very High - Complete system compromise is possible.
Effort: Varies - Depends on the specific vulnerability exploited.
Skill Level: Varies - Depends on the complexity of the exploit.
Detection Difficulty: Varies - Depends on the sophistication of the attack and the security measures in place.

## Attack Tree Path: [{[Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Software]} (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/{_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_installed_software_}__high-risk_path_.md)

Description: This attack path focuses on leveraging vulnerabilities within the applications installed *through* Homebrew Cask.  It's not a direct attack on Homebrew Cask itself, but Cask is the delivery mechanism.  This is a high-risk path because software vulnerabilities are common, and exploiting them is often relatively straightforward.
Likelihood: High - Software vulnerabilities are frequently discovered.
Impact: High/Very High - Depends on the compromised application's functionality and privileges. A vulnerable web browser, for example, could lead to very high impact.
Effort: Low-Medium - Exploiting known vulnerabilities often requires minimal effort, especially if public exploits are available.
Skill Level: Intermediate-Advanced - Depends on the complexity of the vulnerability.  Using pre-built exploits requires less skill than developing a custom exploit.
Detection Difficulty: Medium-Hard - Relies on intrusion detection systems, vulnerability scanners, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.

## Attack Tree Path: [{[Known Vuln. in Installed App via Cask]} (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/{_known_vuln__in_installed_app_via_cask_}__high-risk_path_.md)

Description: This is the most likely and easiest sub-path within the "Exploit Vulnerabilities" branch.  The attacker targets a *publicly known* vulnerability in an application that was installed using Homebrew Cask.  The attacker relies on the user not having updated the vulnerable application to the latest, patched version.
Likelihood: High - Many users delay or neglect software updates.
Impact: High/Very High - Depends on the specific vulnerability and the compromised application.
Effort: Low - Public exploits are often readily available for known vulnerabilities.  The attacker may simply need to download and run a pre-built exploit.
Skill Level: Intermediate - Using pre-built exploits requires less skill than developing them from scratch.  The attacker needs to understand how to use the exploit, but not necessarily how it works internally.
Detection Difficulty: Medium - Signature-based detection (e.g., by antivirus software or intrusion detection systems) is often possible for known exploits.  However, attackers may use techniques to evade signature-based detection.
