# Threat Model Analysis for homebrew/homebrew-cask

## Threat: [Malicious Cask Upstream (Repository Compromise)](./threats/malicious_cask_upstream__repository_compromise_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the `homebrew-cask` GitHub repository (or a widely-used third-party tap's repository) and modifies existing cask definitions or adds new malicious ones.  The attacker could inject malicious code into the `installer` stanza, the `preflight`, `postflight`, or `uninstall` blocks of the cask definition, or they could modify the URL to point to a compromised download. The attacker might also tamper with the versioning or checksums to make the changes less noticeable.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code with the user's privileges during cask installation, upgrade, or uninstallation.  This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or installation of backdoors.
*   **Affected Component:** Primarily the `Cask` definition files within the repository (`.rb` files in the `Casks` directory), and potentially the download servers referenced by the casks. The `brew cask install`, `brew cask upgrade`, and `brew cask uninstall` commands are the execution points.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code Review (Homebrew Maintainers):**  Rigorous code review of all pull requests to the `homebrew-cask` repository is essential.
    *   **Two-Factor Authentication (Homebrew Maintainers):**  Enforce 2FA for all contributors with write access to the repository.
    *   **Checksum Verification (Users/Developers):**  While Homebrew does some checksumming, it's not a complete defense against a compromised repository.  If possible, independently verify the checksum of the downloaded artifact against a trusted source (if the software provider publishes one separately).
    *   **Pinned Versions (Users/Developers):**  Use specific, known-good versions of casks (`brew cask install <cask>@<version>`) instead of always installing the latest.  This reduces the window of exposure to newly introduced malicious code.  *Regularly review and update these pinned versions.*
    *   **Limited Tap Usage (Users/Developers):**  Avoid using third-party taps unless absolutely necessary and you fully trust the maintainer.  Stick to the official `homebrew/cask` tap whenever possible.
    *   **Security Monitoring (Homebrew Maintainers/Users/Developers):**  Monitor security advisories and news related to Homebrew, `homebrew-cask`, and the specific software installed via casks.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack during Download](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_during_download.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the network traffic between the user's machine and the download server for a cask artifact.  The attacker replaces the legitimate artifact with a malicious one.  This could be achieved through ARP spoofing, DNS hijacking, or compromising a router or proxy server.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code with the user's privileges when the downloaded artifact is executed (during installation or later).  This leads to similar consequences as a repository compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** The download process initiated by `brew cask install` or `brew cask upgrade`.  Specifically, the interaction between `curl` (or whatever download mechanism Homebrew uses) and the remote server.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **HTTPS Enforcement (Homebrew Maintainers):**  Ensure that all cask downloads use HTTPS.  This should be the default, but verify it.
    *   **Certificate Pinning (Ideal, but Difficult):**  Ideally, Homebrew would pin the certificates of download servers, but this is often impractical due to the variety of sources.
    *   **VPN/Secure Network (Users/Developers):**  Use a VPN or other secure network connection, especially when on untrusted networks (e.g., public Wi-Fi).
    *   **Checksum Verification (Users/Developers):**  If a cask provides a checksum *and* you can obtain that checksum from a trusted source (e.g., the software vendor's website, *not* just the Homebrew repository), verify the downloaded artifact's checksum.
    *   **Network Monitoring (Users/Developers):**  Advanced users can monitor network traffic for suspicious activity, such as unexpected redirects or certificate errors.

## Threat: [Local Cask Modification](./threats/local_cask_modification.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with local access to the system (e.g., a malicious insider, another compromised process, or malware) modifies the local cask definition files located in `$(brew --prefix)/Caskroom` or the Homebrew cache.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code the next time the modified cask is used (installed, upgraded, or even just referenced).
*   **Affected Component:** The local `.rb` cask definition files and potentially the cached artifacts. The `brew cask` commands that interact with these local files are affected.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if local access is already compromised)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Access Controls (Users/Developers):**  Implement strong file system permissions and user access controls to limit who can modify the Homebrew installation and cask files.
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring (Users/Developers):**  Use file integrity monitoring tools (e.g., `tripwire`, `aide`, macOS's built-in security features) to detect unauthorized modifications to the Homebrew directory and cask files.
    *   **Regular Audits (Users/Developers):**  Periodically review the contents of the `Caskroom` and Homebrew cache for unexpected or modified files.

## Threat: [`brew` Command Compromise (Privilege Escalation)](./threats/_brew__command_compromise__privilege_escalation_.md)

*   **Description:** The `brew` command itself is compromised (e.g., through a malicious update, a compromised Homebrew installation, or a PATH hijacking attack).
*   **Impact:**  An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges whenever `brew` is run.  If `brew` is run with `sudo`, this could lead to root access.
*   **Affected Component:** The `brew` executable and its associated libraries.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Homebrew Updated (Users/Developers):**  Regularly run `brew update` and `brew upgrade` to ensure you have the latest security patches for Homebrew itself.
    *   **Avoid `sudo brew` (Users/Developers):**  Do not run `brew` with `sudo` unless absolutely necessary.  Most casks should *not* require `sudo`.  If a cask *does* require `sudo`, carefully review its installation script.
    *   **Secure PATH (Users/Developers):**  Ensure that your PATH environment variable is configured securely, so that malicious executables cannot be placed before the legitimate `brew` command.
    *   **Homebrew Security Advisories (Users/Developers):**  Monitor for security advisories related to Homebrew.

## Threat: [Unofficial Tap Impersonating Official Tap (Spoofing)](./threats/unofficial_tap_impersonating_official_tap__spoofing_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker creates a third-party tap with a name very similar to the official `homebrew/cask` tap or another popular tap.  They then populate this tap with malicious casks. Users might accidentally add the malicious tap instead of the legitimate one.
*   **Impact:** Installation of malicious software, leading to code execution, data theft, or other security compromises.
*   **Affected Component:** The `brew tap` command and the user's configuration of trusted taps.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful Tap Verification (Users/Developers):**  Double-check the exact URL and name of any tap before adding it using `brew tap`.  Pay close attention to spelling and capitalization.
    *   **Official Tap Preference (Users/Developers):**  Stick to the official `homebrew/cask` tap whenever possible.  Avoid third-party taps unless you have a very good reason and fully trust the maintainer.
    *   **Trusted Tap List (Users/Developers):**  Maintain a list of known-good, trusted taps and compare any new taps against this list.
