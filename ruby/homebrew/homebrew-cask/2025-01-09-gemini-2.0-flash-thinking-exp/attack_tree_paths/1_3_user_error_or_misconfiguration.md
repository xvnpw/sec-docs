**1.3.4 Incorrect File Permissions or Ownership:**

* **Scenario:**  Users might inadvertently change file permissions or ownership of Homebrew Cask files or directories, potentially creating vulnerabilities. For example, making Homebrew Cask executables writable by non-admin users.
* **Attackers' Leverage:** Attackers could exploit these incorrect permissions to modify Homebrew Cask's behavior, inject malicious code, or gain elevated privileges.
* **Consequences:**  System compromise, privilege escalation, or the ability to install malicious software without proper authorization.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Clear Documentation on Permissions:**  Provide clear guidance on the necessary file permissions and ownership for Homebrew Cask.
    * **Automated Permission Checks:** Homebrew Cask could periodically check and correct file permissions.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design Homebrew Cask to operate with the minimum necessary privileges.

**1.3.5 Disabling Security Features or Overriding Security Settings:**

* **Scenario:**  Users might disable security features within macOS or override security settings that Homebrew Cask relies on, such as Gatekeeper or System Integrity Protection (SIP).
* **Attackers' Leverage:** Attackers could exploit these weakened security measures to install malware more easily.
* **Consequences:** Increased vulnerability to various attacks, including malware installation and system compromise.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **User Education:**  Emphasize the importance of maintaining default security settings.
    * **Warnings and Recommendations:** Homebrew Cask could warn users if it detects that crucial security features are disabled.
    * **Dependency on Secure Defaults:** Design Homebrew Cask with the assumption that default security settings are in place.
