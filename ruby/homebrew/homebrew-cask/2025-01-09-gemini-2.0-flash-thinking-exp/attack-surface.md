# Attack Surface Analysis for homebrew/homebrew-cask

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Cask Repositories (Taps)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_cask_repositories__taps_.md)

* **Description:** Malicious actors compromise a Homebrew Cask tap, injecting malicious Cask files or modifying existing ones.
    * **How Homebrew-Cask Contributes:** Cask relies on external "taps" (repositories) for application definitions. Adding untrusted or compromised taps introduces a direct pathway for malicious software.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains control of a popular but less rigorously maintained tap and modifies the Cask file for a widely used application to download and install malware alongside the intended software.
    * **Impact:** Installation of malware, backdoors, or other malicious software on the user's system. Potential for data theft, system compromise, and further propagation of attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Only add trusted and well-maintained Cask taps.
        * Regularly review the list of added taps and remove any that are no longer needed or seem suspicious.
        * Be cautious of adding newly created or obscure taps.
        * Consider using only the official `homebrew/cask` tap for critical applications.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Download Sources Specified in Caskfiles](./attack_surfaces/compromised_download_sources_specified_in_caskfiles.md)

* **Description:** The download URL specified in a Caskfile for an application points to a compromised server or a malicious file.
    * **How Homebrew-Cask Contributes:** Cask directly downloads applications from the URLs specified in the Caskfile. If these sources are compromised, Cask will facilitate the download of malicious software.
    * **Example:** An attacker compromises the download server of a legitimate application. The Caskfile for that application is not immediately updated, leading users to download malware via Cask.
    * **Impact:** Installation of malware disguised as the intended application. Similar impacts to compromised repositories.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Before installing, verify the download URL in the Caskfile if possible.
        * Look for HTTPS URLs to ensure encrypted communication during download.
        * Consider using checksum verification (if provided in the Caskfile or application documentation) after download but before installation.
        * Rely on Caskfiles from trusted taps, as these are more likely to be monitored for such issues.

## Attack Surface: [Execution of Arbitrary Code During Installation (via `installer`, `postflight`, etc.)](./attack_surfaces/execution_of_arbitrary_code_during_installation__via__installer____postflight___etc__.md)

* **Description:** Malicious Caskfiles contain code within the `installer`, `postflight`, or `uninstall_postflight` stanzas that executes arbitrary commands on the user's system.
    * **How Homebrew-Cask Contributes:** Cask executes the commands and scripts defined in these stanzas during the installation and uninstallation processes. This provides an opportunity for malicious code execution.
    * **Example:** A compromised Caskfile for a seemingly harmless utility includes a `postflight` script that adds a backdoor to the system or exfiltrates sensitive data.
    * **Impact:** Full system compromise, privilege escalation, data theft, persistence of malicious software.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully review the contents of Caskfiles from less familiar taps, paying close attention to the `installer`, `postflight`, and `uninstall_postflight` stanzas.
        * Avoid installing applications from untrusted sources.
        * Run Cask commands with the least necessary privileges.
        * Consider using tools or scripts to automatically analyze Caskfiles for suspicious commands.
