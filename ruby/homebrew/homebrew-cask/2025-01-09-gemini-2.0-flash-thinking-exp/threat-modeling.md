# Threat Model Analysis for homebrew/homebrew-cask

## Threat: [Compromised Cask Repository ("Tap")](./threats/compromised_cask_repository__tap_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of a third-party Homebrew Cask tap. They might modify existing Cask definitions to point to malicious download locations or inject malicious installation scripts. They could also add entirely new, malicious Casks to the tap. Users who trust and install from this compromised tap unknowingly download and execute malicious software *through the Homebrew Cask installation process*.

**Impact:** Installation of malware (including ransomware, spyware, backdoors), leading to data theft, system compromise, and potential financial loss.

**Affected Component:** Homebrew Cask `tap` command, Cask definition files within the compromised repository.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Users:** Exercise caution when adding third-party taps. Research the reputation and trustworthiness of the tap maintainer. Regularly review installed taps using `brew tap`.
*   **Tap Maintainers:** Implement strong access controls and multi-factor authentication for repository management. Regularly audit Cask definitions for suspicious changes. Consider code signing for Cask definitions.

## Threat: [Compromised Application Download Source](./threats/compromised_application_download_source.md)

**Description:** The original download location specified in a Cask definition is compromised. An attacker replaces the legitimate application package (DMG, PKG, ZIP, etc.) with a malicious version. When a user installs the application via `brew cask install`, *Homebrew Cask downloads and the user executes* the compromised package.

**Impact:** Installation of malware, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, and unauthorized access.

**Affected Component:** Homebrew Cask download mechanism, Cask definition file (`url` attribute).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Cask Maintainers:** Verify the integrity of download sources and utilize HTTPS. Implement and verify checksums (shasum) for downloaded files within the Cask definition. Monitor download sources for changes.
*   **Users:** Be aware of the application's official website and compare the download source if suspicious. Pay attention to checksum verification failures reported by `brew cask`.

## Threat: [Malicious Cask Definition with Embedded Scripts](./threats/malicious_cask_definition_with_embedded_scripts.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a seemingly legitimate Cask definition that contains malicious installation scripts (`install`, `uninstall`, `postflight`, `caveats`, etc.). When a user installs this Cask, *Homebrew Cask executes these scripts*, potentially performing malicious actions beyond simply installing the application.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the user's system, leading to data theft, system modification, installation of backdoors, or privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** Homebrew Cask installation process, Cask definition file (script blocks).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Tap Maintainers:** Implement rigorous code review processes for all submitted Cask definitions, especially script blocks. Consider static analysis tools to detect potentially malicious code.
*   **Users:**  Be cautious of installing Casks from untrusted sources. Review the Cask definition before installation using `brew cask cat <cask>`.

## Threat: [Checksum Bypass or Weakness](./threats/checksum_bypass_or_weakness.md)

**Description:** The checksum verification mechanism in Homebrew Cask is flawed, uses weak hashing algorithms, or the checksum provided in the Cask definition is incorrect or compromised. An attacker could then provide a modified, malicious application package that *Homebrew Cask incorrectly verifies* as legitimate.

**Impact:** Installation of a tampered application containing malware, even if checksum verification is present.

**Affected Component:** Homebrew Cask download and verification process, Cask definition file (`sha256` or other checksum attributes).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Cask Developers:** Use strong and up-to-date hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-256 or SHA-3). Ensure checksums are sourced securely and verified against multiple sources if possible.
*   **Homebrew Cask Developers:**  Regularly review and test the checksum verification implementation for vulnerabilities. Provide clear error messages to users when checksum verification fails.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Downloads](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_downloads.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the download traffic between the user's machine and the application's download server. They replace the legitimate application package with a malicious one before it reaches the user. *If Homebrew Cask does not enforce HTTPS or properly verify checksums*, this attack is more likely to succeed.

**Impact:** Installation of a tampered application, leading to potential system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Network communication during the download process initiated by Homebrew Cask.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Cask Maintainers:**  Enforce HTTPS for all download URLs in Cask definitions. Provide correct and up-to-date checksums.
*   **Homebrew Cask Developers:**  Enforce HTTPS for downloads whenever possible. Provide clear warnings if HTTPS is not used. Ensure robust checksum verification is implemented and enabled by default.
*   **Users:** Ensure they are using a secure network connection and avoid downloading software on public or untrusted Wi-Fi networks. Pay attention to warnings from Homebrew Cask about insecure downloads.

## Threat: [Exploiting Installer Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_installer_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The application installer itself (e.g., a PKG installer) contains vulnerabilities that can be exploited during the installation process. A malicious actor could craft a Cask that *instructs Homebrew Cask to execute* an installer with known vulnerabilities or provide malicious input to the installer.

**Impact:** Code execution with the privileges of the installer, potentially leading to privilege escalation and system compromise.

**Affected Component:** The underlying application installer executed by Homebrew Cask.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Application Developers:** Securely develop and test application installers. Release updates to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Homebrew Cask Developers:** Encourage the use of applications from reputable sources and with a history of security awareness. Consider adding checks for known vulnerable installer versions (though this can be challenging to maintain).

## Threat: [Post-Installation Script Exploitation](./threats/post-installation_script_exploitation.md)

**Description:** A malicious Cask definition includes malicious code within the `postflight` script block. *Homebrew Cask executes this script* after the main installation process, and it can perform actions with the user's privileges.

**Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary code after installation, potentially leading to persistent malware installation, data exfiltration, or system modification.

**Affected Component:** Homebrew Cask installation process, Cask definition file (`postflight` block).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Tap Maintainers:**  Scrutinize `postflight` scripts during code review.
*   **Users:** Be wary of Casks that perform unusual or unexpected actions after installation. Review the Cask definition before installation.
