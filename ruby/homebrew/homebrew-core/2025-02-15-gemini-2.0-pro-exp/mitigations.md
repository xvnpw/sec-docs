# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for homebrew/homebrew-core

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Auditing of Installed Formulae (from `homebrew/homebrew-core`)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_auditing_of_installed_formulae__from__homebrewhomebrew-core__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Automated Script:** Create a script (Bash, Python) that runs `brew list --versions` and `brew deps --tree --installed`.  Crucially, filter the output to *only* include formulae originating from `homebrew/homebrew-core`. This can be done by checking the output of `brew info <formula>` and looking for the "From:" line.
    2.  **Baseline Definition:** Establish a "known-good" configuration file (`approved_core_formulae.txt`) listing approved formulae *from `homebrew/homebrew-core`* and their specific versions.
    3.  **Comparison:** The script compares the filtered output of `brew` commands against `approved_core_formulae.txt`.
    4.  **Alerting:** Discrepancies (new core formulae, version mismatches, unexpected core dependencies) trigger an alert.
    5.  **Regular Execution:** Schedule the script (e.g., using `cron`) to run at a defined interval (weekly).
    6.  **Manual Review:** A team member reviews alerts and investigates deviations, focusing on changes within `homebrew/homebrew-core`.
    7.  **Dependency Analysis:** Examine `brew deps --tree --installed` output (filtered to `homebrew/homebrew-core`) to identify unexpected dependencies *within the core tap*.
    8. **Documentation:** Document the entire auditing process.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Installation of malicious or compromised formulae from `homebrew/homebrew-core` (Severity: High).
    *   **Threat:** Unintentional installation of outdated or vulnerable formulae from `homebrew/homebrew-core` (Severity: Medium to High).
    *   **Threat:** Dependency confusion attacks involving formulae within `homebrew/homebrew-core` (Severity: Medium to High).
    *   **Threat:** "Drift" from approved `homebrew/homebrew-core` configurations (Severity: Low to Medium).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Core Formulae:** Significantly reduces risk by providing early detection.
    *   **Outdated Core Formulae:** High impact; proactively identifies vulnerable packages.
    *   **Core Dependency Confusion:** Medium impact; helps detect unexpected core dependencies.
    *   **Core Configuration Drift:** High impact; maintains consistency.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic `brew list` checks are performed manually, but not specifically filtered for `homebrew/homebrew-core`.
    *   Alerting is partially implemented via logging.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated script with `homebrew/homebrew-core` filtering.
    *   Formalized `approved_core_formulae.txt` baseline.
    *   Scheduled execution and full automated alerting.
    *   Consistent dependency analysis focused on `homebrew/homebrew-core`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pinning Formulae Versions (from `homebrew/homebrew-core`)](./mitigation_strategies/pinning_formulae_versions__from__homebrewhomebrew-core__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical Core Formulae:** Create a list of *core* formulae (`homebrew/homebrew-core`) critical for stability and security.
    2.  **Pinning:** Use `brew pin <formula>` for each critical *core* formula.
    3.  **Documentation:** For each pinned *core* formula, document: the pinned version, the rationale, and a plan for unpinning/upgrading.
    4.  **Controlled Unpinning and Upgrade (Core Formulae):**
        *   Use a staging environment.
        *   Unpin the *core* formula in staging: `brew unpin <formula>`.
        *   Upgrade the *core* formula in staging: `brew upgrade <formula>`.
        *   Thoroughly test in staging.
        *   If successful, pin to the *new* version in staging.
        *   Deploy to production, including the updated pin.
    5.  **Regular Review of Pins (Core Formulae):** Periodically review the list of pinned *core* formulae.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Breaking changes from uncontrolled upgrades of `homebrew/homebrew-core` formulae (Severity: Medium).
    *   **Threat:** Installation of a compromised version of a `homebrew/homebrew-core` formula immediately after release (Severity: High).
    *   **Threat:** Inconsistent environments (if pinning is applied consistently) (Severity: Low to Medium).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Breaking Changes:** High impact; prevents unexpected failures.
    *   **Compromised Core Versions:** Medium impact; reduces the vulnerability window.
    *   **Inconsistency:** High impact (if consistently applied).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No formal pinning process, especially not focused on `homebrew/homebrew-core`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Identification of critical *core* formulae.
    *   Formalized pinning/unpinning for *core* formulae.
    *   Documentation specific to *core* formulae.
    *   Controlled upgrade process with staging, focused on *core* formulae.
    *   Regular review of *core* formula pins.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Reviewing Formulae Source Code (from `homebrew/homebrew-core`)](./mitigation_strategies/reviewing_formulae_source_code__from__homebrewhomebrew-core__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical Core Formulae:** Determine which *core* formulae (`homebrew/homebrew-core`) are most critical to security.
    2.  **Extraction:** Use `brew extract <formula> homebrew/core` to extract the *core* formula's source code *without* installing.
    3.  **Code Review:** Perform a manual code review (by security experts) of the *extracted core formula code*, focusing on:
        *   Security best practices.
        *   Suspicious code.
        *   Hardcoded secrets.
        *   Network connections (especially those defined within the *core* formula).
        *   Dependencies *declared within the core formula*.
    4.  **Documentation:** Document findings and actions taken.
    5.  **Regular Reviews:** Repeat reviews, especially for new *core* formula releases.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Maliciously crafted *core* formula containing backdoors (Severity: High).
    *   **Threat:** Subtle vulnerabilities in *core* formula code (Severity: Medium to High).
    *   **Threat:** Supply chain attacks targeting dependencies *declared within the core formula* (Severity: Medium to High).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Core Formulae:** High impact; strongest defense.
    *   **Subtle Core Vulnerabilities:** Medium to High impact.
    *   **Core Dependency Supply Chain:** Medium impact.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No formal code review process for *any* Homebrew formulae, including those from `homebrew/homebrew-core`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Identification of critical *core* formulae.
    *   Formalized code review process for *core* formulae.
    *   Regular reviews of *core* formulae.
