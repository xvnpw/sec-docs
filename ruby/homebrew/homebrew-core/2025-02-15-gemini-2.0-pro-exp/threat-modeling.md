# Threat Model Analysis for homebrew/homebrew-core

## Threat: [Malicious Formula Injection](./threats/malicious_formula_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Formula Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker submits a malicious formula to `homebrew/homebrew-core`, or compromises an existing maintainer's account and modifies a legitimate formula. The malicious formula contains code that executes during installation (`brew install`), upgrade (`brew upgrade`), or potentially at runtime if the installed software is designed to be launched. The attacker's code could perform actions like downloading additional malware, exfiltrating data, establishing a backdoor, or modifying system configurations.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data theft, installation of persistent malware, denial of service, lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Homebrew-Core Component:** Formula files (`.rb` files in the `Formula` directory), `brew install` and `brew upgrade` commands, potentially the installed software itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Review (Limited):** Before installing *any* new or updated formula, developers *should* attempt to review the formula's Ruby code (`.rb` file) and any associated patches or download URLs. This is time-consuming and requires Ruby expertise, making it impractical for many users. Look for suspicious system calls (`system`, `exec`, `popen`), network connections, or file modifications.
        *   **Sandboxing (Strong):** Run `brew install` and `brew upgrade` within a sandboxed environment, such as a Docker container or a virtual machine. This limits the potential damage a malicious formula can inflict on the host system.
        *   **Least Privilege (Moderate):** Avoid running `brew` commands as the root user. Create a dedicated user account with limited privileges for installing and managing Homebrew packages.
        *   **Version Pinning (Moderate):** Pin specific versions of critical packages using a `Brewfile` or by manually specifying the version during installation (e.g., `brew install <formula>@<version>`). This prevents automatic upgrades to potentially malicious newer versions, but also means you won't receive security updates automatically.
        *   **Delayed Updates (Limited):** Delay updating packages for a few days or weeks after a new release, allowing time for the community to potentially identify and report any malicious code. This is a trade-off between security and staying up-to-date.
        *   **Monitor Homebrew Security Announcements (Moderate):** Subscribe to Homebrew's security announcements and mailing lists to stay informed about any reported vulnerabilities or malicious formulae.
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA) (Limited):** While SCA tools are primarily designed for application dependencies, some *may* offer limited detection of known malicious Homebrew packages. This is not a reliable primary defense.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Outdated Packages](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_outdated_packages.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Outdated Packages

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an outdated Homebrew package *that is part of homebrew-core* and installed on the system. The user has not run `brew update` and `brew upgrade` to install the latest security patches. The attacker leverages the vulnerability to gain unauthorized access, execute code, or escalate privileges.
    *   **Impact:** System compromise, data breach, denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Homebrew-Core Component:** Installed packages (binaries, libraries, etc.) *from homebrew-core*, `brew update`, `brew upgrade`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates (Strong):** Run `brew update` and `brew upgrade` frequently (e.g., daily or weekly) to install the latest security patches.
        *   **Automated Updates (Strong):** Automate the update process using a script or a system service (e.g., a cron job).  Ensure appropriate testing is in place to avoid breaking your development environment.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning (Moderate):** Use a vulnerability scanner (e.g., `trivy`, `grype`, or commercial tools) to identify outdated packages with known CVEs.
        *   **System-Level Package Management (Moderate):** If possible, use your operating system's built-in package management system (e.g., `apt` on Debian/Ubuntu, `yum` on CentOS/RHEL) to manage system-level dependencies, as these often have more robust security update mechanisms.

## Threat: [Compromised Homebrew Infrastructure](./threats/compromised_homebrew_infrastructure.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Homebrew Infrastructure

    *   **Description:** Attackers compromise the core infrastructure of Homebrew, such as the `brew.sh` website, the Git repositories hosted on GitHub, or the build servers used to create bottles (pre-compiled binaries). This allows the attackers to distribute malicious formulae or bottles to *all* Homebrew users.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread system compromise, potentially affecting a very large number of users.
    *   **Affected Homebrew-Core Component:** The entire Homebrew ecosystem: `brew.sh`, GitHub repositories, build servers, `brew update`, `brew install`, `brew upgrade`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Limited User Control):** This threat is largely outside the control of individual users. Mitigation relies heavily on the security practices of the Homebrew maintainers.
        *   **Monitor Announcements (Moderate):** Pay close attention to Homebrew's official announcements, security advisories, and incident reports.
        *   **Delayed Updates (Limited):** As a precaution, consider delaying updates for a short period after a major release, allowing time for any potential issues to be discovered and reported by the community.
        *   **Checksum Verification (Moderate):** Homebrew uses SHA-256 checksums to verify the integrity of downloaded bottles. While this helps prevent *accidental* corruption, it won't protect against a sophisticated attacker who compromises the infrastructure and replaces both the bottles *and* their checksums.
        *   **HTTPS Verification (Essential):** Ensure that all downloads from Homebrew are using HTTPS. This is generally the default, but it's worth verifying.

## Threat: [Tampering with Downloaded Bottles](./threats/tampering_with_downloaded_bottles.md)

* **Threat:** Tampering with Downloaded Bottles

    * **Description:** An attacker intercepts the network connection between the user's machine and the Homebrew bottle server (Bintray, or GitHub Packages in newer versions) and replaces a legitimate bottle *from homebrew-core* with a malicious one. This is a "man-in-the-middle" (MITM) attack.
    * **Impact:** Execution of malicious code, system compromise.
    * **Affected Homebrew-Core Component:** `brew install` (when downloading bottles), bottle download mechanism.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **HTTPS (Essential):** Ensure that Homebrew is configured to use HTTPS for all downloads. This is the default, but verify it. HTTPS encrypts the connection, making MITM attacks much more difficult.
        *   **Checksum Verification (Moderate):** Homebrew verifies the SHA-256 checksum of downloaded bottles against the checksum listed in the formula. This helps detect tampering, *but* a sophisticated attacker who controls the bottle server could also replace the checksum.
        *   **VPN/Trusted Network (Moderate):** Use a VPN or a trusted network when downloading Homebrew packages, especially when on public Wi-Fi.
        * **Build from Source (Strong):** Use `brew install --build-from-source <formula>` to compile the package from source code instead of downloading a pre-compiled bottle. This eliminates the risk of bottle tampering, but significantly increases installation time.
