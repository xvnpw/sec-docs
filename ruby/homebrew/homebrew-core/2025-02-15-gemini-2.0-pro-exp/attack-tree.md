## Attack Tree Path: [[Execute Arbitrary Code]*](./attack_tree_paths/_execute_arbitrary_code_.md)

Description: The ultimate objective of the attacker: to gain the ability to run arbitrary commands on the target system (either the application server or a developer's machine). This provides the attacker with a high level of control.
Why Critical: This is the final goal; achieving it represents a complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit Homebrew Formula] (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_homebrew_formula___high_risk_.md)

Description: The attacker leverages a Homebrew formula (either a vulnerable one or an outdated one with known vulnerabilities) to achieve code execution. This is the primary attack surface related to Homebrew usage.
Why High Risk: This is the most likely path an attacker would take, as it exploits weaknesses in installed software, which is a common attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Vulnerable Formula]* (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/_vulnerable_formula___high_risk_.md)

Description: The attacker exploits a vulnerability within a legitimately installed Homebrew formula. This vulnerability could be a known CVE or a result of dependency confusion.
Why Critical and High Risk: Exploiting existing vulnerabilities is a common and often successful attack method.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CVE]* (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/_cve___high_risk_.md)

Description: The attacker exploits a publicly known and documented vulnerability (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in a Homebrew formula.
Why High Risk: Exploits for CVEs are often readily available, making this a relatively easy attack for an attacker with intermediate skills.
Attack Vector:
[Known Vuln.]: The application uses a formula with a known, unpatched vulnerability. The attacker identifies this vulnerability (e.g., through vulnerability scanning) and uses a publicly available or custom-developed exploit to gain code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Dependency Confusion]* (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/_dependency_confusion___high_risk_.md)

Description: The attacker publishes a malicious package with the same name as a private or internal dependency of a legitimate Homebrew formula on a public package repository. The build process of the formula (or Homebrew itself) might mistakenly install the malicious package instead of the intended internal one.
Why High Risk: This attack vector is becoming increasingly common and can be difficult to detect without careful dependency management and auditing.
Attack Vector:
[Install malicious dep.]: The attacker crafts a malicious package and publishes it to a public registry. When the legitimate formula is built (or updated), the build system inadvertently pulls in the malicious dependency, leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Outdated Formula]* (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/_outdated_formula___high_risk_.md)

Description: The attacker exploits a vulnerability in an outdated version of a Homebrew formula. The application is not using the latest, patched version.
Why Critical and High Risk: Outdated software is a very common source of security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[No Updates]* (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/_no_updates___high_risk_.md)

Description: The application (or its deployment/development environment) is not configured to regularly update Homebrew formulas. This leads to the use of outdated and potentially vulnerable software.
Why High Risk: This is a fundamental security hygiene failure that directly enables the exploitation of outdated formulas.
Attack Vector:
[App not configured to auto-update]* (HIGH RISK): The root cause.  Lack of automated updates means that security patches are not applied promptly, leaving the system vulnerable to known exploits. The attacker simply needs to find an outdated formula with a known vulnerability and exploit it.
