### 5. Re-evaluation of Likelihood and Impact

**Likelihood:**  The initial assessment of "Moderate" likelihood remains valid and potentially leans towards "High" in certain contexts.

* **Justification:** Public CVE databases are readily available, and identifying vulnerable software packages in Homebrew-core is straightforward. Many applications rely on common libraries and tools installed via Homebrew-core, increasing the attack surface. Automated vulnerability scanners can easily identify vulnerable software.  However, successful exploitation still requires effort and depends on the specific vulnerability and target application.

**Impact:** The initial assessment of "Significant" impact is strongly supported.

* **Justification:** Exploiting known CVEs can have severe consequences, ranging from information disclosure (leaking sensitive data, API keys, credentials) to remote code execution (allowing attackers to take complete control of the system).  Remote code execution is particularly critical as it enables attackers to perform virtually any malicious action. The impact can extend beyond the application itself to the entire organization.
