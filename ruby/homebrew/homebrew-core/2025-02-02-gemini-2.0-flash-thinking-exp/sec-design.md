# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a comprehensive and reliable repository of software formulas for the Homebrew package manager.
  - Enable Homebrew users to easily discover, install, and manage software packages on macOS and Linux.
  - Maintain an up-to-date catalog of software formulas, reflecting the latest software releases and updates.
  - Foster a collaborative community of contributors to expand and improve the formula repository.

- Business Risks:
  - Risk of malicious formulas being introduced into the repository, potentially compromising user systems.
  - Risk of formula availability issues, disrupting users' ability to install or update software.
  - Risk of formula integrity compromise, leading to users installing incorrect or tampered software.
  - Risk of reputational damage if the repository is perceived as insecure or unreliable.
  - Risk of operational disruption due to infrastructure failures or security incidents.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code Review - Formula contributions are reviewed via GitHub Pull Requests by Homebrew maintainers. Implemented in: GitHub Pull Request workflow.
  - security control: Automated Linting and Testing - Formulas are automatically checked for syntax errors and basic functionality using linters and tests in CI. Implemented in: GitHub Actions workflows.
  - security control: Community Reporting - Users can report issues and vulnerabilities through GitHub issues. Implemented in: GitHub Issue tracking system.
  - security control: GitHub Security Features - Reliance on GitHub's platform security features, including access controls, audit logs, and vulnerability scanning for the underlying infrastructure. Implemented in: GitHub platform.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in formulas due to the large volume of contributions and the complexity of software packages.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on volunteer maintainers and community contributions for security monitoring and incident response.
  - accepted risk: Risk of supply chain attacks targeting upstream software sources referenced in formulas.
  - accepted risk: Limited resources for dedicated security testing and in-depth formula security audits.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Formalized Security Review Process - Implement a more structured security review process specifically focused on identifying potential security vulnerabilities in formulas, beyond basic functionality and syntax.
  - security control: Automated Security Scanning - Integrate automated security scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline to detect known vulnerabilities in formula dependencies and potential security issues in formula code.
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement dependency scanning to track and manage dependencies of formulas and identify vulnerable dependencies.
  - security control: Formula Signing or Checksumming - Introduce a mechanism to sign or checksum formulas to ensure integrity and authenticity, preventing tampering during distribution.
  - security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Program - Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues and streamline the vulnerability remediation process.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: While direct authentication to the repository is not applicable for public access, authentication is required for maintainers and contributors to manage the repository and submit changes via GitHub accounts.
    - Requirement: Consider authentication mechanisms for future potential features that might require user-specific actions or data.

  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement fine-grained authorization controls within GitHub to manage permissions for maintainers, contributors, and automated systems to access and modify repository content.
    - Requirement: Define clear roles and responsibilities for maintainers and contributors regarding formula management and security.

  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Rigorously validate formula syntax and structure to prevent injection attacks or other forms of malicious formula construction.
    - Requirement: Validate URLs and checksums of upstream software sources to ensure they are legitimate and haven't been tampered with.
    - Requirement: Implement input validation for any user-provided data in future features, such as search queries or formula submission forms (if introduced).

  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Utilize HTTPS for all communication to and from the repository to protect data in transit. Implemented in: GitHub platform.
    - Requirement: Explore the feasibility of using cryptographic signatures or checksums for formulas to ensure integrity and authenticity during distribution to Homebrew clients. Recommended security control: Formula Signing or Checksumming.
    - Requirement: Securely manage any cryptographic keys or secrets used for signing or other security functions, if implemented.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Distribution of software formulas to Homebrew users is the most critical business process. Any disruption or compromise to this process directly impacts Homebrew's value proposition.
  - Formula contribution and review process is also critical to maintain the quality and comprehensiveness of the repository.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Formula definitions are the primary data to protect. While formulas are publicly accessible, their integrity and authenticity are crucial.
  - Metadata associated with formulas (e.g., version information, dependencies) also needs to be protected for integrity.
  - Sensitivity: Publicly available, but integrity is highly critical. Compromised formulas can lead to widespread security issues for Homebrew users.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What specific automated security checks are currently implemented in the CI/CD pipeline beyond basic linting and testing?
  - Is there a formal process for handling security vulnerabilities reported in formulas or the repository itself?
  - Are there any plans to implement formula signing or checksumming to enhance integrity verification?
  - What is the current process for dependency management and vulnerability scanning of formula dependencies?
  - Are there any security awareness training programs for Homebrew maintainers and contributors?

- Assumptions:
  - Homebrew-core relies heavily on the security provided by the GitHub platform.
  - Formula contributions are generally reviewed for basic functionality and syntax, but in-depth security reviews might be limited due to resource constraints.
  - The Homebrew community plays a significant role in identifying and reporting potential issues, including security vulnerabilities.
  - Security is a shared responsibility between Homebrew maintainers, contributors, and the wider community.
  - The primary focus of security efforts is on preventing malicious or vulnerable formulas from being introduced into the repository and distributed to users.
