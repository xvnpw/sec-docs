# Threat Model Analysis for homebrew/homebrew-core

## Threat: [Malicious Formula Injection/Compromise](./threats/malicious_formula_injectioncompromise.md)

* **Threat:** Malicious Formula Injection/Compromise
    * **Description:**
        * **Attacker Action:** An attacker compromises a Homebrew-core formula. This could be achieved by:
            * Submitting a malicious formula as a contributor.
            * Compromising a maintainer's account to directly modify formulae.
            * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Homebrew-core formula review process.
        * **Method:** The attacker injects malicious code into the formula. This code could:
            * Download and install malware instead of or alongside the intended software.
            * Modify the build process to introduce backdoors into the software being built.
            * Steal credentials or sensitive data during the installation process.
    * **Impact:**
        * Users installing software via the compromised formula unknowingly install malware.
        * System compromise, data breaches, unauthorized access, denial of service.
        * Reputational damage to the application relying on the compromised formula.
    * **Affected Homebrew-core Component:** Formula Files (Ruby scripts in the `homebrew-core` repository)
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Formula Pinning/Specific Versioning:** Pin dependencies to specific, known-good formula versions in application dependency management.
        * **Formula Auditing (Limited):** Prioritize auditing formulae critical to the application and those with a history of issues.
        * **Dependency Vendoring (Alternative):** Vendor critical dependencies instead of relying solely on Homebrew-core.
        * **Regular Dependency Updates & Monitoring:** Stay informed about security advisories and monitor Homebrew-core security channels.
        * **Checksum Verification (Formula Review):** Homebrew-core maintainers should rigorously review formulae and ensure checksum verification for downloaded resources.

## Threat: [Homebrew-core Infrastructure Compromise](./threats/homebrew-core_infrastructure_compromise.md)

* **Threat:** Homebrew-core Infrastructure Compromise
    * **Description:**
        * **Attacker Action:** An attacker compromises the Homebrew-core infrastructure. This could target:
            * The GitHub repository hosting `homebrew-core`.
            * Build servers used to create bottles (pre-compiled binaries).
            * Distribution mechanisms (e.g., CDN).
        * **Method:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Homebrew-core's infrastructure to:
            * Modify formulae directly in the repository.
            * Inject malicious code into bottles.
            * Redirect download URLs to malicious sources.
    * **Impact:**
        * Widespread distribution of malicious software to all Homebrew-core users.
        * Massive system compromise and data breaches across a large user base.
        * Loss of trust in Homebrew-core.
    * **Affected Homebrew-core Component:** Homebrew-core Infrastructure (GitHub repository, build servers, distribution network)
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Verification of Formula Source (Limited):** Verify the source repository (GitHub) and potentially checksums if available.
        * **Monitoring Homebrew-core Status:** Stay informed about Homebrew-core's operational status and security incidents.
        * **Fallback Package Sources (Consideration):** For critical dependencies, consider fallback package sources in case of Homebrew-core compromise.
        * **Strong Infrastructure Security (Homebrew-core):** Homebrew-core maintainers must implement robust security measures to protect their infrastructure.
