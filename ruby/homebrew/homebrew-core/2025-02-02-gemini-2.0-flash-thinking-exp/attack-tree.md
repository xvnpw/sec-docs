## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Existing Vulnerability in Formula -> Identify Vulnerable Formula -> Formula with Known Vulnerability (e.g., outdated package):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_existing_vulnerability_in_formula_-_identify_vulnerable_formula_-_formula_with_known_vulnera_aab6d674.md)

Attack Vector: Attackers identify formulas in Homebrew-core that contain known vulnerabilities, often due to outdated packages or insecure Ruby code within the formula itself.
Risk: Exploiting vulnerabilities in formula's Ruby code or installation scripts during `brew install` process.
Likelihood: Moderate - Identifying outdated packages or formula vulnerabilities is relatively feasible.
Impact: Significant - Can lead to local privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution during installation, or compromised application environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Dependency in Formula -> Formula Declares Vulnerable Dependency -> Formula Uses Outdated/Vulnerable Dependency Version:](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_dependency_in_formula_-_formula_declares_vulnerable_dependency_-_formula_uses_outdatedvul_e3871c90.md)

Attack Vector: Formulas declare dependencies on specific software libraries or tools. If a formula specifies an outdated version of a dependency that contains known vulnerabilities, applications using software installed by this formula become vulnerable.
Risk: Application relies on a vulnerable dependency, exposing it to known exploits.
Likelihood: Moderate - Formulas might inadvertently or intentionally use older dependency versions.
Impact: Significant - Vulnerabilities in dependencies can be directly exploited to compromise the application at runtime.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Dependency in Formula -> Exploit Vulnerability in Dependency during Application Runtime -> Application Uses Vulnerable Dependency Functionality:](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_dependency_in_formula_-_exploit_vulnerability_in_dependency_during_application_runtime_-__2448803f.md)

Attack Vector: Even if a formula declares a dependency, the vulnerability is only exploitable if the target application actually *uses* the vulnerable functionality of that dependency. Attackers need to identify how the application interacts with the vulnerable dependency.
Risk: Application code path triggers the vulnerable code in the dependency.
Likelihood: Moderate - Depends on application's usage patterns, but common libraries often have widely used vulnerable functions.
Impact: Significant - Direct application compromise through dependency vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise via Installed Software Vulnerability -> Exploit Vulnerability in Software Installed by Formula -> Identify Vulnerable Software Installed by Formula -> Software with Known Vulnerability (CVE):](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_via_installed_software_vulnerability_-_exploit_vulnerability_in_software_installed_by_for_f9e015cc.md)

Attack Vector: Attackers identify software packages installed by Homebrew-core that have publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs). They then target applications that use these vulnerable software packages.
Risk: Application uses software with known and potentially easily exploitable vulnerabilities.
Likelihood: Moderate - Public CVE databases make it easy to identify vulnerable software.
Impact: Significant - Exploiting known CVEs can lead to various levels of compromise, from information disclosure to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise via Installed Software Vulnerability -> Exploit Vulnerability in Software Installed by Formula -> Trigger Vulnerability in Installed Software during Application Use -> Application Uses Vulnerable Functionality of Installed Software:](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_via_installed_software_vulnerability_-_exploit_vulnerability_in_software_installed_by_for_bbb887eb.md)

Attack Vector: Similar to the previous path, but emphasizes the need to trigger the vulnerability during application runtime. Attackers need to understand how the application uses the vulnerable software and craft exploits that target those specific usage patterns.
Risk: Application's interaction with vulnerable software triggers the vulnerability.
Likelihood: Moderate - Requires understanding of application's behavior and vulnerable software's functionality.
Impact: Significant - Direct application compromise by exploiting software it relies on.
