# Attack Surface Analysis for homebrew/homebrew-core

## Attack Surface: [Formula Repository Compromise (Supply Chain Risk)](./attack_surfaces/formula_repository_compromise__supply_chain_risk_.md)

**Description:**  The `homebrew/homebrew-core` repository on GitHub hosts formulae. If this repository or maintainer accounts are compromised, malicious formulae can be introduced.

**Homebrew-core Contribution:** Homebrew-core is the central, trusted repository for formulae used by Homebrew, making it a critical point in the software supply chain.

**Example:** An attacker compromises a Homebrew-core maintainer account and modifies the `curl` formula to download a backdoored version of curl. Users installing or upgrading `curl` via Homebrew will unknowingly install the compromised version from the official Homebrew-core repository.

**Impact:** Widespread malware distribution, remote code execution on developer and user machines, data exfiltration, significant supply chain compromise affecting a large user base.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Formula Auditing (Limited User Control):** Rely on and trust Homebrew Core's internal formula review processes. Stay informed about any reported security incidents related to Homebrew Core.
    * **Pin Formula Revisions:** Use specific formula commit hashes instead of relying on `HEAD` to reduce the window of exposure to recent, potentially compromised updates. Example: `brew install openssl@<commit_hash>`.
    * **Checksum Verification (Ensure Enabled):** Homebrew automatically verifies checksums. Ensure this feature is not disabled and that formulae include checksums for downloaded resources.
    * **Monitor Homebrew Security Channels:** Stay updated on any security advisories or discussions related to Homebrew Core.

## Attack Surface: [Formula Vulnerabilities (Formula as Code Execution Risk)](./attack_surfaces/formula_vulnerabilities__formula_as_code_execution_risk_.md)

**Description:** Homebrew formulae are Ruby scripts that execute shell commands. Vulnerabilities in the formula code itself can be exploited during the installation process.

**Homebrew-core Contribution:** Formulae within Homebrew-core define the installation procedures and have the inherent capability to execute arbitrary code on a user's system during package installation.

**Example:** A formula in Homebrew-core contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious shell commands into the `install` phase. When a user installs this formula, the attacker's commands are executed with the privileges of the Homebrew process, potentially gaining local access.

**Impact:** Local privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution on the system during package installation, potential for persistent system compromise originating from a seemingly trusted source (Homebrew-core).

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Formula Auditing (Limited User Control):** Rely on Homebrew Core's community review process. Exercise caution when installing less common or recently added formulae, as review depth might vary.
    * **Sandboxing/Containerization (Advanced):** Run Homebrew installations within sandboxed environments or containers to restrict the potential damage from formula vulnerabilities by limiting system access.
    * **Minimize Custom Formula Usage:** Prioritize using well-established and widely adopted formulae from Homebrew Core over custom or less vetted formulae, which may have undergone less scrutiny.
    * **Review Formula Code (If Concerned):** For highly sensitive environments, consider manually reviewing the Ruby code of formulae before installation, particularly for formulae from sources that are not thoroughly trusted.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Transitive Dependencies Risk)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__transitive_dependencies_risk_.md)

**Description:** Packages installed by Homebrew Core rely on other software packages as dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly introduce risks to applications using Homebrew-installed software.

**Homebrew-core Contribution:** Homebrew-core formulae explicitly declare and manage package dependencies. Installing software via Homebrew inherently brings in its entire dependency tree, potentially including vulnerable components.

**Example:** A user installs `kubernetes-cli` via Homebrew. `kubernetes-cli` depends on `go`. A critical vulnerability is discovered in the version of `go` installed by Homebrew as a dependency.  Any application or system component relying on this `kubernetes-cli` installation might now be vulnerable due to the compromised transitive dependency.

**Impact:** Application vulnerabilities stemming from vulnerable dependencies, potential data breaches, service disruption, or remote code execution within the application's operational context.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Regularly Update Homebrew:**  Execute `brew update` and `brew upgrade` frequently to ensure formulae and installed packages are updated, including dependency updates that patch known vulnerabilities.
    * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement vulnerability scanning tools that can analyze installed packages and identify known vulnerabilities within the dependency chain of software installed by Homebrew.
    * **Dependency Management Tools (Complementary):** Consider using application-level dependency management tools (like `bundler`, `pipenv`, `npm`) alongside Homebrew for more fine-grained control and vulnerability tracking of application-specific dependencies, especially for development environments.
    * **Specific Package Versions (Controlled Updates):**  Where feasible and appropriate, pin specific versions of packages in your application's deployment process instead of always relying on the latest version from Homebrew. This allows for a more controlled update process and dedicated vulnerability assessment before adopting new versions.

## Attack Surface: [Download Source Compromise (Upstream Source Risk)](./attack_surfaces/download_source_compromise__upstream_source_risk_.md)

**Description:** Homebrew formulae specify download locations for software packages, often from upstream project websites or repositories. If these upstream sources are compromised, malicious software can be inadvertently downloaded and installed via Homebrew.

**Homebrew-core Contribution:** Formulae in Homebrew-core contain the download URLs for software packages. If these URLs are manipulated to point to compromised upstream servers, Homebrew will fetch and install malicious software, trusting the formula definition.

**Example:** The official download server for a popular command-line tool is compromised. The corresponding Homebrew formula, still pointing to the official (now compromised) download URL, will lead users to download and install the malicious version when they use `brew install <tool>`.

**Impact:** Installation of malware or backdoors, system compromise, potential for persistent compromise originating from seemingly legitimate software sources, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Checksum Verification (Essential):**  Strictly ensure that formulae include and that Homebrew actively verifies checksums (SHA256, etc.) for all downloaded resources. This is a critical defense against download source compromise by verifying file integrity.
    * **HTTPS for Downloads (Enforce):** Favor and, where possible, enforce the use of HTTPS for download URLs in formulae to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks during the download process.
    * **Reputable Upstream Sources (Prioritize):**  Prefer formulae that download from well-established and reputable upstream sources, such as official project websites, verified GitHub releases, or trusted mirror networks.
    * **Network Monitoring (Advanced):** For highly sensitive environments, consider implementing network monitoring to detect and alert on unusual network connections or download locations during Homebrew installations, providing an additional layer of security.
