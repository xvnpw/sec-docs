# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for homebrew/homebrew-core

## Mitigation Strategy: [Formula Auditing and Review](./mitigation_strategies/formula_auditing_and_review.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Before incorporating a Homebrew formula from `homebrew-core` as a dependency, access the formula's Ruby file directly in the `homebrew-core` GitHub repository (e.g., `Homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula/<formula_name>.rb`).
    *   Step 2: Thoroughly examine the formula file's contents, paying particular attention to sections that define package sources and installation procedures:
        *   `url`: Verify that the download URL in the formula points to the official project's repository or a reputable distribution site. Be cautious of URLs leading to personal websites or unfamiliar domains, as these could be potential sources of compromised software.
        *   `sha256`: Confirm the presence of a SHA256 checksum. This checksum is crucial for verifying the integrity of the downloaded package. Ideally, cross-reference this checksum with the official project's website or trusted sources to ensure its authenticity.
        *   `patches`: Carefully review any patches applied to the source code within the formula. Understand the purpose of each patch and ensure they originate from trustworthy sources and are relevant to your intended use of the package.
        *   `install`: Scrutinize the `install` block, which dictates the commands executed during package installation. Look for any unusual or suspicious commands, such as downloading and executing scripts from external, unverified sources, excessive modifications to system files, or attempts to escalate privileges without clear justification.
        *   `test`: Check the `test` block to assess the post-installation tests performed. Adequate tests are a good sign of formula quality and maintainability. A lack of tests or very basic tests might warrant further investigation.
    *   Step 3: If any part of the formula raises concerns or is unclear, conduct further research on the package and its maintainers. Consult security advisories, community forums, or vulnerability databases to gather more information about the package's security history and reputation within the `homebrew-core` community.
    *   Step 4: Discuss your findings and concerns with your development team and security experts. Make a collaborative decision about whether to approve the formula for use in your project based on the risk assessment.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Compromised `homebrew-core` Formula (High Severity): A malicious actor gains unauthorized access and modifies a formula within the `homebrew-core` repository to inject malicious code that will be distributed to users installing the package.
    *   Malicious Upstream Code in `homebrew-core` Package (High Severity): A formula in `homebrew-core`, even if the formula itself is not compromised within `homebrew-core`, might inadvertently package and distribute software containing intentionally or unintentionally malicious code originating from its upstream source.
    *   Supply Chain Attack via `homebrew-core` (High Severity): An attacker compromises an upstream dependency of a package hosted in `homebrew-core`. This malicious dependency is then incorporated into the `homebrew-core` package and distributed to users, effectively propagating the supply chain attack through `homebrew-core`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromised `homebrew-core` Formula: Significantly reduces the risk by proactively identifying and preventing the use of formulas that have been directly tampered with within `homebrew-core`.
    *   Malicious Upstream Code in `homebrew-core` Package: Moderately reduces the risk by increasing awareness and scrutiny of formula contents, potentially catching obvious malicious inclusions. However, it relies on manual review and might miss sophisticated or subtle malicious code from upstream sources.
    *   Supply Chain Attack via `homebrew-core`: Minimally reduces the risk. While formula review might detect blatant issues, it is unlikely to uncover deeply embedded or subtly malicious changes introduced far upstream in complex dependency chains that are then packaged by `homebrew-core`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in the general code review process where developers are expected to understand dependencies. However, a dedicated and in-depth security-focused formula auditing is not a standard, consistently applied step.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establish a formalized and documented formula security review process. This could include creating checklists, automated scripts to scan formulas for suspicious patterns, and integrating formula review as a mandatory step in the dependency addition workflow.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Binary Verification for `homebrew-core` Packages](./mitigation_strategies/binary_verification_for__homebrew-core__packages.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: When a `homebrew-core` formula installs pre-compiled binaries (often indicated by `bottle :unneeded` or explicit binary download steps in the `install` block of the formula), prioritize verifying the integrity of these downloaded binaries.
    *   Step 2: The `homebrew-core` formula should provide a `sha256` checksum for the binary. After Homebrew downloads the binary, either manually or automatically calculate the SHA256 checksum of the downloaded file on your system.
    *   Step 3: Compare the calculated checksum with the `sha256` checksum specified in the `homebrew-core` formula. For security, these checksums *must* match exactly. Any discrepancy indicates a potential issue: the binary might be corrupted during download, or, more seriously, it could have been tampered with after being published to `homebrew-core`.
    *   Step 4: If the checksums do not match, immediately halt the installation process. Do not use the downloaded binary. Investigate the checksum mismatch thoroughly. It could be due to a legitimate, recent update in `homebrew-core` where the formula's checksum hasn't yet been updated in your local Homebrew installation. However, it could also signal a serious security incident, such as a man-in-the-middle attack or a compromise of the binary distribution server used by `homebrew-core`.
    *   Step 5: Automate this binary verification process within your build scripts, deployment pipelines, or environment setup scripts. This ensures consistent and reliable integrity checks every time you install or update packages from `homebrew-core` that rely on pre-compiled binaries.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attack on `homebrew-core` Binary Downloads (High Severity): An attacker intercepts network traffic during the download of binaries from servers specified in `homebrew-core` formulas and replaces them with malicious versions before they reach the user's system.
    *   Compromised Binary Distribution Server used by `homebrew-core` (High Severity): A server hosting pre-compiled binaries that are referenced by `homebrew-core` formulas is compromised by an attacker. The attacker replaces legitimate binaries with malicious ones, which are then distributed to users through `homebrew-core`.
    *   Data Corruption of Binaries Downloaded from `homebrew-core` (Low Severity): Although less likely to be malicious, data corruption during the download process from `homebrew-core` can result in a faulty or unstable binary, potentially leading to unexpected application behavior or exploitable vulnerabilities if the corrupted binary is executed.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attack on `homebrew-core` Binary Downloads: Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring that downloaded binaries are authentic and have not been altered during transmission from the download server to the user's machine when installing packages from `homebrew-core`.
    *   Compromised Binary Distribution Server used by `homebrew-core`: Moderately reduces the risk. Checksum verification is effective in detecting compromised binaries served from a malicious server. However, if an attacker is sophisticated enough to compromise the checksum source itself (though less likely in `homebrew-core` context), this mitigation could be bypassed.
    *   Data Corruption of Binaries Downloaded from `homebrew-core`: Minimally reduces the risk by detecting corrupted downloads, preventing potential instability or issues arising from using damaged binaries obtained through `homebrew-core`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Homebrew itself performs checksum verification as a standard part of its installation process, which provides a base level of protection. However, developers might not be explicitly implementing *additional* or automated checksum verification steps in their own scripts or pipelines beyond relying on Homebrew's built-in checks for packages from `homebrew-core`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establish explicit and automated checksum verification steps in build and deployment pipelines, specifically targeting binaries downloaded as part of `homebrew-core` package installations. Define clear, documented procedures for developers to follow when checksum mismatches occur, including investigation and remediation steps.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Pinning and Locking for `homebrew-core` Packages](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_pinning_and_locking_for__homebrew-core__packages.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Instead of using the generic `brew install <formula>` command, which always installs the latest available version of a package from `homebrew-core`, explicitly specify the exact version you require using `brew install <formula>@<version>`. This ensures you are using a known and tested version.
    *   Step 2: Create and maintain a centralized dependency manifest file (e.g., a `Brewfile` or a custom configuration file in your project repository). This file should list *all* Homebrew dependencies required by your project, along with their precisely pinned versions (e.g., `formula@version`).
    *   Step 3: When setting up a new development environment, building your application, or deploying to production, use this dependency manifest to install the *exact same versions* of Homebrew packages across all environments. This promotes consistency and reduces the risk of version-related issues. Tools like `brew bundle` can automate installation from a `Brewfile`.
    *   Step 4: Implement a controlled process for updating pinned versions. Regularly review your dependency manifest and check for available updates for your pinned `homebrew-core` packages. However, *do not* automatically update versions. Instead, test updates thoroughly in a staging or testing environment before applying them to production.
    *   Step 5: Consider using or developing scripts or tools to automate the management and updating of pinned `homebrew-core` dependencies. These tools can help streamline the process of checking for updates, testing them, and updating your dependency manifest in a controlled manner.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Dependency Confusion or Substitution via `homebrew-core` Updates (Medium Severity): Unintentionally or maliciously using a different version of a dependency from `homebrew-core` than what was intended or tested. This can occur due to automatic updates or inconsistencies across environments, potentially introducing vulnerabilities, regressions, or breaking changes into your application.
    *   Regression Bugs Introduced by `homebrew-core` Package Updates (Medium Severity): Newer versions of packages in `homebrew-core`, while often containing security fixes, can also introduce unintended bugs or security regressions. Using the latest version without testing can expose your application to these issues.
    *   Uncontrolled and Unpredictable Dependency Updates from `homebrew-core` (Medium Severity): Relying on the latest versions of `homebrew-core` packages without pinning can lead to unexpected and uncontrolled updates. These updates might break application functionality or introduce vulnerabilities without proper testing and validation, making your application's behavior less predictable.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Dependency Confusion or Substitution via `homebrew-core` Updates: Significantly reduces the risk by enforcing the use of consistent dependency versions across all environments, eliminating version drift and ensuring that everyone is using the same, tested package versions from `homebrew-core`.
    *   Regression Bugs Introduced by `homebrew-core` Package Updates: Moderately reduces the risk by enabling controlled updates and thorough testing in staging environments *before* deploying to production. This allows you to identify and address regressions introduced in newer `homebrew-core` package versions before they impact users. However, it does not completely eliminate the possibility of regressions in specific versions.
    *   Uncontrolled and Unpredictable Dependency Updates from `homebrew-core`: Significantly reduces the risk by preventing automatic and potentially breaking updates of `homebrew-core` packages. Dependency pinning gives developers explicit control over *when* and *how* dependencies are updated, allowing for planned and tested updates rather than relying on unpredictable changes from `homebrew-core`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers might pin versions for some critical `homebrew-core` dependencies, especially in deployment configurations. However, a comprehensive, project-wide dependency locking strategy for *all* `homebrew-core` dependencies might be lacking, particularly in development environments.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establish a project-wide dependency locking mechanism, such as mandatory use of a `Brewfile` for all `homebrew-core` dependencies. Implement automated checks in CI/CD pipelines to ensure that pinned versions are consistently used across all environments. Define a clear and enforced process for managing and updating pinned `homebrew-core` dependencies, including testing and approval steps.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Private Tap for Sensitive or Internal Formulas as an Alternative to `homebrew-core`](./mitigation_strategies/private_tap_for_sensitive_or_internal_formulas_as_an_alternative_to__homebrew-core_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: For any sensitive internal tools, scripts, or libraries that you are considering managing with Homebrew, or for dependencies where you require a higher level of control than relying solely on `homebrew-core`, create a private Homebrew tap. A tap is essentially a Git repository that hosts your custom Homebrew formulas.
    *   Step 2: Develop Homebrew formulas for your internal packages and host these formulas within your private tap repository. This keeps your internal tooling separate from the public `homebrew-core`.
    *   Step 3: Instruct your development team to "tap" your private tap repository using the command `brew tap <your_org>/<your_tap>`. Once tapped, developers can install packages from your private tap using `brew install <your_org>/<your_tap>/<internal_package>`.
    *   Step 4: Implement a rigorous review process for *all* formulas added to your private tap. This review process should be *at least* as stringent as the formula auditing process recommended for `homebrew-core` itself. Given that these are internal and potentially sensitive tools, even greater scrutiny is warranted.
    *   Step 5: Implement strict access controls for your private tap repository. Limit who can contribute to or modify formulas within the tap. Use Git repository permissions to control access and ensure that only authorized personnel can make changes to your internal formulas.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of Internal Tools via Accidental Public `homebrew-core` Inclusion (Low Severity): Prevents accidental or unintentional publication of internal, potentially sensitive tools or scripts to the public `homebrew-core` repository.
    *   Lack of Control over Formula Content in Public `homebrew-core` (Medium Severity): Reduces reliance on the public `homebrew-core` for critical internal dependencies, giving you complete control over the formulas for these internal components. This allows for stricter security reviews and customization tailored to your specific internal needs, which is not possible when solely relying on community-maintained `homebrew-core` formulas.
    *   Dependency on Public `homebrew-core` Infrastructure for Internal Tools (Medium Severity): Decreases complete dependence on the public `homebrew-core` infrastructure for the distribution and management of your internal tools. A private tap provides an alternative, self-controlled infrastructure, enhancing resilience and reducing reliance on external systems for internal operations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of Internal Tools via Accidental Public `homebrew-core` Inclusion: Significantly reduces the risk by completely separating internal tools and scripts from the public domain of `homebrew-core`, preventing accidental leaks or exposure.
    *   Lack of Control over Formula Content in Public `homebrew-core`: Moderately to Significantly reduces the risk. By managing formulas internally, you gain full control over their content, security practices, and update cycles. This allows for more tailored security measures compared to relying on the community-driven and publicly accessible `homebrew-core`.
    *   Dependency on Public `homebrew-core` Infrastructure for Internal Tools: Moderately reduces the risk by providing an alternative distribution and management mechanism for internal tools. While still relying on Homebrew itself, you remove the dependency on the public `homebrew-core` repository and its infrastructure for these specific internal components, increasing self-sufficiency and resilience.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. The project currently relies exclusively on public `homebrew-core` for all Homebrew dependencies, including potentially some internal tooling that *could* be better managed in a private tap.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Creation of a dedicated private Homebrew tap repository. Migration of formulas for internal tools, scripts, or sensitive dependencies from direct `homebrew-core` usage to private formulas within the new tap. Establishment of a formal, stringent review process specifically for formulas within the private tap, and implementation of access controls for the private tap repository.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Formula Updates and Monitoring from `homebrew-core`](./mitigation_strategies/regular_formula_updates_and_monitoring_from__homebrew-core_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Make it a routine practice to regularly update your local Homebrew installation using the command `brew update`. This command synchronizes your local Homebrew installation with the latest formula definitions and updates from `homebrew-core` and other tapped repositories.
    *   Step 2: Periodically check for outdated Homebrew packages that are used by your project by running `brew outdated`. This command lists all installed packages that have newer versions available in `homebrew-core` or your taps.
    *   Step 3: Carefully review the list of outdated packages. For each outdated package, investigate whether an update is necessary or advisable. Pay particular attention to packages that have security-related updates or security advisories associated with their newer versions. Security updates should generally be prioritized.
    *   Step 4: Update outdated packages using `brew upgrade <formula>` to update a specific package, or `brew upgrade --formula` to update *all* outdated formulas. When updating, especially for security reasons, consider updating promptly.
    *   Step 5: After updating packages, thoroughly test your application to ensure compatibility and stability with the updated `homebrew-core` packages. Regression testing is crucial to catch any unexpected issues introduced by the updates.
    *   Step 6: Automate the process of checking for outdated packages and notifying developers or triggering update workflows within your CI/CD pipeline. This proactive approach ensures that you are regularly reminded to review and update `homebrew-core` dependencies, especially for security patches.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in Outdated `homebrew-core` Packages (High Severity): Using outdated versions of packages installed from `homebrew-core` that are known to contain security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities to compromise your application or system.
    *   Exposure to Known Exploits due to Outdated `homebrew-core` Packages (High Severity): Leaving known vulnerabilities in `homebrew-core` packages unpatched significantly increases the risk of your application being targeted by publicly available exploits that target these vulnerabilities.
    *   Lack of Security Patches in Outdated `homebrew-core` Packages (High Severity): Outdated packages from `homebrew-core` do not benefit from the latest security patches and bug fixes released by the package maintainers and the `homebrew-core` community. This leaves your application vulnerable to issues that have already been addressed in newer versions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in Outdated `homebrew-core` Packages: Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring that packages are updated to versions where known vulnerabilities have been patched by the `homebrew-core` community and upstream maintainers.
    *   Exposure to Known Exploits due to Outdated `homebrew-core` Packages: Significantly reduces the risk by proactively addressing known vulnerabilities in `homebrew-core` packages before they can be exploited by attackers using readily available exploit code.
    *   Lack of Security Patches in Outdated `homebrew-core` Packages: Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring that your application benefits from the ongoing security improvements, bug fixes, and general stability enhancements provided in newer versions of `homebrew-core` packages.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers might occasionally update Homebrew and packages manually, but a regular, systematic, and automated update process specifically for `homebrew-core` packages is likely missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establish scheduled and automated checks for outdated `homebrew-core` packages. Integrate these outdated package checks into CI/CD pipelines to provide regular visibility. Define a clear and enforced process for reviewing and applying package updates from `homebrew-core`, especially security-related updates, including testing and validation steps.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Vulnerability Scanning Specifically for `homebrew-core` Packages](./mitigation_strategies/vulnerability_scanning_specifically_for__homebrew-core__packages.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Integrate a vulnerability scanning tool into your development workflow and CI/CD pipelines that is capable of specifically analyzing your installed Homebrew packages, particularly those from `homebrew-core`.
    *   Step 2: Configure the vulnerability scanner to actively identify known security vulnerabilities (CVEs - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) that are present in the *specific versions* of `homebrew-core` packages used by your project. The scanner should be able to cross-reference your installed package versions against vulnerability databases.
    *   Step 3: Run vulnerability scans regularly. Ideally, incorporate vulnerability scanning as an automated step within your CI/CD process, ensuring that scans are performed before deploying any changes to testing or production environments. Regular scans provide continuous monitoring for newly discovered vulnerabilities in your `homebrew-core` dependencies.
    *   Step 4: Carefully review the results of each vulnerability scan. Prioritize identified vulnerabilities based on their severity (e.g., using CVSS scores) and exploitability. Focus on addressing high and critical severity vulnerabilities first, as these pose the most immediate and significant risks.
    *   Step 5: For each identified vulnerability, plan and implement a remediation strategy. This typically involves patching or updating the vulnerable `homebrew-core` package to a version that resolves the vulnerability. Consult the vulnerability scanner's recommendations and security advisories from `homebrew-core` or the package maintainers for guidance on the appropriate remediation steps.
    *   Step 6: After patching or updating vulnerable packages, re-run the vulnerability scanner to verify that the identified vulnerabilities have been successfully resolved. Continuous scanning and verification are essential to maintain a secure posture.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Known Vulnerabilities in `homebrew-core` Dependencies (High Severity): Exploitation of known security vulnerabilities present in `homebrew-core` packages that your application depends on. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to compromise your application, system, or data.
    *   Zero-Day Exploits in `homebrew-core` Packages (Medium Severity - Indirect Mitigation): While vulnerability scanning primarily focuses on *known* vulnerabilities (those with CVEs), it indirectly helps mitigate the risk of zero-day exploits. By proactively identifying and patching known vulnerabilities, you reduce the overall attack surface of your application. A smaller attack surface makes it potentially harder for attackers to find and exploit *unknown* vulnerabilities (zero-days).
    *   Compliance Violations due to Vulnerable `homebrew-core` Dependencies (Medium Severity): Using vulnerable dependencies from `homebrew-core` can lead to violations of security compliance standards, regulations, and internal security policies. Many compliance frameworks require organizations to actively manage and remediate known vulnerabilities in their software dependencies.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Known Vulnerabilities in `homebrew-core` Dependencies: Significantly reduces the risk by proactively identifying and enabling the remediation of known security vulnerabilities within the `homebrew-core` packages that your application relies upon.
    *   Zero-Day Exploits in `homebrew-core` Packages: Minimally reduces the risk. Vulnerability scanning is not a direct defense against zero-day exploits (by definition, these are unknown). However, by improving overall security hygiene and reducing known vulnerabilities, you make your system a less attractive and harder target for attackers, potentially making zero-day exploitation less likely to be successful.
    *   Compliance Violations due to Vulnerable `homebrew-core` Dependencies: Moderately reduces the risk by providing a mechanism to identify and remediate vulnerable dependencies, helping your project meet security compliance requirements related to dependency management and vulnerability patching.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. There is currently no vulnerability scanning process specifically targeting Homebrew packages, particularly those from `homebrew-core`. General application vulnerability scanning might be in place, but it is unlikely to effectively cover the specific context and nuances of Homebrew dependencies.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Integration of a dedicated vulnerability scanning tool that is specifically designed to analyze Homebrew packages (especially `homebrew-core` packages) into the project's development and CI/CD pipelines. Configuration of this scanner to accurately identify vulnerabilities in the used `homebrew-core` packages. Establishment of a clear vulnerability remediation workflow that includes reviewing scan results, prioritizing vulnerabilities, patching or updating packages, and re-verifying remediation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege Applied to `homebrew-core` Formula Execution](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_applied_to__homebrew-core__formula_execution.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: During the "Formula Auditing and Review" process, pay close attention to the commands executed within the `install` block of each `homebrew-core` formula you are considering using. Specifically, scrutinize any shell scripts or external commands that are executed as part of the installation process.
    *   Step 2: Evaluate whether the installation scripts adhere to the principle of least privilege. Ensure that they only perform actions that are strictly necessary for the package to function correctly and avoid requesting or utilizing unnecessary privileges or access to sensitive system resources.
    *   Step 3: If a formula from `homebrew-core` appears to require elevated privileges (e.g., using `sudo` within the install script), critically assess the justification for this requirement. Investigate if there are alternative installation methods or formula configurations that can achieve the desired outcome without requiring elevated privileges. Unnecessary privilege escalation increases the potential impact of any vulnerability.
    *   Step 4: If feasible and appropriate, consider modifying or patching `homebrew-core` formulas to reduce or eliminate the need for elevated privileges or any other actions that seem excessive or potentially risky during installation. (Note: Modifying `homebrew-core` formulas should be done cautiously and ideally contributed back to the `homebrew-core` project if the changes are generally applicable and improve security for all users).
    *   Step 5: When developing your own internal Homebrew formulas (if using a private tap as recommended), rigorously adhere to the principle of least privilege when writing installation scripts. Design your formulas to install packages with the minimum necessary permissions and avoid any unnecessary actions that could expand the attack surface or increase risk.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unnecessary Privilege Escalation by `homebrew-core` Formulas (Medium Severity): `homebrew-core` formulas might, in some cases, unnecessarily request or utilize elevated privileges during installation. This increases the potential damage if a vulnerability is later discovered in the installed package or the installation process itself.
    *   Malicious Actions Executed with Elevated Privileges via Compromised `homebrew-core` Formula (High Severity): If a `homebrew-core` formula is compromised (either directly within `homebrew-core` or through a supply chain attack) and the installation script runs with elevated privileges, the compromised code can perform more damaging actions on the system than it would with limited privileges.
    *   Reduced Attack Surface due to Over-Privileged `homebrew-core` Packages (Medium Severity): Packages installed from `homebrew-core` that are granted excessive privileges during installation or runtime can increase the overall attack surface of your system. Limiting privileges reduces the potential impact of a successful exploit by restricting what a compromised package can do.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unnecessary Privilege Escalation by `homebrew-core` Formulas: Moderately reduces the risk by minimizing the use of elevated privileges during package installation from `homebrew-core`. This limits the potential for privilege escalation vulnerabilities to be exploited.
    *   Malicious Actions Executed with Elevated Privileges via Compromised `homebrew-core` Formula: Moderately reduces the risk. By limiting privileges used during installation, you constrain the potential damage that a compromised `homebrew-core` formula could inflict, even if it manages to execute malicious code.
    *   Reduced Attack Surface due to Over-Privileged `homebrew-core` Packages: Moderately reduces the risk by restricting the capabilities and permissions granted to packages installed from `homebrew-core`. This limits the potential actions an attacker can take, even if they manage to compromise a package.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented through the general formula auditing process. However, the principle of least privilege might not be a specifically emphasized or consistently applied criterion during formula reviews. Developers might not always explicitly consider minimizing privileges as a primary security goal when evaluating `homebrew-core` formulas.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Explicitly incorporate the principle of least privilege as a key criterion within the formula review process for `homebrew-core` packages. Develop internal guidelines and best practices for evaluating and, where possible, modifying `homebrew-core` formulas to minimize the need for elevated privileges and unnecessary actions during installation.  For internal private taps, enforce strict adherence to the principle of least privilege when creating new formulas.
