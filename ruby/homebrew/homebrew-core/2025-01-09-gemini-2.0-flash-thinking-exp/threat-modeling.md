# Threat Model Analysis for homebrew/homebrew-core

## Threat: [Compromised Formula Definition](./threats/compromised_formula_definition.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a maintainer's account or exploits a vulnerability in the repository's workflow to modify a formula within `homebrew-core`. They might inject malicious code that downloads and executes a payload, alters application behavior, or steals sensitive information during the package installation process initiated by using `homebrew-core`.
    * **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code on the application's system, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, denial of service, or privilege escalation.
    * **Affected Component:** Formula Definition within the `homebrew-core` repository.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Homebrew and installed packages.
        * Pin specific package versions for critical dependencies.
        * Monitor Homebrew-Core security advisories.

## Threat: [Compromised Package Binary](./threats/compromised_package_binary.md)

* **Description:** An attacker compromises the build or distribution infrastructure for a package within `homebrew-core` and replaces the legitimate binary with a malicious one. When the application installs the package using `homebrew-core`, it downloads and executes the compromised binary.
    * **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code on the application's system, similar to a compromised formula, potentially leading to severe consequences.
    * **Affected Component:** Pre-compiled binaries hosted for packages within `homebrew-core`.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Verify package checksums or signatures if provided by the upstream project.
        * Monitor reports of compromised packages within the Homebrew community.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via Malicious Dependency](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_malicious_dependency.md)

* **Description:** A package within `homebrew-core` depends on another library or tool that has been compromised. The attacker injects malicious code into this dependency, which is then included when the application installs the parent package using `homebrew-core`.
    * **Impact:** The malicious code from the compromised dependency can be executed by the application, potentially leading to various security breaches.
    * **Affected Component:** Dependencies defined within the formulas of `homebrew-core` packages.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update all installed packages and their dependencies.
        * Investigate the dependencies of critical packages.
        * Utilize security scanning tools that can analyze dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Outdated Package with Known Vulnerabilities](./threats/outdated_package_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** The application relies on a package from `homebrew-core` that has known security vulnerabilities that have not been patched in the installed version available through `homebrew-core`.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service.
    * **Affected Component:**  The specific package with the vulnerability within `homebrew-core`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Homebrew and all installed packages.
        * Implement a process for tracking and addressing known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Threat: [Compromised Homebrew-Core Infrastructure](./threats/compromised_homebrew-core_infrastructure.md)

* **Description:** Attackers gain control of the servers or systems that host the `homebrew-core` repository itself. This could allow them to modify formulas and binaries at scale, impacting installations through `homebrew-core`.
    * **Impact:** Widespread compromise of applications relying on `homebrew-core`, potentially affecting a large number of systems.
    * **Affected Component:** The infrastructure hosting the `homebrew-core` repository (servers, databases, etc.).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * This is largely outside the control of individual developers, but relying on reputable and well-maintained repositories like `homebrew-core` reduces this risk compared to less established sources.
        * Monitor official communication channels for any announcements regarding infrastructure security incidents.

## Threat: [Malicious Code in Post-Install Scripts](./threats/malicious_code_in_post-install_scripts.md)

* **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into the post-install scripts of a formula within `homebrew-core`. These scripts are executed after the package is installed using `homebrew-core` and can perform actions with the privileges of the user running the installation.
    * **Impact:** Privilege escalation, execution of arbitrary commands, or other malicious activities performed after package installation.
    * **Affected Component:** Post-install scripts defined within the formulas of `homebrew-core` packages.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Review the contents of post-install scripts before or after installation.
        * Run package installations with the least necessary privileges.
        * Monitor system activity after package installations for suspicious behavior.
