## Attack Tree Path: [***High-Risk Path***: Exploit Malicious Formula](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_malicious_formula.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker introduces a formula containing malicious code or instructions into Homebrew-core. This can be achieved through two primary sub-paths:
    *   **Compromise Homebrew-core Maintainer Account (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Steps:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to a Homebrew-core maintainer's account. This can involve:
            *   Exploiting weak or default credentials.
            *   Bypassing multi-factor authentication (MFA) through vulnerabilities or social engineering.
            *   Using social engineering tactics like phishing to trick the maintainer into revealing their credentials.
        *   **Consequences:**  With a compromised maintainer account, the attacker can directly commit malicious formulas to the repository, bypassing the normal review process.
    *   **Submit Malicious Formula via Pull Request (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Steps:** The attacker submits a pull request containing a seemingly legitimate formula that hides malicious code or dependencies. This relies on:
            *   **Exploiting Review Process Weakness (Critical Node):** The attacker leverages insufficient scrutiny or lack of expertise by reviewers to get the malicious pull request merged. This could involve obfuscated code or subtle changes that are easily overlooked.
            *   **Social Engineering (Convince Reviewer):** The attacker uses social engineering techniques to convince a reviewer that the malicious formula is safe and legitimate. This could involve creating a believable backstory or exploiting trust relationships.
        *   **Consequences:** Once the malicious formula is merged, it becomes available for installation by users, potentially compromising their systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE**: Compromise Homebrew-core Maintainer Account](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_homebrew-core_maintainer_account.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE**: Exploit Review Process Weakness (Lack of Scrutiny)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_review_process_weakness__lack_of_scrutiny_.md)

            *   **Attack Steps:** The attacker leverages insufficient scrutiny or lack of expertise by reviewers to get the malicious pull request merged. This could involve obfuscated code or subtle changes that are easily overlooked.

## Attack Tree Path: [***High-Risk Path***: Exploit Vulnerable Installation Script](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerable_installation_script.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities within the installation scripts included in a Homebrew-core formula.
    *   **Script Executes Unsafe Operations (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Steps:** The installation script contains code that allows for the execution of arbitrary commands or unsafe file system operations. Common vulnerabilities include:
            *   **Command Injection:** The script incorporates user-controlled input without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject and execute malicious commands on the user's system during installation.
            *   **Insecure File Permissions:** The script sets overly permissive file permissions, allowing unauthorized access or modification of critical files.
            *   **Path Traversal:** The script uses user-controlled input to construct file paths without proper validation, allowing an attacker to access or modify files outside the intended installation directory.
        *   **Consequences:** Successful exploitation can lead to privilege escalation, gaining shell access, modifying system files, or installing persistent backdoors.

## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE**: Script Executes Unsafe Operations](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_script_executes_unsafe_operations.md)

        *   **Attack Steps:** The installation script contains code that allows for the execution of arbitrary commands or unsafe file system operations. Common vulnerabilities include:
            *   **Command Injection:** The script incorporates user-controlled input without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject and execute malicious commands on the user's system during installation.

## Attack Tree Path: [***High-Risk Path***: Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attack](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_dependency_confusionsubstitution_attack.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker tricks Homebrew into installing a malicious dependency instead of the intended legitimate one.
    *   **Formula Specifies Insecure/Ambiguous Dependency Source (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Steps:** A Homebrew-core formula specifies a dependency without clearly defining the source repository or uses a common or ambiguous name. The attacker then creates a malicious package with the same name (or a very similar name) and a higher version number on a public repository.
        *   **Consequences:** When a user installs the package, Homebrew might resolve the dependency to the attacker's malicious package due to the higher version number or lack of a specific source, leading to the installation of malware or other malicious components.

## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE**: Formula Specifies Insecure/Ambiguous Dependency Source](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_formula_specifies_insecureambiguous_dependency_source.md)

**Attack Vector:** (Covered under "High-Risk Path: Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attack")
        *   **Attack Steps:** A Homebrew-core formula specifies a dependency without clearly defining the source repository or uses a common or ambiguous name. The attacker then creates a malicious package with the same name (or a very similar name) and a higher version number on a public repository.
        *   **Consequences:** When a user installs the package, Homebrew might resolve the dependency to the attacker's malicious package due to the higher version number or lack of a specific source, leading to the installation of malware or other malicious components.

## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE**: Compromise Homebrew-core's Git Repository](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_homebrew-core's_git_repository.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the main Homebrew-core Git repository.
*   **Attack Steps:** This would involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the Git hosting platform, compromising maintainer credentials with write access, or other sophisticated attacks targeting the repository infrastructure.
*   **Consequences:**  Direct access to the Git repository allows the attacker to modify any file, including formulas, scripts, and even the Homebrew CLI itself, leading to widespread compromise of users.

## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE**: Compromise Homebrew-core's Build Infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_homebrew-core's_build_infrastructure.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises the systems used to build and package software within the Homebrew-core ecosystem.
*   **Attack Steps:** This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the build servers, compromising credentials used for the build process, or injecting malicious code into the build pipeline.
*   **Consequences:**  Compromising the build infrastructure allows the attacker to inject malicious code directly into the binaries distributed to users, affecting a large number of installations.

## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE**: Compromise Homebrew-core's CDN/Download Servers](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_homebrew-core's_cdndownload_servers.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the content delivery network (CDN) or download servers used to distribute Homebrew-core packages.
*   **Attack Steps:** This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the CDN infrastructure, compromising credentials used to manage the servers, or performing supply chain attacks targeting the CDN providers.
*   **Consequences:**  Compromising the CDN allows the attacker to replace legitimate package binaries with malicious ones, directly impacting users who download packages.
