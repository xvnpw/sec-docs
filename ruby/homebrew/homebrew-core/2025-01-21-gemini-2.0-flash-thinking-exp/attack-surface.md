# Attack Surface Analysis for homebrew/homebrew-core

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Formula:](./attack_surfaces/compromised_formula.md)

**Description:** A Homebrew formula (the recipe for installing a package) is maliciously crafted or modified to include harmful code.

**How Homebrew-core Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Our application relies on the integrity of formulas within the `homebrew-core` repository. If this repository is compromised, or a malicious pull request is merged, our application could install a compromised package.

**Example:** A formula for a common library is modified to download and execute a cryptominer during the installation process. When our application installs this dependency, the miner is also installed.

**Impact:**  System compromise, data theft, resource hijacking (e.g., CPU for cryptomining).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Pin specific versions of Homebrew packages in your application's deployment scripts or documentation to avoid automatically pulling in potentially compromised newer versions.
    * Regularly review the dependencies your application uses and be aware of any security advisories related to those packages.
* **Users:**
    * Be cautious about installing packages from untrusted "taps" (third-party repositories). Stick to `homebrew-core` when possible.
    * Regularly update Homebrew and installed packages to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Formula Execution During Installation:](./attack_surfaces/formula_execution_during_installation.md)

**Description:** Homebrew formulas often contain `install` or `post_install` scripts that are executed with user privileges. Malicious code within these scripts can compromise the system.

**How Homebrew-core Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `homebrew-core` repository hosts these formulas, and the Homebrew client executes these scripts. A compromised formula in the repository directly leads to this risk.

**Example:** A formula's `install` script contains a command to download and execute a remote script that installs a rootkit.

**Impact:** System compromise, privilege escalation, persistent malware installation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * When creating custom Homebrew formulas (if applicable), carefully review and sanitize any installation scripts.
* **Users:**
    * While difficult for the average user, reviewing the contents of a formula before installation can help identify suspicious scripts.
    * Be mindful of prompts during installation that seem unusual or request excessive permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Homebrew Client:](./attack_surfaces/compromised_homebrew_client.md)

**Description:** The Homebrew client application itself contains vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.

**How Homebrew-core Contributes to the Attack Surface:** While `homebrew-core` is the repository of formulas, the Homebrew client is the tool that interacts with it. Vulnerabilities in the client can be exploited to manipulate package installations or gain system access.

**Example:** A vulnerability in the Homebrew client allows an attacker to inject malicious commands during package installation.

**Impact:** System compromise, arbitrary code execution, manipulation of installed software.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Keep your development environment's Homebrew client updated to the latest version.
* **Users:**
    * Regularly update the Homebrew client using `brew update`.
