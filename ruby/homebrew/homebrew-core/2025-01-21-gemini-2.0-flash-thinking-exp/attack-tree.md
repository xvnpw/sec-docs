## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Compromise Maintainer Account -> Inject Malicious Code into Formula/Cask -> Exploit Compromised Formula/Cask](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_compromise_maintainer_account_-_inject_malicious_code_into_formulacask_-_exploit_co_0772b074.md)

**Compromise Maintainer Account (Critical Node):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weak credentials.
        * **Description:** Attackers attempt to gain access to a maintainer's GitHub account by guessing common passwords, using leaked credentials from other breaches, or through brute-force attacks.
    * **Attack Vector:** Social Engineering (Phishing).
        * **Description:** Attackers deceive maintainers into revealing their credentials through phishing emails, fake login pages, or other social engineering tactics.

**Inject Malicious Code into Formula/Cask (Critical Node):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Direct code injection after compromising a maintainer account.
        * **Description:** Once an attacker has access to a maintainer's account, they can directly modify the code of a formula or cask to include malicious payloads.

**Exploit Compromised Formula/Cask (Critical Node):**
    * **Attack Vector:** User installs the compromised formula/cask.
        * **Description:** Users, including the target application's deployment environment, unknowingly install the compromised package, executing the malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Vulnerability in Formula/Cask Submission/Review Process -> Inject Malicious Code into Formula/Cask -> Exploit Compromised Formula/Cask](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_vulnerability_in_formulacask_submissionreview_process_-_inject_malicious_co_852f9ff0.md)

**Exploit Vulnerability in Formula/Cask Submission/Review Process (Start of High-Risk Path 2):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Bypass Automated Checks.
        * **Description:** Attackers craft malicious code in a way that evades automated security checks implemented in the Homebrew-core submission process. This could involve obfuscation or exploiting weaknesses in the checks themselves.
    * **Attack Vector:** Exploit Human Review Oversight.
        * **Description:** Attackers submit malicious code that appears benign or is subtly hidden, relying on human reviewers missing the malicious intent or functionality during the review process.

**Inject Malicious Code into Formula/Cask (Critical Node):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Successful bypass of review process leading to malicious code inclusion.
        * **Description:**  The malicious code, having bypassed the review process, becomes part of the official formula or cask.

**Exploit Compromised Formula/Cask (Critical Node):**
    * **Attack Vector:** User installs the compromised formula/cask.
        * **Description:** Users, including the target application's deployment environment, unknowingly install the compromised package, executing the malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Compromise Homebrew Organization Account -> Compromise GitHub Repository -> Exploit Compromised Homebrew Infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_compromise_homebrew_organization_account_-_compromise_github_repository_-_exploit_c_5437a52b.md)

**Compromise Homebrew Organization Account (Critical Node):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weak credentials.
        * **Description:** Attackers attempt to gain access to the main Homebrew GitHub organization account through weak passwords or leaked credentials.
    * **Attack Vector:** Social Engineering.
        * **Description:** Attackers target individuals with access to the organization account, using social engineering tactics to obtain their credentials.

**Compromise GitHub Repository (Critical Node):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Successful compromise of the organization account grants full control over the repository.
        * **Description:** With access to the organization account, attackers can modify any part of the repository, including formulae, casks, and the Homebrew codebase itself.

**Exploit Compromised Homebrew Infrastructure (Critical Node):**
    * **Attack Vector:**  Malicious changes are pushed to the repository, affecting all users.
        * **Description:**  Attackers can introduce widespread malicious code or manipulate the repository to redirect users to compromised resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Application Using Homebrew-core](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_application_using_homebrew-core.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at any of the high-risk paths leads to this critical node being reached.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Individual Maintainer Accounts with Write Access](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_individual_maintainer_accounts_with_write_access.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting weak credentials.
        * **Description:** Similar to compromising the organization account, attackers target individual maintainers with write access.
    * **Attack Vector:** Social Engineering.
        * **Description:** Attackers use social engineering to obtain credentials from individual maintainers.
