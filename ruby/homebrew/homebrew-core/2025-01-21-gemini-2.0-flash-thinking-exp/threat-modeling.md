# Threat Model Analysis for homebrew/homebrew-core

## Threat: [Malicious Formula Inclusion](./threats/malicious_formula_inclusion.md)

**Description:** An attacker could submit a carefully crafted formula to the Homebrew-Core repository. If this formula is merged, users installing software using this formula will execute the malicious code during the installation process. The attacker might aim to install backdoors, steal credentials, or disrupt system operations.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, data theft, installation of malware on user machines.

**Affected Component:** `Formula` definition files, the `brew install` command execution logic.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Rigorous code review process for new and updated formulae within the Homebrew-Core repository.
*   Automated static analysis tools to scan formulae for suspicious patterns.
*   Community reporting mechanisms for potentially malicious formulae.
*   Users can inspect the contents of a formula before installation using `brew cat <formula>`.
*   Sandboxing or virtualized environments for testing formula installations.

## Threat: [Compromised Download Sources in Formulae](./threats/compromised_download_sources_in_formulae.md)

**Description:** An attacker could compromise the download server specified in a formula. When users attempt to install the software, they will download the compromised binary or source code from the attacker's server instead of the legitimate source. The attacker can then inject malware into the downloaded files.

**Impact:** Installation of malware, backdoors, or trojaned versions of legitimate software.

**Affected Component:** The `url` attribute within `Formula` definitions, the download mechanism within `brew install`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Verifying checksums (e.g., `sha256`, `sha1`) of downloaded files within formulae.
*   Using HTTPS for download URLs whenever possible.
*   Monitoring Homebrew-Core for reports of compromised download sources.
*   Users can manually verify checksums after downloading but before installation.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Formula Installation Logic Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_formula_installation_logic_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities might exist in the Ruby code within formulae that handles the installation process (e.g., `install` block). An attacker could craft a formula that exploits these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Homebrew process (typically user level, but can involve `sudo` for certain operations).

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution during installation.

**Affected Component:** The Ruby code within the `install` block of `Formula` definitions, the `brew install` execution environment.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Secure coding practices for formula authors.
*   Static analysis of formula installation logic.
*   Regular security audits of the Homebrew-Core codebase.
*   Users can review the `install` block of a formula before installation.

## Threat: [Compromised Homebrew-Core Update Mechanism](./threats/compromised_homebrew-core_update_mechanism.md)

**Description:** If the Homebrew-Core repository or its update mechanism is compromised, an attacker could push malicious updates to users via `brew update`. This could replace legitimate formulae with malicious ones or inject malicious code into the Homebrew environment itself.

**Impact:** Widespread compromise of systems using Homebrew-Core, including those running our application.

**Affected Component:** The `brew update` command, the Git repository for Homebrew-Core, the CDN or servers hosting the repository.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Relying on the security of the GitHub infrastructure and Homebrew-Core's maintenance practices.
*   Monitoring for unexpected changes or anomalies in Homebrew-Core updates.
*   Potentially using signed commits for the Homebrew-Core repository (if implemented).
