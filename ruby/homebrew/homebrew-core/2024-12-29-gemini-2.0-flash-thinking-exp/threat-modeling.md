### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Homebrew-core

*   **Threat:** Malicious Code Injection in Formula
    *   **Description:** An attacker, potentially a compromised maintainer or contributor with commit access to the `Homebrew/homebrew-core` repository, injects malicious code directly into a Homebrew formula file. This code is designed to execute arbitrary commands on the user's system during the installation process (`brew install`) or when the installed software is run. The attacker's goal could be to gain remote access, steal credentials, or install further malware.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, installation of persistent malware, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Homebrew-core Component:** Formula files within the `Homebrew/homebrew-core` repository.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thorough code review processes for all formula contributions and changes.
        *   Strong multi-factor authentication enforcement for all maintainers with write access.
        *   Automated security scanning of formula files for suspicious patterns before merging.
        *   Utilizing tools that analyze formula changes and highlight potential risks.
        *   Maintaining a clear audit log of changes made to formulas.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Downloadable Resources
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the server hosting the downloadable resources (source code, pre-compiled binaries) referenced by a Homebrew formula within the `Homebrew/homebrew-core` repository. The attacker replaces the legitimate resource with a malicious one. When a user installs the package, they download and execute the compromised resource, leading to system compromise.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, installation of persistent malware, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Homebrew-core Component:** The `url` and checksum attributes (e.g., `sha256`) within formula files in the `Homebrew/homebrew-core` repository that point to external resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Mandatory and verified checksum verification for all downloaded resources during the installation process.
        *   Enforcing the use of HTTPS for all resource downloads to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
        *   Regularly monitoring the integrity of hosted resources.
        *   Implementing Subresource Integrity (SRI) where applicable for web-based resources.
        *   Potentially mirroring critical resources on infrastructure controlled by the Homebrew project.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Confusion/Substitution
    *   **Description:** An attacker creates a malicious package with the same name as an internal dependency of a `Homebrew/homebrew-core` package in a public repository that Homebrew might inadvertently check. During the dependency resolution process initiated by installing a `Homebrew/homebrew-core` package, Homebrew could fetch and install the attacker's malicious package instead of the intended internal dependency.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code within the context of the installed package, potentially leading to system compromise or data access.
    *   **Affected Homebrew-core Component:** The dependency resolution mechanism within `brew install` when processing formulas from the `Homebrew/homebrew-core` repository.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Explicitly specifying the source or repository for dependencies within formulas where possible.
        *   Implementing safeguards within Homebrew to prioritize official `Homebrew/homebrew-core` packages and trusted sources during dependency resolution.
        *   Regularly auditing the dependency chains of packages within `Homebrew/homebrew-core`.

*   **Threat:** Formula Takeover/Account Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains control of a maintainer's account on the `Homebrew/homebrew-core` GitHub repository (e.g., through compromised credentials, social engineering). They can then maliciously modify formulas, introduce malicious code, or tamper with existing packages within the repository.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread distribution of malware to users installing or updating affected packages, leading to the compromise of numerous systems.
    *   **Affected Homebrew-core Component:** The authentication and authorization mechanisms for maintainers within the `Homebrew/homebrew-core` GitHub repository.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strict enforcement of strong multi-factor authentication for all maintainers with write access to the repository.
        *   Regular security audits of maintainer accounts and permissions.
        *   Implementing robust logging and monitoring of maintainer actions within the repository.
        *   Having a well-defined and rapid process for revoking access for compromised accounts.
