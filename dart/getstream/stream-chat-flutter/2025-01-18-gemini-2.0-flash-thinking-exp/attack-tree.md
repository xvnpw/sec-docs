## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in stream-chat-flutter](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_in_stream-chat-flutter.md)

High-Risk Path: Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in stream-chat-flutter
- This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses present directly within the Flutter application's code and how it interacts with the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK. Attackers target vulnerabilities that allow them to access sensitive data stored on the device or manipulate the application's behavior.

  Critical Node: Expose Sensitive Information via Client-Side Storage
  - Attack Vector: Hardcoded API Keys/Secrets in the Flutter App
    - Description: Developers unintentionally embed Stream Chat API keys or secrets directly within the application's source code.
    - Likelihood: Medium
    - Impact: High
    - Effort: Low
    - Skill Level: Low
    - Detection Difficulty: Low
  - Attack Vector: Insecure Storage of User Tokens/Credentials
    - Description: The application or the SDK stores user authentication tokens or other sensitive credentials insecurely on the device, making them accessible to malicious actors with device access.
    - Likelihood: Medium
    - Impact: High
    - Effort: Medium
    - Skill Level: Medium
    - Detection Difficulty: Medium

  Critical Node: Exploit UI Rendering Vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS in custom message rendering)
  - Attack Vector: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Custom Message Rendering
    - Description: If the application uses custom logic to render chat messages, it might be vulnerable to XSS attacks where malicious scripts are injected and executed within other users' sessions.
    - Likelihood: Medium
    - Impact: High
    - Effort: Medium
    - Skill Level: Medium
    - Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept and Manipulate Network Traffic](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_and_manipulate_network_traffic.md)

High-Risk Path: Intercept and Manipulate Network Traffic
  - This path involves attackers intercepting communication between the Flutter application and the Stream Chat backend to steal or modify data in transit.

    Critical Node: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on Unsecured Connections
    - Attack Vector: Interception of Unencrypted Traffic
      - Description: Attackers position themselves between the application and the Stream Chat server, intercepting network traffic if HTTPS is not enforced or if other insecure connections are present.
      - Likelihood: Medium
      - Impact: High
      - Effort: Medium
      - Skill Level: Medium
      - Detection Difficulty: Low

    Critical Node: Manipulate WebSocket Communication
    - Attack Vector: WebSocket Message Tampering
      - Description: Attackers intercept and modify messages being sent or received over the WebSocket connection used by the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data manipulation.
      - Likelihood: Medium
      - Impact: High
      - Effort: Medium
      - Skill Level: Medium
      - Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in the stream-chat-flutter SDK Itself](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_the_stream-chat-flutter_sdk_itself.md)

High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in the stream-chat-flutter SDK Itself
- This path focuses on exploiting inherent security flaws or bugs within the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK code.

  Critical Node: Leverage Known SDK Vulnerabilities
  - Attack Vector: Exploiting Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities
    - Description: Attackers exploit publicly known security vulnerabilities in specific versions of the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK that the application is using.
    - Likelihood: Medium
    - Impact: High
    - Effort: Low
    - Skill Level: Medium
    - Detection Difficulty: Low
