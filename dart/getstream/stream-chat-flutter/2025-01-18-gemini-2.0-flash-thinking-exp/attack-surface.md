# Attack Surface Analysis for getstream/stream-chat-flutter

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Stream API Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_stream_api_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** The application's Stream API key and potentially the API secret are exposed, allowing unauthorized access to the Stream Chat service on behalf of the application.
*   **How Stream Chat Flutter Contributes:** The `StreamChatClient` initialization requires the API key and optionally the API secret. If these are hardcoded or stored insecurely within the application's code or configuration, they become vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An attacker decompiles the application's APK or inspects the application's memory and finds the hardcoded API key. They can then use this key to send messages or create channels as if they were the application.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the Stream Chat service, potential for spamming, data manipulation, and impersonation of the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Avoid hardcoding API keys and secrets directly in the application code.
    *   **Developers:** Utilize secure key management practices, such as storing keys in environment variables or using secure storage mechanisms provided by the operating system (e.g., Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android).
    *   **Developers:** Consider using backend services to mediate access to the Stream Chat API, where the API key is securely stored on the server-side.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure User Token Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_user_token_handling.md)

*   **Description:** User authentication tokens used to interact with the Stream Chat service are generated or stored insecurely, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users.
*   **How Stream Chat Flutter Contributes:** The library relies on user tokens for authentication. If the application's token generation logic is flawed or tokens are stored without proper encryption, they can be compromised.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts network traffic and obtains a user's token. If the token has a long expiry time or is not properly invalidated upon logout, the attacker can reuse this token to access the chat as that user.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to private conversations, ability to send messages as another user, potential for reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement secure token generation mechanisms, preferably on a trusted backend server.
    *   **Developers:** Store tokens securely using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms.
    *   **Developers:** Implement proper token invalidation upon logout or session expiry.
    *   **Developers:** Use short-lived tokens and refresh tokens to minimize the window of opportunity for attackers.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The `stream-chat-flutter` library relies on other third-party libraries, which might contain known security vulnerabilities.
*   **How Stream Chat Flutter Contributes:** By including these dependencies, the application inherits any vulnerabilities present in those libraries.
*   **Example:** A dependency used by `stream-chat-flutter` has a known vulnerability that allows for remote code execution. If the application uses the vulnerable functionality, it could be exploited.
*   **Impact:**  Wide range of potential impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Regularly update the `stream-chat-flutter` library and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Developers:** Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.
    *   **Developers:** Monitor security advisories for the `stream-chat-flutter` library and its dependencies.
