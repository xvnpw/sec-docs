## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving stream-chat-flutter

This table lists high and critical threats that directly involve the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **API Key Exposure** | An attacker gains access to the Stream API key and secret, which are necessary for the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK to function. This could happen through reverse engineering the application binary where the key might be inadvertently included or through accessing compromised developer environments where the key is stored. With the key, the attacker can impersonate the application and perform actions on behalf of legitimate users. | Unauthorized access to user data, ability to send messages as other users, create/delete channels, potentially incur financial costs if the API key is tied to billing. | `StreamChatClient` initialization, API Client module | **Critical** | - **Secure Storage:** Utilize platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android) to store API keys. Avoid hardcoding them in the application code. - **Backend Proxy:** Implement a backend proxy to manage Stream API interactions, preventing the API key from being directly exposed in the client application. - **Regular Key Rotation:** Implement a process for regularly rotating API keys. - **Restrict API Key Permissions:** Utilize Stream's dashboard to restrict the permissions associated with the API key to the minimum necessary. |
| **Malicious Message Injection/Manipulation (Client-Side Rendering)** | An attacker crafts malicious messages that exploit vulnerabilities in how the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK renders or processes messages. This could involve exploiting parsing vulnerabilities in the message content, leading to UI issues, application crashes, or potentially even client-side code execution if vulnerabilities exist in the rendering logic of the SDK's widgets. | Application crashes, UI corruption, potential for client-side code execution (if vulnerabilities exist within the SDK's rendering components), social engineering attacks through misleading or malformed content. | `MessageWidget`, `MessageListController`, image/file rendering components within the SDK | **High** | - **Regular SDK Updates:** Keep the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address rendering vulnerabilities. - **Rely on Backend Sanitization (Defense in Depth):** While the SDK should handle rendering safely, ensure Stream's backend also sanitizes messages to prevent malicious content from reaching the client in the first place. - **Report Suspected Vulnerabilities:** If you identify potential rendering vulnerabilities within the SDK, report them to the GetStream team. |
| **Local Data Tampering via SDK Storage** | An attacker with physical access to the device or through malware modifies locally cached chat data managed by the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK. If the SDK uses insecure methods for local storage, this data can be easily altered, potentially affecting the user's perceived chat history or application state. | Altered chat history displayed within the application, potential for manipulating evidence or creating false narratives within the local application instance. | Local storage mechanisms used by the SDK (e.g., potentially shared preferences or local databases if not implemented securely within the SDK) | **High** | - **Utilize Secure SDK Storage Features:** Ensure the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK utilizes secure storage mechanisms provided by the platform. If the SDK offers options for encryption or secure storage, enable them. - **Regular SDK Updates:** Updates might include improvements to local data storage security within the SDK. - **Device Security Best Practices:** Encourage users to secure their devices with strong passwords/biometrics, although this is not a direct mitigation for SDK vulnerabilities. |
| **Information Disclosure through Insecure SDK Logging/Error Handling** | Sensitive information, such as user tokens or internal SDK states, is inadvertently logged or exposed through debugging mechanisms within the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK itself. If these logs are accessible (e.g., in debug builds or through insecure logging practices within the SDK), attackers could gain access to this sensitive data. | Exposure of user tokens potentially leading to account takeover, disclosure of internal SDK information that could aid in further attacks. | Logging mechanisms within the SDK, error handling components of the SDK | **High** | - **Disable Debug Logging in Production SDK Builds:** Ensure the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK disables verbose debug logging in production builds. - **Review SDK Documentation for Logging Practices:** Understand the SDK's logging behavior and ensure it aligns with security best practices. - **Report Suspected Information Leaks:** If you suspect the SDK is logging sensitive information insecurely, report it to the GetStream team. |
| **Resource Exhaustion Exploiting SDK Functionality** | A malicious user or a compromised account sends a large number of messages or performs actions that exploit inefficiencies or vulnerabilities within the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK's handling of data or network requests. This could lead to excessive device resource consumption (CPU, memory, network), causing the application to become unresponsive or crash. | Application instability, poor user experience, battery drain due to excessive SDK activity. | Message processing components within the SDK, network communication module of the SDK | **High** | - **Regular SDK Updates:** Updates might include performance improvements and fixes for resource management within the SDK. - **Implement Client-Side Rate Limiting (as a safeguard):** While the SDK should be efficient, implement client-side rate limiting to prevent users from overwhelming the SDK with requests. - **Monitor Application Performance:** Monitor application performance and resource usage to identify potential issues related to SDK behavior. |
| **Dependency Vulnerabilities within stream-chat-flutter** | The `stream-chat-flutter` SDK relies on other third-party libraries. Known vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the application if the SDK doesn't manage or update its dependencies securely. | Various impacts depending on the vulnerability, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution within the application context. | All components within the SDK that rely on vulnerable dependencies | **High** | - **Regularly Update SDK:** Keeping the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK updated is crucial as updates often include updates to its dependencies, addressing known vulnerabilities. - **Monitor SDK Release Notes:** Pay attention to the SDK's release notes for information about dependency updates and security fixes. - **Report Suspected Dependency Issues:** If you suspect a vulnerability in an SDK dependency, report it to the GetStream team. |
