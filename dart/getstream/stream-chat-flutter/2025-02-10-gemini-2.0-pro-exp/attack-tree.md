## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise User Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_user_authenticationauthorization__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most critical area, as compromising authentication allows an attacker to bypass all other security controls. It's the gateway to all other attacks.
*   **Why Critical:** Successful authentication compromise grants the attacker the same privileges as a legitimate user, potentially including administrative access.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Token Handling Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_token_handling_vulnerabilities__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  This attack path focuses on weaknesses in how user tokens are generated, stored, transmitted, or validated.  Tokens are the primary means of identifying and authorizing users in the Stream Chat system.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Token compromise directly leads to user impersonation, which has a high impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Token Leakage via Client-Side Storage [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_token_leakage_via_client-side_storage__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This focuses on vulnerabilities where the user's authentication token is exposed due to insecure storage practices on the client device.
                *   **Why High-Risk:**  If tokens are easily accessible, attackers can readily steal them and impersonate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.1 Insecure Storage of Token (e.g., LocalStorage, insecure cookies) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_1_insecure_storage_of_token__e_g___localstorage__insecure_cookies___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  This specific vulnerability involves storing the token in a location that is not designed for secure storage, such as `SharedPreferences` (without encryption), `LocalStorage` in a web view, or insecurely configured cookies.
                        *   **Why Critical:** This is a common developer error and provides a direct and easy path for attackers to obtain user tokens.  It's a low-effort, high-impact vulnerability.
                        *   **Attack Steps:**
                            1.  Attacker gains access to the device (physically or through malware).
                            2.  Attacker inspects the application's storage (e.g., using developer tools in a browser or accessing the file system on a rooted/jailbroken device).
                            3.  Attacker finds the token stored in plain text or easily decrypted.
                            4.  Attacker uses the stolen token to authenticate as the user.
                        *   **Mitigation:** Use `FlutterSecureStorage` or platform-specific secure storage APIs (e.g., Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android).  Never store tokens in insecure locations.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Account Takeover via Stream API (If API keys are compromised) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_account_takeover_via_stream_api__if_api_keys_are_compromised___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack path involves the attacker gaining access to the Stream API keys used by the application.  These keys grant full administrative access to the Stream Chat account.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Compromised API keys give the attacker complete control over the chat data and users, allowing them to perform any action, including deleting all data or creating/modifying user accounts.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            1.  Attacker obtains the Stream API key through various means:
                *   Source code analysis (if keys are hardcoded).
                *   Compromising a developer's machine.
                *   Exploiting a server vulnerability where the keys are stored.
                *   Social engineering a developer.
            2.  Attacker uses the compromised API key to make requests to the Stream API, bypassing the application's authentication.
            3.  Attacker performs malicious actions, such as:
                *   Creating new administrator accounts.
                *   Deleting or modifying user accounts and data.
                *   Reading all chat messages.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Never hardcode API keys in the application code.**
            *   Use environment variables to store API keys securely.
            *   Implement a key rotation policy.
            *   Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.
            *   Use a secrets management service (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Chat Data](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_chat_data.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.3 Send Messages as Another User](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_send_messages_as_another_user.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1 Impersonation through compromised token (See 1.1) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1_impersonation_through_compromised_token__see_1_1___high-risk_.md)

*  **Description:** If an attacker has obtained a valid user token (through any of the methods described in 1.1), they can use that token to send messages *as if they were that user*.
            * **Why High-Risk:** This attack directly undermines the integrity of the chat system and can be used for various malicious purposes, including spreading misinformation, phishing, harassment, and damaging the reputation of the impersonated user.
            * **Attack Steps:**
                1. Attacker obtains a valid user token (refer to section 1.1 for methods).
                2. Attacker uses the Stream Chat Flutter SDK (or directly interacts with the Stream API) and provides the stolen token for authentication.
                3. Attacker sends messages using the SDK's `sendMessage` (or equivalent) function. The Stream API will treat these messages as if they originated from the legitimate user associated with the token.
            * **Mitigation:** This attack is entirely dependent on preventing token compromise. Therefore, all mitigations listed under 1.1 (especially secure token storage) are crucial.
