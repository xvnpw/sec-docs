# Threat Model Analysis for getstream/stream-chat-flutter

## Threat: [Token Forgery/Theft Leading to User Impersonation (via `connectUser`)](./threats/token_forgerytheft_leading_to_user_impersonation__via__connectuser__.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains a valid user token or crafts a forged token. They then use this token with the `StreamChatClient.connectUser()` method to impersonate the legitimate user, gaining full access to their chat data and capabilities. This bypasses authentication *through the SDK*.

*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the user's account within the chat system. The attacker can read/send messages, modify profile information, and interact with the chat as if they were the legitimate user.

*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `StreamChatClient.connectUser()`: This is the *direct* point of vulnerability. The method accepts a token and establishes the user session. If the token is compromised, the SDK grants access.

*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Backend Token Generation:** *Never* generate tokens on the client. Tokens *must* be generated by a secure backend.
    *   **Secure Token Storage:** (While not *directly* an SDK issue, it's essential) Use `flutter_secure_storage` or platform equivalents.
    *   **HTTPS Enforcement:** Ensure all communication (especially token exchange) uses HTTPS. The SDK should enforce this, but verify.
    *   **Short-Lived Tokens:** Use short token expiration and a secure backend-driven refresh mechanism.
    *   **Backend Token Validation:** The backend *must* validate the token on *every* request, checking signature, issuer, audience, and expiration. This is the primary defense.

## Threat: [Message Tampering (Pre-Send, Exploiting `sendMessage`)](./threats/message_tampering__pre-send__exploiting__sendmessage__.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies the message content *before* it's passed to `StreamChannel.sendMessage()`. While input validation is a general concern, this threat focuses on the *point of entry* to the SDK. If malicious content reaches `sendMessage()`, the SDK will transmit it.

*   **Impact:** Altered messages are sent, potentially leading to misinformation, phishing, or (if rendering is vulnerable) XSS attacks on other clients.

*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `StreamChannel.sendMessage()`: This method is the *direct* point of vulnerability. It accepts the message data and transmits it.

*   **Risk Severity:** High (especially if XSS is a possibility in the rendering)

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Input Sanitization:** *Before* calling `sendMessage()`, thoroughly sanitize and validate *all* user-supplied message content. Use a robust HTML sanitization library if any HTML is allowed. This is the *primary* client-side defense.
    *   **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** If message confidentiality and integrity are critical, implement E2EE (supported by Stream Chat). This prevents tampering in transit and at rest.
    *   **Backend Validation (Defense-in-Depth):** Ideally, the backend should also perform some level of message validation and sanitization.

## Threat: [Message Tampering (Post-Receive, Exploiting UI Components)](./threats/message_tampering__post-receive__exploiting_ui_components_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the `stream-chat-flutter` UI components responsible for rendering messages (`MessageListView`, `MessageWidget`, etc.) to inject malicious code (XSS) or alter the displayed message content *after* it has been received from the Stream API. This relies on a vulnerability *within* the SDK's rendering logic.

*   **Impact:** Execution of malicious code (XSS) in the context of the receiving user's application, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other attacks.

*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `MessageListView`, `MessageWidget`, and related UI components within the `stream-chat-flutter` UI package. These are the components responsible for displaying messages.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use SDK Components Correctly:** Ensure that the `stream-chat-flutter` UI components are used as intended, following the official documentation. Avoid any custom modifications that could introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular SDK Updates:** Keep the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK updated to the latest version. This is *crucial* to receive security patches that address potential rendering vulnerabilities. This is the *primary* defense.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** If the app is embedded in a web view, use CSP to limit the types of content that can be loaded and executed. (This is a general mitigation, but relevant here).
