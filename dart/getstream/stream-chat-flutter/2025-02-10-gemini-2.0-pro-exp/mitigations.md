## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Backend Token Generation (for `stream-chat-flutter`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_backend_token_generation__for__stream-chat-flutter__.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Backend Token Generation (for `stream-chat-flutter`)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **User Authentication:**  The user attempts to log in to the application.
    2.  **Backend Validation:** Your backend verifies the user's credentials.
    3.  **Stream Token Request (Backend):**  Your backend uses the Stream *server-side* SDK.  It calls the `createUserToken` method (or equivalent) using your Stream API *secret* key.
    4.  **Token Generation (Stream Server):** The Stream server generates a signed JWT.
    5.  **Token Response (Backend):** The Stream server returns the token to your backend.
    6.  **Secure Token Delivery:** Your backend sends the token to the Flutter application over HTTPS.
    7.  **Client-Side Initialization (Flutter):** The Flutter application receives the token and uses it to initialize the `StreamChatClient`:
        ```dart
        final client = StreamChatClient(
          'YOUR_API_KEY', // Public API key, *not* the secret.
          logLevel: Level.INFO,
        );

        await client.connectUser(
          User(id: 'user-id'),
          'THE_TOKEN_FROM_YOUR_BACKEND',
        );
        ```
    8.  **Token Refresh (Backend & Client):** Your backend provides a refresh endpoint. The Flutter app periodically calls this endpoint (using `client.connectUser` again with the new token) *before* the current token expires.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:**  Client-side token generation within `stream-chat-flutter`.
        *   **Severity:** Critical.  Allows attackers to forge tokens and impersonate any user, bypassing all Stream security.
        *   **Impact:**  Completely eliminates this risk by ensuring tokens are *only* generated on the secure backend.
    *   **Threat:**  Exposure of Stream API Secret (if it were mistakenly used in the Flutter app).
        *   **Severity:** Critical.  Grants full control over your Stream application.
        *   **Impact:**  Prevents accidental exposure by ensuring the secret is *never* present in the client-side code.

*   **Impact:**  This is the *most critical* mitigation specific to `stream-chat-flutter`.  It's the foundation of secure authentication and authorization.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  [Example: Yes, implemented.  The `AuthService` in our Flutter app retrieves tokens from the `/auth/login` and `/auth/refresh` endpoints of our backend. `client.connectUser` is used with the retrieved token.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example:  The refresh logic in `AuthService` doesn't handle network errors gracefully.  We need to add retry logic and error handling to ensure the user stays connected.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Granular Permissions with Stream Roles (Used by `stream-chat-flutter`)](./mitigation_strategies/granular_permissions_with_stream_roles__used_by__stream-chat-flutter__.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Granular Permissions with Stream Roles (Used by `stream-chat-flutter`)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User Roles:** Define specific user roles beyond Stream's defaults (e.g., "standard_user," "moderator," "guest").
    2.  **Define Permissions:** For each role, determine the precise actions they can perform within Stream Chat (create channels, send messages, read messages, delete messages, etc.).
    3.  **Configure Roles (Stream Dashboard/SDK):** Use the Stream Dashboard or server-side SDK to create roles and assign permissions.
    4.  **Assign Roles in Token (Backend):**  When your backend generates the user token (see Mitigation #1), it *must* include the correct role for the user in the token's claims.  This is how `stream-chat-flutter` enforces permissions.
    5.  **`stream-chat-flutter` Enforcement:** The `stream-chat-flutter` SDK, based on the role in the token, automatically restricts the user's actions to those allowed by their role.  You don't need to write custom client-side permission checks.
    6.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review the roles and permissions in the Stream Dashboard.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:**  Overly permissive default roles within Stream.
        *   **Severity:** High.  Default roles might grant excessive permissions.
        *   **Impact:**  Reduces risk by ensuring users have only the minimum necessary permissions, enforced by `stream-chat-flutter`.
    *   **Threat:**  Unauthorized actions by compromised accounts (limited by role).
        *   **Severity:** Medium-High.  Even with a compromised token, the attacker's actions are restricted by the role in the token.
        *   **Impact:**  Limits the damage a compromised account can do, as `stream-chat-flutter` enforces the role-based restrictions.

*   **Impact:**  Implements the principle of least privilege *within the context of Stream Chat*, leveraging the SDK's built-in permission enforcement.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: We have "user" and "moderator" roles defined in Stream.  The backend sets the `role` claim in the JWT.  The Flutter app doesn't have any custom permission checks; it relies on Stream.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example: We need to add a "guest" role with read-only access.  We also need to document the exact permissions for each role more clearly.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep `stream-chat-flutter` Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep__stream-chat-flutter__updated.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Keep `stream-chat-flutter` Updated**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regular Checks:**  Periodically check for updates to the `stream-chat-flutter` package using `pub outdated`.
    2.  **Review Changelogs:**  Before updating, review the changelog for security-related fixes.
    3.  **Test Updates:**  Test updates in a development/staging environment before deploying to production. This is *crucial* for an SDK like this, as updates can affect core functionality.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:**  Exploitation of known vulnerabilities *within the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK itself*.
        *   **Severity:** Variable (Low to Critical), depending on the vulnerability.  Could range from minor UI glitches to major security flaws.
        *   **Impact:**  Reduces the risk by applying security patches provided by the Stream team.
    *   **Threat:**  Vulnerabilities in the SDK's *dependencies*.
        *   **Severity:** Variable.
        *   **Impact:** Updating `stream-chat-flutter` often updates its dependencies, mitigating vulnerabilities in those libraries.

*   **Impact:**  Directly addresses vulnerabilities within the SDK, which is essential for maintaining the security of your chat integration.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: We check for updates weekly and test in our staging environment.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example: We don't have automated alerts for new `stream-chat-flutter` releases. We should set that up.]
