# Attack Surface Analysis for getstream/stream-chat-flutter

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of API Key/Secret](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_api_keysecret.md)

*   **Description:** The Stream Chat API key and secret are used to authenticate your application with the Stream Chat service. If exposed, attackers can impersonate your application and access or manipulate your chat data.
    *   **How stream-chat-flutter contributes:** The `StreamChatClient` initialization requires the API key. If this key is hardcoded or stored insecurely within the Flutter application, it becomes a target.
    *   **Example:** An attacker decompiles the Flutter application and finds the API key hardcoded in the source code. They can then use this key to access your Stream Chat data through the Stream API.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of your Stream Chat instance, including reading messages, creating/deleting channels, and potentially accessing user data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Never hardcode the API key directly in the application.
        *   **Developers:** Utilize a backend service to handle authentication and authorization, where the API key is securely stored and not directly exposed to the client.
        *   **Developers:** Employ environment variables or secure configuration management techniques to store the API key, retrieving it at runtime.
        *   **Developers:** Consider using the Stream Chat SDK's support for user tokens generated by your backend, eliminating the need to expose the API key on the client.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of User Tokens](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_user_tokens.md)

*   **Description:** User tokens are used to authenticate individual users with the Stream Chat service. If these tokens are compromised, attackers can impersonate users and access their chat history and potentially perform actions on their behalf.
    *   **How stream-chat-flutter contributes:** The library relies on user tokens for authenticating users. If developers store these tokens insecurely (e.g., in shared preferences without encryption), they are vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a user's device and extracts the user token stored in plain text in shared preferences. They can then use this token to log in as that user and read their private messages.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, privacy breaches, potential for impersonation and malicious actions performed as the compromised user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Store user tokens securely using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android).
        *   **Developers:** Avoid storing tokens in easily accessible locations like shared preferences without encryption.
        *   **Developers:** Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms to limit the lifespan of compromised tokens.
        *   **Developers:** Consider using biometric authentication or device binding to further secure user sessions.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Communication](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers intercept communication between the Flutter application and the Stream Chat backend, potentially reading or modifying data in transit.
    *   **How stream-chat-flutter contributes:** The library handles network communication with the Stream Chat servers. If TLS certificate validation is not strictly enforced (e.g., missing certificate pinning), the application might trust a malicious certificate.
    *   **Example:** A user connects to a public Wi-Fi network where an attacker is performing a MITM attack. The attacker intercepts the communication between the user's app and Stream Chat, potentially reading messages or modifying data.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data manipulation, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement TLS certificate pinning within the Flutter application to ensure that only trusted certificates from Stream Chat are accepted.
        *   **Developers:** Ensure that the application always uses HTTPS for communication with the Stream Chat backend.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Input via Message Content](./attack_surfaces/malicious_input_via_message_content.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send specially crafted messages that, when rendered by the receiving client, can cause unintended behavior or potentially execute malicious code (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS).
    *   **How stream-chat-flutter contributes:** The library is responsible for rendering message content in the UI. If the backend doesn't properly sanitize input, and the Flutter app blindly renders it, XSS vulnerabilities could be introduced.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a message containing malicious JavaScript code. When another user's `stream-chat-flutter` application renders this message, the JavaScript code executes within the application's context.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential for UI manipulation, redirection to malicious sites, access to local storage or other application data, depending on the capabilities exposed by the rendering engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers (Backend):** Implement robust server-side input validation and sanitization to prevent the storage of malicious content.
        *   **Developers (Frontend):** Utilize the library's features for safe rendering of message content. If custom rendering is implemented, ensure proper escaping and sanitization of user-generated content.
        *   **Developers:** Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the application can load resources.
