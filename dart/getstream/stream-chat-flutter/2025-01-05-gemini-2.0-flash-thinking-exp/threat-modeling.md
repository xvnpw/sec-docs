# Threat Model Analysis for getstream/stream-chat-flutter

## Threat: [API Key/Token Exposure in Client](./threats/api_keytoken_exposure_in_client.md)

**Description:** An attacker could reverse engineer the application or intercept network traffic to extract Stream Chat API keys or user authentication tokens that are improperly stored or handled within the client-side code of the `stream-chat-flutter` library.

**Impact:**  Compromised API keys could allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of the application, potentially sending messages, creating channels, or accessing data. Stolen user tokens could allow impersonation and access to user accounts.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Module within `stream-chat-flutter`, potentially Network Communication.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Never hardcode API keys or secret tokens directly into the application code that uses `stream-chat-flutter`.**
*   Utilize secure methods for managing API keys and tokens, such as fetching them from a secure backend service after user authentication.
*   Implement certificate pinning to prevent MITM attacks aimed at intercepting credentials used by `stream-chat-flutter`.
*   Regularly rotate API keys and invalidate compromised tokens used with `stream-chat-flutter`.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Chat Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_chat_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker positioned between the user's device and the Stream Chat backend could intercept, eavesdrop on, or even manipulate chat messages being transmitted by the `stream-chat-flutter` library if the communication is not properly secured with HTTPS.

**Impact:** Loss of confidentiality of chat messages, potential manipulation of messages leading to misinformation or social engineering attacks through the chat interface.

**Affected Component:** Network Communication (using HTTP/WebSocket) within `stream-chat-flutter`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Ensure that the `stream-chat-flutter` library enforces HTTPS for all communication with the Stream Chat backend.**
*   Implement certificate pinning within the application using `stream-chat-flutter` to further protect against fraudulent certificates.
*   Educate users about the risks of using unsecured Wi-Fi networks when using the chat functionality.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The `stream-chat-flutter` library relies on other third-party libraries. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, they could be exploited to compromise the application through the `stream-chat-flutter` integration.

**Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but it could range from information disclosure to remote code execution within the context of the application using `stream-chat-flutter`.

**Affected Component:**  The specific vulnerable dependency used by `stream-chat-flutter`.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Regularly update the `stream-chat-flutter` library and its dependencies to the latest versions that include security patches.
*   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies, including those used by `stream-chat-flutter`.
