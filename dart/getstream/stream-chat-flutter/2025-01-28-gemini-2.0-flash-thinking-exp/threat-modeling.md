# Threat Model Analysis for getstream/stream-chat-flutter

## Threat: [Insecure Local Storage of Sensitive Data by SDK](./threats/insecure_local_storage_of_sensitive_data_by_sdk.md)

*   **Description:** The `stream-chat-flutter` SDK might store sensitive data like user tokens or encryption keys locally on the device without proper encryption. An attacker gaining physical access or using malware could extract this data, leading to account compromise or unauthorized access to chat resources.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to Stream Chat resources, complete compromise of user's chat account and data.
*   **Affected Component:** `stream-chat-flutter` SDK's local storage module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Thoroughly investigate the SDK's local storage implementation. If sensitive data is stored, ensure it is encrypted using platform-recommended secure storage mechanisms (like `flutter_secure_storage`). If possible, minimize the SDK's local storage of highly sensitive data and rely on secure backend services for token management.
    *   **Users:** Ensure device security best practices are followed (strong device password/PIN, avoid installing apps from untrusted sources).

## Threat: [Message Injection/Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in SDK Rendering](./threats/message_injectioncross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerability_in_sdk_rendering.md)

*   **Description:** The `stream-chat-flutter` SDK might fail to properly sanitize or escape user-generated messages before rendering them in the chat UI. A malicious user could inject malicious code (e.g., JavaScript-like code within message formatting) that would be executed within other users' chat views when rendered by the SDK.
*   **Impact:** Client-side XSS vulnerabilities within the chat application. Attackers could hijack user sessions, steal user data, deface the chat interface, or perform actions on behalf of users without their consent.
*   **Affected Component:** `stream-chat-flutter` SDK's message rendering and display module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Verify that the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK *internally* performs robust sanitization and escaping of all user-generated content before rendering. If possible, configure the SDK to use stricter content security policies. Report any observed XSS vulnerabilities to the `stream-chat-flutter` maintainers immediately. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers where applicable to further reduce XSS impact.
    *   **Users:**  Be cautious about clicking on links or interacting with unusual message formatting in chats, especially from unknown users. Keep the application and SDK updated to the latest versions.

## Threat: [Critical Vulnerabilities in `stream-chat-flutter` SDK Dependencies](./threats/critical_vulnerabilities_in__stream-chat-flutter__sdk_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** The `stream-chat-flutter` SDK relies on third-party libraries. If a critical security vulnerability is discovered in one of these dependencies, and the SDK doesn't promptly update or patch, applications using the SDK become vulnerable. Attackers could exploit these dependency vulnerabilities to compromise the application and potentially user devices.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the specific dependency vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, and more.
*   **Affected Component:** Third-party dependencies used by the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a critical vulnerability exists in a widely used dependency).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Maintain awareness of security advisories related to `stream-chat-flutter` and its dependencies. Regularly update the `stream-chat-flutter` SDK to the latest version to incorporate dependency updates and security patches. Use dependency scanning tools to proactively identify known vulnerabilities in the SDK's dependency tree.
    *   **Users:** Keep the application updated to the latest version as updates often include security fixes for underlying SDKs and dependencies.
