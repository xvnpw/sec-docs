## High and Critical DevTools Threats

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve Flutter DevTools.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Exposure of Sensitive Application State via Debugger** | An attacker with access to a developer's machine or a shared development environment could use the DevTools debugger to inspect variables and objects in memory, revealing sensitive data like API keys, temporary credentials, or PII used for testing. | Leakage of sensitive data, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or compliance violations. | **Debugger Module (Variable Inspection)** | High | - Avoid storing real sensitive data in memory during development. Use mock data or secure placeholders like environment variables or secrets management tools.- Implement mechanisms to scrub sensitive data before it's potentially visible in DevTools (e.g., custom `toString` methods that redact sensitive fields). - Restrict access to development environments and developer machines. - Educate developers on the potential for data exposure through DevTools. |
| **Modification of Application State via Debugger (Malicious Intent)** | An attacker with access could use the DevTools debugger to directly modify the application's state, trigger events, or call functions in unintended ways, potentially bypassing security checks or introducing malicious behavior during development. This could lead to vulnerabilities being inadvertently introduced into the final application. | Introduction of bugs, bypassing security measures, potential for malicious manipulation during development, leading to vulnerabilities in the final product. | **Debugger Module (State Modification, Function Calls)** | High | - Implement robust input validation and security checks within the application itself, regardless of how state is modified. - Limit access to DevTools features in sensitive environments or for less experienced developers. - Emphasize the importance of responsible use of DevTools for debugging and code exploration. - Implement code reviews to catch unintended state modifications. |
