# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for bitwarden/mobile

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Application Auto-Lock with Configurable Timeout](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_application_auto-lock_with_configurable_timeout.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Implement code within the mobile application to automatically lock the Bitwarden vault after a user-defined period of inactivity.
    2.  Develop a user interface within the application's settings to allow users to configure the auto-lock timeout duration (e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, immediately).
    3.  Ensure the application logic enforces re-authentication (master password, biometric, PIN) upon timeout to regain access to the vault.
    4.  Test and verify that the auto-lock mechanism is robust and cannot be bypassed by simple app switching or background/foreground actions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access after Device Left Unattended - High Severity
    *   Shoulder Surfing after Inactivity - Medium Severity
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access after Device Left Unattended - High Risk Reduction
    *   Shoulder Surfing after Inactivity - Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, implemented in the codebase within the "Security" settings as "Vault Timeout". The code allows users to configure the timeout duration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Consider enhancing the codebase to offer more granular timeout options or implement smart timeout logic based on context (e.g., location, network activity).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage Secure Keystore Systems for Key Storage](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_secure_keystore_systems_for_key_storage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Utilize platform-specific APIs within the codebase to interact with secure keystore systems: Android Keystore on Android and Keychain on iOS.
    2.  Implement key generation and storage logic within the codebase to store the encryption key for the local vault data in these keystores.
    3.  Ensure the code uses appropriate security parameters when generating keys and leverages hardware-backed keystore capabilities where available through platform APIs.
    4.  Refrain from implementing any code that stores encryption keys directly in application memory or the file system, bypassing the secure keystore.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Key Extraction from Device Storage - High Severity
    *   Malware Accessing Encryption Keys - High Severity
    *   Rooted/Jailbroken Device Key Compromise - Medium Severity (Keystore provides enhanced protection even on compromised devices)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Key Extraction from Device Storage - High Risk Reduction
    *   Malware Accessing Encryption Keys - High Risk Reduction
    *   Rooted/Jailbroken Device Key Compromise - Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, the codebase utilizes platform keystore APIs for key storage. This is a core security component within the mobile application code.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Continuously monitor platform keystore API updates and potential vulnerabilities.  The codebase should be updated to leverage any enhanced key protection features offered by newer OS versions and APIs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Certificate Pinning for HTTPS Communication](./mitigation_strategies/implement_certificate_pinning_for_https_communication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Implement certificate pinning logic within the network communication modules of the mobile application codebase.
    2.  Embed the expected server certificate or public key of the Bitwarden backend servers directly into the application code.
    3.  Modify the code responsible for establishing HTTPS connections to verify that the server certificate presented during the TLS handshake matches the pinned certificate or public key.
    4.  Implement error handling within the codebase to gracefully refuse connections if certificate pinning fails, preventing communication with potentially malicious servers.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Public Wi-Fi - High Severity
    *   Compromised Certificate Authorities - Medium Severity
    *   DNS Spoofing leading to Malicious Servers - Medium Severity
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Public Wi-Fi - High Risk Reduction
    *   Compromised Certificate Authorities - Medium Risk Reduction
    *   DNS Spoofing leading to Malicious Servers - Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely implemented within the networking code of the mobile application. Certificate pinning is a standard security practice for mobile apps and is crucial for Bitwarden.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  The codebase should include mechanisms for regularly reviewing and updating pinned certificates as needed. Robust error handling and potentially backup pinning strategies should be implemented in the code to handle pinning failures gracefully.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Biometric Authentication with Fallback](./mitigation_strategies/secure_biometric_authentication_with_fallback.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Integrate platform biometric authentication APIs (BiometricPrompt on Android, LocalAuthentication on iOS) into the codebase.
    2.  Develop code to use biometric authentication as an alternative unlock method after auto-lock or initial app launch, triggered by user choice.
    3.  Ensure the code securely integrates biometric authentication and does not expose sensitive data during the authentication flow.
    4.  Implement code to always provide a fallback authentication method using the master password in case biometric authentication fails or is unavailable.
    5.  Include user interface elements and code to clearly communicate the role of biometric authentication as a convenience feature and the master password as the primary security key.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Weak PIN/Password Usage for Frequent Unlocks - Medium Severity (Biometrics offer stronger authentication in many cases)
    *   Shoulder Surfing during Password Entry - Low Severity (Biometrics can be faster and less visible)
    *   Brute-Force Attacks on Lock Screen PIN/Password (Indirectly mitigated by encouraging stronger primary password) - Low Severity
*   **Impact:**
    *   Weak PIN/Password Usage for Frequent Unlocks - Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Shoulder Surfing during Password Entry - Low Risk Reduction
    *   Brute-Force Attacks on Lock Screen PIN/Password - Low Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, the codebase includes biometric unlock functionality as a user option.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  The codebase should be continuously updated to reflect best practices for biometric authentication security. Consider implementing code-level mitigations for biometric bypass techniques and presentation attacks, and enhance user education within the app about biometric security limitations.

    2.  Implement certificate pinning within the codebase as described in its dedicated mitigation strategy.
    3.  Remove or disable any legacy HTTP communication code paths from the codebase.
    4.  Implement network security policies within the application code to programmatically enforce HTTPS and prevent accidental downgrade to HTTP connections.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks - High Severity
    *   Data Interception and Eavesdropping - High Severity
    *   Credential Theft during Transmission - High Severity
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks - High Risk Reduction
    *   Data Interception and Eavesdropping - High Risk Reduction
    *   Credential Theft during Transmission - High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, HTTPS enforcement and certificate pinning are likely implemented within the network communication code of the mobile application.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Regularly audit the codebase and network configurations to ensure HTTPS enforcement and certificate pinning remain active and correctly configured. Implement automated tests within the codebase to verify HTTPS and pinning are always in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Requested Permissions and Explain Rationale](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_requested_permissions_and_explain_rationale.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Conduct a review of the application manifest and code to identify all requested permissions.
    2.  Remove any permission requests from the manifest and codebase that are not strictly essential for the core functionality of the application.
    3.  For each remaining permission, implement user interface elements and code to provide clear and concise explanations to the user within the application (e.g., during permission request dialogs, in a privacy/permissions settings section). Explain *why* each permission is needed and *how* it is used by the application.
    4.  Implement runtime permission request logic within the code (where applicable) and develop code to gracefully handle scenarios where users deny permissions, ensuring core functionality remains available or providing clear guidance on limitations within the application.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Privacy Violation through Unnecessary Data Access - Medium Severity
    *   Over-Privileged Application in Case of Compromise - Medium Severity
    *   User Mistrust and Reluctance to Install - Low Severity
*   **Impact:**
    *   Privacy Violation through Unnecessary Data Access - Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Over-Privileged Application in Case of Compromise - Medium Risk Reduction
    *   User Mistrust and Reluctance to Install - Low Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely partially implemented. The codebase probably requests only necessary permissions, but the level of in-app user explanation and graceful handling of denied permissions can be improved through code changes and UI enhancements.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  A dedicated permission audit should be conducted on the codebase. Code should be added to provide clear in-app explanations for each permission. The application logic should be enhanced to gracefully handle denied permissions and maintain a usable user experience.
