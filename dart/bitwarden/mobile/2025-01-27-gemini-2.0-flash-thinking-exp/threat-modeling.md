# Threat Model Analysis for bitwarden/mobile

## Threat: [Physical Device Compromise (Loss or Theft)](./threats/physical_device_compromise__loss_or_theft_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains physical access to a lost or stolen device. They might attempt to bypass device lock screen (if weak or disabled) or access the device if left unlocked.
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Bitwarden application and the user's password vault. This can lead to identity theft, account compromise, and data breaches.
**Affected Component:** Device Lock Screen, Local Data Storage, Application Access Control
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    **Developers:**
        *   Implement strong application lock with master password or biometrics.
        *   Ensure data at rest encryption is robust.
    **Users:**
        *   Use strong device lock screen (PIN, password, biometrics).
        *   Enable device encryption.
        *   Enable application lock within Bitwarden.

## Threat: [Malware Infection on the Device](./threats/malware_infection_on_the_device.md)

**Description:** Malware (e.g., keylogger, screen recorder, clipboard monitor) is installed on the device, potentially through malicious apps, phishing, or compromised websites. Malware can monitor user activity and steal data.
**Impact:** Stealing the master password, vault data, intercepting autofill operations, or capturing screenshots of sensitive information within Bitwarden.
**Affected Component:** Input Methods (Keyboard), Screen Display, Clipboard, Application Process Memory
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    **Developers:**
        *   Implement anti-tampering and root/jailbreak detection measures.
        *   Use secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities that malware could exploit.
    **Users:**
        *   Install apps only from official app stores.
        *   Be cautious of phishing links and suspicious websites.
        *   Keep the device operating system and apps updated.
        *   Use a reputable mobile security solution (antivirus/anti-malware).

## Threat: [Compromised Operating System](./threats/compromised_operating_system.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the mobile operating system (Android or iOS) to gain unauthorized access. This could involve zero-day exploits or unpatched vulnerabilities in older OS versions.
**Impact:** Similar to malware infection, potentially leading to data theft, application compromise, or privilege escalation to access Bitwarden data.
**Affected Component:** Operating System Kernel, System Libraries, Platform APIs
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    **Developers:**
        *   Keep up-to-date with OS security updates and best practices.
    **Users:**
        *   Keep the device operating system updated to the latest version with security patches.
        *   Avoid using outdated or unsupported operating system versions.

## Threat: [Insecure Local Data Storage](./threats/insecure_local_data_storage.md)

**Description:** Sensitive data, even temporarily, is stored insecurely on the device, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access. This could be due to weak encryption implementation, key management issues, or logging sensitive data.
**Impact:** Potential exposure of vault data if local storage is compromised, even if the device is not lost or stolen, but accessed by malware or through OS vulnerabilities.
**Affected Component:** Local Database, File System, Encryption Modules, Logging Functions
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    **Developers:**
        *   Use robust and well-vetted encryption libraries for data at rest.
        *   Implement secure key management practices.
        *   Minimize local data storage and securely erase temporary files.
