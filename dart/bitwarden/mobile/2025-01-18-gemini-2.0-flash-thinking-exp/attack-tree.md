## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Local Data Storage](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_local_data_storage.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target the way the Bitwarden mobile application stores sensitive data (the vault) on the device.
* **Critical Node: Exploit: Inadequate Encryption of Vault Data on Device**
    * **Attacker Action:** The attacker attempts to access the local storage of the mobile device where Bitwarden stores its data. They analyze the files to find the vault data. If the encryption is weak or non-existent, they can directly read the sensitive information.
    * **Potential Impact:** Complete compromise of the user's Bitwarden vault, exposing all usernames, passwords, notes, and other stored information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Mobile Device (Malware Infection)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_mobile_device__malware_infection_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker aims to infect the user's mobile device with malware.
* **Critical Node: Exploit: Keylogging**
    * **Attacker Action:** Once malware is installed, a keylogger component can record every keystroke made by the user. This allows the attacker to capture the user's Bitwarden master password when they enter it to unlock the application.
    * **Potential Impact:** Complete compromise of the user's Bitwarden vault after obtaining the master password.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Mobile Device (Physical Access)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_mobile_device__physical_access_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker gains physical access to the user's unlocked mobile device.
* **Critical Node: Exploit: Unlocked Device Exploitation**
    * **Attacker Action:** If the user leaves their device unlocked, the attacker can simply open the Bitwarden application and access the vault directly.
    * **Potential Impact:** Immediate and complete compromise of the user's Bitwarden vault.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Targeting Mobile Users (SMS Phishing)](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_targeting_mobile_users__sms_phishing_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker uses social engineering techniques, specifically SMS phishing (smishing), to trick the user.
* **Critical Node: Exploit: SMS Phishing (Smishing)**
    * **Attacker Action:** The attacker sends a deceptive SMS message pretending to be a legitimate entity (e.g., Bitwarden support). The message might contain a link to a fake login page or request the user's master password directly.
    * **Potential Impact:** If the user falls for the scam and enters their master password on the fake page or provides it directly, the attacker gains access to their vault.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit: Improper Input Validation (e.g., during login, unlock)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_improper_input_validation__e_g___during_login__unlock_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker attempts to exploit weaknesses in how the application handles user input, particularly during the login or vault unlock process.
* **Attacker Action:** The attacker provides unexpected or malicious input (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) into the login or unlock fields. If the application doesn't properly validate this input, it could lead to bypassing authentication or executing arbitrary code.
* **Potential Impact:** Bypassing authentication and gaining direct access to the user's vault without knowing the correct credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit: Bypassing Biometric Lock with Spoofed Biometrics](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_bypassing_biometric_lock_with_spoofed_biometrics.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker attempts to bypass the biometric authentication mechanism used to unlock the Bitwarden application.
* **Attacker Action:** The attacker uses fake fingerprints, facial scans, or other spoofing techniques to trick the biometric sensor into authenticating them as the legitimate user. This could involve creating fake fingerprints or using sophisticated methods to mimic the user's face.
* **Potential Impact:** Gaining unauthorized access to the Bitwarden application and the user's vault by bypassing the intended security measure.
