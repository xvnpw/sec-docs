# Attack Surface Analysis for bitwarden/mobile

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Local Data Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_local_data_storage.md)

**Description:** Sensitive data, including the encrypted vault, is stored locally on the mobile device.
*   **How Mobile Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mobile devices are more susceptible to physical theft or loss compared to desktop environments. The operating system's security features and the application's implementation are the primary defenses.
*   **Example:** An attacker steals an unlocked phone and is able to bypass the application's lock screen or find vulnerabilities in the OS to access the encrypted vault data.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the user's password vault, leading to unauthorized access to all stored credentials and sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Utilize platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain) with strong encryption.
        *   Implement robust key management practices, ensuring encryption keys are securely stored and protected.
        *   Consider additional layers of encryption or obfuscation for sensitive data at rest.
        *   Implement mechanisms to detect and respond to potential tampering or unauthorized access attempts.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Enable strong device lock screen security (PIN, pattern, biometric).
        *   Keep the device operating system updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Avoid rooting or jailbreaking the device, as this can weaken security measures.
        *   Enable full-disk encryption on the device if available.

## Attack Surface: [Clipboard Exposure](./attack_surfaces/clipboard_exposure.md)

**Description:** When users copy usernames, passwords, or other sensitive information from the Bitwarden app, this data is temporarily stored in the device's clipboard.
*   **How Mobile Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mobile operating systems often have clipboard history features or allow other applications to access the clipboard, increasing the window of opportunity for malicious apps to steal this data.
*   **Example:** A user copies a password from Bitwarden. A malicious app running in the background monitors the clipboard and captures the copied password.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of individual credentials or other sensitive information copied from the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement a short timeout for copied data to remain in the clipboard before being automatically cleared.
        *   Consider using platform-specific APIs to mark clipboard data as sensitive, preventing other apps from accessing it (though OS support varies).
        *   Warn users about the risks of copying sensitive information to the clipboard.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Be mindful of what applications are installed on their device and their permissions.
        *   Avoid copying sensitive information unless absolutely necessary.
        *   Manually clear the clipboard after copying sensitive data.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Autofill Functionality](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_autofill_functionality.md)

**Description:** The autofill feature relies on inter-process communication to interact with other applications and input credentials.
*   **How Mobile Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The mobile environment involves numerous applications interacting, creating opportunities for malicious apps to exploit vulnerabilities in the autofill implementation or the communication channels used.
*   **Example:** A malicious application exploits a vulnerability in the Bitwarden autofill service to inject malicious data into form fields or steal credentials intended for legitimate applications.
*   **Impact:** Potential for credential theft, account takeover, or injection of malicious data into other applications.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Strictly validate the target application and the context in which autofill is requested.
        *   Secure the communication channels used for autofill (e.g., using platform-provided secure mechanisms).
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
        *   Follow platform best practices for implementing autofill services (e.g., using Accessibility Service responsibly on Android, AutoFill framework on iOS).
    *   **Users:**
        *   Grant autofill permissions only to trusted applications.
        *   Be cautious when using autofill on unfamiliar or suspicious websites or applications.
        *   Regularly review the applications with autofill permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Biometric Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/biometric_authentication_bypass.md)

**Description:** The application uses biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint, face unlock) for added security.
*   **How Mobile Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in the implementation of biometric authentication or weaknesses in the device's biometric security can be exploited to bypass this security layer.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in the device's fingerprint sensor or the Bitwarden app's biometric authentication implementation to gain access without proper authorization.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application and the user's password vault.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Utilize platform-provided biometric authentication APIs and follow security best practices.
        *   Implement fallback mechanisms (e.g., master password) in case biometric authentication fails or is unavailable.
        *   Regularly update the biometric authentication implementation to address known vulnerabilities.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly based on biometric authentication success without additional security measures.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Enable strong biometric security on their device.
        *   Be aware of potential vulnerabilities in their device's biometric system.
        *   Use a strong master password as a backup authentication method.
