# Threat Model Analysis for bitwarden/mobile

## Threat: [Insecure Local Storage](./threats/insecure_local_storage.md)

**Description:** An attacker with physical access to the unlocked device or who has exploited an OS vulnerability could access the device's file system and potentially retrieve the encrypted vault data or other sensitive information if stored insecurely by the mobile application. They might use forensic tools or exploit known vulnerabilities to bypass file system protections.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the user's Bitwarden vault, including all stored credentials, notes, and other sensitive data.
*   **Affected Component:** Local Storage Module (within the mobile application, responsible for storing the encrypted vault and other application data).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Utilize strong, OS-provided encryption mechanisms for local storage (e.g., Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android) within the mobile application. Ensure proper key management and protection, potentially leveraging hardware-backed security features. Implement secure file permissions to restrict access to the application's data directory. Regularly review and audit local storage implementation for vulnerabilities within the mobile application's code.

## Threat: [Device Compromise via Malware](./threats/device_compromise_via_malware.md)

**Description:** An attacker could install malware on the user's device through various means. This malware could then directly interact with the Bitwarden mobile application, keylog the master password as it's entered within the app, intercept decrypted data during auto-fill operations performed by the app, or even exfiltrate the entire encrypted vault stored by the app.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the user's Bitwarden vault and potentially other sensitive data on the device.
*   **Affected Component:** Entire Application (as malware can interact with various parts of the mobile app depending on its capabilities), particularly the Auto-fill Service and UI components involved in password entry and display within the mobile app.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement runtime application self-protection (RASP) techniques within the mobile application to detect and potentially prevent malicious activities. Implement code obfuscation within the mobile application to make reverse engineering and malware analysis more difficult. Regularly scan the mobile application's code for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Lost or Stolen Device - Brute-Force Attack](./threats/lost_or_stolen_device_-_brute-force_attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker who has obtained a lost or stolen device could attempt to brute-force the device's lock screen and then the Bitwarden master password directly within the mobile application to gain access to the vault.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the user's Bitwarden vault.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication Module (within the mobile application, responsible for handling master password login).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strong rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms within the mobile application after a certain number of failed master password attempts. Encourage users to set strong and unique master passwords through UI guidance within the app.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries.md)

**Description:** The Bitwarden mobile application relies on various third-party libraries. If these libraries contain security vulnerabilities, attackers could exploit them to compromise the mobile application directly.
*   **Impact:** Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution within the mobile app, data breaches affecting data handled by the mobile app, or denial of service of the mobile application.
*   **Affected Component:** Dependencies Management (the process of including and managing third-party libraries within the mobile application).
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the severity of the vulnerability in the library, prioritizing those with High severity).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Maintain a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for the mobile application. Regularly update third-party libraries to their latest secure versions within the mobile application. Implement security scanning and vulnerability management processes specifically for the mobile application's dependencies. Use dependency management tools to track and update libraries used by the mobile app.

## Threat: [Reverse Engineering and Code Tampering](./threats/reverse_engineering_and_code_tampering.md)

**Description:** Attackers could reverse engineer the Bitwarden mobile application to understand its inner workings, identify vulnerabilities in its code, or tamper with the code to introduce malicious functionality or bypass security checks within the mobile app. They might then redistribute the tampered application.
*   **Impact:** Discovery of security flaws within the mobile application, creation of malicious clones of the mobile app, or distribution of modified mobile applications that could steal user data.
*   **Affected Component:** Entire Application Codebase (of the mobile application).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Employ code obfuscation techniques within the mobile application to make reverse engineering more difficult. Implement integrity checks within the mobile application to detect tampering. Utilize platform security features to protect against debugging and reverse engineering of the mobile app.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Biometric Data](./threats/insecure_handling_of_biometric_data.md)

**Description:** If the mobile application uses biometric authentication (fingerprint, face unlock), vulnerabilities in how this data is handled *within the application itself* could allow an attacker to bypass biometric authentication and gain unauthorized access to the app.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the mobile application.
*   **Affected Component:** Biometric Authentication Module (within the mobile application).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Rely on the platform's secure biometric authentication APIs and avoid storing raw biometric data within the mobile application. Follow platform best practices for biometric authentication implementation within the app.

## Threat: [Deep Links and URI Handling Vulnerabilities](./threats/deep_links_and_uri_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Improper handling of deep links or custom URI schemes *within the mobile application* could allow a malicious website or application to craft a specific link that, when opened, triggers unintended actions within the Bitwarden app, potentially leading to data leakage or unauthorized operations performed by the app.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration initiated by the mobile application, unauthorized actions within the application (e.g., triggering password changes).
*   **Affected Component:** Deep Link/URI Handling Logic (within the mobile application).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Carefully validate and sanitize all input received through deep links and URI schemes within the mobile application. Implement proper authorization checks for actions triggered by deep links within the app. Avoid performing sensitive actions directly based on deep link parameters without user confirmation within the app.
