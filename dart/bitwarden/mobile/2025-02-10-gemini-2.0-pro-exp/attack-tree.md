## Attack Tree Path: [1. Physical Access to Unlocked Device [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__physical_access_to_unlocked_device__high_risk_.md)

**Description:** The attacker gains physical possession of the user's device while it is unlocked and the Bitwarden app is either already open or easily accessible.
    **Vectors:**
        *   **1.1.1.1 Directly Access Vault Data [CRITICAL]:** If the app is open and unlocked, the attacker has immediate access to all stored credentials.
        *   **1.1.2 Bypass PIN/Biometric [HIGH RISK]:** If a PIN or biometric lock is enabled, but weak, the attacker attempts to bypass it.
            *   **1.1.2.1 Guess PIN [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL]:**  Trying common PINs (1234, 0000, etc.) or short PINs.
            *   **1.1.2.2 Smudge Attack [CRITICAL]:**  Examining the screen for fingerprint traces to deduce the unlock pattern or PIN.
            *   **1.1.2.3 Shoulder Surfing [CRITICAL]:**  Observing the user entering their PIN or unlock pattern.
            *   **1.1.2.4 Biometric Spoofing [CRITICAL]:**  Using a fake fingerprint, photograph, or other method to bypass biometric authentication.
        *   **1.1.3.1 Maintain Persistent Access [CRITICAL]:** Disabling the auto-lock feature or setting a very long timeout to keep the device unlocked.
    *   **1.3.1 "Evil Maid" Attack - Copy Vault Data [CRITICAL]:** Gaining temporary physical access to copy the vault data to external storage or the cloud.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise Device Operating System (OS) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_device_operating_system__os___high_risk_.md)

*   **2.1 Exploit OS Vulnerability (Zero-Day or Unpatched) [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the mobile operating system (Android or iOS) to gain elevated privileges.
    *   **Vectors:**
        *   **2.1.1 Gain Root/System Privileges [CRITICAL]:**  Achieving full control over the device, bypassing security mechanisms.
            *   **2.1.1.1/2/3 Access App Data/Keylogger/Modify App [CRITICAL]:**  Directly accessing Bitwarden's data, installing a keylogger to capture the master password, or modifying the app's code to disable security features.

*   **2.2 Malware/Spyware Infection [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** The user's device is infected with malicious software.
    *   **Vectors:**
        *   **2.2.1 Phishing/Malicious App Installation [HIGH RISK]:**  Tricking the user into installing a malicious app or clicking a malicious link.
            *   **2.2.1.1 User Tricked / 2.2.1.2 Drive-by Download:**  Social engineering or exploiting browser vulnerabilities to install malware.
        *   **2.2.2/3/4 Keylogger/Screen Recorder/Data Exfiltration/Credential Stealing [CRITICAL]:**  The malware captures keystrokes (including the master password), records the screen, sends data to the attacker, or specifically targets Bitwarden credentials.

* **2.3 Compromised Device Management (MDM/EMM)**
    * **Description:** Attacker gains control over device via malicious MDM profile or vulnerability.
    * **Vectors:**
        * **2.3.1 Rogue Profile / 2.3.2 Exploit MDM [CRITICAL]:** Remotely access or control device, potentially accessing Bitwarden data.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Network-Based Attacks (Specific to Mobile) [HIGH RISK (Specific Cases)]](./attack_tree_paths/3__network-based_attacks__specific_to_mobile___high_risk__specific_cases__.md)

*   **3.1 Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker intercepts network traffic between the Bitwarden app and the Bitwarden servers.
    * **Vectors:**
        *   **3.1.2 Rogue Access Point [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL]:**  The attacker sets up a fake Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate network.  If the user connects, the attacker can intercept their traffic.

*   **3.2 Compromised DNS Server:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker controls the DNS server the device uses, allowing them to redirect traffic.
    *   **Vectors:**
        *   **3.2.1 Redirect to Malicious Server [CRITICAL]:**  Directing Bitwarden API requests to a fake server controlled by the attacker, potentially leading to a phishing attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Bitwarden Mobile App Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK (Specific Cases)]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_bitwarden_mobile_app_vulnerabilities__high_risk__specific_cases__.md)

*   **4.1 Improper Input Validation / 4.4 Code Injection [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:**  The attacker crafts malicious input that exploits a vulnerability in the app's input handling, potentially leading to code execution.
    *   **Impact:**  If successful, this could allow the attacker to bypass security checks, access data, or even gain control of the app.

*   **4.2 Insecure Data Storage [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:**  The app stores sensitive data (like the encrypted vault or encryption keys) insecurely, making it accessible to other apps or attackers with device access.
    *   **Impact:**  If the vault data is not properly encrypted at rest, an attacker could access it directly.

*   **4.3 Weak Authentication/Authorization [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Description:**  The app's authentication mechanisms are flawed, allowing attackers to bypass them.
    *   **Vectors:**
        *   **4.3.1 Bypass Biometric [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL]:**  Exploiting a flaw in the biometric authentication implementation to gain access without valid biometric data.
        *   **4.3.2 Weak PIN [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL]:**  Using a weak or easily guessable PIN, or exploiting a lack of rate limiting to brute-force the PIN.
*   **4.5 Improper Session Management**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to hijack or manipulate user sessions.
    *   **Vectors:**
        *   **4.5.1 Session Fixation [CRITICAL]:**  Attacker sets the session ID before the user authenticates, allowing them to hijack the session after authentication.
