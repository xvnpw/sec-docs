Okay, let's create a design document for the Bitwarden mobile application based on the provided GitHub repository.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a secure and user-friendly password management solution for mobile users.
*   Maintain feature parity with Bitwarden's offerings on other platforms (browser extensions, desktop applications).
*   Ensure cross-platform compatibility and synchronization of user data.
*   Offer both free and premium subscription options, catering to a wide range of users.
*   Maintain a high level of user trust and confidence in the security of their sensitive data.
*   Enable users to securely store and manage passwords, notes, credit card information, and identities.
*   Provide convenient access to credentials through autofill functionality on mobile devices.
*   Support biometric authentication for enhanced security and ease of use.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Compromise of user credentials due to vulnerabilities in the mobile application.
*   Data breaches resulting from server-side vulnerabilities or attacks.
*   Loss of user data due to synchronization issues or data corruption.
*   Reputational damage caused by security incidents or negative user experiences.
*   Inability to meet user expectations for features, performance, or usability.
*   Violation of user privacy due to inadequate data protection measures.
*   Failure to comply with relevant security and privacy regulations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: End-to-end encryption: User data is encrypted on the client-side before being transmitted to Bitwarden's servers, ensuring that only the user can decrypt and access their information. Implemented in application logic.
*   security control: Zero-knowledge encryption: Bitwarden claims to have no knowledge of user master passwords or the encryption keys used to protect user data. Implemented in application logic.
*   security control: Use of strong cryptographic algorithms: Bitwarden uses industry-standard encryption algorithms such as AES-256 and PBKDF2-SHA256. Implemented in application logic.
*   security control: Two-factor authentication (2FA): Users can enable 2FA to add an extra layer of security to their accounts. Implemented in application logic and server side.
*   security control: Biometric authentication: The mobile app supports biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint and facial recognition. Implemented in application logic.
*   security control: Autofill functionality: The app integrates with the mobile operating system's autofill framework to securely fill in credentials in other apps and browsers. Implemented in application logic.
*   security control: Secure storage of encryption keys: The app securely stores encryption keys on the device, using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms. Implemented in application logic.
*   security control: Regular security audits and penetration testing: Bitwarden undergoes regular security assessments by third-party security firms. Described in public documentation.
*   security control: Open-source codebase: The mobile app's codebase is open source, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Described in public documentation.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on the security of the underlying mobile operating system: The app's security is ultimately dependent on the security of the mobile OS and the device itself.
*   accepted risk: Potential for user error: Users may choose weak master passwords or disable security features, increasing their risk of compromise.
*   accepted risk: Limited control over third-party integrations: The app integrates with third-party services (e.g., for 2FA), which may have their own security vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   Integrate with a mobile threat detection (MTD) solution to detect and respond to device-level threats.
*   Provide options for more granular control over data synchronization, such as selective sync or offline-only mode.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support strong password policies, including minimum length, complexity, and history requirements.
    *   Implement secure password reset mechanisms, such as email-based verification or security questions.
    *   Protect against brute-force attacks by implementing account lockout or rate-limiting mechanisms.
    *   Offer multiple 2FA options, including TOTP, email, and hardware security keys.
*   Authorization:
    *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive features or data based on user roles.
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege, granting users only the minimum necessary permissions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.
    *   Sanitize user data before displaying it to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement input length restrictions to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms for all sensitive data, both in transit and at rest.
    *   Use secure random number generators for all cryptographic operations.
    *   Regularly update cryptographic libraries to address known vulnerabilities.
    *   Protect encryption keys using secure key management practices.
