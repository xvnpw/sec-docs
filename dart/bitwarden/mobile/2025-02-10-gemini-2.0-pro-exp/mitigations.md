# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for bitwarden/mobile

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enhanced Biometric Authentication & Secure Fallback](./mitigation_strategies/enhanced_biometric_authentication_&_secure_fallback.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Mobile Biometric APIs:** Utilize platform-specific biometric APIs (Android's BiometricPrompt, iOS's LocalAuthentication framework).  This is inherently mobile-specific.
2.  **Strongest Available Biometrics:** Prioritize the strongest biometric method available on the *specific mobile device*.
3.  **Secure Fallback (Mobile Context):**  Enforce a strong passphrase (not a simple PIN) as the fallback, recognizing the increased risk of physical access on mobile.
4.  **Mobile-Specific Timeouts:** Configure timeouts for biometric re-authentication based on mobile usage patterns (e.g., after device reboot, after a period of inactivity *on the mobile device*).
5.  **Liveness Detection (Mobile):** Implement liveness checks for facial recognition on mobile, leveraging the device's camera.
6.  **Mobile User Configuration:** Allow users to enable/disable biometrics and configure timeouts *within the mobile app*.
7.  **Mobile-Focused Education:** Provide clear in-app guidance *on the mobile device* about the security implications.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (Mobile - High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access to the vault on a compromised or lost/stolen *mobile device*.
*   **Biometric Spoofing (Mobile - Medium Severity):** Liveness detection on the mobile device reduces the risk.
*   **Weak PIN Bypass (Mobile - High Severity):** Eliminates the vulnerability of a weak PIN on a physically accessible mobile device.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (Mobile):** Significantly reduces risk (High Impact).
*   **Biometric Spoofing (Mobile):** Moderately reduces risk (Medium Impact).
*   **Weak PIN Bypass (Mobile):** Eliminates risk (High Impact).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Biometric authentication (fingerprint, face) is implemented on both Android and iOS (inherently mobile).
*   Fallback to master password is implemented.
*   Mobile-specific timeouts are likely implemented.
*   Liveness detection is likely implemented (mobile-specific).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Explicit enforcement of a *strong passphrase* as the mobile fallback (distinct from the master password).
*   More granular mobile-specific biometric settings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Remote Wipe & Data Self-Destruct (Mobile Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/remote_wipe_&_data_self-destruct__mobile_focus_.md)
