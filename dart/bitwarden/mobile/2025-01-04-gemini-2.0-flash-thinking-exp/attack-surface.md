# Attack Surface Analysis for bitwarden/mobile

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Local Storage of Vault Data](./attack_surfaces/insecure_local_storage_of_vault_data.md)

*   **Description:** The application stores the encrypted vault data locally on the mobile device. If the encryption is weak, keys are poorly managed, or the storage mechanisms are insecure, an attacker gaining access to the device's file system could potentially decrypt the vault.
    *   **How Mobile Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mobile devices are more prone to physical loss or theft compared to desktop computers. Additionally, the mobile OS environment, while sandboxed, can still be targeted by sophisticated malware that might gain access to app data.
    *   **Example:** An attacker steals a user's unlocked phone. They then use rooting tools or exploit OS vulnerabilities to access the Bitwarden app's data directory and attempt to decrypt the vault.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the user's password vault, leading to unauthorized access to all their online accounts and potentially significant financial and personal data loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Employ strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) for vault data.
            *   Implement robust key derivation functions (KDFs) like Argon2id for the master password.
            *   Securely store encryption keys, potentially leveraging hardware-backed keystores provided by the mobile OS (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain).
            *   Implement mechanisms to detect and respond to potential tampering with local data.
            *   Consider adding an option for users to set a local PIN or biometric authentication as an additional layer of security even if the device is unlocked.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Set a strong, unique master password.
            *   Enable device encryption.
            *   Keep the mobile device's operating system and the Bitwarden app updated.
            *   Avoid rooting or jailbreaking the device.
            *   Enable a strong lock screen PIN or biometric authentication for the device.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Autofill Functionality](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_autofill_functionality.md)

*   **Description:** The autofill feature allows the application to automatically fill in usernames and passwords in other apps and websites. Vulnerabilities in the implementation or the platform's autofill service can be exploited.
    *   **How Mobile Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The integrated nature of mobile operating systems and the reliance on platform-provided autofill APIs introduce a shared attack surface. Malicious apps could potentially trick the autofill service or intercept autofill data.
    *   **Example:** A malicious app on the user's phone registers as an autofill provider or exploits a vulnerability in the Android/iOS autofill framework. When the user attempts to log in to a legitimate app, the malicious app intercepts the credentials or injects its own.
    *   **Impact:** Credential theft, leading to unauthorized access to other applications and online accounts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Strictly adhere to platform guidelines for implementing autofill.
            *   Implement robust verification mechanisms to ensure the target application or website is legitimate before providing credentials.
            *   Consider using accessibility services carefully and only when necessary, as misuse can lead to vulnerabilities.
            *   Regularly audit and update the autofill implementation to address newly discovered vulnerabilities.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Grant autofill permissions only to trusted password manager applications.
            *   Be cautious when granting accessibility permissions to applications.
            *   Review the autofill suggestions carefully before confirming.

## Attack Surface: [Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/inter-process_communication__ipc__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The application might use IPC mechanisms (like Intents on Android or URL schemes on iOS) to communicate with other parts of the system or other applications. Vulnerabilities in these interfaces can be exploited by malicious apps.
    *   **How Mobile Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mobile operating systems rely heavily on IPC for inter-app communication. This creates opportunities for malicious apps to intercept, manipulate, or trigger unintended actions within the Bitwarden app.
    *   **Example:** A malicious app registers a custom URL scheme or listens for specific Intents used by the Bitwarden app. It then crafts a malicious link or Intent to trigger an unintended action in Bitwarden, such as exporting the vault or revealing sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Potential data leakage, unauthorized actions within the application, or even complete compromise depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all data received through IPC.
            *   Use explicit Intents/URL schemes where possible to limit the scope of communication.
            *   Implement robust authentication and authorization checks for IPC requests.
            *   Avoid exposing sensitive functionality through easily accessible IPC mechanisms.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Be cautious about clicking on links from untrusted sources, as these could exploit deep linking vulnerabilities.
            *   Regularly review the permissions granted to other applications on the device.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure through Custom Keyboards (if implemented)](./attack_surfaces/exposure_through_custom_keyboards__if_implemented_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application implements a custom keyboard for enhanced security or features, vulnerabilities in this keyboard could lead to keystroke logging or data exfiltration.
    *   **How Mobile Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Custom keyboards have access to all text input, making them a prime target for malicious actors if not implemented securely.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the custom keyboard allows a malicious app to intercept keystrokes entered within the Bitwarden app, including the master password.
    *   **Impact:** Master password compromise, leading to complete vault access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if implemented)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Thoroughly audit and secure any custom keyboard implementation.
            *   Follow secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities like keystroke logging or data leakage.
            *   Consider using the platform's standard keyboard input methods whenever possible to reduce the attack surface.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Be cautious about using custom keyboards from less reputable sources.
            *   If using a custom keyboard from Bitwarden, ensure the application is from the official source and kept up to date.
