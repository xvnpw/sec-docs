## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Bitwarden Mobile Application](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_bitwarden_mobile_application.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success here means complete compromise of the application and access to the user's vault data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Mobile Device](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_mobile_device.md)

* This is a critical node because gaining control of the mobile device allows the attacker to bypass many application-level security measures.
    * Attack vectors include:
        * Installing malware through social engineering or exploiting OS vulnerabilities.
        * Gaining physical access to an unlocked device.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within the Bitwarden Mobile Application](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_the_bitwarden_mobile_application.md)

* This is a critical node as it represents direct weaknesses in the application's code or design.
    * Attack vectors include:
        * Exploiting local data storage vulnerabilities to access encrypted data.
        * Bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms.
        * Exploiting insecure keyboard caching to capture sensitive input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept Network Communication](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_network_communication.md)

* This is a critical node because successful interception can expose sensitive data transmitted between the app and the server.
    * Attack vectors include:
        * Performing Man-in-the-Middle attacks on compromised or rogue Wi-Fi networks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Mobile Device -> Install Malware on Device -> Social Engineering (Phishing, Malicious Apps)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_mobile_device_-_install_malware_on_device_-_social_engineering__phishing__malicious_a_733de387.md)

* Attack Vector: Tricking the user into installing malicious applications or clicking on phishing links that lead to malware installation.
    * Likelihood: Medium (due to the prevalence of social engineering attacks).
    * Impact: Critical (full device compromise).

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Mobile Device -> Gain Physical Access to Unlocked Device](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_mobile_device_-_gain_physical_access_to_unlocked_device.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploiting situations where users leave their devices unattended and unlocked.
    * Likelihood: Medium (depends on user behavior).
    * Impact: Critical (full access to the device and its data).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within the Bitwarden Mobile Application -> Exploit Local Data Storage Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_the_bitwarden_mobile_application_-_exploit_local_data_storage_vulnera_7a6581c0.md)

* Attack Vector: Identifying and exploiting weaknesses in how the application stores sensitive data locally, such as insecure encryption or key management.
    * Likelihood: Low to Medium (depends on the security measures implemented).
    * Impact: Critical (direct access to the vault data).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within the Bitwarden Mobile Application -> Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_the_bitwarden_mobile_application_-_exploit_authenticationauthorizatio_b1941950.md)

* Attack Vector: Bypassing or circumventing the mechanisms that verify the user's identity and grant access to the application.
    * Likelihood: Low to Medium (depends on the robustness of the authentication implementation).
    * Impact: Critical (direct access to the vault data).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within the Bitwarden Mobile Application -> Exploit Insecure Keyboard Caching](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_the_bitwarden_mobile_application_-_exploit_insecure_keyboard_caching.md)

* Attack Vector: Leveraging vulnerabilities in third-party keyboard applications that might cache sensitive data entered in the Bitwarden app.
    * Likelihood: Medium (depends on user's keyboard app choices).
    * Impact: Critical (exposure of master password or other sensitive information).

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept Network Communication -> Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_network_communication_-_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack.md)

* Attack Vector: Intercepting network traffic between the Bitwarden app and its server, often by compromising Wi-Fi networks or setting up rogue access points.
    * Likelihood: Medium (common in public Wi-Fi scenarios).
    * Impact: Critical (potential to steal credentials and vault data).
