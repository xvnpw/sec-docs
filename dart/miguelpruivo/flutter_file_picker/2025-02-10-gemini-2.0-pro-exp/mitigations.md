# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict File Type Validation (Using `allowedExtensions` - Client-Side)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_file_type_validation__using__allowedextensions__-_client-side_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Client-Side (Flutter):** Utilize the `allowedExtensions` parameter within the `FilePicker.platform.pickFiles()` method. This provides an initial, *user-experience-focused* filter, guiding the user towards selecting appropriate file types.  It is *not* a robust security control on its own.
    2.  Example:
        ```dart
        FilePickerResult? result = await FilePicker.platform.pickFiles(
          allowedExtensions: ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'pdf'],
          type: FileType.custom, // Required when using allowedExtensions
        );
        ```
    3.  Clearly communicate to the user which file types are permitted.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious File Uploads (Low Severity - Client-Side Only):** *Minimally* reduces the *likelihood* of a user selecting an obviously incorrect file type. It does *not* prevent a determined attacker.
    *   **File Type Spoofing (Low Severity - Client-Side Only):** Easily bypassed; provides no real protection against spoofing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious File Uploads:** Very low impact on security. Primarily a usability feature.
    *   **File Type Spoofing:** Negligible impact.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Used in `lib/widgets/file_upload_widget.dart`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None, from the perspective of *using* `flutter_file_picker`. The crucial missing piece is the robust *server-side* validation, which is outside the scope of this narrowed-down list.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege (Using `withReadAccess` and `withWriteAccess`)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege__using__withreadaccess__and__withwriteaccess__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Client-Side (Flutter):** When calling `FilePicker.platform.pickFiles()`, use the `withReadAccess` and `withWriteAccess` boolean parameters judiciously.
    2.  Set `withReadAccess: true` only if you need to read the contents of the selected file. This is almost always the case.
    3.  Set `withWriteAccess: true` *only* if you absolutely need to modify the selected file. This is *rarely* needed when using a file picker for uploads.  Avoid it if possible.
    4.  Example (Read-Only - Typical):
        ```dart
        FilePickerResult? result = await FilePicker.platform.pickFiles(
          withReadAccess: true,
          withWriteAccess: false, // Usually the correct setting for uploads
        );
        ```
    5.  Example (Read-Write - *Rarely* Needed):
        ```dart
        FilePickerResult? result = await FilePicker.platform.pickFiles(
          withReadAccess: true,
          withWriteAccess: true, // Only if you need to modify the selected file
        );
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Improper Permissions (Medium Severity):** Reduces the potential impact of vulnerabilities by limiting the application's access to the file system. If an attacker *could* exploit a vulnerability, the damage would be limited by the restricted permissions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Improper Permissions:** Minimizes the potential damage from a successful exploit.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `withReadAccess: true` and `withWriteAccess: false` are correctly used in `lib/widgets/file_upload_widget.dart`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None, from the perspective of correctly *using* `flutter_file_picker`. The broader context of requesting appropriate permissions in the Android Manifest and iOS Info.plist is outside the scope of this list.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review `flutter_file_picker`'s Behavior (UI/UX)](./mitigation_strategies/review__flutter_file_picker_'s_behavior__uiux_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Development/Testing:**
        *   Thoroughly test the `flutter_file_picker`'s UI and behavior on all supported platforms (Android, iOS, web). This is about observing how the *picker itself* behaves.
        *   Pay close attention to how the file picker displays file paths, directory structures, and file metadata.
        *   Ensure that the picker *does not* inadvertently reveal any sensitive information about the file system, server details, or other potentially exploitable data. The picker should only show information relevant to the user's selection.
        *   Test with different file system configurations (e.g., different storage locations, symbolic links) and user permissions to identify any platform-specific differences or potential information leaks.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low Severity):** Reduces the risk of the file picker *itself* leaking sensitive information through its user interface.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Minimizes the risk of unintentional information disclosure via the file picker's UI.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic UI testing has been performed on Android and iOS.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More comprehensive testing is needed, especially on the web platform and with various file system configurations and user permission levels. This should be part of the regular testing process.
