Okay, let's create a design document for the `flutter_file_picker` project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Enable developers to easily integrate file picking functionality into their Flutter applications across various platforms (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop).
*   Provide a consistent and user-friendly API for accessing files from different sources (local storage, cloud providers).
*   Maintain a high level of platform compatibility and adapt to evolving operating system file access mechanisms.
*   Minimize external dependencies to reduce the risk of supply chain attacks and maintain a small package size.
*   Provide good documentation and examples to facilitate easy adoption by developers.
*   Offer a flexible and customizable solution to cater to diverse application needs.

Business Risks:

*   Inconsistent behavior across different platforms, leading to application instability or user frustration.
*   Security vulnerabilities related to file access, potentially exposing sensitive user data.
*   Dependency on deprecated or insecure platform APIs, causing compatibility issues or security risks.
*   Lack of support for emerging file sources or storage mechanisms.
*   Difficult integration or usage, hindering developer adoption.
*   Failure to comply with platform-specific file access guidelines and permissions, leading to application rejection or runtime errors.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Leverages platform-specific file access APIs (e.g., Android Intents, iOS Document Picker) to delegate file selection to the operating system, inheriting the OS's built-in security mechanisms.
*   security control: Uses standard Flutter/Dart mechanisms for inter-process communication (MethodChannel) to interact with native platform code, reducing the attack surface.
*   security control: The project is open-source, allowing for community review and identification of potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Follows semantic versioning, allowing users to control updates and avoid unexpected breaking changes.
*   security control: Implemented in Dart - memory-safe language.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Relies on the security of the underlying platform's file access APIs and user's granting of appropriate permissions.
*   accepted risk: Limited control over the UI/UX of the native file pickers, as they are provided by the operating system.
*   accepted risk: Potential for future platform API changes to introduce compatibility issues or require updates to the plugin.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for file paths and names returned by the platform APIs to prevent path traversal or other injection vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Provide clear documentation and guidelines on secure file handling practices for developers using the plugin, including recommendations for data encryption and storage.
*   security control: Regularly review and update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Consider implementing a mechanism for verifying the integrity of downloaded files (e.g., checksum validation) if the plugin supports downloading files from remote sources.
*   security control: Add static code analysis to CI pipeline.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The plugin itself does not handle user authentication. Authentication, if required, is the responsibility of the application using the plugin or the underlying platform APIs (e.g., when accessing cloud storage).

*   Authorization:
    *   The plugin relies on the operating system's permission model to control access to files. The application using the plugin must request the necessary permissions (e.g., READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE on Android) from the user.

*   Input Validation:
    *   File paths and names returned by the platform APIs should be treated as untrusted input and validated/sanitized before being used by the application. This is crucial to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.

*   Cryptography:
    *   The plugin does not directly handle encryption. If encryption is required, it is the responsibility of the application using the plugin to encrypt/decrypt files before/after using the file picker.

## DEPLOYMENT

Possible Deployment Solutions:

1.  **Flutter Package Deployment:** The primary deployment method is as a Flutter package hosted on [pub.dev](http://pub.dev/). Developers add the package as a dependency in their `pubspec.yaml` file.
2.  **Direct GitHub Repository Inclusion:** Developers can also include the plugin directly from the GitHub repository, although this is less common.
3.  **Local Copy:** A developer could download a copy of the repository and include it locally in their project. This is not recommended due to update and maintenance issues.

```

Build Process Description:

1.  **Development:** Developers write code and commit changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  **Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions):**
    *   A GitHub Actions workflow is triggered on each push or pull request.
    *   **Static Analysis:** `Dart Analyzer` performs static code analysis to identify potential issues and enforce code style.
    *   **Testing:** `Flutter Test` runs unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
    *   **Publishing (on tagged commits):** If the workflow is triggered by a tagged commit, and all checks pass, the package is automatically published to pub.dev.
3.  **Package Publication:** The `flutter pub publish` command is used (within the GitHub Actions workflow) to upload the package to pub.dev.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: **GitHub Actions:** Automates the build, test, and publishing process, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors.
*   security control: **Dart Analyzer:** Enforces code style and identifies potential issues through static analysis.

*   security control: **Semantic Versioning:** Uses semantic versioning to manage releases and allow users to control updates.
*   security control: **Signed Commits:** Developers should sign their commits to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering.
*   security control: **Dependency Management:** Regularly review and update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   **File Selection:** The core functionality of the plugin, enabling users to select files from various sources.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensuring consistent behavior across different operating systems.
*   **Application Stability:** Preventing crashes or errors related to file picking.
*   **User Data Privacy:** Protecting user data accessed through the file picker.

Data Sensitivity:

*   **File Paths:** May reveal information about the user's file system structure. Sensitivity: Low to Medium.
*   **File Names:** May contain sensitive information, depending on the user's naming conventions. Sensitivity: Low to High.
*   **File Contents:** The actual content of the selected files, which can range from non-sensitive to highly sensitive (e.g., personal documents, financial records, medical information). Sensitivity: Variable, potentially High.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that need to be considered when handling user files?
*   Are there any plans to support specific cloud storage providers directly (beyond what is offered by the native file pickers)?
*   What level of logging and error reporting is desired for the plugin?
*   Are there any specific performance requirements or limitations for file picking (e.g., maximum file size)?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a convenient and reliable file picking solution for Flutter developers.
*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The project prioritizes ease of use and cross-platform compatibility.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The plugin relies heavily on the security of the underlying operating system's file access mechanisms.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: Developers using the plugin are responsible for implementing appropriate security measures in their applications, such as input validation and data encryption.
*   DESIGN: The plugin acts as a bridge between the Flutter application and the native file picking APIs.
*   DESIGN: The plugin does not directly handle file storage or management.
*   DESIGN: The plugin does not require any specific authentication mechanisms beyond what is provided by the operating system or cloud storage providers.
