# Threat Model Analysis for miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker

## Threat: [File Type Spoofing / Masquerading (via `extension` property)](./threats/file_type_spoofing__masquerading__via__extension__property_.md)

*   **Threat:** File Type Spoofing / Masquerading (via `extension` property)

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious file with a misleading file extension (e.g., a `.exe` disguised as a `.pdf`). The user, deceived by the extension displayed in the file picker dialog, selects the file.  The `flutter_file_picker` package returns this misleading extension to the application. The application, if it relies solely on this extension, is then vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Code Execution:** If the application attempts to execute the disguised file based on the incorrect extension provided by `flutter_file_picker`, it could lead to arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Data Corruption/Exfiltration:** Processing the file as the wrong type (again, based on the incorrect extension from the picker) can lead to corruption or data theft.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `FilePickerResult.files`: Specifically, the `extension` property of the `PlatformFile` objects within the `files` list. This property is directly populated by `flutter_file_picker` based on the file name and is the source of the misleading information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Content-Based Type Detection:** *Never* rely solely on the `extension` property provided by `flutter_file_picker`. Implement robust content-based type detection using libraries that analyze the file's actual contents (magic numbers, headers, etc.).
        *   **MIME Type Validation (Web, as a *supplement*):** On the web, use the `type` property of `PlatformFile` (MIME type) *in addition to*, but not as a replacement for, content-based validation. The MIME type can also be spoofed, but it provides an extra check.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Process the file in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential code execution.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Files (unchecked `size` property)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_large_files__unchecked__size__property_.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Files (unchecked `size` property)

    *   **Description:** An attacker selects an extremely large file through the file picker. The `flutter_file_picker` package correctly reports the file's size via the `size` property. However, if the application *fails* to check this `size` property *before* attempting to read the file, it can lead to a denial-of-service attack.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Application Crash:** The application runs out of memory and crashes due to attempting to load the entire large file.
        *   **Device Unresponsiveness:** The device becomes unresponsive due to excessive memory consumption.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `FilePickerResult.files`: Specifically, the `size` property of the `PlatformFile` objects.  The vulnerability is the application's *failure to use* this information provided by `flutter_file_picker`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory File Size Limit:** *Always* check the `size` property of the `PlatformFile` object *before* attempting any file operations. Enforce a strict maximum file size limit.
        *   **Streaming (for large file support):** If handling potentially large files is necessary, use the `readStream` property (and handle it correctly) to process the file in chunks, avoiding loading the entire file into memory at once.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious File Content (unchecked file handling after selection)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_malicious_file_content__unchecked_file_handling_after_selection_.md)

*  **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious File Content (unchecked file handling after selection)

    *   **Description:** An attacker selects a specially crafted file (e.g., a "zip bomb" or a file designed to cause excessive processing) through the file picker. While `flutter_file_picker` itself doesn't process the file content, it provides the means (path or stream) to access the file. If the application doesn't properly validate or limit the processing of this file *after* selection, it can lead to a DoS.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Application Crash:** Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk) causes the application to crash.
        *   **Device Unresponsiveness:** The device becomes slow or unresponsive.
        *   **Disk Space Exhaustion:** (Specifically for attacks like zip bombs)
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *    `FilePickerResult.files`: The `path` and `readStream` properties are the means by which the application accesses the potentially malicious file. The vulnerability is in the *subsequent* handling of the file by the application, but the picker provides the entry point.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Resource Limits:** Enforce strict limits on memory, CPU time, and disk space during file processing.
        *   **Specialized Input Validation:** Implement checks for known malicious file types or structures (e.g., zip bomb detection).
        *   **Sandboxing:** Process the file in a sandboxed environment to contain the damage.
        *   **Decompression Limits (for archives):** If the application decompresses archives, set limits on expansion ratio, file count, and uncompressed size.
