# Attack Surface Analysis for miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  An attacker could manipulate the file selection process to choose files outside the intended directory scope, potentially accessing sensitive data or system files.

**How flutter_file_picker contributes:** The library provides the functionality to select files from the device's file system and returns the file path. If the application doesn't validate this path *returned by the library*, it's vulnerable.

**Example:** A user, prompted to select an image, navigates to and selects a sensitive configuration file using the file picker. The application, without proper validation of the path *received from `flutter_file_picker`*, then attempts to read or process this file.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential for data breaches, and in some cases, the ability to manipulate system files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Server-side validation:** If the file is being uploaded to a server, perform strict path validation on the server-side to ensure the file is within the expected directory.
*   **Restrict allowed directories:** If the application has a specific directory it should access, implement checks to ensure the selected file path *returned by `flutter_file_picker`* falls within that allowed scope.
*   **Use file identifiers instead of direct paths:**  Where possible, use system-provided file identifiers or URIs instead of raw file paths *returned by the library* to abstract away the direct path structure.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection through Filenames](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_through_filenames.md)

**Description:** If the application uses the selected filename directly in commands or operations without sanitization, a malicious filename could lead to injection vulnerabilities.

**How flutter_file_picker contributes:** It provides the filename as part of the `FilePickerResult`. The application then uses this filename *provided by the library*.

**Example:** The application uses the filename *obtained from `flutter_file_picker`* in a shell command without proper escaping: `Runtime.getRuntime().exec("process_file " + selectedFile.name);`. A file named `"; rm -rf /"` could cause unintended consequences.

**Impact:**  Command injection, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid using filenames directly in commands:** If possible, avoid using user-provided filenames *obtained from `flutter_file_picker`* directly in system commands or other sensitive operations.
*   **Input sanitization:** If filenames must be used, rigorously sanitize and validate them to remove or escape potentially harmful characters *after receiving them from `flutter_file_picker`*.
*   **Use parameterized commands:** When interacting with databases or external systems, use parameterized queries or commands to prevent injection attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Intent Interception (Android Specific)](./attack_surfaces/intent_interception__android_specific_.md)

**Description:** On Android, a malicious application could potentially intercept the intent used by `flutter_file_picker` to launch the file selection activity.

**How flutter_file_picker contributes:** It uses Android Intents to invoke the file picker. The vulnerability lies in the standard Android Intent mechanism used by the library.

**Example:** A malicious app registers an intent filter that matches the file picking intent *initiated by `flutter_file_picker`*. When the user tries to select a file, the malicious app's activity is launched instead, potentially tricking the user into selecting a malicious file or stealing information.

**Impact:**  User tricked into selecting malicious files, potential for malware installation or data theft.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Explicit Intent:** Use explicit intents to target the specific file picker activity provided by the system or trusted file manager apps, reducing the chance of interception. This is something the *application using* `flutter_file_picker` needs to implement carefully.

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect Handling of File Types](./attack_surfaces/incorrect_handling_of_file_types.md)

**Description:** Relying solely on the file extension provided by the library to determine the file type can be insecure, as extensions can be easily spoofed.

**How flutter_file_picker contributes:** It provides the filename, which includes the extension, as part of the `FilePickerResult`. The application might then incorrectly use this extension *provided by the library*.

**Example:** A user selects a file named `malware.txt`, but it's actually an executable. The application, relying only on the `.txt` extension *obtained from `flutter_file_picker`*, attempts to process it as a text file, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security issues.

**Impact:**  Bypassing security checks, potential for executing malicious code.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Content-based file type detection:** Implement mechanisms to verify the file type based on its content (e.g., magic numbers or MIME type detection) rather than relying solely on the extension *provided by `flutter_file_picker`*.
