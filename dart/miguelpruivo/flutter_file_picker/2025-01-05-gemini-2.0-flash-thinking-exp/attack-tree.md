## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via `flutter_file_picker` [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via__flutter_file_picker___critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application through the `flutter_file_picker` library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious File Injection [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_file_injection__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This represents a category of attacks where the attacker aims to introduce a harmful file into the application's processing flow via the file picker. This is a critical node because it's a primary entry point for many attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass File Type Restrictions [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_file_type_restrictions__high-risk_path_.md)

This attack vector focuses on circumventing the application's attempts to limit the types of files that can be selected.

## Attack Tree Path: [Select File with Misleading Extension (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Medium, Effort: Low, Skill Level: Low, Detection Difficulty: Medium) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/select_file_with_misleading_extension__likelihood_medium__impact_medium__effort_low__skill_level_low_1ae9794d.md)

The attacker renames a malicious file (e.g., an executable) with an extension that the application considers safe (e.g., a text file). If the application relies solely on the extension for validation, it will process the malicious file.

## Attack Tree Path: [Masquerade as Legitimate File [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/masquerade_as_legitimate_file__high-risk_path_.md)

This involves disguising a malicious payload within a file type that the application typically allows.

## Attack Tree Path: [Embed Malicious Payload in Allowed File Type (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High, Effort: Medium, Skill Level: Medium, Detection Difficulty: Hard) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/embed_malicious_payload_in_allowed_file_type__likelihood_medium__impact_high__effort_medium__skill_l_91ee67ba.md)

The attacker embeds malicious code (e.g., JavaScript in an HTML file, a macro in a document) within a file type that the application accepts. When the application processes this file, the embedded malicious code can be executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Application's Handling of Selected Files [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_application's_handling_of_selected_files__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This category focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application processes the files selected by the user through the `flutter_file_picker`. This is a critical node because the application's actions after file selection are crucial for security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insufficient Validation of File Content [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/insufficient_validation_of_file_content__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This represents a significant weakness where the application does not adequately inspect the content of the selected file for malicious elements. This is a critical node as it directly leads to high-impact attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Unsafe File Types (Likelihood: Low, Impact: High, Effort: Medium, Skill Level: Medium, Detection Difficulty: Medium) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_unsafe_file_types__likelihood_low__impact_high__effort_medium__skill_level_medium__detection_30b7e6e6.md)

If file type restrictions are bypassed, and the application attempts to execute the selected file (thinking it's a legitimate script or executable), it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the device or within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Parse Malicious Content (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High, Effort: Medium, Skill Level: Medium, Detection Difficulty: Medium) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/parse_malicious_content__likelihood_medium__impact_high__effort_medium__skill_level_medium__detectio_18f77fa2.md)

The attacker crafts a file with malicious content designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's parsing logic. For example, a specially crafted XML file could exploit XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities, or a file containing a malicious script could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the content is later rendered by the application.
