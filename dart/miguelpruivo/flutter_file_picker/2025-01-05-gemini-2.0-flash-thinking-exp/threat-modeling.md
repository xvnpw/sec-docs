# Threat Model Analysis for miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker

## Threat: [Malicious File Selection by User](./threats/malicious_file_selection_by_user.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious File Selection by User
    *   **Description:** An attacker, posing as a legitimate user, intentionally selects a malicious file through the `flutter_file_picker` interface. The library provides the mechanism for the user to choose this file, which the application might then process, potentially triggering an exploit embedded within the file.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution within the application's context, data corruption, denial of service, or even system compromise if the application has elevated privileges.
    *   **Affected Component:** `file_picker` module (specifically the core functionality enabling file selection).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust file validation on the server-side or within the application *immediately* after a file is selected via `flutter_file_picker`, before any further processing.
        *   Use a sandboxed environment for processing files selected through `flutter_file_picker` to limit the impact of potential exploits.
        *   Scan uploaded files for malware using antivirus or anti-malware solutions after selection via `flutter_file_picker`.
        *   Educate users about the risks of selecting files from untrusted sources, even when using the application's file picker.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerability via Manipulated Filename Returned by `flutter_file_picker`](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerability_via_manipulated_filename_returned_by__flutter_file_picker_.md)

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal Vulnerability via Manipulated Filename Returned by `flutter_file_picker`
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability within `flutter_file_picker` or the underlying platform interaction could potentially allow an attacker to influence the filename or path returned by the library. If `flutter_file_picker` does not properly sanitize or validate the file path it returns, and the application directly uses this unsanitized path in file system operations, it could lead to accessing or manipulating files outside the intended scope.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to files on the user's system, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `file_picker` module (specifically the part responsible for returning the file path after selection).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   The application must rigorously sanitize and validate file paths *received from `flutter_file_picker`* before using them for any file system operations.
        *   Avoid directly using file paths returned by `flutter_file_picker` in file system operations without thorough checks. Use secure file access methods that validate paths against expected locations.
        *   Ensure `flutter_file_picker` is updated to the latest version, which may contain fixes for path handling vulnerabilities.
