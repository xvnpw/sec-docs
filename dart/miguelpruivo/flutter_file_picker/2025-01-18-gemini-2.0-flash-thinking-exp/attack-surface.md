# Attack Surface Analysis for miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerability.md)

* **Description:**  A malicious user could potentially select files outside of the intended directories by manipulating the file selection process or if the application doesn't properly validate the returned file path.
    * **How flutter_file_picker Contributes:** The package provides the mechanism for users to select files from the device's file system and returns the file path to the application. Without proper handling, this path can be exploited.
    * **Example:** A user selects a file with a path like `/../../../../etc/passwd` (on Linux/macOS) or similar, and the application directly uses this path to read the file, leading to unauthorized access.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential data breaches, or modification of critical system files.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization of the file path received from `flutter_file_picker`.
        * **Developer:** Use allow-lists of permitted directories or canonicalize paths to prevent traversal.
        * **Developer:** Avoid directly using the user-provided path for file operations. Instead, use it to identify the file and then access it through a controlled mechanism.

## Attack Surface: [Reliance on File Extension/MIME Type for Security](./attack_surfaces/reliance_on_file_extensionmime_type_for_security.md)

* **Description:** The package allows filtering files based on extensions or MIME types. If the application solely relies on this information for security decisions, it can be bypassed.
    * **How flutter_file_picker Contributes:** The package provides the selected file's extension and MIME type, which the application might use for validation.
    * **Example:** A malicious executable file is renamed with a `.txt` extension. The application, relying only on the extension, might treat it as a harmless text file.
    * **Impact:** Execution of malicious code, bypassing security checks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:** Never rely solely on file extensions or MIME types for security.
        * **Developer:** Implement content-based analysis or other robust validation methods to determine the true nature of the file.
        * **Developer:** Use platform-specific APIs for file type verification if available.

## Attack Surface: [User-Initiated Selection of Malicious Files](./attack_surfaces/user-initiated_selection_of_malicious_files.md)

* **Description:** A user could be tricked into selecting a malicious file through social engineering or phishing tactics.
    * **How flutter_file_picker Contributes:** The package provides the mechanism for users to select files, making the application vulnerable to user error or malicious intent.
    * **Example:** A user is tricked into downloading and selecting a file disguised as a legitimate document, but it contains malware.
    * **Impact:** Execution of malicious code, data breaches, compromise of the user's device or application data.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:** Educate users about the risks of selecting files from untrusted sources.
        * **Developer:** Implement security measures to scan or analyze selected files before processing them.
        * **Developer:** Provide clear warnings and guidance to users during the file selection process.
        * **User:** Be cautious about selecting files from unknown or untrusted sources. Verify the source and legitimacy of files before selecting them.
