## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit File Picker Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_file_picker_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to find and exploit inherent weaknesses within the `flutter_file_picker` library itself. This could involve flaws in how it handles file paths, memory management, or interacts with the underlying operating system.
**Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to significant compromise, allowing attackers to bypass intended security measures and gain unauthorized access or control.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Path Traversal Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__path_traversal_vulnerability.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate the file path provided to the file picker, using special characters (like `../`) to navigate outside the intended directories.
**Impact:** This allows access to sensitive application files, overwriting critical system files, or exfiltrating confidential data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Select File Outside Allowed Directories](./attack_tree_paths/select_file_outside_allowed_directories.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker successfully uses path traversal techniques to select a file located outside the directories the application intends to allow access to.
**Impact:** This is the direct action that enables the subsequent compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Application Files](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_application_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** By selecting files outside the allowed scope, attackers can read configuration files, database credentials, or other sensitive information stored within the application's file system.
**Impact:** Leads to information disclosure and potential further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwrite Critical Application Files](./attack_tree_paths/overwrite_critical_application_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers can select and overwrite critical application binaries, libraries, or configuration files with malicious versions.
**Impact:** Can lead to complete application compromise, denial of service, or persistent backdoors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate Application Data](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_application_data.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers can select and copy sensitive data files from the application's file system to a location they control.
**Impact:** Results in data breaches and potential regulatory violations.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Manipulate File Selection Process](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__manipulate_file_selection_process.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to influence or control the user's file selection process to introduce malicious files into the application's workflow.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Social Engineering](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__social_engineering.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers use psychological manipulation to trick users into performing actions that compromise security, in this case, selecting a malicious file.
**Impact:** Can bypass technical security controls by exploiting human trust and lack of awareness.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Trick User into Selecting Malicious File](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__trick_user_into_selecting_malicious_file.md)

**Attack Vector:** The core action of the social engineering attack, where the user is deceived into choosing a harmful file.
**Impact:** Directly leads to the introduction of malicious content into the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Masquerade Malicious File as Legitimate](./attack_tree_paths/masquerade_malicious_file_as_legitimate.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers disguise malicious files with names, extensions, or icons that make them appear harmless or legitimate.
**Impact:** Increases the likelihood of the user selecting the malicious file.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit User Trust/Lack of Awareness](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_user_trustlack_of_awareness.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage the user's trust in the application, the sender of the file, or their general lack of awareness about file-based threats.
**Impact:** Makes users more susceptible to social engineering tactics.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Supply Malicious File Content](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__supply_malicious_file_content.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers provide files containing malicious payloads or crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in how the application processes file content.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Application Vulnerabilities via File Content](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_application_vulnerabilities_via_file_content.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application has weaknesses in how it parses, processes, or handles specific file formats, which attackers can exploit by providing specially crafted malicious files.
**Impact:** Can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or data exfiltration.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Malicious Image File](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__malicious_image_file.md)

**Attack Vector:** A specially crafted image file is used to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's image parsing libraries.
**Impact:** Can lead to code execution or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Trigger Image Parsing Vulnerability in Application](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__trigger_image_parsing_vulnerability_in_application.md)

**Attack Vector:** The malicious image file contains data that triggers a bug or flaw in the image parsing logic.
**Impact:** This is the point where the vulnerability is actively exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code.md)

**Attack Vector:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system running the application.
**Impact:** Complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Malicious Document File (PDF, DOCX, etc.)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__malicious_document_file__pdf__docx__etc__.md)

**Attack Vector:** A malicious document file exploits vulnerabilities in the application's document processing or rendering components.
**Impact:** Can lead to code execution or data exfiltration.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Trigger Document Parsing Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__trigger_document_parsing_vulnerability.md)

**Attack Vector:** The malicious document contains elements that trigger a flaw in the document parsing logic.
**Impact:** This is the point where the vulnerability is actively exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code.md)

**Attack Vector:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
**Impact:** Complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate Data](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_data.md)

**Attack Vector:** The malicious document can be crafted to extract data from the application's environment and send it to an attacker-controlled location.
**Impact:** Data breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Malicious Archive File (ZIP, TAR, etc.)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__malicious_archive_file__zip__tar__etc__.md)

**Attack Vector:** A malicious archive file is used to exploit vulnerabilities related to archive extraction, such as path traversal during extraction or denial-of-service attacks (zip bombs).
**Impact:** Can lead to overwriting application files or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Path Traversal within Archive (If application extracts without sanitization)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__path_traversal_within_archive__if_application_extracts_without_sanitization_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The archive contains files with specially crafted paths (e.g., starting with `../`) that, if not properly sanitized during extraction, allow writing files to arbitrary locations on the file system.
**Impact:** Can lead to overwriting critical application files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwrite Application Files](./attack_tree_paths/overwrite_application_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** Files within the malicious archive overwrite existing application files with malicious versions.
**Impact:** Application compromise or denial of service.
