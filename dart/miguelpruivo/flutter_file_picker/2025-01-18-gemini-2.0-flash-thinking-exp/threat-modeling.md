# Threat Model Analysis for miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload Leading to Code Execution](./threats/malicious_file_upload_leading_to_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker could trick a user into selecting and uploading a malicious file using the `flutter_file_picker`. The vulnerability lies in the application's subsequent processing of this file, but `flutter_file_picker` is the direct mechanism allowing the user to provide the malicious input. The attacker exploits the lack of proper sanitization or security checks on the file after it has been picked using the library.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server or client device, data breaches, installation of malware, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `FilePicker.platform.pickFiles()` (the function responsible for allowing file selection and returning file data).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement robust server-side and client-side validation of file types and content *immediately* after the file is picked.
- Sanitize uploaded files to remove potentially malicious code *before* any further processing.
- Use sandboxing or containerization for file processing.
- Avoid executing uploaded files directly.
- Implement strong authentication and authorization to restrict who can initiate file picking and uploading.

## Threat: [Over-Permissioning Leading to Unauthorized File Access](./threats/over-permissioning_leading_to_unauthorized_file_access.md)

**Description:** The application, when integrating `flutter_file_picker`, might request broader file system access permissions than strictly necessary. This is a direct consequence of how the application utilizes the library's capabilities to access the file system. An attacker who gains control of the application could then leverage these excessive permissions to access sensitive files beyond the intended scope of the file picker.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive user data, potential data exfiltration, privacy violations.

**Affected Component:** The underlying platform's permission system accessed directly by `flutter_file_picker` when the application requests file access.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring `flutter_file_picker` and requesting file system permissions. Only request the specific permissions required for the intended file picking functionality.
- Regularly review and minimize the requested permissions in the application's manifest or configuration.
- Educate users about the permissions the application is requesting and why.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerability via Filename Manipulation](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerability_via_filename_manipulation.md)

**Description:** While the core vulnerability lies in the application's handling of file paths, `flutter_file_picker` provides the initial filename. An attacker could potentially influence the filename (depending on the platform and how the picker is used) to include path traversal characters ("..", "/") that the application then unsafely uses for file system operations. The direct involvement is the library providing the potentially malicious filename.

**Impact:** Overwriting critical system files, accessing sensitive application data, potential for remote code execution if executable files can be written to vulnerable locations.

**Affected Component:** The file path information returned by `FilePicker.platform.pickFiles()`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement strict validation and sanitization of filenames received from `flutter_file_picker` *before* using them in any file system operations.
- Avoid directly using user-provided filenames for file system operations; instead, use secure file handling APIs.
- Enforce proper directory structures and access controls.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `flutter_file_picker` or its Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in__flutter_file_picker__or_its_dependencies.md)

**Description:** The `flutter_file_picker` library itself might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. Attackers could directly exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application or the user's device. This is a direct risk stemming from the library's code.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially leading to code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** The `flutter_file_picker` library code and its dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Keep the `flutter_file_picker` library and its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
- Regularly review security advisories for the library and its dependencies.
- Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities within the library's code if possible.
