# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Allowed File Types (Client-Side using `flutter_file_picker` parameters)](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_allowed_file_types__client-side_using__flutter_file_picker__parameters_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When using `FilePicker.platform.pickFiles` in your Flutter code, explicitly define allowed file types.
    2.  Utilize the `allowedExtensions` parameter to specify a list of permitted file extensions (e.g., `['jpg', 'png', 'pdf']`). This directly restricts file selection within the `flutter_file_picker` UI.
    3.  Alternatively, use the `type` parameter with predefined `FileType` options (e.g., `FileType.image`, `FileType.video`) or `FileType.custom` in conjunction with `allowedExtensions` for more granular control.
    4.  Test by attempting to select files with disallowed extensions using the file picker. The `flutter_file_picker` should prevent selection based on these parameters.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unintended File Uploads (Low Severity):** Reduces accidental selection of incorrect file types by users within the file picker interface.
        *   **Malicious File Uploads (Medium Severity):**  Limits the initial selection of potentially malicious file types at the client level, making it slightly harder for users to intentionally pick risky file types through the `flutter_file_picker` UI.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unintended File Uploads:** High reduction in the context of user interaction with `flutter_file_picker`. Effectively guides users towards selecting intended file types within the picker.
        *   **Malicious File Uploads:** Medium reduction. While client-side restrictions are bypassable, it adds a readily available layer of defense within the `flutter_file_picker` usage itself.
    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. The profile picture upload feature uses `FileType.image` within `flutter_file_picker`. However, other file upload functionalities using `flutter_file_picker` lack explicit `allowedExtensions` or `type` restrictions.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Missing in the document upload feature and the general file attachment feature in chat where `flutter_file_picker` is used.  `allowedExtensions` or `type` parameters should be consistently applied in all `FilePicker.platform.pickFiles` calls across the application to enforce a uniform file type policy directly at the picker level.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Client-Side File Size Limits (using `PlatformFile` from `flutter_file_picker`)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_client-side_file_size_limits__using__platformfile__from__flutter_file_picker__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  After a user selects a file using `FilePicker.platform.pickFiles`, immediately access the `size` property of the `PlatformFile` object returned by `flutter_file_picker`.
    2.  Compare this `size` value to a predefined maximum file size limit (e.g., in bytes or kilobytes) *before* proceeding with any upload process.
    3.  If the `PlatformFile.size` exceeds the limit, display an immediate error message to the user, informing them about the size restriction directly after file selection from `flutter_file_picker`.
    4.  Prevent any further upload attempts if the size limit is exceeded based on the `PlatformFile.size` check.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Client-Side (Low Severity):** Prevents client-side performance issues or potential crashes that could arise from attempting to handle extremely large files selected via `flutter_file_picker`.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Server-Side (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of users selecting and attempting to upload excessively large files through `flutter_file_picker`, which could later overwhelm server resources.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Client-Side:** Medium reduction. Improves client-side responsiveness and stability when users interact with `flutter_file_picker` and select large files.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Server-Side:** Low reduction. Client-side checks are easily bypassed; server-side limits are essential. This is primarily a user experience improvement related to `flutter_file_picker` usage and a minor initial defense layer.
    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not implemented. There are no client-side file size checks performed on the `PlatformFile.size` obtained from `flutter_file_picker` before initiating uploads.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Missing across all file upload features that utilize `flutter_file_picker`.  Implement size checks using `PlatformFile.size` immediately after file selection to provide user feedback and prevent unnecessary upload attempts of large files picked via `flutter_file_picker`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Provide Clear User Interface and Instructions (around `flutter_file_picker` usage)](./mitigation_strategies/provide_clear_user_interface_and_instructions__around__flutter_file_picker__usage_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Design the user interface elements surrounding the `flutter_file_picker` invocation to be highly intuitive.
    2.  Use clear and concise labels and prompts directly associated with the file selection button or area that triggers `flutter_file_picker`. For example, "Select Profile Picture (JPEG, PNG only)" or "Attach Document (PDF)".
    3.  Ensure the UI clearly communicates the purpose of file selection *before* the user interacts with `flutter_file_picker`.
    4.  Avoid ambiguous wording near the `flutter_file_picker` trigger that could lead to user confusion about the expected file types or purpose.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unintended File Uploads (Low Severity):** Reduces the chance of users accidentally selecting and uploading incorrect files because of unclear instructions related to the `flutter_file_picker` interface.
        *   **Social Engineering (Low Severity):**  Slightly reduces the potential for attackers to mislead users into uploading malicious files by making the intended file types and purpose of the `flutter_file_picker` action very explicit in the UI.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unintended File Uploads:** Medium reduction. Improves user understanding of the file selection process initiated by `flutter_file_picker`, reducing accidental errors.
        *   **Social Engineering:** Low reduction. Primarily enhances user awareness within the application's UI context, but not a strong technical defense.
    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Some file upload sections using `flutter_file_picker` have reasonably descriptive labels, but consistency and clarity can be improved across all usages of the package.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Needs improvement in document upload and general file attachment sections where `flutter_file_picker` is used. Review all UI elements associated with `FilePicker.platform.pickFiles` calls for optimal clarity and user-friendliness.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Confirmation Step Before Upload (after using `flutter_file_picker`)](./mitigation_strategies/confirmation_step_before_upload__after_using__flutter_file_picker__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Immediately after the user selects a file using `FilePicker.platform.pickFiles`, display a summary of the selected file *before* initiating the actual upload.
    2.  Present this summary (filename, file size, and file type if easily available from `PlatformFile`) in a confirmation dialog or a clear UI element right after the `flutter_file_picker` dialog closes.
    3.  Require explicit user confirmation (e.g., a "Confirm Upload" button displayed after `flutter_file_picker` selection) to proceed with the upload.
    4.  Provide a "Cancel" option in this confirmation step, allowing users to easily discard their selection from `flutter_file_picker` and re-select if needed.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unintended File Uploads (Low Severity):** Provides a final opportunity for users to verify their file selection made through `flutter_file_picker` before the upload begins.
        *   **User Error (Low Severity):** Reduces the impact of user errors during file selection in `flutter_file_picker` by offering a chance to review and correct mistakes.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unintended File Uploads:** Medium reduction. Adds a significant layer of protection against accidental uploads originating from user interactions with `flutter_file_picker`.
        *   **User Error:** Medium reduction. Helps users rectify selection errors made within the `flutter_file_picker` interface before irreversible actions.
    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not implemented. File uploads are initiated immediately after file selection in `flutter_file_picker` without a confirmation step in any file upload feature.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Missing across all file upload features that utilize `flutter_file_picker`. Implement a confirmation step as a standard user experience enhancement and error prevention measure for all file uploads initiated via `flutter_file_picker`.
