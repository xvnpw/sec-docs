# Threat Model Analysis for isar/isar

## Threat: [Unencrypted Data at Rest](./threats/unencrypted_data_at_rest.md)

Description: An attacker who gains physical access to the device or system where the Isar database file is stored can directly read the raw database file. They can use readily available tools to parse the binary file and extract sensitive data stored within.
Impact: Data breach, loss of confidentiality of sensitive user data, potential regulatory compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
Isar Component Affected: Core data storage mechanism, file system interaction.
Risk Severity: High (if sensitive data is stored).
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement application-level encryption for sensitive data before storing it in Isar.
    * Utilize operating system level full-disk encryption.
    * Evaluate and use future Isar-provided encryption features if available.
    * Restrict physical access to devices and systems storing Isar databases.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Debugging/Logging](./threats/data_leakage_through_debugginglogging.md)

Description: During development or in production with verbose logging enabled, sensitive data stored in Isar might be unintentionally logged or exposed in debugging outputs. An attacker gaining access to these logs (e.g., through compromised logging servers, exposed log files) can extract sensitive information.
Impact: Data breach, loss of confidentiality, potential exposure of user credentials or personal information.
Isar Component Affected: Query execution, data retrieval, logging integration (indirectly).
Risk Severity: High (depending on the sensitivity of logged data and log access controls).
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement secure logging practices: avoid logging sensitive data directly.
    * Sanitize or mask sensitive data before logging Isar queries or data objects.
    * Disable verbose logging in production environments.
    * Securely store and restrict access to application logs.
    * Regularly review and audit logging configurations.

## Threat: [Data Exposure through Backup/Restore Mechanisms](./threats/data_exposure_through_backuprestore_mechanisms.md)

Description: If backups of the application include the Isar database file and these backups are not properly secured, an attacker gaining access to these backups (e.g., through compromised backup storage, insecure cloud backups) can extract the Isar database and access its contents.
Impact: Data breach, loss of confidentiality, potential exposure of historical data.
Isar Component Affected: Data persistence, file system interaction (indirectly through backup process).
Risk Severity: High (depending on the sensitivity of data in backups and backup security).
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Encrypt backups that include the Isar database.
    * Securely store backups in protected locations with access control.
    * Implement secure backup and restore procedures.
    * Consider excluding highly sensitive data from backups if feasible.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Isar Library or Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_isar_library_or_dependencies.md)

Description: Security vulnerabilities might be discovered in the Isar library itself or its dependencies. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service.
Impact: Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including data breach, code execution, denial of service, complete system compromise.
Isar Component Affected: Core Isar library code, potentially dependencies.
Risk Severity: Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Keep Isar library and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest versions.
    * Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases.
    * Apply security patches and updates promptly.
    * Follow secure coding practices when using Isar APIs.
    * Use static analysis tools to scan for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Lack of Access Control within Isar (Application Level)](./threats/lack_of_access_control_within_isar__application_level_.md)

Description: Isar itself does not enforce access control. If the application fails to implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, an attacker who gains access to the application (e.g., through compromised accounts, application vulnerabilities) can potentially bypass application logic and directly access or modify all data stored in Isar.
Impact: Data breach, unauthorized data modification, data integrity compromise, potential privilege escalation.
Isar Component Affected: Application's data access layer, application logic interacting with Isar (not Isar itself, but directly relevant to its usage).
Risk Severity: High (if sensitive data is stored and access control is weak).
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms within the application.
    * Enforce the principle of least privilege when granting access to Isar data.
    * Carefully design application logic to ensure proper access control to Isar data.
    * Regularly review and audit application access control mechanisms.
