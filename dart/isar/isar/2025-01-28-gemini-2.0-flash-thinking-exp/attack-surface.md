# Attack Surface Analysis for isar/isar

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Data at Rest](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_data_at_rest.md)

*   **Description:** Data stored by Isar is, by default, not encrypted on disk. This exposes sensitive data if an attacker gains file system access.
*   **Isar Contribution:** Isar's default configuration stores data unencrypted. Encryption is an optional feature requiring explicit developer activation.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises a server hosting an Isar-backed application. They access the Isar database file directly and read sensitive user credentials or personal information because encryption was not enabled.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, complete data exposure, severe regulatory consequences, significant reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Isar Encryption:** Developers **must** enable Isar's encryption feature during database initialization.
    *   **Strong Key Management:** Implement robust and secure key management practices, storing encryption keys outside of application code and using secure storage mechanisms.
    *   **Regular Encryption Verification:** Periodically verify that encryption is enabled and correctly configured in production environments.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Permissions](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** Overly permissive file system permissions on the Isar database file and directory allow unauthorized local users or processes to access and potentially manipulate the database.
*   **Isar Contribution:** Isar creates database files with file system permissions. If developers don't enforce restrictive permissions, default system settings might be insecure.
*   **Example:** An application using Isar runs on a shared server. Due to default file permissions, another user on the same server gains read and write access to the Isar database, allowing them to steal or modify application data.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, potential data corruption, privilege escalation if sensitive application configurations are stored in the database.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrictive File Permissions:**  Configure file system permissions for the Isar database file and its directory to be highly restrictive, granting access only to the application's user and necessary system processes.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary user privileges to limit the impact of potential permission misconfigurations.
    *   **Automated Permission Checks:** Implement automated checks during deployment or runtime to verify and enforce correct file system permissions for Isar database files.

## Attack Surface: [NoSQL Injection (Query Manipulation)](./attack_surfaces/nosql_injection__query_manipulation_.md)

*   **Description:**  Improperly constructed Isar queries that directly incorporate unsanitized user input can allow attackers to manipulate query logic, potentially bypassing access controls and accessing or modifying unauthorized data.
*   **Isar Contribution:** Isar's query language, while not SQL, can still be vulnerable to injection-style attacks if developers directly embed user input into queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Example:** An application uses user-provided input to filter search results in Isar. By crafting malicious input, an attacker manipulates the Isar query to bypass intended filters and retrieve all data, including records they should not have access to.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, potential data deletion, circumvention of access control mechanisms, potential for further exploitation depending on application logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries:**  Utilize Isar's query builder methods and parameterized queries exclusively. Avoid string concatenation of user input directly into query strings.
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data used in Isar queries. Enforce data type, length, and format restrictions.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Queries:** Design queries to retrieve only the necessary data and avoid overly broad queries that could expose more data than intended if manipulated.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service through Query Complexity](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_through_query_complexity.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can craft or trigger excessively complex Isar queries that consume significant server resources (CPU, memory, I/O), leading to application slowdowns, crashes, and denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **Isar Contribution:** Isar's query processing, especially for complex queries involving indexing and filtering, can be resource-intensive. Maliciously crafted or unoptimized queries can exploit this.
*   **Example:** An attacker repeatedly sends requests to an application endpoint that triggers a computationally expensive Isar query with numerous filters and sorts. These queries overload the server, causing the application to become unresponsive and unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Application downtime, service disruption, reduced availability for legitimate users, potential financial losses due to service outages, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Query Complexity Limits and Timeouts:** Implement limits on query complexity (e.g., number of filters, sorts) and set timeouts for query execution to prevent resource exhaustion from runaway queries.
    *   **Query Performance Monitoring and Optimization:** Continuously monitor Isar query performance and identify slow or resource-intensive queries. Optimize Isar schema, indexes, and query logic for efficiency.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Request Throttling:** Implement rate limiting at the application level to restrict the number of requests from a single source, mitigating the impact of repeated malicious queries.
    *   **Input Validation for Query Parameters:** Validate user inputs that influence query parameters to prevent attackers from injecting excessively complex or inefficient query parameters.
