## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Parameterized Queries and Isar Query Builder](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_parameterized_queries_and_isar_query_builder.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Parameterized Queries and Isar Query Builder
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid String Concatenation:** Never construct Isar queries by directly concatenating user input strings into query strings.
    2.  **Use Isar Query Builder:** Utilize Isar's Query Builder API to construct queries programmatically. This API provides methods to build queries in a structured and safe manner, preventing injection vulnerabilities.  Isar's query builder is the primary mechanism for constructing queries and should be used instead of manual string manipulation.
    3.  **Use Parameterized Queries (where available):** If Isar offers parameterized query features (check Isar documentation for updates), use them to pass user input as parameters to queries instead of embedding them directly in the query string. This further enhances security by treating user input purely as data.
    4.  **Code Reviews:** Review code to ensure that all Isar queries are constructed using the Query Builder and avoid any string concatenation of user input into queries. Focus specifically on Isar query construction during code reviews.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities (Low Severity - Isar is NoSQL):** While Isar is NoSQL and less susceptible to traditional SQL injection, improper query construction could still lead to unexpected behavior or data manipulation if user input is directly embedded in queries. Using the Query Builder mitigates this risk by design within Isar's query mechanism.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities:** Low Risk Reduction (due to NoSQL nature of Isar, but important for secure Isar query practices)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Developers are generally trained to use the Isar Query Builder. Code examples and templates promote using the Query Builder for Isar interactions.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Automated code analysis tools are not yet configured to specifically detect potential injection vulnerabilities in Isar queries. Need to integrate static analysis tools or linters that can identify risky query patterns *specifically related to Isar query construction*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Encryption at Rest for Sensitive Data (Considering Isar's Lack of Built-in Encryption)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_encryption_at_rest_for_sensitive_data__considering_isar's_lack_of_built-in_encryption_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Encryption at Rest for Sensitive Data
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data in Isar:** Clearly define what data stored within Isar is considered sensitive (e.g., user credentials, personal information, financial data).
    2.  **Choose Encryption Method (External to Isar):** Since Isar lacks built-in encryption at rest, select an external encryption method:
        *   **Platform-Level Encryption:** Utilize OS features like FileVault (macOS), BitLocker (Windows), or LUKS (Linux) to encrypt the entire disk or partition where Isar database files are stored. For mobile, use platform-specific secure storage APIs. This leverages OS capabilities to protect Isar data files.
        *   **Application-Level Encryption (Pre-Isar Storage):** Encrypt sensitive fields *before* storing them in Isar. Use established encryption libraries (e.g., libsodium, Tink) within your application code. Choose strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256, ChaCha20-Poly1305). Manage encryption keys securely, ideally using hardware-backed keystores or secure key management systems. This approach encrypts data before Isar even handles it.
    3.  **Implement Encryption:** Configure and enable the chosen encryption method. For platform-level, follow OS documentation. For application-level, integrate the chosen library, encrypt data before `isar.put()` and decrypt after `isar.get()`. Ensure encryption is applied *around* Isar data storage.
    4.  **Key Management:** Establish a secure key management strategy, especially crucial for application-level encryption.  Avoid hardcoding keys in the application. For application-level encryption, consider user-derived keys (with strong password policies), or securely stored application keys.  Key management is critical because Isar itself doesn't handle it.
    5.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test encryption and decryption processes to ensure data is correctly encrypted at rest and can be decrypted when needed. Verify performance impact of encryption, considering Isar's performance characteristics.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** If the device is lost, stolen, or compromised, attackers cannot easily access sensitive data stored in the Isar database files without the decryption key. This is especially important because Isar itself doesn't provide this protection.
    *   **Data Breaches due to Physical Security Lapses (High Severity):** Protects data even if physical security is breached and the storage medium is accessed directly. Addresses the inherent risk of local file storage used by Isar.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breaches due to Physical Security Lapses:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Platform-level encryption (FileVault on macOS for development machines) is enabled. This is a general OS setting, not Isar-specific implementation.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Application-level encryption for highly sensitive user profile data within the Isar database is not yet implemented in the production application. Key management strategy for application-level encryption needs to be defined *specifically for use with Isar stored data*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Database Access Scope (Within Isar Usage)](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_database_access_scope__within_isar_usage_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize Database Access Scope
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Modular Application Design with Isar in Mind:** Design your application with clear module boundaries and well-defined interfaces between modules, considering how each module interacts with Isar collections and data.
    2.  **Isolate Isar Data Access:** Encapsulate Isar database interactions within dedicated data access objects (DAOs) or repositories for each module. This isolates Isar-specific code and limits direct Isar access from broader application logic.
    3.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Isar Access:** Grant each module or component only the necessary access to *specific Isar collections and fields* required for its functionality. Avoid granting broad Isar database access to modules that only need to interact with a limited subset of data.  Focus on limiting access *within the context of Isar collections*.
    4.  **API Design for Isar Data Access:** Design APIs for data access that are specific to the needs of each module and their interaction with Isar. Avoid creating generic "get all data from Isar" APIs that could expose more Isar data than necessary.
    5.  **Code Reviews (Focus on Isar Access):** Conduct code reviews to ensure that Isar database access is minimized and follows the principle of least privilege. Specifically review code sections that interact with Isar.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Lateral Movement within Application (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential damage if one component of the application is compromised. An attacker gaining access to a limited-scope module will have restricted access to the Isar database *and its specific collections*.
    *   **Data Exposure through Component Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches if a vulnerability in a specific component is exploited. The compromised component will only have access to a limited subset of the Isar database.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Lateral Movement within Application:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Exposure through Component Vulnerabilities:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Application is designed with modular architecture. Data access is generally encapsulated within service layers, which indirectly limits Isar access scope.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Data access objects (DAOs) are not consistently implemented for all modules *specifically to manage Isar interactions*. Some modules still directly interact with Isar without going through a dedicated DAO, potentially leading to broader Isar access than necessary. Need to refactor modules to use DAOs and enforce stricter access control at the DAO level *for Isar operations*.
