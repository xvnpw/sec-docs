## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Isar Bugs [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_isar_bugs__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** Exploit Known Isar Bugs
*   **Description:** Attackers target publicly known vulnerabilities in specific versions of the Isar library. These vulnerabilities could be memory corruption issues, logic errors, or other flaws that allow for arbitrary code execution, data manipulation, or denial of service. Attackers typically research public vulnerability databases (like CVE) or Isar's issue tracker to find details and potentially exploit code.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (Depends on Isar's maturity and the application's update frequency)
*   **Impact:** High (Full application compromise, data breach, denial of service)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Isar Library Updated:** Regularly update the Isar library to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to Isar's security advisories or monitor their release notes for vulnerability announcements.
    *   **Implement Robust Error Handling:** Prevent unexpected application behavior that could trigger underlying Isar bugs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Isar Query Injection [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/isar_query_injection__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** Isar Query Injection
*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code or commands into Isar queries, typically by manipulating user input that is directly incorporated into query construction. This can allow attackers to bypass access controls, extract unauthorized data, modify data, or potentially execute arbitrary Isar functions, leading to data breaches or application compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If developers dynamically build queries with user input without proper sanitization)
*   **Impact:** Medium-High (Data breach, data manipulation, potentially denial of service)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Parameterized Queries:**  Always use parameterized queries or Isar's query builder methods instead of dynamically constructing queries with raw user input.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in any part of the application, including query parameters.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure database users and application roles have only the necessary permissions to access and modify data.

## Attack Tree Path: [File System Access to Isar Database Files [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/file_system_access_to_isar_database_files__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** File System Access to Isar Database Files
*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the file system where the Isar database files are stored. This could be achieved through device compromise, operating system vulnerabilities, or misconfigurations. Once file system access is obtained, attackers can directly read, modify, or delete the Isar database files, bypassing application logic and security controls. This leads to data theft, data manipulation, or data destruction.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on target platform security and attacker's access to the device/server)
*   **Impact:** High (Full data breach, data manipulation, data deletion)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Platform Security Best Practices:** Follow platform-specific security guidelines to protect the file system (e.g., OS hardening, access controls, device security policies).
    *   **Secure Device Management:** Implement measures to secure user devices and prevent unauthorized access (e.g., device encryption, strong passwords, malware protection).
    *   **Minimize Data Storage on Client-Side:** If possible, reduce the amount of sensitive data stored locally in the Isar database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Encryption Key Compromise [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH - if encryption used]](./attack_tree_paths/encryption_key_compromise__critical_node__high_risk_path_-_if_encryption_used_.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** Encryption Key Compromise
*   **Description:** If Isar database encryption is used, attackers attempt to compromise the encryption key. This could involve exploiting weak key storage mechanisms, reverse engineering the application to find hardcoded keys, or using platform-specific vulnerabilities to access secure storage where keys are kept. Once the key is compromised, attackers can decrypt the Isar database files and access sensitive data.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (Depends on the application's key management implementation)
*   **Impact:** High (Data breach - decryption of sensitive data)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Key Storage:** Utilize platform-provided secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android) to store encryption keys.
    *   **Avoid Hardcoding Keys:** Never hardcode encryption keys directly in the application code.
    *   **Key Rotation and Management:** Implement proper key rotation and management practices according to security best practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [No Encryption Used (Data at Rest in Plaintext) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH - if sensitive data stored]](./attack_tree_paths/no_encryption_used__data_at_rest_in_plaintext___critical_node__high_risk_path_-_if_sensitive_data_st_2062690e.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** No Encryption Used (Plaintext Data)
*   **Description:** If the application stores sensitive data in the Isar database and encryption is not enabled, the data is stored in plaintext on the file system. If attackers gain file system access (as described in point 3), they can directly read the plaintext database files and access sensitive information without needing to bypass any encryption.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If developers don't enable encryption and store sensitive data)
*   **Impact:** High (Data breach - plaintext access to sensitive data)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Isar Database Encryption:**  Always enable Isar database encryption when storing sensitive data at rest.
    *   **Data Minimization:**  Reduce the amount of sensitive data stored locally if possible.
    *   **Platform Security Best Practices:**  Reinforce platform security to limit unauthorized file system access, even if encryption is used as a defense-in-depth measure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Business Logic Bypass via Data Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/business_logic_bypass_via_data_manipulation__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** Business Logic Bypass via Data Manipulation
*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate data directly within the Isar database (either through file system access or potentially query injection) to bypass application business logic and access controls. If the application relies on Isar data to enforce business rules, manipulating this data directly can allow attackers to circumvent these rules, gain unauthorized access, or perform actions they should not be permitted to.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If application logic heavily relies on Isar data without sufficient validation within the application code itself)
*   **Impact:** Medium-High (Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, business logic compromise)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Application Logic:** Implement robust business logic and access controls within the application code itself, not solely relying on database data integrity.
    *   **Data Validation and Integrity Checks:**  Implement data validation and integrity checks within the application to detect and handle manipulated or inconsistent data from Isar.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Limit the application's access to Isar data to only what is strictly necessary for its functionality.
