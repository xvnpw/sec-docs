# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for isar/isar

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Configure Isar Encryption](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_configure_isar_encryption.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Key Derivation:** Implement a robust key derivation function (KDF) like Argon2id or PBKDF2. This function takes a user-provided password (or a securely stored secret) and a salt as input and generates a cryptographically strong encryption key. *Do not hardcode the key.*
    2.  **Salt Generation:** Generate a unique, cryptographically secure random salt for each user or device. Store this salt securely, ideally alongside the encrypted data (the salt itself is not secret).
    3.  **Isar Initialization:** When initializing the Isar database, provide the derived encryption key to the `Isar.open()` method using the `encryptionKey` parameter. This is the *direct Isar interaction*.
    4.  **Password Handling (if applicable):** If using a user-provided password, handle it securely. Avoid storing the password directly. Use a secure input method. Consider password manager integration.
    5. **Key Storage (if not using user password):** If deriving from a secret, store that secret securely using platform's secure storage (Android Keystore, iOS Keychain). Never store the secret in plain text.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from reading database contents if they gain file system access.
    *   **Data Breach via Backup (High Severity):** Protects data even if backups are compromised.
    *   **Reverse Engineering (Medium Severity):** Makes it harder for attackers to reverse engineer and extract sensitive data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Risk reduced from High to Very Low.
    *   **Data Breach via Backup:** Risk reduced from High to Very Low.
    *   **Reverse Engineering:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Key derivation using PBKDF2 is implemented in `lib/security/key_manager.dart`.
    *   Salt generation and storage are handled in `lib/data/database_manager.dart`.
    *   Isar encryption is enabled during database initialization in `lib/main.dart` (using `encryptionKey` in `Isar.open()`).
    *   User password handling (secure text input) is in `lib/ui/login_screen.dart`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Currently using PBKDF2; should migrate to Argon2id (planned for next release).
    *   No integration with platform-specific secure storage (Android Keystore/iOS Keychain) for the key derivation secret.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable `isar.connect()` in Production](./mitigation_strategies/disable__isar_connect____in_production.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Conditional Compilation:** Use preprocessor directives (e.g., `#if DEBUG`) or build flags (e.g., `--dart-define=DEBUG=true`) to conditionally include or exclude the `isar.connect()` call.  This directly affects how Isar is used.
    2.  **Build Configuration:** Ensure your production build configuration sets flags to disable debugging features.
    3.  **Code Review:** Include a check for `isar.connect()` calls in code reviews.
    4.  **Automated Testing:** Include tests that verify `isar.connect()` is not accessible in production.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Data Access (Critical Severity):** Prevents attackers from remotely accessing database contents via the debugging interface.
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Prevents leakage of sensitive data through the debugging interface.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Data Access:** Risk reduced from Critical to None.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from High to None.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Conditional compilation using `#if !kReleaseMode` excludes `isar.connect()` in `lib/data/database_manager.dart`.
    *   Production build configuration in `pubspec.yaml` and CI/CD pipeline ensures `kReleaseMode` is true for release builds.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No automated tests specifically verifying the absence of `isar.connect()` in production.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Schema Definition](./mitigation_strategies/strict_schema_definition.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Precise Types:** Use the most specific Isar data types available (e.g., `Int`, `Double`, `String`, `Bool`, `DateTime`, `List<Int>`, etc.) within your Isar schema definitions. Avoid using `dynamic` unless absolutely necessary. This is a *direct interaction with Isar's schema system*.
    2.  **Constraints:** Utilize Isar's schema constraints (e.g., `@Index`, `@Size32`, `@Size64`) within your schema definitions to enforce data integrity rules at the database level. This is a *direct interaction with Isar's schema system*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Prevents invalid or unexpected data from being stored, which could lead to application errors.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Low Severity):**  `@Size` annotations can help limit the size of data, mitigating some DoS vectors.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced from Low to Very Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Isar schema is defined with specific data types in `lib/models/`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Not all fields utilize appropriate size constraints (e.g., `@Size32`, `@Size64`).  More comprehensive use of constraints is needed.
