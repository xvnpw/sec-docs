## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Isar Features -> Query Design Flaws -> Query Injection](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_isar_features_-_query_design_flaws_-_query_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft malicious Isar queries to bypass intended access controls, retrieve, modify, or delete data they shouldn't have access to, or cause a denial-of-service. This is analogous to SQL injection. The attacker leverages improperly sanitized user input that is directly used in constructing Isar queries.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   *Strictly use Isar's query builder methods (parameterized queries).* Never construct queries using string concatenation with user input.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization *before* using any user-provided data in queries, even with parameterized queries (defense-in-depth).
    *   Enforce least privilege principles: Ensure the database user account used by the application has only the necessary permissions.
    *   Implement query complexity limits and timeouts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Isar Features -> Index Design Flaws -> Index Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_isar_features_-_index_design_flaws_-_index_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers (or poorly written application code) create an excessive number of indexes or trigger the creation of very large indexes, leading to storage exhaustion or significant performance degradation. This is more likely to be a result of developer error than a direct attack, unless index creation is somehow exposed to users.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (attacker-controlled), Medium (developer error)
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Carefully design indexes; only create those that are strictly necessary for performance.
    *   Monitor index sizes and set alerts for unusually large indexes.
    *   Implement rate limiting if index creation is user-controllable (unlikely).

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Isar Features -> Link Design Flaws -> Link Creation Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_isar_features_-_link_design_flaws_-_link_creation_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers create circular links or excessively deep link chains, leading to infinite loops or stack overflows when Isar traverses the links. This requires the attacker to have some control over link creation.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement validation logic to prevent the creation of circular links.
    *   Set reasonable limits on the depth of link traversal during queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Isar Features -> Watch Design Flaws -> Watch Abuse](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_isar_features_-_watch_design_flaws_-_watch_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers register a large number of watchers or trigger frequent updates to watched objects, leading to excessive CPU usage or network traffic.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Limit the number of watchers per user or object.
    *   Implement debouncing or throttling to reduce the frequency of updates.
    *   Use watchers judiciously, only where real-time updates are essential.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Isar Bugs -> Schema Design Errors](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_isar_bugs_-_schema_design_errors.md)

*   **Description:** Developer errors in the Isar schema definition, such as using excessively large string fields without proper validation or other mistakes, can lead to resource exhaustion or other vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Thorough schema review and validation.
    *   Fuzz testing of schema parsing (if applicable).
    *   Strict input validation based on schema constraints.
    *   Limit string/binary sizes in the schema.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Isar Bugs -> Data Type Errors](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_isar_bugs_-_data_type_errors.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs in Isar's handling of different data types (e.g., integer overflows, floating-point precision issues, incorrect serialization) could lead to data corruption or other unexpected behavior.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Comprehensive testing of all data types and edge cases.
    *   Leverage Dart's strong typing.
    *   Implement boundary checks for numeric data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Isar Dependencies -> FFI (Dart) Bugs](./attack_tree_paths/target_isar_dependencies_-_ffi__dart__bugs.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Foreign Function Interface (FFI) layer or the underlying native libraries used by Isar.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low to Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
*   **Mitigation:** Keep Isar and its dependencies updated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Isar Dependencies -> WASM (WASM) Bugs](./attack_tree_paths/target_isar_dependencies_-_wasm__wasm__bugs.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the WebAssembly (WASM) runtime or the WASM code generated by Isar.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low to Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
*   **Mitigation:** Keep Isar and its dependencies updated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Isar Dependencies -> Other Libs Bugs](./attack_tree_paths/target_isar_dependencies_-_other_libs_bugs.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in other Dart or Flutter libraries that Isar depends on.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Variable
*   **Effort:** Variable
*   **Skill Level:** Variable
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Variable
*   **Mitigation:** Keep all dependencies updated; use vulnerability scanners.
