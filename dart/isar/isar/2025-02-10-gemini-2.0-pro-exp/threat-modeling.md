# Threat Model Analysis for isar/isar

## Threat: [Database File Tampering (Direct Modification)](./threats/database_file_tampering__direct_modification_.md)

*   **Threat:** Database File Tampering (Direct Modification)

    *   **Description:** An attacker with direct file system access (e.g., on a rooted/jailbroken mobile device, a compromised desktop system, or if the database file is stored in an insecure, user-accessible location) uses a hex editor or other tools to directly modify the Isar database file. They could alter existing data, inject new records, or delete records. This bypasses any application-level checks.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data corruption, leading to application crashes or incorrect behavior.
        *   Injection of malicious data that could be used to exploit other vulnerabilities in the application.
        *   Unauthorized modification of sensitive data (e.g., financial records, personal information).
        *   Circumvention of application logic, potentially leading to unauthorized access or actions.
    *   **Isar Component Affected:** The core database file storage mechanism (implementation details vary depending on the platform, but generally involves the `.isar` file).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive data is stored) or Critical (if the database controls critical application functionality).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure File Storage:** Store the database file in a location protected by the operating system's security mechanisms. On mobile, this is usually handled automatically by the OS. On desktop, choose a secure, application-specific directory and set appropriate file permissions.
        *   **Data Validation (Pre-Write):**  Implement rigorous data validation *before* writing to Isar.  This helps prevent corrupted or malicious data from being stored in the first place.
        *   **Checksums/Hashing (External):**  For critical data, calculate and store checksums or cryptographic hashes of the data *outside* of Isar (e.g., in a separate file or using a platform-specific secure storage mechanism).  On data retrieval, verify the checksums to detect tampering.
        *   **Regular Backups (Encrypted):**  Implement a robust backup and restore mechanism.  Encrypt the backups to protect them from unauthorized access.
        *   **Tamper Detection (Advanced):** Consider using file integrity monitoring tools (if available on the target platform) to detect unauthorized modifications to the database file.

## Threat: [Data Leakage via Unencrypted Database](./threats/data_leakage_via_unencrypted_database.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Leakage via Unencrypted Database

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Isar database file, which is not encrypted at rest. They can then open the file and read the contents directly, potentially exposing sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of sensitive user data, potentially leading to privacy violations, identity theft, or financial loss.
        *   Loss of confidential business data.
        *   Compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
    *   **Isar Component Affected:** The core database file storage; specifically, the lack of use of Isar's built-in encryption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive data is stored) or Critical (if the data is highly regulated or confidential).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable Isar's Encryption:**  Use Isar's built-in encryption feature (`encryption: true` in the configuration). This encrypts the database file at rest.
        *   **Secure Key Management:**  Generate a strong, random encryption key. *Never* hardcode the key in the application code. Store the key securely using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Keychain on macOS/iOS, Keystore on Android, DPAPI on Windows).  Consider key rotation strategies.
        *   **Data Minimization:**  Store only the absolutely necessary data in Isar.  Avoid storing sensitive data that is not essential for the application's functionality.

## Threat: [Schema Migration Errors (Leading to Data Loss/Corruption)](./threats/schema_migration_errors__leading_to_data_losscorruption_.md)

*   **Threat:** Schema Migration Errors (Leading to Data Loss/Corruption)

    *   **Description:** Flawed schema migration logic within the application, using Isar's migration features, results in data loss or corruption during the database upgrade process. This is a direct threat because the vulnerability lies in *how* the application uses Isar's migration functionality.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Irreversible data loss: Records or fields might be incorrectly deleted or transformed.
        *   Data corruption: Data becomes inconsistent, leading to application malfunctions.
        *   Application downtime: The application may become unusable until the database is restored or the migration is fixed.
    *   **Isar Component Affected:** `Isar.open()` with a schema that differs from the existing database, triggering the migration process. The developer-written migration code is the critical point.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if the database contains important data and migrations are frequent or complex).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Extensive Testing:** Thoroughly test all schema migrations with diverse datasets, including edge cases. Automate testing for consistency.
        *   **Mandatory Backups:** Create a complete database backup *immediately before* any migration. This is crucial for recovery.
        *   **Staged Rollouts:** If possible, deploy schema changes gradually to a subset of users first, to catch errors early.
        *   **Version Control:** Use version control (e.g., Git) for all schema and migration code.
        *   **Atomic Migrations:** Design migrations to be as small and self-contained as possible.
        *   **Rollback Plan:** Have a documented and tested procedure for reverting a failed migration.
