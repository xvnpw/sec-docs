# Attack Surface Analysis for isar/isar

## Attack Surface: [Data Corruption (via Isar/LMDB Interaction)](./attack_surfaces/data_corruption__via_isarlmdb_interaction_.md)

*   **Description:**  Unintentional or malicious modification of the database contents due to flaws *within Isar's code* that interacts with LMDB. This excludes general file system issues or vulnerabilities solely within LMDB itself (covered separately).
*   **How Isar Contributes:** Isar's LMDB wrapper, transaction handling logic, and data serialization/deserialization routines are the direct attack surface. Bugs in *Isar's implementation* are the key concern.
*   **Example:** A race condition in Isar's multi-threaded access logic (using multiple isolates) *within Isar's code* could lead to inconsistent writes, corrupting the database. Or, a bug in Isar's handling of a specific data type during serialization *within Isar's code* could cause incorrect data to be written.
*   **Impact:** Data loss, application instability, incorrect results, potential denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Isar Updates:** Keep Isar up-to-date to benefit from bug fixes and security patches specifically addressing Isar's LMDB interaction and data handling code.
    *   **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling within the application to detect Isar-reported errors (e.g., `IsarError`) and attempt graceful recovery or data validation. This focuses on handling errors *returned by Isar*.
    *   **Multi-Isolate Synchronization:** If using multiple isolates accessing the same Isar database, rigorously test for race conditions *within Isar's code* and ensure proper synchronization using Isar's provided mechanisms (or carefully designed custom solutions that interact correctly with Isar's concurrency model).

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (via Index Manipulation)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__via_index_manipulation_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms *Isar's indexing mechanism* with requests to create excessive or overly large indexes, leading to resource exhaustion. This focuses on the attack surface presented by *Isar's index handling code*.
*   **How Isar Contributes:** Isar's code responsible for creating, managing, and using indexes is the direct target.
*   **Example:** If the application allows any form of user-controlled index creation (even indirectly), an attacker could exploit *Isar's index handling logic* to create a large number of indexes or indexes on very large fields, causing Isar to consume excessive resources.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, application unavailability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if user-controlled index creation is allowed),
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Limit Index Creation:**  Strictly limit the number, size, and type of indexes that can be created, especially if users have any influence over index definition.  Avoid allowing arbitrary index creation based on user input. This directly mitigates the impact on *Isar's code*.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor Isar's resource usage (memory, disk I/O, CPU) to detect potential DoS attacks targeting *Isar's indexing functionality*. Implement alerts for unusual resource consumption *by Isar*.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** If index creation is exposed to users (even indirectly), implement rate limiting to prevent an attacker from rapidly creating a large number of indexes, thus limiting the load on *Isar's code*.

## Attack Surface: [Isar Inspector Exposure](./attack_surfaces/isar_inspector_exposure.md)

*   **Description:**  The Isar Inspector, a debugging tool *provided by Isar*, is accidentally left enabled in a production environment or is accessible to unauthorized users.
*   **How Isar Contributes:** Isar *provides* the Inspector tool. Its *misconfiguration or misuse* is the vulnerability, but the tool itself is part of Isar.
*   **Example:**  The application is deployed with the Isar Inspector enabled and accessible without authentication. An attacker discovers the Inspector endpoint (provided by Isar) and can view, modify, or delete data.
*   **Impact:**  Data breach, data modification, data deletion, potential for further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable in Production:**  **Absolutely disable the Isar Inspector in production builds.** This is the most crucial mitigation and directly addresses the risk of exposing *Isar's tool*. Use conditional compilation or build flags to ensure it's only enabled in development environments.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** If the Inspector *must* be used in a non-production but potentially exposed environment, protect it with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.  Ensure only authorized personnel can access *Isar's tool*.
