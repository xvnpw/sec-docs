## High and Critical Isar Threats

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the Isar database.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Isar Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Local File Tampering** | An attacker with physical access to the device or through malware directly modifies the Isar database files, bypassing application logic. They might use a file explorer or scripting tools to alter the raw data. | Data corruption, unauthorized modification of user data, manipulation of application state, potential privilege escalation within the application if data controls access. | Core Storage Engine (Isar Files) | High | - **Device Security:** Encourage users to secure their devices with strong passwords/biometrics. <br> - **File System Permissions:** Ensure appropriate file system permissions are set for the Isar database files, limiting access to the application's user. <br> - **Data Integrity Checks:** Implement checksums or other integrity checks on critical data within Isar to detect tampering. <br> - **Encryption at Rest:** Utilize Isar's built-in encryption feature with a strong, securely managed encryption key. Understand the limitations of Isar's encryption and key management. <br> - **Root/Jailbreak Detection:** Implement checks to detect if the device is rooted or jailbroken, as this increases the risk of file system access. |
| **Local File Access (Unencrypted Data)** | An attacker with physical access to the device or through malware directly reads the Isar database files if encryption is not enabled or is poorly implemented. They can use file explorers or scripting tools to access the raw data. | Exposure of sensitive user data, business logic, or application secrets stored within Isar. | Core Storage Engine (Isar Files) | Critical | - **Mandatory Encryption:** Enforce the use of Isar's encryption feature for sensitive data. <br> - **Secure Key Management:** Implement robust key management practices. Avoid hardcoding keys. Consider using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain). <br> - **Regular Security Audits:** Review the encryption implementation and key management practices. |
| **Synchronization Vulnerabilities (Isar Sync)** | An attacker intercepts communication during Isar Sync, performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to eavesdrop on or modify synchronized data. They might exploit insecure transport protocols or vulnerabilities in the sync server's handling of Isar data. | Exposure or modification of synchronized data, potentially affecting multiple users or devices. | Isar Sync Module, Network Communication | High | - **Secure Communication:** Ensure all communication during synchronization uses HTTPS/TLS with strong ciphers. <br> - **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for the sync server interacting with Isar data. <br> - **Input Validation on Sync Server:** Validate data received from clients during synchronization to prevent injection attacks targeting Isar data structures. <br> - **Regular Security Audits of Sync Infrastructure:** Thoroughly review the security of the synchronization server and its components, focusing on Isar data handling. |
| **Vulnerabilities in Isar Library Itself** | An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability within the Isar library code. This could involve crafting specific inputs or exploiting logic flaws within Isar's core functionality. | Wide range of potential impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., data corruption, information disclosure, potential for local code execution within the application's context). | Core Library Code, Specific Modules (e.g., Query, Encryption, Storage) | Critical | - **Stay Updated:** Keep the Isar library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches. <br> - **Monitor Security Advisories:** Follow Isar's release notes and any security advisories related to the library. <br> - **Community Scrutiny:** Benefit from the open-source nature of Isar and the potential for community identification of vulnerabilities. |
| **Weaknesses in Isar's Encryption Implementation** | An attacker exploits weaknesses in Isar's encryption implementation (e.g., use of weak algorithms, insecure key derivation, improper key storage) even if encryption is enabled. | Sensitive data can be easily decrypted despite encryption being enabled. | Encryption Module | Critical | - **Use Strong Encryption Options:** Utilize the strongest encryption algorithms offered by Isar. <br> - **Secure Key Derivation:** Employ robust key derivation functions (if applicable) to generate encryption keys from user secrets. <br> - **Secure Key Storage:** Utilize platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain) for storing encryption keys. <br> - **Regular Security Audits:** Have the encryption implementation reviewed by security experts. |
| **Data Manipulation for Privilege Escalation** | An attacker modifies data within Isar that is directly used for access control or authorization within the application, granting themselves higher privileges. This exploits the application's reliance on Isar data for security decisions. | Unauthorized access to sensitive features or data, ability to perform actions beyond authorized scope. | Core Storage Engine, Application Logic directly interacting with Isar data for authorization | High | - **Server-Side Validation:** Perform critical authorization checks on the server-side whenever possible, rather than solely relying on local Isar data. <br> - **Data Integrity Checks:** Ensure the integrity of Isar data used for authorization. <br> - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design the application so that even if local Isar data is compromised, the impact on overall security is minimized. |
