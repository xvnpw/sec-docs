# Threat Model Analysis for isar/isar

## Threat: [Unencrypted Data Exposure](./threats/unencrypted_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the device's file system (e.g., through malware, physical access to a lost device, or OS vulnerabilities) and directly reads the Isar database file, which contains sensitive data in plaintext. This is a direct consequence of Isar's default behavior of storing data unencrypted.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of sensitive data stored within the Isar database, leading to privacy violations, identity theft, financial loss, or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Isar Component:** Core data storage mechanism (database file on disk).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always enable Isar's encryption feature using a strong, securely managed password.
        *   Utilize platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain) to protect the encryption password used with Isar.

## Threat: [Insecure Encryption Key Management](./threats/insecure_encryption_key_management.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers or compromises the encryption key used *with Isar* to protect the database. This could happen if the key is hardcoded in the application, stored in an easily accessible location, or transmitted insecurely, directly impacting Isar's encryption effectiveness.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can decrypt the Isar database and access all stored data, effectively bypassing Isar's encryption. This has the same impact as unencrypted data exposure.
    *   **Affected Isar Component:** Encryption feature, specifically the key management aspect within the context of Isar's usage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never hardcode the encryption key used for Isar directly in the application code.
        *   Avoid storing the key in easily accessible locations like shared preferences or application settings without additional protection.
        *   Use platform-provided secure storage mechanisms for the encryption key used with Isar.
        *   If the key needs to be derived from user input (e.g., a passphrase), ensure a strong key derivation function (like PBKDF2 or Argon2) is used with a high number of iterations and a salt when setting up Isar's encryption.

## Threat: [Data Corruption via File System Manipulation](./threats/data_corruption_via_file_system_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with access to the device's file system intentionally or unintentionally corrupts the Isar database file. This directly affects the integrity of the data managed by Isar.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss within the Isar database, application crashes due to Isar being unable to read or process corrupted data, or unpredictable application behavior stemming from inconsistent data. If critical data managed by Isar is corrupted, the application may become unusable or provide incorrect information.
    *   **Affected Isar Component:** Core data storage mechanism (database file on disk).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement data integrity checks within the application to detect corruption of the Isar database.
        *   Consider implementing backup and restore mechanisms specifically for the Isar database.

## Threat: [Data Tampering via Application Vulnerabilities](./threats/data_tampering_via_application_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the application's code to bypass intended data access controls and directly modify data within the Isar database. While the vulnerability isn't *in* Isar, the target of the tampering is Isar's data.
    *   **Impact:** Modification of sensitive data stored within Isar, leading to incorrect application behavior, data integrity issues within Isar, and potential security breaches if the tampered data is used for authorization or other critical functions.
    *   **Affected Isar Component:** The application's interaction layer with Isar (e.g., data access objects, business logic) leading to the direct manipulation of Isar data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices to minimize application vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized Isar data modification.
        *   Implement robust authorization and access control mechanisms within the application logic when interacting with Isar to prevent unauthorized data changes.
        *   Perform regular security audits and penetration testing of the application, focusing on how it interacts with Isar.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Isar Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_isar_library_itself.md)

*   **Description:** A security vulnerability is discovered within the Isar library code itself. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if the application uses a vulnerable version of the library.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability. It could range from data corruption within Isar or crashes due to Isar errors, to more severe issues like remote code execution or data breaches if the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to or manipulation of Isar's internal state or data.
    *   **Affected Isar Component:** Any component within the Isar library affected by the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Can range from Low to Critical depending on the vulnerability, but vulnerabilities allowing data breaches or remote code execution are Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest versions of the Isar library.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories and release notes for Isar to be informed of any identified vulnerabilities and necessary updates.
        *   Regularly review and update dependencies of the application to ensure you are using the most secure version of Isar.
