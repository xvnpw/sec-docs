## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Isar Data](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_isar_data.md)

This path represents the attacker's objective to directly access the data stored within the Isar database without proper authorization. Success here leads to a breach of confidentiality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Encryption Key Management](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_encryption_key_management.md)

If the encryption key used by Isar is stored insecurely (e.g., in easily accessible locations like shared preferences without proper protection or directly hardcoded in the application), an attacker can retrieve this key. Once the key is obtained, the attacker can decrypt the Isar database and access all its contents.

## Attack Tree Path: [Retrieve Key from Insecure Storage (e.g., shared preferences, hardcoded)](./attack_tree_paths/retrieve_key_from_insecure_storage__e_g___shared_preferences__hardcoded_.md)

This specific step within the "Exploit Weak Encryption Key Management" node involves the attacker finding and extracting the encryption key from a vulnerable storage location. This often requires minimal technical skill and readily available tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Operating System Level Access Controls](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_operating_system_level_access_controls.md)

This node signifies an attacker circumventing the standard operating system security measures to gain access to the file system where the Isar database is stored. This bypass allows them to interact with the database file directly, regardless of Isar's internal security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure File Permissions on Isar Database File](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_file_permissions_on_isar_database_file.md)

This step and node are critical because if the permissions on the Isar database file are set too permissively, an attacker with limited access to the device can directly read the file. This bypasses any application-level access controls and encryption at rest if the attacker can later decrypt the data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Application State through Isar](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_application_state_through_isar.md)

This path focuses on attackers altering the application's behavior or data by exploiting weaknesses in how the application interacts with the Isar database. Success here can lead to data corruption, application malfunction, or unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Input Validation on Data Persisted to Isar](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_input_validation_on_data_persisted_to_isar.md)

If the application does not properly validate or sanitize data before storing it in Isar, an attacker can inject malicious data. This data, when later retrieved and processed by the application, can trigger unexpected behavior, logic errors, or even vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Data that Triggers Application Logic Errors](./attack_tree_paths/inject_data_that_triggers_application_logic_errors.md)

This step within the "Exploit Lack of Input Validation" node involves the attacker successfully inserting malicious data that causes the application to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly when processing that data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Isar Query Language Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_isar_query_language_vulnerabilities.md)

Similar to SQL injection, if the application dynamically constructs Isar queries based on user input without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious query fragments. This allows them to bypass intended data access restrictions, retrieve more data than authorized, or potentially manipulate data within the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Perform Isar Injection Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/perform_isar_injection_attacks.md)

This step within the "Exploit Isar Query Language Vulnerabilities" node involves the attacker crafting and executing malicious Isar queries to achieve unauthorized data access or manipulation.
