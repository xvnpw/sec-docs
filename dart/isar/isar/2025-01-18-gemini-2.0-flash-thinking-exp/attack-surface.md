# Attack Surface Analysis for isar/isar

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Flaws in how Isar reads and interprets serialized data. Maliciously crafted data could exploit these flaws.

**How Isar Contributes:** Isar uses a custom binary format for serialization. Vulnerabilities in the deserialization logic within Isar could be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker provides a specially crafted Isar database file or data stream that, when opened or processed by the application using Isar, triggers a buffer overflow or code execution within the Isar library.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, application crashes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate any Isar database files or data streams received from untrusted sources before attempting to open or process them.
* **Isolate Processing:** If possible, process data from untrusted sources in isolated environments to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
* **Keep Isar Updated:** Regularly update Isar to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Query Injection](./attack_surfaces/query_injection.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities where user-controlled input is directly incorporated into Isar queries without proper sanitization.

**How Isar Contributes:** While Isar doesn't use SQL, its query language can be susceptible if dynamic query construction is not handled carefully.

**Example:** An application allows users to filter data based on a string input. If this input is directly used to build an Isar query without sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious query fragments to access or manipulate unintended data.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Parameterized Queries/Safe Query Building:** Utilize Isar's features for building queries safely, avoiding direct string concatenation of user input.
* **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize and validate all user inputs that are used to construct Isar queries.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design queries to only access the necessary data.

## Attack Surface: [File System Access Control Issues](./attack_surfaces/file_system_access_control_issues.md)

**Description:** Insufficiently restrictive permissions on the files where Isar stores its data.

**How Isar Contributes:** Isar stores data in files on the file system. If these files are accessible to unauthorized users or processes, the integrity and confidentiality of the data are at risk.

**Example:** The Isar database files are stored in a directory with world-readable permissions, allowing any user on the system to access and potentially modify the database.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, unauthorized modification.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Restrict File Permissions:** Ensure that the directories and files used by Isar have the most restrictive permissions possible, allowing access only to the application user.
* **Secure Storage Location:** Choose a secure location for storing Isar database files, considering the operating system's security features.

## Attack Surface: [Encryption Implementation Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/encryption_implementation_weaknesses.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the implementation of Isar's encryption at rest feature.

**How Isar Contributes:** Isar offers encryption for its data files. Weaknesses in the encryption algorithm, key management, or implementation could be exploited.

**Example:** Isar uses a weak or outdated encryption algorithm, or the encryption key is stored insecurely, allowing an attacker to decrypt the database contents.

**Impact:** Data breaches, loss of confidentiality.

**Risk Severity:** High (if encryption is relied upon for security)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Use Strong Encryption:** Ensure Isar is configured to use strong and up-to-date encryption algorithms.
* **Secure Key Management:** Implement robust key management practices, storing encryption keys securely and separately from the database.
* **Regularly Review Configuration:** Periodically review Isar's encryption configuration to ensure it aligns with security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Management Issues](./attack_surfaces/memory_management_issues.md)

**Description:** Bugs within Isar's native code that could lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities.

**How Isar Contributes:** As a native library, Isar involves manual memory management in certain parts. Errors in this management can lead to vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A buffer overflow or use-after-free vulnerability within Isar's code could be triggered by specific data or operations, potentially leading to code execution.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, application crashes.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep Isar Updated:** Regularly update Isar to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* **Report Potential Issues:** If you encounter unexpected behavior or suspect a memory management issue, report it to the Isar developers.
