## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Isar Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_isar_vulnerabilities.md)

**1. Exploit Isar Vulnerabilities (Critical Node & Start of High-Risk Path):**

*   **Code Injection via Isar Query Language (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Craft Malicious Isar Query (Critical Node):** Attackers aim to inject malicious code into Isar queries.
        *   **Inject Malicious Filter Conditions (High-Risk Path):** By manipulating filter conditions, attackers can bypass intended restrictions and access unauthorized data.
*   **Data Corruption (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Write Malformed Data to Isar Database (Critical Node):** Attackers attempt to write invalid or unexpected data to the Isar database.
        *   **Exploit Lack of Input Validation (High-Risk Path):**  Applications failing to validate input allow attackers to insert malformed data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Isar Features](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_isar_features.md)

**2. Abuse Isar Features (High-Risk Path):**

*   **Data Exfiltration (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Leverage Isar Querying for Unauthorized Data Retrieval (Critical Node):** Attackers misuse Isar's query functionality to extract sensitive information.
        *   **Exploit Insecure Query Construction (High-Risk Path):**  Vulnerabilities in how queries are built allow attackers to craft queries for unauthorized data retrieval.
*   **Data Modification (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Leverage Isar Querying for Unauthorized Data Updates/Deletions (Critical Node):** Attackers misuse Isar's query functionality to alter or delete data without authorization.
        *   **Exploit Insecure Query Construction (High-Risk Path):** Vulnerabilities in how update/delete queries are built allow for unauthorized data modification.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Isar's Storage Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_isar's_storage_mechanisms.md)

**3. Exploit Isar's Storage Mechanisms (Critical Node & Start of High-Risk Path):**

*   **Direct File Access (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Access Isar Database Files Directly (Critical Node):** Attackers gain direct access to the files where Isar stores its data.
        *   **Exploit Insufficient File System Permissions (High-Risk Path):** Weak file system permissions allow unauthorized access to Isar data files.
        *   **Exploit Lack of Encryption at Rest (High-Risk Path):** If data is not encrypted, direct file access leads to immediate data exposure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Isar](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_isar.md)

**4. Exploit Dependencies of Isar (High-Risk Path):**

*   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (Critical Node):** Attackers target known security flaws in libraries that Isar relies upon.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Data Handling](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_data_handling.md)

**5. Insecure Data Handling (High-Risk Path):**

*   **Expose Sensitive Data in Isar Objects Without Proper Sanitization (Critical Node):** The application inadvertently reveals sensitive information retrieved from Isar due to a lack of proper sanitization before display or use.
