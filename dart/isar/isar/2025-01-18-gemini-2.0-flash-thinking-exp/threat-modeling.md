# Threat Model Analysis for isar/isar

## Threat: [Insecure Default Storage](./threats/insecure_default_storage.md)

**Description:** An attacker with physical access to the device could potentially access the raw Isar database files stored in the default location. They might copy, modify, or delete these files directly, bypassing any application-level security measures.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach (sensitive data exposed), data integrity compromise (data modified or deleted), application unavailability (database files deleted or corrupted).

**Affected Isar Component:** Storage Layer (default file location and permissions).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Utilize platform-specific secure storage mechanisms provided by the operating system for storing Isar database files.
*   Avoid storing highly sensitive data without encryption, even in secure storage.

## Threat: [Lack of Built-in Encryption at Rest](./threats/lack_of_built-in_encryption_at_rest.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to the Isar database files (through physical access or other means) can read the data directly if it's not encrypted by the application.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach (sensitive data exposed).

**Affected Isar Component:** Core Functionality (lack of built-in encryption feature).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement application-level encryption for sensitive data before storing it in Isar.
*   Use established encryption libraries and follow best practices for key management.

## Threat: [Database Corruption Leading to Unavailability](./threats/database_corruption_leading_to_unavailability.md)

**Description:**  Various factors (application bugs *in Isar interaction*, storage issues, or even direct file manipulation) can lead to corruption of the Isar database files, making the data inaccessible to the application.

**Impact:** Application unavailability, data loss.

**Affected Isar Component:** Storage Layer, Core Functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms for Isar operations.
*   Consider implementing backup and restore strategies for the Isar database.
*   Monitor storage health and ensure sufficient free space.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Isar Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_isar_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Isar relies on other libraries and components. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could potentially be exploited to compromise the Isar database or the application.

**Impact:** Various, depending on the vulnerability in the dependency (could range from data breaches to application crashes).

**Affected Isar Component:** Dependencies (external libraries used by Isar).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep Isar and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security auditing tools.
