# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for isar/isar

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data-at-Rest Encryption (Application-Level)](./mitigation_strategies/data-at-rest_encryption__application-level_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Recognize that Isar *does not* provide built-in data-at-rest encryption.
    2.  Implement encryption of sensitive data *before* storing it in Isar. This involves using encryption libraries within your application code to encrypt data objects in memory before calling Isar's `put()` or similar methods.
    3.  Choose a strong encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-256) and a suitable encryption library compatible with your development platform (Dart/Flutter).
    4.  Manage encryption keys securely, utilizing platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (like `flutter_secure_storage` in Flutter or Keychain/Keystore on native platforms) to store keys separately from the Isar database.
    5.  Implement corresponding decryption logic when retrieving data from Isar, decrypting data objects after fetching them from Isar but before using them in the application.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access via Database File (High Severity): If an attacker gains access to the Isar database file (e.g., through physical device access or file system vulnerabilities), the data remains encrypted and unreadable without the encryption key. This directly addresses the lack of built-in encryption in Isar.
    *   Data Breaches from Device Loss/Theft (High Severity): Protects sensitive data on lost or stolen devices by ensuring it is encrypted within the Isar database, mitigating the risk inherent in local data storage with Isar.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access via Database File: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Data Breaches from Device Loss/Theft: Significantly reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No
*   **Missing Implementation:** Application-level data-at-rest encryption is not currently implemented for data stored in Isar. This is a direct mitigation for Isar's lack of built-in encryption.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Isar's Query Builder Correctly](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_isar's_query_builder_correctly.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Always use Isar's provided query builder methods (e.g., `isarCollection.where()`, `.filter()`, `.build()`, `.find()`, `.findAll()`) to construct database queries.
    2.  Avoid manually crafting raw query strings or using string interpolation to build queries with user-provided input. Isar's query builder is designed to parameterize queries implicitly, preventing injection vulnerabilities.
    3.  Familiarize developers with the correct usage of Isar's query builder API and emphasize its importance for secure query construction.
    4.  Conduct code reviews to ensure that all Isar queries are built using the query builder and not through manual string manipulation.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Query Injection Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity, *mitigated by Isar's design*):  While Isar's query builder is designed to prevent injection, incorrect usage or attempts to bypass it could potentially introduce vulnerabilities. This mitigation emphasizes using Isar as intended to leverage its built-in protection.
    *   Unintended Query Behavior (Low to Medium Severity): Using the query builder correctly ensures queries are constructed as intended, reducing the risk of logical errors or unexpected data retrieval due to malformed queries.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Query Injection Vulnerabilities: Significantly reduces risk *if used correctly*.
    *   Unintended Query Behavior: Partially reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes
*   **Missing Implementation:**  The application generally uses Isar's query builder. However, ongoing code reviews and developer training are needed to ensure consistent and correct usage across all features and prevent potential deviations that might weaken this mitigation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage Isar Transactions for Data Integrity](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_isar_transactions_for_data_integrity.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify database operations that require atomicity and consistency when using Isar. This includes operations involving multiple steps or modifications that must be treated as a single unit.
    2.  Wrap these operations within Isar transactions using `isar.writeTxn()` for write operations or `isar.readTxn()` for read operations requiring transactional consistency.
    3.  Implement proper error handling within transactions. If any operation within a transaction fails, allow the transaction to rollback to maintain data integrity as guaranteed by Isar's transaction mechanism.
    4.  Educate developers on the importance of Isar transactions for maintaining data integrity and consistency, especially in scenarios involving concurrent operations or potential interruptions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Corruption due to Partial Writes (Medium Severity): Isar transactions prevent partial writes by ensuring that a series of operations are completed atomically. This directly utilizes Isar's transaction feature to mitigate data corruption risks.
    *   Data Inconsistency (Medium Severity): Transactions guarantee consistency by ensuring that related database operations are treated as a single, indivisible unit, leveraging Isar's transactional guarantees.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Corruption due to Partial Writes: Partially reduces risk.
    *   Data Inconsistency: Partially reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially
*   **Missing Implementation:** Transactions are used in some critical data modification flows, but a systematic review is needed to ensure all multi-step or critical operations that rely on Isar for data integrity are consistently protected by Isar transactions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Isar Library Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_isar_library_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a process for regularly monitoring for updates to the Isar database library (https://github.com/isar/isar) and its dependencies.
    2.  Subscribe to Isar's release notes, GitHub releases, and community channels to receive notifications about new versions and potential security advisories.
    3.  Integrate dependency update checks into the development workflow and build pipeline to automate the detection of outdated Isar versions.
    4.  Prioritize applying updates to Isar, especially security patches and bug fixes, in a timely manner. Test updates in a staging environment before deploying to production.
    5.  Maintain documentation of the Isar version used in the application for traceability and security auditing.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Isar Vulnerabilities (High to Low Severity, depending on the vulnerability): Regularly updating Isar mitigates the risk of attackers exploiting known security vulnerabilities that may be discovered in Isar itself. This is a direct mitigation for vulnerabilities within the Isar library.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Isar Vulnerabilities: Significantly reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially
*   **Missing Implementation:** Dependency updates are performed, but a formalized and proactive process specifically for monitoring and promptly applying Isar library updates, especially security-related updates, is not fully established.
