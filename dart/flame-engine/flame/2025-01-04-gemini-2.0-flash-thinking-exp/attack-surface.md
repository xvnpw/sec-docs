# Attack Surface Analysis for flame-engine/flame

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Asset Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_asset_loading.md)

**Description:** Flame's asset loading mechanisms process various asset types (images, audio, fonts, etc.). Maliciously crafted assets can exploit vulnerabilities within Flame's internal asset parsing or rendering logic.

**How Flame Contributes:** Flame provides the core functionality for loading and interpreting asset files. Weaknesses in its decoding libraries or processing pipeline can be directly exploited.

**Example:** A specially crafted PNG image, when loaded by Flame's image decoding library, triggers a buffer overflow, allowing for arbitrary code execution on the user's device.

**Impact:**
* Code Execution: Attackers can gain control of the user's system.
* Denial of Service (DoS): The application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to resource exhaustion or errors in Flame's rendering.
* Information Disclosure:  Exploiting vulnerabilities in asset parsers might allow access to memory regions containing sensitive data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developer:**
    * Utilize secure and well-audited asset decoding libraries within Flame.
    * Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all loaded asset data *before* passing it to Flame's internal processing.
    * Consider sandboxing or isolating asset processing within Flame to limit the impact of potential exploits.
    * Regularly update Flame to benefit from security patches in its asset handling components.

## Attack Surface: [Asset Path Traversal through Flame's APIs](./attack_surfaces/asset_path_traversal_through_flame's_apis.md)

**Description:**  If the application allows user-controlled input to influence asset paths passed to Flame's asset loading functions without proper sanitization, attackers can access unintended files.

**How Flame Contributes:** Flame's asset loading APIs, if used without careful validation of the provided paths, can be exploited to access files outside the intended asset directories.

**Example:** An attacker manipulates a game configuration setting that directly feeds into Flame's asset loading function, allowing them to load arbitrary files from the device's file system.

**Impact:**
* Information Disclosure: Access to sensitive application files or system files readable by the application.
* Application Tampering: Loading of modified or malicious assets that could alter game behavior.
* Potential Code Execution: If the attacker can load and influence the execution of scripts or libraries.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developer:**
    * Avoid directly using user-provided input as asset paths in Flame's loading functions.
    * Implement strict path validation and sanitization *before* passing paths to Flame.
    * Use relative paths and restrict asset loading to predefined, secure directories within the application.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Flame's Direct Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_flame's_direct_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Flame relies on specific underlying libraries for core functionalities. Vulnerabilities within these direct dependencies can be exploited through applications using Flame.

**How Flame Contributes:** Flame directly integrates and utilizes these libraries. If these specific libraries have known high or critical severity vulnerabilities, any application using that version of Flame is potentially at risk.

**Example:** A critical vulnerability in the specific version of the rendering library used by Flame allows an attacker to trigger remote code execution by crafting specific rendering commands that Flame utilizes.

**Impact:**
* Code Execution: Attackers can gain control of the user's system.
* Denial of Service (DoS): The application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to errors within the vulnerable dependency triggered by Flame's usage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developer:**
    * Regularly update Flame to the latest versions, ensuring that dependency updates include security patches for known vulnerabilities.
    * Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in the specific versions of libraries that Flame depends on.
    * Consider using tools that scan for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities Introduced by Flame's Features (if applicable)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_flame's_features__if_applicable_.md)

**Description:** If Flame provides or recommends specific mechanisms for serializing and deserializing game state or other data, vulnerabilities in these processes can allow for arbitrary code execution.

**How Flame Contributes:** If Flame offers built-in serialization features or suggests the use of specific libraries with known deserialization vulnerabilities, applications using these features are at risk.

**Example:** Flame provides a utility function for saving game state that uses an insecure deserialization library. An attacker crafts a malicious save file that, when loaded using this function, executes code on the user's machine.

**Impact:**
* Code Execution: Attackers can gain control of the user's system.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developer:**
    * Avoid using insecure deserialization methods provided by Flame or recommended for use with Flame.
    * Implement integrity checks and signatures for serialized data if using Flame's provided serialization features.
    * If using external libraries for serialization, choose secure and well-vetted options.
