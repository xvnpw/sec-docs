## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Flame Engine [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_flame_engine__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of executing arbitrary code on the user's machine, gaining full control over the application and potentially the underlying system. This node is critical because it represents the culmination of any successful attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rendering Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rendering_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This node represents a category of attacks targeting how the Flame Engine renders graphics. It is critical because successful exploitation in this area can directly lead to code execution through vulnerabilities in image handling, shaders, or font rendering.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Image/Texture Loading [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_imagetexture_loading__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This attack vector involves loading specially crafted image or texture files designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the image processing libraries used by Flame. It is a high-risk path because image loading is a common operation, and vulnerabilities in image parsing libraries are frequently discovered. This node is critical as it's a primary entry point for exploiting rendering vulnerabilities.
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG) containing malformed data that triggers a buffer overflow or other memory corruption vulnerability in the image decoding library (like libpng or libjpeg). When the application attempts to load and process this image, the vulnerability is triggered, potentially allowing the attacker to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image Parsing Bugs [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image_parsing_bugs__critical_node_.md)

This node focuses on the specific vulnerabilities within the libraries responsible for parsing image files. It is critical because these bugs directly enable the "Malicious Image/Texture Loading" attack vector and provide a direct path to code execution.
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage known or zero-day vulnerabilities in image parsing libraries. These vulnerabilities often involve improper handling of image headers, color palettes, or compressed data, leading to buffer overflows, heap overflows, or other memory safety issues during the parsing process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflows in Input Processing [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflows_in_input_processing__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This attack vector targets how the Flame Engine handles user input (keyboard, mouse, touch). It is a high-risk path because improper bounds checking on input data can lead to buffer overflows, allowing attackers to overwrite memory and potentially execute code. This node is critical as uncontrolled input is a frequent source of vulnerabilities.
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends excessively long input strings or sequences to the application through various input channels. If the application doesn't properly allocate enough memory or validate the length of the input, the input data can overflow the allocated buffer, overwriting adjacent memory regions. This can be used to overwrite return addresses or function pointers, redirecting program execution to attacker-controlled code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Asset Loading Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_asset_loading_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This node represents a broad category of attacks targeting how the Flame Engine loads various game assets (images, audio, JSON, etc.). It is a high-risk path because applications rely on loading external assets, and vulnerabilities in asset parsing can lead to code execution. This node is critical as it encompasses multiple potential attack surfaces related to external data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Asset Files [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_asset_files__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This attack vector involves providing malicious asset files (beyond just images) that exploit vulnerabilities in the parsers for those specific file formats. It is a high-risk path because applications often load various asset types, and vulnerabilities in their parsers can be exploited. This node is critical as it's the point where malicious external data enters the application.
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft malicious asset files (e.g., malformed audio files, corrupted JSON data) that exploit vulnerabilities in the corresponding parsing libraries used by Flame. These vulnerabilities can be similar to image parsing bugs, leading to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues when the application attempts to load and process the malicious asset.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Asset Parsers [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_asset_parsers__critical_node_.md)

This node focuses on the specific vulnerabilities within the libraries responsible for parsing different types of asset files (audio, JSON, etc.). It is critical because these bugs directly enable the "Malicious Asset Files" attack vector, providing a path to code execution through the loading of various asset types.
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers target known or zero-day vulnerabilities in asset parsing libraries. These vulnerabilities can arise from improper handling of file headers, data structures, or compression algorithms, leading to memory safety issues during the parsing process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Underlying Libraries Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_underlying_libraries_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This node represents a category of attacks targeting vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries that Flame depends on, such as SDL. It is critical because these libraries provide fundamental functionalities, and their vulnerabilities can directly impact the security of applications using Flame.

## Attack Tree Path: [SDL Vulnerabilities (Common Dependency) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/sdl_vulnerabilities__common_dependency___high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This attack vector specifically targets known vulnerabilities in the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library, a common dependency for Flame. It is a high-risk path because SDL is a widely used library, and known vulnerabilities are often publicly documented and exploitable. This node is critical because SDL provides low-level access to hardware and system resources, making its vulnerabilities particularly impactful.
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers research known vulnerabilities in the specific version of SDL used by the application. These vulnerabilities can range from buffer overflows in event handling or input processing to issues in window management or graphics rendering. By triggering the vulnerable SDL functionality with specific inputs or conditions, attackers can potentially gain code execution or cause denial of service.
