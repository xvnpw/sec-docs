# Threat Model Analysis for flame-engine/flame

## Threat: [Malicious Asset Injection](./threats/malicious_asset_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious assets (e.g., images with embedded code, corrupted data files) into the application's asset loading pipeline by exploiting vulnerabilities in how Flame handles and processes different asset types. This could occur if Flame doesn't perform sufficient validation or sanitization during asset loading.

**Impact:** Code execution on the user's device, application crash due to malformed data, display of unintended or harmful content.

**Affected Flame Component:** `flame/assets` module (specifically the `AssetLoader` class and related functions for loading various asset types like `load_image()`, `load_audio()`, etc.). The rendering pipeline could also be affected if malicious image formats are processed.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure Flame is updated to the latest version containing security patches.
*   Implement robust asset validation and sanitization within the application's asset loading logic, even if Flame provides some basic checks.
*   Consider using a secure asset management system outside of Flame's core functionality for critical assets.

## Threat: [Asset Path Traversal](./threats/asset_path_traversal.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates asset paths provided to Flame's asset loading functions to access files outside the intended asset directory. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in how Flame resolves and accesses file paths, potentially bypassing intended security restrictions.

**Impact:** Information disclosure by gaining access to sensitive files on the user's system or the server hosting the assets.

**Affected Flame Component:** `flame/assets` module, specifically the functions responsible for resolving and accessing file paths within the `AssetLoader` or related utility functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using user-provided input directly in Flame's asset loading functions without strict validation.
*   Ensure Flame's configuration and usage patterns enforce a clear asset root directory and prevent access to parent directories.
*   Update Flame to versions that have addressed path traversal vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Flame's Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_flame's_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Flame relies on various underlying libraries. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, and the application uses a vulnerable version of Flame that includes these dependencies, attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Can range from denial of service to remote code execution depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.

**Affected Flame Component:** Various modules within Flame that rely on the vulnerable dependency. This could include the rendering pipeline (if a graphics library dependency is vulnerable), audio handling, or other internal functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** Can be Critical depending on the vulnerability.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Flame updated to the latest stable version, as updates often include fixes for dependency vulnerabilities.
*   Monitor security advisories for Flame's dependencies and consider updating Flame even if a new version isn't immediately available (if possible to update dependencies independently, though this might introduce compatibility issues).

## Threat: [Shader Exploits (if using custom shaders with Flame)](./threats/shader_exploits__if_using_custom_shaders_with_flame_.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes custom shaders within Flame's rendering pipeline, an attacker could potentially inject malicious shader code. This could happen if Flame's shader loading or compilation process has vulnerabilities, allowing the introduction of harmful code.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the rendering device (GPU), denial of service by crashing the graphics driver, visual glitches or the display of misleading or harmful content.

**Affected Flame Component:** The rendering pipeline within Flame, specifically the parts responsible for loading, compiling, and managing shaders. This might involve interactions with underlying graphics APIs.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and audit all custom shader code used with Flame.
*   Avoid dynamically generating shader code based on untrusted input.
*   Keep Flame and graphics drivers updated to benefit from security fixes in shader compilation and handling.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Rendering Overload (exploiting Flame's rendering capabilities)](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_rendering_overload__exploiting_flame's_rendering_capabilities_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit how the application uses Flame's rendering capabilities to trigger scenarios that cause excessive rendering operations, leading to resource exhaustion (CPU, GPU, memory) and potentially a denial of service for the user's device. This could involve manipulating game elements or triggering complex visual effects in a way that overwhelms Flame's rendering pipeline.

**Impact:** Application freeze, crash, system instability, denial of service for the local device.

**Affected Flame Component:** The core rendering pipeline within Flame, including components responsible for managing sprites, textures, and drawing operations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement mechanisms within the game logic to limit the number of objects being rendered simultaneously.
*   Optimize the usage of Flame's rendering features to reduce resource consumption.
*   Utilize techniques like object pooling and culling provided by or compatible with Flame to manage rendering load effectively.
*   Monitor resource usage and implement safeguards to prevent runaway rendering processes.
