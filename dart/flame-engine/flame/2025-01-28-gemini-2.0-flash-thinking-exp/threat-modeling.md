# Threat Model Analysis for flame-engine/flame

## Threat: [State Manipulation through Game Engine APIs](./threats/state_manipulation_through_game_engine_apis.md)

*   **Threat:** State Manipulation through Game Engine APIs
    *   **Description:** An attacker might find ways to directly manipulate game state variables or engine components outside of intended game mechanics. This could involve exploiting unintended access points or vulnerabilities in game code that exposes or allows modification of internal game state. For example, if debugging tools are left enabled in production or if game state is not properly encapsulated.
    *   **Impact:** Cheating, game breaking bugs, unfair advantages, potential for data corruption if game state is persisted, ability to drastically alter game experience.
    *   **Flame Component Affected:** `Component System` (`Component`, `Entity`, `Game`), `Game Loop`, `State Management` (Game state variables, data persistence mechanisms).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Encapsulation:** Properly encapsulate game state and limit direct access to internal variables and components. Use controlled APIs for state modification.
        *   **Access Control:** Implement access control mechanisms within game code to restrict unintended modification of game state.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential pathways for unintended state manipulation.
        *   **Production Builds:** Ensure debugging tools and development-time features that might expose state manipulation capabilities are disabled in production builds.

## Threat: [Malicious Assets Injection](./threats/malicious_assets_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Assets Injection
    *   **Description:** If the game loads assets from untrusted sources (e.g., user-generated content, external servers without validation), an attacker could inject malicious assets. These assets could be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in image/audio decoding libraries used by Flutter and Flame, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service. For example, a specially crafted PNG image could trigger a buffer overflow during decoding.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution on the user's device, denial of service (crashes, resource exhaustion), unexpected game behavior, potential data breaches if malicious assets can access sensitive data.
    *   **Flame Component Affected:** `Asset Loading` (`Flame.images`, `Flame.audio`, `Flame.loadAsset`), `Rendering Pipeline` (Flutter's image rendering, potentially Flame's sprite rendering).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Trusted Asset Sources:** Load assets only from trusted and controlled sources. Avoid loading assets directly from user-provided URLs or untrusted external servers without rigorous validation.
        *   **Asset Validation:** Implement validation and sanitization of assets before loading them. Check file types, sizes, and potentially perform deeper content inspection if feasible.
        *   **Content Security Policies (CSP):** If running in a web context, utilize Content Security Policies to restrict asset loading origins.
        *   **Dependency Updates:** Keep Flutter and Dart dependencies updated to patch vulnerabilities in image/audio decoding libraries.

## Threat: [Flame Engine Bugs and Vulnerabilities](./threats/flame_engine_bugs_and_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Flame Engine Bugs and Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** The Flame engine itself, being software, may contain bugs or security vulnerabilities. If discovered, these could be exploited by attackers. This includes vulnerabilities in core engine logic, rendering, physics, or other engine subsystems.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, denial of service, unexpected game behavior, potential for bypassing security measures if vulnerabilities are in security-related engine components (less likely in a game engine, but possible).
    *   **Flame Component Affected:** Core `Flame Engine` code, various modules and subsystems within Flame (rendering, input, physics, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potential for High severity vulnerabilities within the engine)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Engine Updates:** Regularly update to the latest stable version of the Flame engine to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   **Security Monitoring:** Monitor Flame engine release notes, security advisories, and community forums for reported vulnerabilities and security updates.
        *   **Community Engagement:** Participate in the Flame community to stay informed about potential issues and best practices.
        *   **Bug Reporting:** If you discover a potential vulnerability in Flame, report it to the Flame development team.
