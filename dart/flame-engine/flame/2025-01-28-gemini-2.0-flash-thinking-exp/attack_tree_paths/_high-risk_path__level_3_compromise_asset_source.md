#### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk of asset source compromise, the following strategies should be implemented:

##### 4.3.1. General Security Measures for Asset Sources (CDN, Backend Server, Cloud Storage)

*   **Strong Authentication and Access Control:**
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Enforce MFA for all accounts with administrative access to asset sources (CDN accounts, server access, cloud provider accounts).
    *   **Strong Passwords and Regular Password Rotation:**  Implement strong password policies and encourage regular password changes.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users and applications only the minimum necessary permissions to access and manage assets.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Utilize RBAC to manage permissions based on user roles and responsibilities.
    *   **Regular Access Reviews:**  Periodically review and audit access permissions to ensure they are still appropriate and necessary.

*   **Secure Configuration and Hardening:**
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of asset sources to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
    *   **Security Hardening:**  Harden servers and systems by disabling unnecessary services, applying security patches, and following security best practices.
    *   **Secure Configuration Management:**  Implement secure configuration management practices to ensure consistent and secure configurations across all asset sources.
    *   **HTTPS Enforcement:**  Enforce HTTPS for all communication with asset sources to protect data in transit and prevent MITM attacks.

*   **Vulnerability Management and Patching:**
    *   **Regular Vulnerability Scanning:**  Implement automated vulnerability scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in software and systems.
    *   **Timely Patching:**  Apply security patches and updates promptly to address identified vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Tracking and Remediation:**  Establish a process for tracking and remediating vulnerabilities in a timely manner.

*   **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):**
    *   **Implement IDPS:**  Deploy IDPS solutions to monitor network traffic and system activity for malicious behavior and intrusion attempts.
    *   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Utilize SIEM systems to aggregate and analyze security logs from various sources to detect and respond to security incidents.

*   **Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   **Comprehensive Logging:**  Enable comprehensive logging of all access and modifications to asset sources.
    *   **Real-time Monitoring:**  Implement real-time monitoring of asset sources for suspicious activity and anomalies.
    *   **Alerting and Notifications:**  Configure alerts and notifications for critical security events and potential breaches.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization (If Applicable):**
    *   **Validate User Inputs:**  If the asset source involves any user input (e.g., file uploads, configuration changes), implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.

*   **Supply Chain Security:**
    *   **Dependency Management:**  Maintain an inventory of all software dependencies and components used in asset sources.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning of Dependencies:**  Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them regularly.
