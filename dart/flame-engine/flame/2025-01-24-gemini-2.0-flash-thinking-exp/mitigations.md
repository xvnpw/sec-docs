# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for flame-engine/flame

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Asset Checksums (Flame Asset Loading)](./mitigation_strategies/validate_asset_checksums__flame_asset_loading_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **During asset preparation for Flame:** When preparing assets for your Flame game (e.g., during asset pipeline processing or build scripts), generate SHA-256 checksums (or similar cryptographic hashes) for all assets that Flame will load (images, audio, spritesheets, etc.).
2.  **Store checksums alongside Flame assets:**  Store these checksums in a manifest file that Flame can access. This manifest could be a JSON file bundled with the game or hosted on a secure server if assets are dynamically loaded by Flame.
3.  **Integrate checksum verification into Flame asset loading:**  Modify or extend Flame's asset loading mechanisms (e.g., using `Flame.images.load`, `FlameAudio.audioCache.load`) to include checksum verification. Before fully loading an asset, calculate its checksum.
4.  **Compare calculated checksum with stored checksum (within Flame):**  Within your Flame game code, compare the calculated checksum of the asset being loaded with the corresponding checksum from the manifest.
5.  **Handle checksum mismatch in Flame:** If checksums do not match, prevent Flame from using the asset. Implement error handling within your Flame game logic to gracefully manage this situation, such as logging an error, displaying a placeholder asset, or halting game execution if critical. This indicates potential asset tampering or corruption that Flame has detected.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Asset Tampering via Flame Asset Loading (High Severity): Malicious actors replacing game assets that Flame loads with modified or malicious versions. This could lead to injected malware, altered game behavior within Flame, or display of inappropriate content rendered by Flame.
*   Data Corruption Affecting Flame Assets (Medium Severity): Accidental corruption of asset files that Flame attempts to load, leading to errors, crashes within Flame, or unexpected visual/audio glitches in the game.
**Impact:**
*   Asset Tampering via Flame Asset Loading: High Reduction - Directly prevents Flame from loading and using tampered assets, effectively mitigating this threat within the game's visual and audio elements managed by Flame.
*   Data Corruption Affecting Flame Assets: Medium Reduction - Flame can detect corrupted assets before fully integrating them into the game, allowing for error handling and preventing crashes or visual/audio issues caused by corrupted data within the Flame engine.
**Currently Implemented:** No
**Missing Implementation:**  Requires modification of the asset loading process used with Flame. This would involve:
*   Creating a checksum manifest generation process during asset build.
*   Extending or wrapping Flame's asset loading functions (like `Flame.images.load`, `FlameAudio.audioCache.load`) to incorporate checksum calculation and verification before asset usage within the Flame game loop.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User Input Influencing Flame Asset Paths](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user_input_influencing_flame_asset_paths.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Flame asset loading points influenced by user input:**  Determine if and where user input (even indirectly) could influence the paths or filenames used when Flame loads assets. This is relevant if your game allows users to specify custom assets, themes, or if modding is considered where users might provide asset paths that Flame will process.
2.  **Implement input validation before Flame asset loading:** Before passing any user-provided input to Flame's asset loading functions, implement strict validation. Use allowlists or regular expressions to ensure input conforms to expected formats for filenames or directory names. Reject any input that doesn't validate.
3.  **Sanitize input specifically for Flame asset paths:**  Sanitize user input to remove path traversal characters (`../`, `./`, `\`) and any other characters that could be exploited to manipulate file paths when used with Flame's asset loading.
4.  **Use secure path joining within Flame context:** When constructing asset paths within your Flame game logic based on user input, use secure path joining functions (if available in Dart/Flutter) to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities when Flame attempts to access these paths. Avoid direct string concatenation for path construction within Flame asset handling.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Path Traversal via Flame Asset Loading (High Severity): Attackers using manipulated user input to influence Flame's asset loading paths, potentially allowing access to files outside the intended asset directories. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive game files or even system resources if Flame's asset loading mechanism is improperly used.
*   Local File Inclusion via Flame Assets (Medium Severity): In less common scenarios, if Flame's asset loading were to inadvertently process or execute code within loaded assets (highly unlikely in typical Flame usage but theoretically possible with custom asset handling), path traversal could lead to local file inclusion vulnerabilities exploited through Flame's asset system.
**Impact:**
*   Path Traversal via Flame Asset Loading: High Reduction - Prevents path traversal attacks specifically targeting Flame's asset loading by ensuring user input cannot manipulate paths to access unintended locations when Flame loads resources.
*   Local File Inclusion via Flame Assets: Medium Reduction - Reduces the risk of local file inclusion vulnerabilities that might be hypothetically exploitable through Flame's asset loading by limiting the ability to specify arbitrary file paths processed by Flame.
**Currently Implemented:** Partially
**Missing Implementation:** Input sanitization might be present for general user inputs in the game, but a specific review is needed to ensure all points where user input could influence *Flame's* asset loading paths are rigorously sanitized. This is especially important if custom asset loading or modding features are planned that directly interact with Flame's asset management.  Specifically, check any code that takes user input and then uses it in conjunction with `Flame.images.load`, `FlameAudio.audioCache.load`, or any custom asset loading logic within the Flame game.
