## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Flame Engine (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_flame_engine__critical_node_.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. It represents any successful compromise of the application through vulnerabilities in or related to the Flame Engine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Flame Engine Code (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_flame_engine_code__critical_node_.md)

* This category encompasses attacks that directly target flaws within the Flame Engine's codebase. Successful exploitation can lead to significant control over the application's execution environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Memory Corruption (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_memory_corruption__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* This involves exploiting vulnerabilities that corrupt the application's memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Buffer Overflow in Native Bindings (AND) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_buffer_overflow_in_native_bindings__and___critical_node_.md)

* Attackers attempt to send more data to a buffer than it can hold, overwriting adjacent memory locations. If Flame uses native bindings (e.g., for performance-critical tasks), a buffer overflow here can allow the attacker to inject and execute malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Code Execution via Overflow (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_code_execution_via_overflow__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* This is the successful outcome of a buffer overflow attack, where the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Out-of-Bounds Access in Core Logic (AND) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_out-of-bounds_access_in_core_logic__and___critical_node_.md)

* Attackers manipulate input or game state to cause the engine to access memory outside the intended boundaries of an array or data structure. This can lead to crashes, information leaks, or, in some cases, code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Crash or Potential Code Execution (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/cause_crash_or_potential_code_execution__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* This is the result of successful out-of-bounds access. While a crash disrupts the application, the potential for code execution makes this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (AND) (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies__and___high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* Flame Engine relies on external libraries for various functionalities. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Vulnerability Through Flame's Usage of the Dependency (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_vulnerability_through_flame's_usage_of_the_dependency__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* This occurs when Flame's specific usage of a vulnerable dependency triggers the vulnerability, even if the dependency itself is not directly exposed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities (AND)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities__and_.md)

* Attackers craft malicious input events (e.g., mouse clicks, keyboard presses) to exploit flaws in how Flame processes user input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Unexpected Behavior or Code Execution within Flame's Input Handlers (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_unexpected_behavior_or_code_execution_within_flame's_input_handlers__critical_node_.md)

* Successful exploitation of input handling vulnerabilities can lead to unexpected application behavior, client-side denial of service, cross-site scripting (XSS), or even remote code execution (RCE) if the input is processed insecurely.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Assets Loaded by Flame Engine (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_assets_loaded_by_flame_engine__critical_node_.md)

* Attackers target the assets (images, audio, etc.) that Flame loads and uses. By manipulating these assets, they can potentially compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Assets (OR) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_assets__or___high-risk_path_.md)

* This involves introducing harmful assets into the application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Replace Legitimate Assets with Malicious Ones (AND) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/replace_legitimate_assets_with_malicious_ones__and___critical_node_.md)

* Attackers attempt to substitute genuine game assets with malicious versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities in the Application (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_upload_vulnerabilities_in_the_application__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* If the application allows users to upload files (which might be used as Flame assets), attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the upload process to introduce malicious assets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Serve Malicious Assets from Compromised CDN/Server (AND) (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/serve_malicious_assets_from_compromised_cdnserver__and___high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* If the application loads assets from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or other external server, compromising that server allows attackers to serve malicious assets to application users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise CDN or Asset Server (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_cdn_or_asset_server__critical_node_.md)

* Gaining control over the CDN or asset server is a critical step in serving malicious assets at scale.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Asset Loading Vulnerabilities in Flame (AND) (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_asset_loading_vulnerabilities_in_flame__and___high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* Attackers provide specially crafted assets that exploit vulnerabilities in how Flame parses and loads asset files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Vulnerability during Asset Parsing/Loading (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_vulnerability_during_asset_parsingloading__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* This is the point where the crafted malicious asset triggers a vulnerability in Flame's asset loading mechanism, potentially leading to code execution or other harmful outcomes.
