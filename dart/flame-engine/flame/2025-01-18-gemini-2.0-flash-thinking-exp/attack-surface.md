# Attack Surface Analysis for flame-engine/flame

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Event Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_event_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts and sends unexpected or excessive input events (keyboard, mouse, touch) to the application.

**How Flame Contributes:** Flame's event handling system processes these inputs to drive game logic and rendering. If not properly validated or handled, malicious events can disrupt the game state or cause resource exhaustion.

**Example:** Sending thousands of mouse click events per second to overwhelm the game loop, causing lag or crashes. Injecting specific key combinations to trigger unintended actions or bypass security checks.

**Impact:** Denial of service (client-side), unexpected game behavior, potential exploitation of logic flaws triggered by specific event sequences.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Implement input validation and sanitization to filter out unexpected or malicious event data.
    * Implement rate limiting on event processing to prevent overwhelming the game loop.
    * Design game logic to be resilient to unexpected event sequences.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Asset Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_asset_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides crafted or malicious asset files (images, audio, data files) that, when loaded by Flame, exploit vulnerabilities in the asset loading or processing pipeline.

**How Flame Contributes:** Flame's asset loading system handles fetching and decoding various asset types. Vulnerabilities in the underlying decoding libraries or improper handling of asset data can be exploited.

**Example:** Providing a specially crafted PNG image that exploits a buffer overflow in the image decoding library, potentially leading to code execution. Injecting an audio file with embedded malicious code.

**Impact:** Client-side code execution, denial of service, data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Sanitize and validate all loaded assets.
    * Use secure and up-to-date asset decoding libraries.
    * Implement content security policies (CSPs) where applicable to restrict the types of assets that can be loaded.
    * Avoid loading assets from untrusted sources or user-provided URLs without thorough validation.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in UI Elements](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_ui_elements.md)

**Description:** If the application uses Flame's UI elements to display user-generated content or data from untrusted sources without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute in other users' browsers.

**How Flame Contributes:** Flame's UI system might allow rendering of text or other elements that could contain malicious scripts if not handled carefully.

**Example:** A user enters a malicious script in a chat message or profile name that is then displayed by the game's UI to other players, executing the script in their browsers.

**Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, information theft.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Sanitize all user-provided content before displaying it in UI elements.
    * Use appropriate escaping techniques to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
    * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal during Asset Loading](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_during_asset_loading.md)

**Description:** If the application allows user-controlled input to influence asset loading paths without proper sanitization, attackers could potentially access files outside the intended asset directory.

**How Flame Contributes:** Flame's asset loading functions might be vulnerable if they directly use user-provided strings to construct file paths without validation.

**Example:** A user provides a path like "../../sensitive_data.txt" when the application requests an asset, potentially allowing access to files outside the intended asset directory.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive application files, potential for code execution if executable files are accessed.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Never directly use user-provided input to construct file paths for asset loading.
    * Implement strict validation and sanitization of any user input that influences asset loading.
    * Use relative paths and restrict access to a defined asset directory.
