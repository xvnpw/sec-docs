# Threat Model Analysis for flame-engine/flame

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Asset Loading](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_asset_loading.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious game asset (e.g., image, audio file) with excessively long or malformed data. When Flame attempts to load and process this asset, it could overflow a buffer in memory, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions. This could lead to application crashes or, in more severe cases, arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for remote code execution if the attacker can control the overwritten memory.
*   **Affected Component:** `flame/assets` module, specifically functions responsible for parsing and loading various asset types (e.g., image decoders, audio decoders).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize the latest stable version of Flame, which may contain fixes for known buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all loaded assets, checking file sizes and formats against expected values.
    *   Consider using memory-safe programming practices within Flame's asset loading code (if contributing to the engine).
    *   Implement sandboxing or isolation techniques for asset loading processes to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization of Game State](./threats/insecure_deserialization_of_game_state.md)

*   **Description:** If the application saves game state data (e.g., player progress, world information) using Flame's mechanisms and this data is deserialized without proper validation, an attacker could manipulate the saved data to inject malicious objects or code. Upon loading the manipulated save file, the application could execute this malicious code.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, manipulation of game state leading to unfair advantages or unintended consequences.
*   **Affected Component:**  Potentially the `flame/serialization` module (if it exists and is used), or any custom serialization logic implemented by the developer using Flame's data structures.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly.
    *   Implement robust validation and sanitization of deserialized data before using it.
    *   Consider using secure serialization formats that are less prone to exploitation.
    *   Digitally sign saved game data to ensure its integrity and prevent tampering.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Flame Plugins](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_flame_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses community-developed or third-party Flame plugins, these plugins might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws, buffer overflows) that could be exploited.
*   **Impact:**  Depends on the vulnerability, ranging from application crashes to remote code execution.
*   **Affected Component:** The specific third-party plugin being used.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the plugin and the vulnerability, can be High or Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully vet and audit any third-party plugins before using them.
    *   Keep plugins updated to their latest versions, as updates often include security fixes.
    *   Monitor the plugin's issue tracker and security advisories.
    *   Consider the reputation and trustworthiness of the plugin developer.
