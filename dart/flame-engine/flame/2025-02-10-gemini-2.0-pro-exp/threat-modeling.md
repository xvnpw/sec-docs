# Threat Model Analysis for flame-engine/flame

## Threat: [Asset Tampering (Pre-Packaging)](./threats/asset_tampering__pre-packaging_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Asset Replacement
*   **Description:** An attacker with access to the development environment or build pipeline replaces legitimate game assets (images, audio, Tiled maps loaded by Flame) with malicious versions.  This could involve replacing a sprite with an offensive image, inserting malicious code into a Tiled map (if custom properties are misused with Flame's `TiledComponent`), or modifying audio files. The attack leverages Flame's asset loading system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Game displays offensive/inappropriate content.
    *   Potential for code execution if Tiled map custom properties are misused to trigger unexpected behavior *through Flame's handling of those properties*.
    *   Game crashes or instability.
    *   Reputational damage.
*   **Flame Component Affected:** `Flame.assets` (the core asset loading mechanism), `TiledComponent` (specifically, how it handles custom properties), and any component that uses loaded assets (e.g., `SpriteComponent`, `SpriteAnimationComponent`, `AudioPlayer`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Development (Crucial):**
        *   Strict access control to the development environment and build servers.
        *   Implement a secure build pipeline with automated integrity checks (hashing) of assets *before* inclusion in the build. This verifies assets haven't been tampered with before Flame even touches them.
        *   Version control (e.g., Git) for asset tracking and rollbacks.
        *   Regular security audits of the build pipeline.
    *   **Runtime (Additional Layer, Performance Consideration):**
        *   If performance allows, implement runtime asset integrity checks (hashing) *within Flame, before loading*. This adds a layer of defense *specific to Flame's asset loading*, even if the build process is compromised.

## Threat: [Game State Manipulation (In-Memory) - *Focusing on Flame's Role*](./threats/game_state_manipulation__in-memory__-_focusing_on_flame's_role.md)

*   **Threat:** Cheat Engine / Memory Editor Targeting Flame Components
*   **Description:** An attacker uses a memory editor to modify game state variables managed *by Flame components*. While memory editing is a general threat, this focuses on the attacker targeting data structures and variables *within Flame's component system*.  They're exploiting the fact that Flame organizes and manages game state in a predictable way.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unfair gameplay advantage (cheating).
    *   Disruption of game balance.
    *   Negative impact on other players (multiplayer).
*   **Flame Component Affected:** Any component that stores or manages game state, particularly those inheriting from `PositionComponent`, `HasGameRef`, or custom components holding game logic data. The core game loop (`FlameGame.update`) is indirectly affected.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (especially for competitive games)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Obfuscation:** Obfuscate the game code, making it harder to reverse engineer Flame's component structure and identify memory locations.
    *   **Redundancy and Validation (Flame-Specific):** Store critical game state *outside* of standard Flame components (e.g., in a separate data manager) and cross-check with the component's state. This makes it harder to manipulate the game by only targeting Flame components.
    *   **Anti-Cheat (Flame-Aware):** Implement anti-cheat logic that understands Flame's component system and can detect inconsistencies (e.g., a `PositionComponent` reporting an impossible position).

## Threat: [Denial of Service (Rendering/Update Loop)](./threats/denial_of_service__renderingupdate_loop_.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Flame Components
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits game logic or vulnerabilities to cause Flame to create an excessive number of game objects (sprites, particles), trigger complex animations handled by Flame, or force excessive collision checks *within Flame's collision detection system*. This directly targets Flame's rendering and update pipeline.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Game lag, unplayability.
    *   Device freeze/crash.
    *   Battery drain.
*   **Flame Component Affected:** `FlameGame.update`, `FlameGame.render`, `SpriteComponent`, `SpriteAnimationComponent`, `ParticleComponent`, and the `CollisionDetection` system (including `HasHitboxes` and `Collidable`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Performance Profiling (Flame-Focused):** Use Flame's debugging tools and profiling features to identify performance bottlenecks *within Flame's components*.
    *   **Object Pooling (Flame-Specific):** Reuse Flame components (e.g., `SpriteComponent`, `ParticleComponent`) instead of creating new ones. Flame provides mechanisms for this.
    *   **Limits and Throttling (Flame-Aware):** Implement limits on the number of active Flame components (especially resource-intensive ones). Use Flame's component lifecycle methods (`onLoad`, `onRemove`) to manage these limits.
    *   **Efficient Collision Detection (Flame's System):** Utilize Flame's optimized collision detection algorithms (e.g., spatial partitioning using `QuadTreeCollisionDetection`) and configure them appropriately.
    *   **Input Validation (Feeding into Flame):** Sanitize and validate user input *before* it interacts with Flame components, preventing malicious input from triggering excessive resource use within Flame.

## Threat: [Component Lifecycle Manipulation](./threats/component_lifecycle_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Injection/Modification of Flame Component Logic
*   **Description:** An attacker injects code or modifies existing code to disrupt the normal execution of Flame's component lifecycle methods (`onLoad`, `update`, `render`, `onRemove`). This directly targets the core functionality of Flame's component system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Game crashes or instability.
    *   Unpredictable game behavior.
    *   Potential for further exploitation.
*   **Flame Component Affected:** Any component derived from `Component`, and `FlameGame` itself (the core game loop).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code Obfuscation:** Make it significantly harder to reverse engineer and modify the game code, including Flame's component interactions.
    *   **Anti-Tampering (Advanced, Flame-Specific):**  Implement runtime integrity checks (if feasible) that specifically target Flame components and their lifecycle methods. This is a very advanced technique.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities that could allow code injection in the first place. This is a general mitigation, but it's crucial to prevent attackers from gaining the initial foothold needed to manipulate Flame components.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Direct Flame Impact)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities__direct_flame_impact_.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of a *Flame Engine* Vulnerability
*   **Description:** A vulnerability *within the Flame engine itself* is exploited. This is distinct from vulnerabilities in Flutter or other general libraries; this is a flaw in Flame's code.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution *within the context of the game*.
*   **Flame Component Affected:** Potentially *any* Flame component, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a vulnerability exists)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates (Crucial):** Keep the Flame engine updated to the *latest stable version*. This is the primary defense against known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Actively monitor security advisories and announcements specifically for the Flame engine.
    *   **Pin Dependencies (Carefully):** Pin the Flame engine to a specific, known-good version to prevent accidental updates to a potentially vulnerable version.  *However*, balance this with the need to apply security patches promptly.  A good strategy is to pin to a minor version (e.g., `1.x.y`) and allow patch updates (`1.x.z`), but manually review and test major or minor version upgrades.
    * **Dependency Scanning (Flame Focus):** While general dependency scanners are useful, prioritize tools or methods that can specifically analyze the Flame engine's codebase for potential vulnerabilities (if such tools exist or become available).
