# Attack Surface Analysis for flame-engine/flame

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted Input to Game Components](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_input_to_game_components.md)

*Description:* User-provided data (input events, network messages, loaded files) is processed by Flame components without sufficient validation.
*How Flame Contributes:* Flame's component-based architecture and event system are central to game logic.  Components often directly receive and process user input *via Flame's event handling mechanisms*. This is a *direct* consequence of using Flame.
*Example:* A player sends a crafted network message containing an excessively large number, causing a buffer overflow in a Flame `Component` responsible for player movement.  The message is processed directly by Flame's event loop and dispatched to the component.
*Impact:* Denial of Service (game crash), arbitrary code execution (within the game's context), game state manipulation.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developers:* Implement strict input validation *before* any data reaches Flame components. Use a whitelist approach, allowing only known-good input patterns and data types.  Fuzz test components that handle user input, specifically targeting Flame's event handlers (`onTapDown`, `onGameResize`, custom event handlers, etc.).  Sanitize all input, even if it appears to come from a trusted source (defense-in-depth).  Consider using Flame's built-in input validation features if available (and ensure they are used correctly).

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Game State (from Untrusted Sources)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_game_state__from_untrusted_sources_.md)

*Description:* The game loads saved game data, level data, or other configuration from external sources (files, network) using potentially vulnerable deserialization methods.
*How Flame Contributes:* While Flame itself doesn't *mandate* a specific serialization method, *libraries commonly used with Flame for game state management* (e.g., for saving/loading levels) are often chosen because of their integration with Flame or the Flutter ecosystem.  This is a *direct* influence, as the choice of these libraries is often driven by Flame compatibility.
*Example:* A malicious user provides a crafted save file that exploits a vulnerability in a JSON deserialization library *recommended for use with Flame* (even if not part of Flame itself), leading to arbitrary code execution.
*Impact:* Arbitrary code execution, game compromise, potential data exfiltration (if the game has access to sensitive data).
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developers:* Use secure deserialization libraries.  Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.  If using a custom format, rigorously validate the structure and content *before* processing.  Consider using a format with schema validation (e.g., Protocol Buffers).  Implement checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of saved data.  If using a library commonly recommended for Flame, specifically research its security posture and known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Flame's Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_flame's_dependencies.md)

*Description:* Flame relies on external libraries, and vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited.
*How Flame Contributes:* Flame's `pubspec.yaml` file *directly* defines the dependencies used by the project.  This is a *direct* and unavoidable aspect of using Flame.  The specific versions of Flutter and other packages listed in Flame's dependencies are a direct contributor to the attack surface.
*Example:* A vulnerability in a third-party physics library *directly included as a dependency in Flame's `pubspec.yaml`* allows an attacker to trigger a crash.
*Impact:* Varies, but can be High or Critical depending on the dependency.
*Risk Severity:* High (potentially Critical)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developers:* Use a dependency management tool (`pubspec.yaml` - *which is mandatory with Flame*). Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions. Use tools like `dependabot` or `renovate` for automated dependency updates. Perform Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to identify known vulnerabilities. *Specifically monitor Flame's own `pubspec.yaml` for updates and security advisories related to its dependencies.*
