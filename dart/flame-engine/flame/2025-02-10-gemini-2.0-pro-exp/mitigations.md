# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for flame-engine/flame

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Component Design and Review](./mitigation_strategies/strict_component_design_and_review.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define Clear Component Responsibilities:**  Before writing any Flame component code, clearly define its purpose and scope. Document this within the component's Dart file using comments.  Each component should have a single, well-defined responsibility within the Flame game world.
2.  **Limit Component Interactions:** Minimize direct calls between Flame components. Use Flame's `HasGameRef` to access the game instance and its event system for communication.  Avoid tight coupling between components.
3.  **Enforce Data Encapsulation:** Keep component data private using Dart's `_` prefix for private members. Use getters and setters to control access to component properties. Avoid exposing internal Flame component state directly.
4.  **Code Review Checklist (Flame-Specific):** Create a code review checklist specifically for Flame components. Include items like: correct use of `update`, `onLoad`, and other lifecycle methods; proper handling of `PositionComponent` transformations; safe use of Flame's collision detection; and secure interaction with Flame's audio and input systems.
5.  **Regular Code Reviews (Flame Focus):** Conduct regular code reviews, focusing on how components interact *within the Flame engine*. Pay attention to data flow between Flame components and potential security vulnerabilities arising from Flame-specific APIs.
6.  **Refactor Regularly (Flame Context):** As the Flame project evolves, refactor components to maintain clarity and reduce complexity, specifically considering how they use Flame's features.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Component Misuse (Flame-Specific):** (Severity: High) - Reduces the risk of misusing Flame's component system, leading to logic errors or vulnerabilities specific to how Flame handles components.
*   **Logic Errors (Flame Context):** (Severity: High) - Helps identify and fix logic errors within Flame components and their interactions *within the Flame engine*.
*   **Unintentional Data Exposure (Flame Components):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents Flame components from accidentally exposing sensitive data through Flame's properties or event system.
*   **Injection Vulnerabilities (Component Level, Flame API):** (Severity: High) - By enforcing input validation within Flame components, reduces the risk of injection attacks that exploit Flame's API.
*   **Inconsistent Game State (Flame Engine):** (Severity: Medium) - Proper state management within Flame's component lifecycle prevents race conditions and ensures a consistent game state *within the Flame engine*.

**Impact:**
*   **Component Misuse (Flame-Specific):** Risk significantly reduced (70-80%).
*   **Logic Errors (Flame Context):** Risk significantly reduced (60-70%).
*   **Unintentional Data Exposure (Flame Components):** Risk moderately reduced (40-50%).
*   **Injection Vulnerabilities (Component Level, Flame API):** Risk significantly reduced (70-80%).
*   **Inconsistent Game State (Flame Engine):** Risk significantly reduced (60-70%).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic Flame component structure defined in `lib/components`.
*   Some code reviews, but not consistently focused on Flame-specific aspects.
*   No formal Flame-specific code review checklist.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Formal Flame-specific code review checklist needs to be created.
*   Regular, scheduled code reviews with a Flame focus are needed.
*   Refactoring of older Flame components is needed, focusing on their use of Flame APIs.
*   Documentation of Flame component responsibilities needs improvement.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Component-Level Input Validation and Sanitization (Flame Input Handlers)](./mitigation_strategies/component-level_input_validation_and_sanitization__flame_input_handlers_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Flame Input Points:** Identify all points within each Flame component where user input is received. This primarily includes using Flame's input handling system: `TapCallbacks`, `DragCallbacks`, `KeyboardEvents`, etc.
2.  **Implement Type Checks (Dart):** Verify that the input data (e.g., `Vector2` for tap positions) is of the expected type, leveraging Dart's type system.
3.  **Implement Range Checks (Flame Coordinates):** If the input represents a position or movement within the Flame game world, check that it falls within the expected bounds of the game world or relevant components.
4.  **Implement Sanitize Input (Flame Context):** If user input is used to generate text or modify game elements *within the Flame rendering context*, sanitize the input to remove or escape potentially dangerous characters that could lead to injection vulnerabilities *within Flame's rendering*. This is less about XSS (which is a browser concern) and more about preventing malicious input from corrupting the Flame game state or visuals.
5.  **Reject Invalid Input (Flame Handlers):** If the input fails any validation check within a Flame input handler, reject it.  Do not attempt to "fix" invalid input within the Flame component.  Consider logging the event for debugging.
6.  **Document Validation Rules (Flame Components):** Clearly document the validation rules for each Flame input handler within the component's code comments.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Injection Vulnerabilities (Flame Input System):** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious data through Flame's input handlers, potentially corrupting game state or visuals.
*   **Logic Errors (Flame Input Handling):** (Severity: Medium) - Input validation within Flame's input system helps prevent unexpected behavior caused by invalid input.
* **Game state corruption** (Severity: High)

**Impact:**
*   **Injection Vulnerabilities (Flame Input System):** Risk significantly reduced (80-90%).
*   **Logic Errors (Flame Input Handling):** Risk moderately reduced (40-50%).
*   **Game state corruption:** Risk significantly reduced (80-90%).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic type checks in some Flame components using Dart.
*   No consistent sanitization within Flame's input handling context.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive input validation and sanitization needs to be implemented in *all* Flame components that handle user input via Flame's input system.
*   Sanitization functions need to be chosen and used appropriately within the Flame rendering context.
*   A consistent approach to handling invalid input within Flame's input handlers needs to be defined.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Data Storage and Transmission (Using Flame-Compatible Libraries)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_data_storage_and_transmission__using_flame-compatible_libraries_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Identify all data within the Flame game that needs protection (player progress, etc.).
2.  **Choose Secure Flame-Compatible Storage:** Use Flame-compatible libraries for platform-specific storage (e.g., `shared_preferences`, `flutter_secure_storage`). Avoid storing sensitive data directly in Flame's component properties without proper protection.
3.  **Encryption at Rest (Flame-Compatible Libraries):** Encrypt sensitive data stored locally using Flame-compatible encryption libraries. Use strong encryption algorithms.
4.  **Key Management (Flame Integration):** Securely manage encryption keys. Do not hardcode keys. Use platform-specific key management APIs or Flame-compatible secure key storage solutions.
5.  **HTTPS for Network Communication (Flame-Compatible Clients):** If the Flame game communicates with a server, use HTTPS. Use a Flame-compatible HTTP client library that supports HTTPS and certificate validation.
6.  **Data Minimization (Flame Game Data):** Only store and transmit the minimum amount of data necessary for the Flame game's functionality.
7.  **Secure Serialization (Flame Data):** Use secure serialization libraries (e.g., JSON serialization with proper escaping, protobuf) that are compatible with Flame and Dart, to prevent injection vulnerabilities during data serialization and deserialization *of Flame game data*.
8. **Data Validation on Deserialization (Flame Data):** Validate data *after* deserialization within Flame to ensure it hasn't been tampered with, especially data loaded into Flame components.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Breaches (Local Storage, Flame Data):** (Severity: High) - Encryption protects Flame game data if the device is compromised.
*   **Data Breaches (Network, Flame Communication):** (Severity: High) - HTTPS protects Flame game data in transit.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Flame Networking):** (Severity: High) - HTTPS prevents eavesdropping and data modification during Flame game communication.
*   **Data Tampering (Flame Game Data):** (Severity: High) - Encryption and secure serialization prevent unauthorized modification of Flame game data.
*   **Injection Vulnerabilities (Flame Data Serialization):** (Severity: High) - Secure serialization prevents injection attacks during Flame data handling.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Breaches (Local Storage, Flame Data):** Risk significantly reduced (80-90%).
*   **Data Breaches (Network, Flame Communication):** Risk significantly reduced (90-100%).
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Flame Networking):** Risk significantly reduced (90-100%).
*   **Data Tampering (Flame Game Data):** Risk significantly reduced (70-80%).
*   **Injection Vulnerabilities (Flame Data Serialization):** Risk significantly reduced (80-90%).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   HTTPS is used for network communication (using a Flame-compatible library).
*   Basic `shared_preferences` is used (via a Flame-compatible wrapper), but without encryption.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Encryption at rest needs to be implemented for all sensitive Flame game data.
*   Secure key management needs to be integrated with Flame.
*   Data minimization principles need to be applied to Flame game data.
*   Review and potentially improve data serialization methods used for Flame game data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Game Logic Exploits (Specific to Flame's Structure)](./mitigation_strategies/game_logic_exploits__specific_to_flame's_structure_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Server-Side Authority (Flame Client Logic):** For multiplayer Flame games, implement server-side authority for all critical game logic and state. The Flame client should primarily handle rendering and input, sending user actions to the server.
2.  **Cheat Detection (Flame Client Monitoring):** Implement server-side cheat detection mechanisms that monitor the data received from the Flame client. Look for inconsistencies or impossible actions within the Flame game context.
3.  **Input Validation (Server-Side, Flame Input):** Validate all player input received from the Flame client on the server-side. This includes validating data received from Flame's input handlers.
4.  **Rate Limiting (Flame Client Actions):** Implement rate limiting on the server to prevent attackers from flooding the server with requests originating from the Flame client or exploiting Flame game mechanics.
5.  **Secure Random Number Generation (Flame Logic):** Use cryptographically secure random number generators for any Flame game logic that requires randomness, especially if that logic affects gameplay or rewards. Avoid using predictable random number generators within Flame components.
6. **Sanitize Text Input in Flame:** If your Flame game allows for text input that is then displayed within the game (e.g., chat, player names), sanitize this input *within Flame* to prevent potential issues with rendering or game logic. This is distinct from web-based XSS; it's about protecting the Flame rendering context.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cheating (Flame Client Manipulation):** (Severity: High) - Prevents players from manipulating the Flame client to gain an unfair advantage.
*   **Game Logic Exploits (Flame Component Manipulation):** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from manipulating Flame's components or game logic on the client.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (Flame Client Origin):** (Severity: High) - Rate limiting helps mitigate DoS attacks originating from the Flame client.
*   **Data Manipulation (Flame Client Data):** (Severity: High) - Server-side validation prevents data manipulation originating from the Flame client.
* **Flame Rendering/Logic Corruption:** (Severity: High) - Sanitizing text input within Flame prevents issues caused by malicious text input.

**Impact:**
*   **Cheating (Flame Client Manipulation):** Risk significantly reduced (70-80%).
*   **Game Logic Exploits (Flame Component Manipulation):** Risk significantly reduced (70-80%).
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (Flame Client Origin):** Risk moderately reduced (50-60%).
*   **Data Manipulation (Flame Client Data):** Risk significantly reduced (80-90%).
*   **Flame Rendering/Logic Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced (80-90%).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic server-side validation of some player actions originating from the Flame client.
*   No dedicated cheat detection mechanisms monitoring Flame client data.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive server-side authority for all Flame game state and logic needs to be implemented.
*   Robust cheat detection heuristics need to be developed, specifically monitoring data from the Flame client.
*   Rate limiting needs to be implemented for actions originating from the Flame client.
*   Secure random number generation needs to be used consistently within Flame game logic.
*   Text input sanitization within Flame needs to be implemented if applicable.
