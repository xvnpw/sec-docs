*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** Rigorous validation of all network data, especially data related to component creation.  Use whitelisting for allowed component types and data structures.  Consider network intrusion detection systems.
