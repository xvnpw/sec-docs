## Attack Tree Path: [1. Manipulate FVM Configuration [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__manipulate_fvm_configuration__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.a. Overwrite `.fvm/fvm_config.json`**
    *   **1.a.i. Local File System Access [CRITICAL]**:  The attacker gains direct access to the developer's file system, allowing them to modify the `fvm_config.json` file. This could be achieved through a compromised IDE, a malicious script executed by the developer, or other malware.
    *   **1.a.iii. Social Engineering [CRITICAL]**: The attacker tricks the developer into using a malicious `fvm_config.json` file, perhaps by sending it as an attachment or providing a link to a compromised download.
*   **1.b. Influence Environment Variables [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **1.b.i. Compromised CI/CD Pipeline Configuration [CRITICAL]**: The attacker gains access to the CI/CD system and modifies environment variables like `FVM_HOME` or `FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL`. This affects all builds and deployments.
    *   **1.b.ii. Malicious Shell Script/Profile Modification [CRITICAL]**: The attacker modifies the developer's shell profile or startup scripts to set malicious environment variables, affecting all FVM usage on that machine.
    *   **1.b.iii. Developer Workstation Compromise [CRITICAL]**: The attacker gains full control over the developer's workstation, allowing them to modify environment variables and any other aspect of the system.
*    **1.c. Exploit Weaknesses in Configuration Parsing/Validation**
    *   **1.c.i. Craft Malicious `fvm_config.json` [CRITICAL]**: The attacker crafts a specially designed `fvm_config.json` file that exploits a vulnerability in FVM's parsing logic, potentially leading to code execution or other unintended behavior.
    *   **1.c.ii. Craft Malicious Environment Variable Values [CRITICAL]**: The attacker sets environment variables to values that exploit a vulnerability in how FVM handles them, potentially leading to code execution or other unintended behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Tamper with Flutter SDK Downloads [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__tamper_with_flutter_sdk_downloads__high_risk_.md)

*   **2.a. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**
    *   **2.a.i. Compromised Network [CRITICAL]**: The attacker intercepts the network traffic between the developer's machine and the Flutter SDK download server, allowing them to replace the legitimate SDK with a malicious one.
    *   **2.a.ii. DNS Spoofing/Hijacking [CRITICAL]**: The attacker redirects the developer's DNS requests to a malicious server, causing FVM to download the SDK from an attacker-controlled location.
*   **2.b. Exploit Weaknesses in Download Verification**
    *   **2.b.i. Bypass Checksum Verification [CRITICAL]**: The attacker finds a flaw in FVM's checksum verification process, allowing them to provide a malicious SDK that passes the (incorrect) verification.
*   **2.c. Influence `FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL` (see 1.b) [HIGH RISK]** - Same attack vectors and mitigations as 1.b.i, 1.b.ii, and 1.b.iii.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Vulnerabilities in FVM's Code](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_fvm's_code.md)

*   **3.a. Command Injection**
    *   **3.a.i. Unsanitized User Input [CRITICAL]**: FVM uses unsanitized user input (e.g., version strings, project paths) when constructing shell commands, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
    *   **3.a.ii. Improper Handling of External Commands [CRITICAL]**: Even without direct user input, FVM might improperly handle external commands (e.g., `git`, `flutter`), leading to command injection vulnerabilities.
*   **3.b. Path Traversal**
    *   **3.b.i. Malicious Project Path or Version String [CRITICAL]**: The attacker provides a malicious project path or version string that, due to a vulnerability in FVM, allows them to access or modify files outside of the intended directory.
    *   **3.b.ii. Vulnerable File Operations within FVM [CRITICAL]**: FVM has internal file operations that are vulnerable to path traversal, even without direct malicious input.
*   **3.c. Dependency Confusion/Hijacking**
    *   **3.c.i. FVM's Dependencies Pulled from Malicious Source [CRITICAL]**: The attacker compromises the package repository or uses a malicious proxy to inject malicious code into one of FVM's dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Symlink Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/4__symlink_attacks.md)

*   **4.a. FVM creates predictable symlinks**
    *   **4.a.i. Attacker creates a malicious file/directory before FVM creates the symlink. [CRITICAL]**: FVM intends to create a symlink at a predictable location.  The attacker, knowing this, creates a malicious file or directory at that location *before* FVM can create the symlink.  FVM then ends up linking to the attacker's malicious content.
    *   **4.a.ii. Attacker replaces a legitimate file/directory with a symlink to a malicious location. [CRITICAL]**: The attacker replaces a file or directory that FVM expects to be legitimate with a symlink pointing to a malicious location.
*   **4.b. FVM follows symlinks insecurely**
    *   **4.b.i. Attacker places a symlink in a location FVM interacts with. [CRITICAL]**: The attacker places a symlink in a location that FVM will access during its operation.
    *   **4.b.ii. FVM reads/writes to the target of the symlink without proper validation. [CRITICAL]**: FVM follows a symlink and performs operations on the target without verifying that the target is a safe and expected location.
