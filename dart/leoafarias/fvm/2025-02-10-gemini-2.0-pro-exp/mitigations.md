# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for leoafarias/fvm

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify Flutter SDK Hashes (after `fvm install`)](./mitigation_strategies/verify_flutter_sdk_hashes__after__fvm_install__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Install via `fvm`:** Use the `fvm install <version>` command to download and install the desired Flutter SDK.
2.  **Calculate Local Hash:** *After* the `fvm install` command completes, use a command-line tool (e.g., `sha256sum`, `Get-FileHash`) to calculate the SHA-256 hash of the downloaded SDK directory (typically `~/.fvm/versions/<version>`).  It is crucial that this step happens *after* `fvm` has finished its work.
3.  **Compare with Official Hash:** Compare the calculated hash with the official SHA-256 hash for that specific Flutter version (obtained from the official Flutter documentation or release artifacts).
4.  **Automate in CI/CD:** Integrate this hash verification into your CI/CD pipeline as a script that runs *immediately after* the `fvm install` step. The build should fail if the hashes don't match.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Malicious Flutter SDK Versions:** (Severity: **Critical**) - Prevents the use of a compromised SDK installed by `fvm`.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks via Flutter SDK Mirrors:** (Severity: **High**) - Detects altered SDKs even if `fvm` downloads from a compromised mirror.

**Impact:**
*   **Malicious Flutter SDK Versions:** Risk reduction: **Very High**.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks via Flutter SDK Mirrors:** Risk reduction: **High**.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Manual hash verification is performed sporadically.
*   No automated hash verification in CI/CD.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **Full Automation (CI/CD):** The automated hash verification script within the CI/CD pipeline is the most critical missing piece.
*   **Standardized Procedure:** A documented procedure for manual verification.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pin `fvm` Version](./mitigation_strategies/pin__fvm__version.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Select Stable Version:** Choose a specific, stable version of `fvm`.
2.  **Document:** Document the chosen `fvm` version.
3.  **Install Specific Version:** Use `pub global activate fvm --version <selected_version>` to install the specified version.
4.  **CI/CD Enforcement:** In the CI/CD pipeline, *explicitly install* the pinned `fvm` version *before* any `fvm` commands are executed. This is a direct interaction with `fvm`.
5.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review and update the pinned `fvm` version.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Tampered `fvm` Executable:** (Severity: **High**)
*   **Dependency Confusion with `fvm` Itself:** (Severity: **Low**)

**Impact:**
*   **Tampered `fvm` Executable:** Risk reduction: **High**.
*   **Dependency Confusion with `fvm` Itself:** Risk reduction: **Moderate**.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `fvm` version mentioned in README, but not enforced.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **CI/CD Enforcement:** The CI/CD pipeline does *not* install a specific `fvm` version.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use `.fvmrc` and Enforce Project-Specific SDKs](./mitigation_strategies/use___fvmrc__and_enforce_project-specific_sdks.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Create `.fvmrc`:** Create a `.fvmrc` file at the project root.
2.  **Specify Version:** Inside `.fvmrc`, specify the desired Flutter SDK version (e.g., `3.16.0`).
3.  **CI/CD Usage:** In the CI/CD pipeline, use the command `fvm use` (without a version argument) to activate the Flutter SDK version defined in `.fvmrc`. This is a direct `fvm` command. This should be followed by `fvm install` to ensure that version is installed.
4. **IDE configuration:** Configure IDE to use fvm.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Misconfiguration Leading to Incorrect SDK Usage:** (Severity: **High**)

**Impact:**
*   **Misconfiguration Leading to Incorrect SDK Usage:** Risk reduction: **Very High**.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `.fvmrc` file exists.
*   Developers mostly use IDEs that respect `.fvmrc`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **CI/CD Enforcement:** The CI/CD pipeline does *not* use `fvm use`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Audit `fvm` and Flutter SDK Installations](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_audit__fvm__and_flutter_sdk_installations.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Schedule Audits:** Establish a regular audit schedule.
2.  **List Installed SDKs:** Run `fvm list` to display installed Flutter SDKs. This is a direct `fvm` command.
3.  **Check `fvm` Version:** Run `fvm --version` to verify the installed `fvm` version. This is a direct `fvm` command.
4.  **Compare:** Compare with an approved list.
5.  **Investigate:** Investigate discrepancies.
6.  **Automate (Optional):** Consider automation.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Malicious Flutter SDK Versions:** (Severity: **Medium**)
*   **Tampered `fvm` Executable:** (Severity: **Medium**)
*   **Misconfiguration Leading to Incorrect SDK Usage:** (Severity: **Medium**)

**Impact:**
*   **Malicious Flutter SDK Versions:** Risk reduction: **Moderate**.
*   **Tampered `fvm` Executable:** Risk reduction: **Moderate**.
*   **Misconfiguration Leading to Incorrect SDK Usage:** Risk reduction: **Moderate**.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   No formal audit process.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **Formal Schedule:** A regular schedule is needed.
*   **Approved List:** A maintained list of approved versions is required.
*   **Automated Script (Optional):** Automation would improve efficiency.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use a Trusted Flutter SDK Mirror (If Necessary) - *fvm Configuration*](./mitigation_strategies/use_a_trusted_flutter_sdk_mirror__if_necessary__-_fvm_configuration.md)

**Description:**
1. **Prefer Official Source:** Prioritize the official Flutter download source.
2. **Vet Mirrors:** If a mirror is *absolutely necessary*, thoroughly vet its security.
3. **Configure fvm (If Supported):** If `fvm` supports configuring mirrors (via environment variables or configuration files), use this mechanism to specify the trusted mirror.  This is a direct interaction with `fvm`'s configuration.
4. **Regular Re-evaluation:** Periodically re-evaluate the mirror.
5. **Hash Verification (Essential):** Always perform hash verification after `fvm install`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
* **Supply Chain Attacks via Flutter SDK Mirrors:** (Severity: **High**)

**Impact:**
* **Supply Chain Attacks via Flutter SDK Mirrors:** Risk reduction: **Moderate to High**.

**Currently Implemented:**
* The project uses the official Flutter download source.

**Missing Implementation:**
* None, as no mirrors are used. Documentation should include guidelines for mirror configuration *if* it becomes necessary.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure fvm Installation and Permissions](./mitigation_strategies/secure_fvm_installation_and_permissions.md)

**Description:**
1. **Official Installation:** Install `fvm` following the official instructions.
2. **File Permissions:** Ensure the `fvm` executable and its installation directory have appropriate file permissions, restricting write access.
3. **Avoid `sudo` (When Possible):** Avoid running `fvm` commands with `sudo` unless absolutely necessary. This relates to how `fvm` is *used*.
4. **Global Installation (Careful Consideration):** If installing globally, protect the installation directory.
5. **Regular Updates:** Keep `fvm` updated (while adhering to version pinning).

**Threats Mitigated:**
* **Tampered `fvm` Executable:** (Severity: **Medium**)
* **Local Privilege Escalation via fvm:** (Severity: **Low to Medium**)

**Impact:**
* **Tampered `fvm` Executable:** Risk reduction: **Moderate**.
* **Local Privilege Escalation via fvm:** Risk reduction: **Moderate**.

**Currently Implemented:**
* Developers generally follow official installation instructions.

**Missing Implementation:**
* **Formal Permission Checks:** No automated checks for correct file permissions.
* **`sudo` Usage Guidance:** Explicit guidance on avoiding unnecessary `sudo` usage.
