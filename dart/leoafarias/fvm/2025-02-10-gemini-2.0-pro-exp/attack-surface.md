# Attack Surface Analysis for leoafarias/fvm

## Attack Surface: [1. Compromised `fvm` Release](./attack_surfaces/1__compromised__fvm__release.md)

**Description:** Attackers distribute a malicious version of the `fvm` tool itself, compromising the entire Flutter SDK management process.
**How `fvm` Contributes:** `fvm` is the *direct* target and vector.  A compromised `fvm` controls all subsequent SDK operations.
**Example:** An attacker compromises the `fvm` GitHub repository or pub.dev listing and replaces the legitimate release with a backdoored version.
**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on developer machines and CI/CD servers, leading to complete compromise of the development pipeline.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Package Verification:** Attempt to verify downloaded `fvm` package integrity (checksums, if available â€“ often impractical).
    *   **Trusted Sources:** Install `fvm` *only* from official sources (pub.dev, GitHub releases).
    *   **Internal Mirroring:** Maintain an internal, vetted mirror of `fvm` (for larger organizations).
    *   **Monitoring:** Actively monitor the `fvm` project for security advisories.

## Attack Surface: [2. Dependency Confusion/Substitution (for `fvm` itself)](./attack_surfaces/2__dependency_confusionsubstitution__for__fvm__itself_.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit `fvm`'s dependencies by publishing malicious packages with the same names as legitimate `fvm` dependencies.
**How `fvm` Contributes:** The attack targets `fvm`'s *own* dependency resolution process, making `fvm` the direct conduit for the malicious code.
**Example:** `fvm` depends on "downloader". An attacker publishes a malicious "downloader" on pub.dev, and `fvm` installs it.
**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on systems running `fvm`, compromising the development environment.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Lockfiles:** Use `pubspec.lock` to *strictly* pin `fvm`'s dependency versions. Commit the lockfile.
    *   **Private Repositories:** Prioritize trusted, private package repositories for `fvm` and its dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit `fvm`'s dependencies for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [3. Malicious Flutter SDK Installation (via `fvm` command)](./attack_surfaces/3__malicious_flutter_sdk_installation__via__fvm__command_.md)

**Description:** Attackers use `fvm` commands to install a compromised or malicious Flutter SDK.
**How `fvm` Contributes:** `fvm` is the *direct* tool used to perform the malicious installation.  This is distinct from `.fvmrc` manipulation, where `fvm` is used *indirectly*.
**Example:** An attacker with access to a developer's terminal or a CI/CD script executes `fvm install <malicious-sdk-version>` or `fvm use <malicious-sdk-version>`.
**Impact:** The compiled application contains vulnerabilities from the malicious SDK, leading to potential exploits.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Command Auditing:**  Audit and monitor `fvm` commands executed in CI/CD environments and on developer machines.
    *   **Restricted Shell Access:** Limit shell access to CI/CD servers and developer machines to authorized personnel only.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run CI/CD processes and developer tools with the least necessary privileges.
    *   **Input Validation (for CI/CD):** If SDK versions are provided as input to CI/CD pipelines, *strictly* validate and sanitize these inputs.

## Attack Surface: [4. Cache Poisoning (of `fvm`'s cache)](./attack_surfaces/4__cache_poisoning__of__fvm_'s_cache_.md)

**Description:**  Attackers with write access to the `fvm` cache directory replace legitimate SDK files with malicious ones.
**How `fvm` Contributes:**  `fvm`'s caching mechanism is the *direct* target. The attacker leverages `fvm`'s reliance on the cache.
**Example:** An attacker gains access to a CI/CD server and modifies the contents of the `fvm` cache, replacing a legitimate Flutter SDK.
**Impact:** Subsequent builds using the poisoned cache result in a vulnerable application.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Permissions:** Enforce *very* restrictive permissions on the `fvm` cache directory, allowing write access *only* to the specific user account running `fvm`.
    *   **Isolated Build Environments:** Use isolated build environments (e.g., Docker containers) to minimize the risk and impact of cache poisoning.  Each build should ideally start with a clean cache.
    *   **Cache Clearing:** Regularly clear the `fvm` cache, especially before critical builds.
    *   **Immutable Caches (Ideal):** If possible, configure the build environment to treat the cache as read-only after the initial download.
