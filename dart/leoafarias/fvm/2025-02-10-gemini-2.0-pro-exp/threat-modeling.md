# Threat Model Analysis for leoafarias/fvm

## Threat: [Malicious Flutter SDK Substitution (via FVM)](./threats/malicious_flutter_sdk_substitution__via_fvm_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious Flutter SDK that mimics a legitimate version.  They then trick `fvm` into downloading and using this malicious SDK. While this relies on compromising *external* resources (Flutter distribution), `fvm` is the *direct* tool used to introduce the malicious SDK. The attacker might achieve this through a compromised mirror, DNS spoofing targeting the download URLs used by `fvm`, or a man-in-the-middle attack on the connection between `fvm` and the Flutter servers.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker's malicious code is incorporated into the built application, potentially leading to data breaches, remote code execution on user devices, or other malicious behavior. The application's integrity and user trust are compromised.
    *   **Affected FVM Component:** `fvm`'s download and installation mechanism (specifically, the functions responsible for fetching SDKs from remote sources, like the `fetch` command and related internal functions). The cache directory (`~/.fvm/versions`) is where the malicious SDK would be stored.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strongly Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure `fvm` *always* uses HTTPS for downloading SDKs. This is generally the default, but verify configuration.
        *   **Implement Checksum Verification (Future Enhancement for FVM):**  `fvm` *should* verify the checksum of downloaded SDKs against a trusted source *after* download. This is a crucial feature request for `fvm`.
        *   **Use a Trusted Network:** Avoid using public Wi-Fi or untrusted networks when downloading SDKs.
        *   **Validate Flutter SDK integrity manually (if highly concerned):** Download the official Flutter SDK separately and compare its checksum with the one downloaded by `fvm`.

## Threat: [Post-Download SDK Tampering (within FVM Cache)](./threats/post-download_sdk_tampering__within_fvm_cache_.md)

*   **Description:** After `fvm` downloads a legitimate Flutter SDK, an attacker with local access (e.g., compromised developer machine, malicious insider, compromised CI/CD agent) modifies the files within the `fvm` cache directory (`~/.fvm/versions`). This directly targets `fvm`'s storage of the SDK.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker's code is incorporated into the built application, leading to compromised application integrity and potential harm to users.
    *   **Affected FVM Component:** The `fvm` cache directory (`~/.fvm/versions`) and any `fvm` commands that use the cached SDKs (e.g., `fvm use`, `fvm flutter`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Cache Directory Permissions:** Ensure that only authorized users and processes have write access to the `~/.fvm/versions` directory. Use the principle of least privilege.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Implement FIM on the `~/.fvm/versions` directory.
        *   **Read-Only Cache (Ideal):** If feasible, make the `~/.fvm/versions` directory read-only after the initial SDK download.

## Threat: [FVM Configuration File Tampering](./threats/fvm_configuration_file_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies the `fvm` configuration files (e.g., `.fvm/fvm_config.json`, per-project `.fvmrc` files) to point to a malicious Flutter SDK version or a compromised repository. This is a direct attack on `fvm`'s configuration.
    *   **Impact:** The build process uses a malicious or outdated SDK, leading to compromised application integrity and potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected FVM Component:** The `fvm` configuration loading mechanism and any commands that rely on the configuration (e.g., `fvm use`, `fvm flutter`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Version Control:** Store all `fvm` configuration files in a version control system (e.g., Git).
        *   **Code Reviews:** Enforce mandatory code reviews for *any* changes to `fvm` configuration files.
        *   **Restrict File Permissions:** Limit write access to these configuration files.
        *   **CI/CD Validation:** Have the CI/CD pipeline validate the configuration files.
        *   **Signed Configuration (Future Enhancement):** Ideally, `fvm` could support digitally signed configuration files.

## Threat: [FVM Executable Tampering](./threats/fvm_executable_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker replaces or modifies the `fvm` executable itself with a malicious version. This is a direct attack on the `fvm` tool.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker gains complete control over the `fvm` process, allowing them to manipulate SDK downloads, configurations, and potentially execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Affected FVM Component:** The `fvm` executable itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Trusted Installation Source:** Install `fvm` only from the official repository using a trusted package manager.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Monitor the `fvm` executable for changes.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `fvm` updated.
        *   **Code Signing Verification (If Available):** Verify the signature before running (if `fvm` releases are signed).

## Threat: [Compromised FVM repository](./threats/compromised_fvm_repository.md)

*   **Description:** Official FVM repository is compromised and attacker is publishing malicious version of FVM.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker gains control over the system where `fvm` is running, potentially compromising the entire development environment or CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Affected FVM Component:** The `fvm` executable itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Monitor FVM repository:** Monitor FVM repository for any suspicious activity.
        *   **Use alternative installation method:** If possible, use alternative installation method, e.g. build from source.
        *   **Wait for official fix:** Wait for official fix and announcement from FVM maintainers.

## Threat: [FVM Vulnerability Exploitation (Hypothetical)](./threats/fvm_vulnerability_exploitation__hypothetical_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability is discovered in `fvm` itself (e.g., command injection, path traversal) that allows arbitrary code execution. This is a direct threat to `fvm`.
    *   **Impact:** Attacker gains control over the system where `fvm` is running.
    *   **Affected FVM Component:** The specific vulnerable component within `fvm`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a vulnerability exists)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep FVM Updated:** Regularly update `fvm`.
        *   **Run with Least Privilege:** Avoid running `fvm` with root privileges.
        *   **Sandboxing (Containerization):** Run `fvm` in a container.
        *   **Security Audits (for FVM Maintainers):** Regularly audit the `fvm` codebase.
