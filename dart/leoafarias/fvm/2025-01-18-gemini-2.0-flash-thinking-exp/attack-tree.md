## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using FVM (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_fvm__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** The attacker's ultimate goal is to successfully compromise the application that utilizes FVM. This node represents the successful achievement of their objective through any of the identified attack paths.

**How it Works:** This is the culmination of a successful attack through one or more of the sub-nodes. The specific method depends on the chosen attack path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit FVM Download Process (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_fvm_download_process__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This attack path focuses on compromising the integrity of the Flutter SDK during the download process managed by FVM.

**How it Works:** An attacker aims to inject a malicious Flutter SDK into the developer's environment by intercepting or manipulating the download process. This can be achieved through various means, such as a Man-in-the-Middle attack or by compromising the source of the SDK itself (though the latter is lower likelihood).

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on SDK Download (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_sdk_download__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the network communication between the developer's machine and the server hosting the Flutter SDK during the `fvm install` process.

**How it Works:** The attacker positions themselves within the network path, allowing them to intercept the download request for the Flutter SDK. They then replace the legitimate SDK with a malicious version before forwarding it to the developer's machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit FVM Local Storage and Configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_fvm_local_storage_and_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This attack path targets the locally stored Flutter SDKs and FVM configuration files on the developer's machine.

**How it Works:** An attacker, having gained access to the developer's local machine, directly modifies the files within an FVM-managed Flutter SDK directory or alters FVM's configuration files. This allows them to introduce malicious code or force the use of a compromised SDK.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Locally Stored SDK (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_locally_stored_sdk__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** An attacker with local access modifies the files within an FVM-managed Flutter SDK directory after it has been installed.

**How it Works:** Once FVM has downloaded and installed a Flutter SDK, the attacker gains access to the developer's machine and directly modifies critical files within the SDK's directory structure. This could involve replacing legitimate binaries with malicious ones or injecting malicious code into existing files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via FVM (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_fvm__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This attack path exploits vulnerabilities in how the application or developer scripts might programmatically interact with FVM.

**How it Works:** If the application or a developer script constructs FVM commands based on user input or external data without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands. When these commands are executed by the system, the attacker gains the ability to run arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Attacks Targeting Developers (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_attacks_targeting_developers__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This attack path relies on manipulating developers into performing actions that compromise the security of their development environment.

**How it Works:** Attackers use psychological manipulation techniques to trick developers into installing malicious software (like a backdoored Flutter SDK) or running malicious commands related to FVM. This often involves phishing emails, deceptive websites, or other forms of social engineering.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tricking Developer into Installing Malicious SDK (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/tricking_developer_into_installing_malicious_sdk__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** An attacker deceives a developer into manually downloading and installing a malicious Flutter SDK, bypassing FVM's intended management.

**How it Works:** The attacker uses social engineering tactics to convince the developer to download and install a fake or backdoored Flutter SDK from an untrusted source. This could involve sending a link to a malicious download site disguised as the official Flutter website or through other deceptive means.
