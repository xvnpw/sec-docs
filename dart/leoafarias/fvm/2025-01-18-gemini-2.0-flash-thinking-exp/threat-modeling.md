# Threat Model Analysis for leoafarias/fvm

## Threat: [Compromised FVM Installation](./threats/compromised_fvm_installation.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could trick a developer into downloading and installing a modified version of FVM containing malicious code. This could be achieved through phishing, compromised software repositories, or by hosting a fake FVM download site. Upon installation, the malicious FVM could execute arbitrary commands on the developer's machine.
* **Impact:** Full compromise of the developer's workstation, including access to source code, credentials, and other sensitive information. The attacker could also use the compromised machine to further attack the development infrastructure.
* **Affected FVM Component:** Installation script/process.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Download FVM only from the official GitHub repository: `https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm`.
    * Verify the integrity of the downloaded file using checksums (if provided by the official source).
    * Be cautious of links and download sources from untrusted origins.
    * Employ endpoint security solutions to detect and prevent malicious software installation.

## Threat: [Malicious Flutter SDK Installation via FVM](./threats/malicious_flutter_sdk_installation_via_fvm.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could create a fake Flutter SDK repository or modify an existing one (if access is gained) and trick FVM into downloading and installing this malicious SDK. This could involve manipulating the FVM configuration or exploiting vulnerabilities in how FVM resolves and downloads SDK versions. The malicious SDK could contain backdoors, exfiltrate data during the build process, or introduce vulnerabilities into the final application.
* **Impact:** Introduction of backdoors, data exfiltration during build, unexpected application behavior, potential security vulnerabilities in the final application. This could lead to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
* **Affected FVM Component:** SDK Download and Installation Module, potentially SDK Version Resolution.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Rely on FVM's default behavior of installing official Flutter releases.
    * Avoid configuring FVM to use unofficial or untrusted Flutter SDK sources.
    * Implement code review processes to identify suspicious code changes introduced by potentially compromised SDKs.
    * Consider using static analysis tools on the built application to detect anomalies.
    * Monitor network traffic during SDK downloads for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [CI/CD Pipeline Compromise via FVM Configuration](./threats/cicd_pipeline_compromise_via_fvm_configuration.md)

* **Description:** If the CI/CD pipeline uses FVM to manage Flutter versions, a compromise of the pipeline's configuration or secrets could allow an attacker to modify the FVM setup. This could lead to the installation of a malicious Flutter SDK during the build process without the team's knowledge.
* **Impact:** Deployment of a compromised application, potentially leading to widespread security breaches affecting end-users.
* **Affected FVM Component:** Configuration Loading/Parsing Module within the CI/CD environment.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Secure the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    * Store CI/CD secrets securely using dedicated secret management tools.
    * Implement strict access controls for the CI/CD environment.
    * Verify the integrity of the Flutter SDK used in the CI/CD pipeline, potentially by comparing checksums.
    * Consider using containerization to isolate the build environment and limit the impact of potential compromises.
