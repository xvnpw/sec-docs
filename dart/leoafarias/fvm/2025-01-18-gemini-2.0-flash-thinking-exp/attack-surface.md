# Attack Surface Analysis for leoafarias/fvm

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Flutter SDK Download](./attack_surfaces/malicious_flutter_sdk_download.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Flutter SDK Download
    *   **Description:** An attacker substitutes a legitimate Flutter SDK with a malicious one during the download process.
    *   **How FVM Contributes:** FVM is responsible for downloading Flutter SDKs from external sources (typically GitHub or mirrors). It relies on the integrity of these sources and the network connection. If these are compromised, FVM will download the malicious SDK.
    *   **Example:** A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack intercepts the download request for a Flutter SDK and replaces the legitimate archive with a modified one containing backdoors or malware. FVM, unaware of the substitution, installs this malicious SDK.
    *   **Impact:**  Critical. Using a malicious SDK can lead to the injection of malicious code into the built application, compromising user data, system integrity, or enabling remote access. The development environment itself can also be compromised.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Verify cryptographic signatures of downloaded SDKs (if available from the official source).
        *   Utilize secure and trusted network connections for SDK downloads.
        *   Consider using internal mirrors for Flutter SDKs hosted on infrastructure under your control.
        *   Implement network security measures to prevent MITM attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Local File System Manipulation of SDKs](./attack_surfaces/local_file_system_manipulation_of_sdks.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Local File System Manipulation of SDKs
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains write access to the directories where FVM stores Flutter SDKs and modifies or replaces legitimate SDK files with malicious ones.
    *   **How FVM Contributes:** FVM manages the installation and storage of multiple Flutter SDK versions on the local file system. If the permissions on the FVM directories (`~/.fvm` or project-specific `.fvm` directories) or the SDK installation directories are not properly secured, they become vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits weak file permissions on the `~/.fvm/versions` directory to replace the `stable` Flutter SDK with a compromised version. When a developer uses FVM to select the `stable` version, they are unknowingly using the malicious SDK.
    *   **Impact:** High. A compromised SDK can lead to the same severe consequences as downloading a malicious SDK, including backdoored applications and compromised development environments.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure secure file permissions on FVM directories and SDK installation locations, restricting write access to authorized users only.
        *   Regularly scan FVM directories for unexpected file modifications.
        *   Educate developers on the importance of secure file permissions and avoiding running FVM with unnecessary elevated privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of FVM Configuration (`.fvm/fvm_config.json`)](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_fvm_configuration____fvmfvm_config_json__.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Manipulation of FVM Configuration (`.fvm/fvm_config.json`)
    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies the `.fvm/fvm_config.json` file to point to a malicious Flutter SDK already present on the system or to trigger the download of a malicious SDK.
    *   **How FVM Contributes:** FVM relies on the `.fvm/fvm_config.json` file to determine the active Flutter SDK version for a project. If this file is writable by unauthorized users, the integrity of the selected SDK can be compromised.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to the `.fvm` directory of a project and modifies the `flutterSdkVersion` entry in `fvm_config.json` to point to a path where a malicious Flutter SDK is located. The next time a developer builds the project, FVM will use this malicious SDK.
    *   **Impact:** High. Leads to the use of a potentially compromised SDK, resulting in backdoored applications or compromised development environments.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict write access to the `.fvm` directory and its contents, including `fvm_config.json`, to authorized users only.
        *   Implement file integrity monitoring for the `.fvm` directory.
        *   Consider using version control for the `.fvm` directory to track and revert unauthorized changes.
