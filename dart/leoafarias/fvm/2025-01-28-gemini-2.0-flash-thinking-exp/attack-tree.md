## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via FVM Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_fvm_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is the ultimate goal. Successful exploitation of any of the sub-paths leads to compromising the application that uses FVM.
* **Criticality:** Highest criticality as it represents the overall objective of the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Supply Malicious Flutter SDK [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__supply_malicious_flutter_sdk__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  The attacker aims to provide a modified Flutter SDK to the developer, which will then be used to build the application, embedding malicious code.
* **Criticality:** High criticality because a compromised SDK directly impacts every application built with it.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack during SDK Download [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_during_sdk_download__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Intercepting the network communication between the developer's machine and the Flutter SDK download server to inject or redirect to a malicious SDK.
* **Criticality:** High criticality as it allows for widespread distribution of malicious SDKs if successful against multiple developers.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Intercept FVM SDK Download Request](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__intercept_fvm_sdk_download_request.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Positioning the attacker in the network path to intercept the download request initiated by FVM.
    * **1.1.1.1. Network Level MitM (ARP Spoofing, DNS Spoofing)**
        * **Attack Vector:** Using techniques like ARP or DNS spoofing on a local network to redirect network traffic intended for the legitimate SDK server to the attacker's machine.
    * **1.1.1.2. Compromised Network Infrastructure (e.g., Malicious WiFi)**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities or malicious configurations in network infrastructure, such as public WiFi hotspots, to perform MitM attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Network Level MitM (ARP Spoofing, DNS Spoofing)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__network_level_mitm__arp_spoofing__dns_spoofing_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities or malicious configurations in network infrastructure, such as public WiFi hotspots, to perform MitM attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3. Serve Malicious SDK Content [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3__serve_malicious_sdk_content__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Once the download request is intercepted (via redirection or MitM), the attacker serves a malicious Flutter SDK instead of the legitimate one.
    * **1.1.3.1. Host Malicious SDK on Attacker-Controlled Server**
        * **Attack Vector:** Setting up a server controlled by the attacker to host the malicious SDK and serving it when the intercepted request is redirected.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.1. Host Malicious SDK on Attacker-Controlled Server](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_1__host_malicious_sdk_on_attacker-controlled_server.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Local SDK Replacement (Requires Local Access) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__local_sdk_replacement__requires_local_access___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  If the attacker gains local access to the developer's machine, they can directly replace the legitimate Flutter SDK stored by FVM with a malicious one.
* **Criticality:** High criticality as it directly compromises the development environment.

        * **Attack Vector:**  Using path traversal to overwrite critical system files, application binaries, or other sensitive data, leading to system instability or compromise.
