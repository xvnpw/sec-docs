# Attack Surface Analysis for leoafarias/fvm

## Attack Surface: [1. Insecure Download of Flutter SDKs](./attack_surfaces/1__insecure_download_of_flutter_sdks.md)

*   **Description:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks during the download of Flutter SDKs by `fvm`, leading to the installation of a compromised SDK. This attack surface is directly created by `fvm`'s responsibility to fetch and install Flutter SDKs from remote sources.
*   **fvm Contribution:** `fvm` initiates and manages the download process of Flutter SDKs. If this process lacks security measures, it becomes vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An attacker positioned on the network intercepts `fvm`'s SDK download request and injects a malicious Flutter SDK. `fvm`, without proper verification, installs this compromised SDK. When a developer uses this SDK, their projects and system can be compromised.
*   **Impact:** Installation of malicious Flutter SDKs, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution during Flutter development, data theft, or system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (fvm maintainers):**
        *   **Enforce HTTPS for Downloads:**  Ensure `fvm` *only* uses HTTPS for downloading SDKs to prevent eavesdropping and tampering during transit.
        *   **Implement Checksum Verification:** `fvm` should download and verify checksums (e.g., SHA-256) of SDKs from a trusted source and compare them against the downloaded SDK files before installation to ensure integrity.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Ensure `fvm` is configured to use HTTPS for downloads (this should be the default and enforced by `fvm`).

## Attack Surface: [2. Local Path Manipulation and File System Access](./attack_surfaces/2__local_path_manipulation_and_file_system_access.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of file paths and file system operations by `fvm`, such as path traversal, leading to unauthorized file access or modification. This attack surface is directly related to `fvm`'s core function of managing SDK installations within the local file system.
*   **fvm Contribution:** `fvm` manipulates file paths to install, manage, and switch between Flutter SDK versions. Insecure path handling within `fvm` can be exploited.
*   **Example:** If `fvm` uses user-provided input (e.g., in configuration or commands) to construct file paths without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject a path like `../../../../sensitive_file` to access or overwrite files outside of `fvm`'s intended SDK directories.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized file access, modification, or deletion; potential privilege escalation if sensitive system files are targeted; data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (fvm maintainers):**
        *   **Strict Path Sanitization and Validation:** `fvm` must rigorously sanitize and validate all file paths, especially those derived from user input or configuration. Use secure path manipulation functions provided by the programming language to prevent path traversal.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (File Permissions):**  `fvm` should apply the principle of least privilege when setting file permissions for SDK directories and files, restricting access to only necessary users and processes.

## Attack Surface: [3. Command Execution and Injection](./attack_surfaces/3__command_execution_and_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Command injection vulnerabilities arising from insecure construction and execution of system commands by `fvm`. This is a direct attack surface because `fvm` likely needs to execute system commands to interact with Flutter SDKs and the operating system.
*   **fvm Contribution:** `fvm` might execute system commands to perform actions like running Flutter commands, managing SDK installations, or interacting with the shell. If these commands are constructed insecurely, injection is possible.
*   **Example:** If `fvm` constructs a command using unsanitized user input from a configuration file or command-line argument, an attacker could inject malicious commands. For example, if `fvm` uses user input to build a command like `fvm run flutter <user_provided_argument>`, and the user provides `; malicious_command`, this could lead to execution of `malicious_command`.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's system with the privileges of the `fvm` process, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (fvm maintainers):**
        *   **Avoid Shell Execution:** `fvm` should prioritize using programming language APIs that directly execute commands without invoking a shell to minimize injection risks.
        *   **Input Sanitization and Parameterization:** If shell execution is necessary, `fvm` must rigorously sanitize all inputs used to construct commands. Use parameterized commands or escaping mechanisms provided by the operating system or programming language to prevent command injection.

## Attack Surface: [4. Configuration File Vulnerabilities (`fvm_config.json`)](./attack_surfaces/4__configuration_file_vulnerabilities___fvm_config_json__.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from insecure parsing or processing of `fvm`'s configuration files (`fvm_config.json`), potentially leading to code execution or unauthorized actions. This is directly related to how `fvm` handles and interprets its configuration.
*   **fvm Contribution:** `fvm` relies on `fvm_config.json` to store project-specific settings. Insecure parsing or validation of this file can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** If `fvm`'s JSON parsing library has a vulnerability, a maliciously crafted `fvm_config.json` could exploit it.  Furthermore, if `fvm_config.json` allows specifying paths or commands that are not properly validated, an attacker could manipulate these settings to execute arbitrary code when `fvm` processes the configuration.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, unauthorized file access or modification, denial of service, depending on the nature of the vulnerability in configuration parsing or processing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (fvm maintainers):**
        *   **Secure JSON Parsing:** `fvm` should use well-vetted and regularly updated secure JSON parsing libraries.
        *   **Configuration Validation:** `fvm` must thoroughly validate all configuration options read from `fvm_config.json` against a strict schema. Restrict allowed values and formats to prevent malicious configurations.

## Attack Surface: [5. Update Mechanism Vulnerabilities (if applicable)](./attack_surfaces/5__update_mechanism_vulnerabilities__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in `fvm`'s update mechanism, allowing attackers to distribute malicious updates. This is a direct attack surface if `fvm` provides an update feature, as it controls the software users receive.
*   **fvm Contribution:** If `fvm` has an update mechanism, it is responsible for fetching and installing updates. Insecure updates can lead to users installing compromised versions of `fvm`.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises the update server used by `fvm` or performs a MITM attack during the update process, delivering a malicious version of `fvm` to users. Users unknowingly install this compromised `fvm` version.
*   **Impact:** Distribution of compromised `fvm` versions to users, potentially leading to widespread system compromise, data theft, or supply chain attacks affecting all users of the compromised `fvm` version.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (fvm maintainers):**
        *   **Secure Update Channel (HTTPS):** `fvm`'s update mechanism must use HTTPS for downloading updates.
        *   **Cryptographic Verification (Digital Signatures):** Implement a robust update verification mechanism using digital signatures. `fvm` updates should be signed by the `fvm` developers, and the application should verify these signatures before applying updates.
