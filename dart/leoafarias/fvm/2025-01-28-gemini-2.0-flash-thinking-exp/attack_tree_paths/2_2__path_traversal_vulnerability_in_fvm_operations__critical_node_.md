#### 2.2. Path Traversal Vulnerability in FVM Operations [CRITICAL NODE]

**Description:**

This node identifies a critical vulnerability category: **Path Traversal** within the file operations performed by `fvm`. Path traversal vulnerabilities occur when an application improperly handles user-supplied or externally influenced file paths, allowing an attacker to access or manipulate files and directories outside of the intended working directory or scope of the application. In the context of `fvm`, this could mean an attacker could potentially access or modify files beyond the directories where `fvm` is supposed to manage Flutter SDK versions.

**Why Critical:**

This node is marked as **CRITICAL** because successful exploitation of path traversal vulnerabilities can have severe consequences, including:

* **Unauthorized File Access:** Attackers can read sensitive files that `fvm` or the application using it should not have access to.
* **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers can modify or delete critical application files, configuration files, or even system files, leading to application malfunction, data corruption, or system instability.
* **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** In some scenarios, manipulating certain files through path traversal could indirectly lead to privilege escalation if the application or system processes files with elevated privileges.
* **System Compromise:** Overwriting critical system files can lead to complete system compromise, denial of service, or the ability to execute arbitrary code.

**Potential Areas in FVM Operations Susceptible to Path Traversal:**

Based on the general functionality of `fvm`, potential areas where path traversal vulnerabilities could exist include:

* **Flutter SDK Installation Path:** If `fvm` allows users to specify a custom installation path for Flutter SDKs without proper validation, an attacker could provide a path containing traversal sequences to install SDKs outside the intended directory.
* **Project Configuration Files:** If `fvm` reads or writes project configuration files based on paths provided by the user or derived from project structure, vulnerabilities could arise if these paths are not sanitized.
* **Cache Directories:** If `fvm` uses caching mechanisms and relies on user-provided or derived paths for cache storage, path traversal could be exploited to manipulate cached data or access files in the cache directory.
* **Operations involving file paths as arguments:** Any `fvm` command that takes file paths as arguments (e.g., potentially for custom SDK paths, project paths, etc.) could be vulnerable if these paths are not properly validated.

#### 2.2.2. Craft Malicious Paths to Access or Modify Files Outside FVM's Intended Scope

**Description:**

This node details the primary attack vector: **Crafting Malicious Paths**. Attackers exploit path traversal vulnerabilities by constructing file paths that contain special sequences or characters designed to navigate outside the intended directory structure.

**Attack Vector Details:**

* **Path Traversal Sequences:** The most common technique involves using sequences like `../` (dot-dot-slash) to move up directory levels. By repeatedly using `../`, an attacker can escape the intended working directory and access files in parent directories or even the root directory.
    * **Example:** If `fvm` is intended to operate within `/opt/fvm/sdks` and a user-provided path is processed without validation, an attacker could provide a path like `../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to access the system's password file.
* **Absolute Paths:** In some cases, if the application doesn't properly restrict path handling, providing an absolute path (e.g., `/etc/shadow`) directly might bypass intended directory restrictions.
* **URL Encoding:** Attackers might use URL encoding (e.g., `%2e%2e%2f` for `../`) to obfuscate path traversal sequences and bypass basic input validation that might only check for literal `../`.
* **Operating System Specific Paths:** Attackers might utilize operating system-specific path separators (e.g., `\` on Windows) if the application is not correctly handling path separators across different platforms.

**Potential Impact:**

Successful crafting of malicious paths allows attackers to:

* **Read arbitrary files:** Access sensitive data, configuration files, source code, or other confidential information located outside of `fvm`'s intended scope.
* **Modify arbitrary files:**  Alter application behavior, corrupt data, or potentially gain control over the system by modifying configuration files, application binaries, or system files.
* **Bypass access controls:** Circumvent intended security measures that restrict access to certain files or directories.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Whitelist Valid Characters:**  Restrict allowed characters in file paths to only those strictly necessary (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores, etc.). Reject paths containing special characters like `.` and `/` unless explicitly required and carefully validated.
    * **Canonicalization:** Convert user-provided paths to their canonical form (absolute path with symbolic links resolved) and compare them against an allowed base directory. This helps prevent traversal using symbolic links and relative paths.
    * **Path Normalization:** Normalize paths to remove redundant separators, `.` and `..` components before processing.
* **Sandboxing and Chroot:**  Run `fvm` operations within a sandboxed environment or chroot jail to restrict its access to only the necessary file system resources.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that `fvm` and the application using it run with the minimum necessary privileges to perform their intended functions. This limits the potential damage if a path traversal vulnerability is exploited.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**  Developers should be trained on secure coding practices related to file path handling and path traversal vulnerabilities. Code reviews should specifically look for potential path traversal issues.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address path traversal vulnerabilities and other security weaknesses in `fvm` and the application.

#### 2.2.3. Overwrite Critical System Files or Application Files [CRITICAL NODE]

**Description:**

This node represents the most severe consequence of a successful path traversal attack in this context: **Overwriting Critical Files**.  By crafting malicious paths, an attacker can not only access files outside of `fvm`'s scope but also modify or overwrite them. Targeting critical system files or application files can lead to catastrophic outcomes.

**Attack Vector Details:**

Building upon the techniques described in node 2.2.2, attackers can use path traversal to construct paths that point to critical files and then leverage `fvm` operations (or vulnerabilities in the application using `fvm`) that involve file writing or modification to overwrite these files.

**Examples of Critical Files to Overwrite:**

* **System Files:**
    * `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`: User account information. Overwriting these can lead to denial of service, privilege escalation, or system compromise.
    * `/etc/sudoers`:  Defines sudo privileges. Modification can grant unauthorized users root access.
    * System binaries in `/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`, `/bin`, `/sbin`: Essential system utilities. Overwriting these can cause system instability or denial of service.
    * Kernel modules or configuration files:  Can lead to system crashes or kernel-level compromise.
* **Application Files:**
    * Application binaries: Overwriting application executables can render the application unusable or replace it with malicious code.
    * Application configuration files: Modifying configuration files can alter application behavior, disable security features, or introduce vulnerabilities.
    * Data files: Corrupting or deleting application data can lead to data loss or application malfunction.
    * `fvm`'s own binaries or configuration files:  Compromising `fvm` itself can have cascading effects on Flutter development environments managed by it.
    * Flutter SDK files:  While less critical than system files, corrupting SDK files can disrupt development workflows and potentially introduce subtle build issues.

**Why Critical:**

This node is marked as **CRITICAL** because overwriting critical files can have immediate and devastating consequences:

* **System Instability and Denial of Service:** Overwriting essential system files can render the operating system unusable, leading to a complete denial of service.
* **Privilege Escalation:**  Modifying files like `/etc/sudoers` can directly grant attackers root privileges.
* **Data Corruption and Loss:** Overwriting application data or configuration files can lead to data loss, application malfunction, or data breaches.
* **Backdoor Installation:** Attackers can overwrite legitimate application binaries with backdoored versions, allowing persistent access and control over the system.
* **Complete System Compromise:** In the worst-case scenario, overwriting critical system components can lead to complete system compromise, allowing attackers to gain full control and potentially use the system for malicious purposes.

**Mitigation Strategies (Building upon 2.2.2):**

All mitigation strategies from node 2.2.2 are crucial here. In addition, specific focus should be placed on:

* **Write Access Control:**  Strictly control write access to sensitive directories and files. `fvm` operations should ideally not require write access outside of its designated working directories.
* **Read-Only File Systems (where applicable):** Consider mounting critical system partitions as read-only to prevent accidental or malicious modifications.
* **Integrity Monitoring:** Implement file integrity monitoring systems (e.g., using tools like AIDE or Tripwire) to detect unauthorized modifications to critical files.
* **Regular Backups:** Maintain regular backups of critical system and application files to facilitate recovery in case of successful attacks.
* **Principle of Least Privilege (Strict Enforcement):**  Enforce the principle of least privilege rigorously. `fvm` and the application should run with the absolute minimum permissions required, minimizing the potential impact of a successful path traversal attack.  Avoid running `fvm` operations with elevated privileges unless absolutely necessary and carefully controlled.

**Conclusion:**

The "Path Traversal Vulnerability in FVM Operations" attack path represents a significant security risk.  The ability to craft malicious paths and potentially overwrite critical system or application files can lead to severe consequences, including system instability, data loss, and complete system compromise.  Implementing robust input validation, sanitization, and adhering to secure coding practices are essential to mitigate this vulnerability. Regular security assessments and penetration testing are crucial to identify and address any weaknesses in `fvm` and the applications that utilize it.  Prioritizing the mitigation strategies outlined above is critical to ensure the security and integrity of systems using `fvm`.
