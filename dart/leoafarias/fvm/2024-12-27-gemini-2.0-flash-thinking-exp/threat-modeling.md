## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving FVM

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the `fvm` (Flutter Version Management) tool.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Actions & How) | Impact | Affected FVM Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Compromised FVM Installation Script** | An attacker compromises the `fvm` installation script hosted on the official repository or a mirror. A developer downloads and executes this malicious script. The attacker might inject malware, backdoors, or modify the `fvm` installation to download compromised Flutter SDKs later. |  Developer machines are compromised, potentially leading to data theft, code injection into projects, or further attacks on the development environment. | `install` script, potentially the download mechanism within the script. | **High** | - **Verify the integrity of the installation script:** Check checksums or signatures if provided by the `fvm` maintainers. - **Use official sources:** Download `fvm` only from the official GitHub repository (`https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm`). - **Monitor network activity during installation:** Look for suspicious connections or data transfers. - **Employ endpoint security:** Use antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) software on developer machines. |
| **Malicious Flutter SDK Download via FVM** | An attacker compromises the source from which `fvm` downloads Flutter SDKs (e.g., a compromised mirror, a man-in-the-middle attack on the download link). When `fvm` installs or switches to a specific Flutter version, it downloads a tampered SDK containing malicious code. This code could be injected into the application during the build process. | The application build is compromised, potentially leading to data exfiltration from user devices, remote code execution on user devices, or other malicious activities. | SDK download mechanism within `fvm`, potentially affecting the `fvm install` and `fvm use` commands. | **Critical** | - **Use official Flutter channels:** Ensure `fvm` is configured to use the official Flutter SDK download sources. Avoid using unofficial mirrors. - **Verify SDK integrity (if possible):** While challenging, explore methods to verify the integrity of downloaded SDKs (e.g., comparing hashes if provided by Flutter). - **Secure network connections:** Ensure secure HTTPS connections when `fvm` downloads SDKs. - **Regularly update `fvm`:** Newer versions might include security improvements related to download integrity. |
| **Manipulation of Locally Installed SDKs Managed by FVM** | An attacker gains unauthorized access to a developer's machine and directly modifies the files within the Flutter SDKs managed by `fvm` (located in the `~/.fvm/flutter_sdk` directory or similar). They could inject malicious code into the SDK files, which would then be included in subsequent application builds. | The application build is compromised, potentially leading to data exfiltration from user devices, remote code execution on user devices, or other malicious activities. | File system access and management logic within `fvm`, specifically how it interacts with the installed SDK directories. | **High** | - **Secure developer machines:** Implement strong access controls, regular patching, and security awareness training for developers. - **File integrity monitoring:** Consider using tools to monitor changes to the installed SDK directories and alert on unauthorized modifications. - **Regularly reinstall SDKs (as a drastic measure):** If compromise is suspected, reinstalling the SDK through `fvm` can help ensure a clean state. |
| **Command Injection Vulnerability in FVM Command Execution** | If the application or build scripts directly use `fvm` commands with unsanitized user input, an attacker could inject malicious shell commands that are executed by the system with the privileges of the user running the `fvm` command. | An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the build server or developer machine, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or denial of service. | Command execution logic within `fvm`, specifically when passing arguments to the underlying Flutter CLI. | **High** | - **Avoid direct execution of `fvm` commands with user input:** If necessary, sanitize and validate all user-provided input before using it in `fvm` commands. Use parameterized commands or secure command execution libraries where possible. - **Principle of least privilege:** Run build processes with minimal necessary privileges. |
