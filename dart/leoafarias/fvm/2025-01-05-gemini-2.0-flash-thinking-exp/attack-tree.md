Objective: Gain unauthorized control over the application's environment by exploiting vulnerabilities introduced by the use of FVM.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   **Compromise Application via FVM Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   **High-Risk Path: Manipulate FVM Configuration**
        *   **Critical Node: Modify `fvm_config.json`**
            *   **High-Risk Path: Point to Malicious Flutter SDK Location**
        *   **High-Risk Path: Inject malicious paths into `PATH` to prioritize attacker-controlled Flutter executables**
    *   **High-Risk Path: Exploit the `.fvm/flutter_sdk` Symlink**
        *   **Critical Node: Replace the symlink with a link to a malicious Flutter SDK location**
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via FVM Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_fvm_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*   **Compromise Application via FVM Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node signifies a complete breach of the application's environment through vulnerabilities introduced by FVM.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Manipulate FVM Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_fvm_configuration.md)

*   **High-Risk Path: Manipulate FVM Configuration:**
    *   This path involves subverting FVM's normal operation by altering its configuration settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Modify `fvm_config.json`](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_modify__fvm_config_json_.md)

*   **Critical Node: Modify `fvm_config.json`:**
        *   This involves gaining write access to the `fvm_config.json` file, typically located in the project's root directory.
        *   Attackers can directly edit this file to change the `flutterSdkVersion` value.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Point to Malicious Flutter SDK Location](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_point_to_malicious_flutter_sdk_location.md)

*   **High-Risk Path: Point to Malicious Flutter SDK Location:**
            *   **Download Malicious SDK from Attacker-Controlled Server:** The attacker modifies `fvm_config.json` to point to a URL hosting a compromised Flutter SDK. When FVM attempts to use this version, it downloads and uses the malicious SDK.
            *   **Use Locally Crafted Malicious SDK:** The attacker modifies `fvm_config.json` to point to a directory on the local file system containing a malicious Flutter SDK.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Inject malicious paths into `PATH` to prioritize attacker-controlled Flutter executables](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_malicious_paths_into__path__to_prioritize_attacker-controlled_flutter_executab_01ed55e0.md)

*   **High-Risk Path: Inject malicious paths into `PATH` to prioritize attacker-controlled Flutter executables:**
        *   This involves modifying the system's `PATH` environment variable.
        *   The attacker adds a directory containing malicious Flutter binaries (e.g., `flutter`, `dart`) to the `PATH` *before* the legitimate Flutter SDK paths.
        *   When the application or FVM attempts to execute a Flutter command, the attacker's malicious binary will be executed instead.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit the `.fvm/flutter_sdk` Symlink](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_the___fvmflutter_sdk__symlink.md)

*   **High-Risk Path: Exploit the `.fvm/flutter_sdk` Symlink:**
    *   This path targets the symbolic link (`.fvm/flutter_sdk`) that FVM uses to point to the currently active Flutter SDK version.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Replace the symlink with a link to a malicious Flutter SDK location](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_replace_the_symlink_with_a_link_to_a_malicious_flutter_sdk_location.md)

*   **Critical Node: Replace the symlink with a link to a malicious Flutter SDK location:**
        *   The attacker needs write access to the `.fvm` directory.
        *   They remove the existing `flutter_sdk` symlink.
        *   They create a new symlink named `flutter_sdk` that points to a directory containing a malicious Flutter SDK, either hosted remotely or present locally.
        *   When FVM or the application attempts to use the Flutter SDK, it will be redirected to the malicious version.
