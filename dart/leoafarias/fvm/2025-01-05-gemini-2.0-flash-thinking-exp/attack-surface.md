# Attack Surface Analysis for leoafarias/fvm

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Flutter SDK Downloads](./attack_surfaces/compromised_flutter_sdk_downloads.md)

**Description:** The risk of downloading a malicious Flutter SDK from a compromised source or through a man-in-the-middle attack.

**How FVM Contributes:** FVM's core functionality involves downloading and managing different Flutter SDK versions from remote sources. It relies on the integrity of these sources.

**Example:** An attacker compromises a Flutter mirror site or performs a MITM attack, replacing a legitimate Flutter SDK download with a modified version containing malware. When a developer uses FVM to install this version, their system and subsequent applications built with it are compromised.

**Impact:**  Potentially critical. Could lead to malware infection of developer machines, supply chain attacks affecting applications built with the compromised SDK, data breaches, and unauthorized access.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Verify Download Integrity:**  Implement checks (manual or automated) to verify the checksum or signature of downloaded Flutter SDKs against known good values from official Flutter sources.
* **Use Official Sources:**  Preferentially download Flutter SDKs from the official Flutter repository or trusted, verified mirrors. Avoid using untrusted or unofficial sources.
* **Secure Download Channels:** Ensure that FVM and any related scripts use HTTPS for downloading SDKs to prevent MITM attacks.
* **Network Security:** Implement network security measures to detect and prevent MITM attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Local File System Manipulation via FVM](./attack_surfaces/local_file_system_manipulation_via_fvm.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from how FVM manages files and directories on the local file system.

**How FVM Contributes:** FVM creates and manages directories for different Flutter SDK versions. Incorrect permissions or vulnerabilities in FVM's file handling could be exploited.

**Example:**  An attacker gains write access to the FVM cache directory due to overly permissive file permissions. They could then replace a legitimate Flutter SDK with a malicious one, which would be used when a developer switches to that version using FVM.

**Impact:** High. Could lead to the execution of malicious code, data corruption, or denial of service if critical files are modified or deleted.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Restrict File System Permissions:** Ensure that the FVM cache directory and managed SDK directories have appropriate permissions, limiting write access to authorized users only.
* **Regularly Audit Permissions:** Periodically review the permissions of FVM-related directories to ensure they haven't been inadvertently changed.
* **Keep FVM Updated:** Update FVM to the latest version to benefit from security patches that may address file handling vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Environment Variable Manipulation for Malicious SDKs](./attack_surfaces/environment_variable_manipulation_for_malicious_sdks.md)

**Description:**  Exploiting how FVM modifies the `PATH` environment variable to switch between Flutter SDK versions.

**How FVM Contributes:** FVM directly manipulates the `PATH` environment variable. If an attacker can influence this process through FVM configurations, they could point the system to a malicious Flutter SDK.

**Example:** An attacker compromises a developer's environment and modifies the FVM configuration or a related script to point to a malicious "Flutter SDK" directory. When the developer activates this version using FVM, the system will execute binaries from the attacker's controlled directory.

**Impact:** Critical. Allows for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the commands.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure Development Environments:** Implement strong security measures for development environments, including access controls, malware protection, and regular security audits.
* **Monitor Environment Variable Changes:** Implement monitoring to detect unauthorized changes to environment variables, especially those related to FVM.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run development tools and processes with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via FVM (Potential)](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_fvm__potential_.md)

**Description:**  The possibility of injecting malicious commands if FVM uses user-provided input without proper sanitization when executing shell commands internally.

**How FVM Contributes:** While primarily a version manager, FVM might internally execute Flutter CLI commands. If FVM were to incorporate unsanitized user input into these commands, it could be vulnerable.

**Example:**  Hypothetically, if FVM had a feature that allowed specifying custom arguments for Flutter commands and didn't sanitize these arguments, an attacker could inject malicious shell commands. For instance, `fvm flutter "build apk & rm -rf /"`.

**Impact:** Critical. Could lead to arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or the build server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep FVM Updated:** Ensure FVM is updated to the latest version, which should include fixes for any command injection vulnerabilities.
* **Input Sanitization (FVM Development):**  If contributing to FVM development, ensure all user inputs used in command execution are properly sanitized and validated.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Manipulation (.fvm/fvm_config.json)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_manipulation___fvmfvm_config_json_.md)

**Description:**  The risk of an attacker modifying the FVM configuration file to point to a malicious Flutter SDK.

**How FVM Contributes:** FVM relies on the `fvm_config.json` file to determine the selected Flutter SDK version.

**Example:** An attacker gains write access to the `.fvm` directory and modifies the `fvm_config.json` file to point to a directory containing a malicious "Flutter SDK." When a developer uses FVM to activate or use Flutter, the malicious SDK will be used.

**Impact:** High. Could lead to the execution of malicious code during development or build processes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Restrict File System Permissions:**  Ensure the `.fvm` directory and its contents are not writable by unauthorized users.
* **Monitor Configuration File Changes:** Implement monitoring or version control for the `fvm_config.json` file to detect unauthorized modifications.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Vulnerabilities of FVM Itself](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_vulnerabilities_of_fvm_itself.md)

**Description:** The risk that the FVM tool itself is compromised at its source or during distribution.

**How FVM Contributes:** Developers rely on the integrity of the FVM tool to manage their Flutter SDKs securely. If FVM itself is malicious, it can directly compromise the development process.

**Example:** An attacker compromises the FVM repository or the developer's distribution channel and injects malicious code into the FVM binary or scripts. Developers unknowingly download and use this compromised version, which could then install malicious SDKs or perform other malicious actions.

**Impact:** Critical. Could lead to widespread compromise of developer machines and applications.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Use Trusted Sources:** Download FVM from the official repository or trusted package managers.
* **Verify Integrity:** Verify the integrity of the downloaded FVM binary or package using checksums or signatures provided by the FVM developers.
* **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools to scan dependencies (including FVM) for known vulnerabilities.
