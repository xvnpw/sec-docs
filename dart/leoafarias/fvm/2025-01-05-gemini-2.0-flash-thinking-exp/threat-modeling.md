# Threat Model Analysis for leoafarias/fvm

## Threat: [Malicious SDK Replacement via Compromised Cache](./threats/malicious_sdk_replacement_via_compromised_cache.md)

- **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the FVM cache directory (typically `~/.fvm/versions`) and replaces a legitimate Flutter SDK directory with a malicious one. When a project uses that specific SDK version via `fvm use`, the malicious SDK will be executed during build processes. This directly involves FVM's management of SDK versions.
- **Impact:**  The malicious SDK can inject arbitrary code into the application binary, steal sensitive data from the development environment (e.g., API keys, credentials), or compromise the developer's machine.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Exploiting FVM Tool Vulnerabilities for Arbitrary Code Execution](./threats/exploiting_fvm_tool_vulnerabilities_for_arbitrary_code_execution.md)

- **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a vulnerability within the FVM tool itself (e.g., a command injection flaw in how FVM handles user input or external commands). This directly involves a security flaw in the FVM application.
- **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the developer's machine with the privileges of the user running FVM. This could lead to data theft, malware installation, or complete system compromise.
- **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Compromised FVM Configuration Leading to Malicious SDK Usage](./threats/compromised_fvm_configuration_leading_to_malicious_sdk_usage.md)

- **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the FVM configuration file (`.fvm/fvm_config.json` or similar) within a project. They modify this file to point to a malicious Flutter SDK that has been previously placed in the FVM cache or a remote location. When developers build or run the project, the malicious SDK will be used. This directly involves FVM's configuration mechanism.
- **Impact:** Similar to malicious SDK replacement, this can lead to code injection, data theft, and compromise of the development environment.
- **Risk Severity:** High
