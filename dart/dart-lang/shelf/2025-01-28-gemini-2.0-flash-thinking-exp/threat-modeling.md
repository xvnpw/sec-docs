# Threat Model Analysis for dart-lang/shelf

## Threat: [Middleware Ordering Vulnerabilities](./threats/middleware_ordering_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit incorrect middleware order to bypass security checks or gain unauthorized access. For example, if logging middleware is before authentication, an attacker could send requests and have sensitive information logged even if they are unauthenticated. Or, if input sanitization middleware is after a vulnerable processing middleware, the sanitization might be ineffective.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access, data leakage, security bypass, application compromise.
*   **Shelf Component Affected:** Middleware chain, `Handler` composition.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully design and document middleware order.
    *   Thoroughly test middleware chains, especially security-related middleware.
    *   Use static analysis tools to detect potential ordering issues.
    *   Implement integration tests to verify expected middleware behavior.

## Threat: [Malicious Middleware Injection](./threats/malicious_middleware_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could compromise a dependency or inject malicious code into custom middleware. This allows them to execute arbitrary code within the application context, potentially gaining full control, stealing data, or causing denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Full application compromise, data breach, denial of service, reputational damage.
*   **Shelf Component Affected:** Middleware, dependency management, `Handler` execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly vet and audit all middleware dependencies, especially third-party ones.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in middleware dependencies.
    *   Implement code reviews for custom middleware.
    *   Use strong access controls to prevent unauthorized modification of middleware code.
    *   Employ runtime application self-protection (RASP) or similar technologies to detect and prevent malicious middleware behavior.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Middleware Component](./threats/vulnerable_middleware_component.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in a used middleware component. This could be a third-party library or custom middleware with coding flaws. Exploitation could lead to various attacks depending on the vulnerability, such as remote code execution, cross-site scripting (XSS), or SQL injection if the middleware interacts with databases.
*   **Impact:**  Data breach, unauthorized access, remote code execution, cross-site scripting, denial of service.
*   **Shelf Component Affected:** Middleware, specific middleware library or code.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep all middleware dependencies up-to-date with security patches.
    *   Regularly scan middleware dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanners.
    *   Implement secure coding practices when developing custom middleware.
    *   Conduct penetration testing and security audits to identify vulnerabilities in middleware.

## Threat: [Unsafe Route Parameter Handling in Handlers](./threats/unsafe_route_parameter_handling_in_handlers.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker could manipulate route parameters to exploit vulnerabilities in handler logic. While `shelf` itself doesn't introduce injection, handlers might unsafely use route parameters in database queries, file system operations, or external API calls, leading to injection attacks (SQL injection, path traversal, etc.).
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access, remote code execution, file system access.
*   **Shelf Component Affected:** Route handlers, application logic within handlers, `shelf_router` parameter extraction.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all route parameters within handler functions.
    *   Use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection.
    *   Avoid directly using route parameters in file paths without proper validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal.
    *   Implement input validation libraries and practices.

## Threat: [Exposure of Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive configuration files if they are improperly secured or placed in publicly accessible locations. This could expose secrets, database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to systems, application compromise.
*   **Shelf Component Affected:** Application deployment, configuration management, file system access.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store configuration files outside the web application's document root.
    *   Use environment variables or secure configuration management systems for sensitive data.
    *   Restrict access to configuration files using file system permissions.
    *   Avoid committing sensitive configuration files to version control.
