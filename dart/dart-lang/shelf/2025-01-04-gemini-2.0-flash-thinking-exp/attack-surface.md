# Attack Surface Analysis for dart-lang/shelf

## Attack Surface: [Improper Request Parameter Handling](./attack_surfaces/improper_request_parameter_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Application handlers do not adequately validate or sanitize data received through request parameters (query parameters, path parameters).
    *   **How Shelf Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `shelf`'s `Request` object provides direct access to these parameters via `request.uri.queryParameters` and through routing libraries that extract path parameters. If handlers directly use these values without validation, they become vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A handler retrieves a user ID from a query parameter (`/users?id=`). Without validation, an attacker could provide a malicious ID like `'; DROP TABLE users; --` leading to a SQL injection if this value is used in a database query.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, potential for remote code execution depending on how the unsanitized input is used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation within handlers, checking data types, formats, and allowed values.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Sanitize input data by encoding or escaping special characters before using them in sensitive operations.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Request Body](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_request_body.md)

*   **Description:** Application handlers automatically deserialize request bodies (e.g., JSON, XML) without proper validation or using insecure deserialization methods.
    *   **How Shelf Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `shelf` provides access to the request body as a `Stream<List<int>>`. Libraries built on top of `shelf` often provide utilities for deserializing this stream into objects. If these deserialization processes are not secure, they can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A handler using `dart:convert` to decode JSON might be vulnerable if the incoming JSON contains malicious code or unexpected object structures that exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization process, potentially leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid automatic deserialization of untrusted data.
        *   Implement strict schema validation for incoming data before deserialization.
        *   Use secure deserialization libraries and keep them updated.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** Developers implement custom middleware with security flaws.
    *   **How Shelf Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `shelf`'s middleware mechanism allows developers to intercept and process requests and responses. Vulnerabilities in this custom code directly expand the application's attack surface.
    *   **Example:** Custom middleware intended to authorize requests might have a flaw that allows bypassing the authorization check under certain conditions.
    *   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability in the middleware, including authentication bypass, authorization flaws, data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Apply secure coding practices when developing custom middleware.
        *   Thoroughly test custom middleware for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Conduct code reviews of custom middleware.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal in Static File Serving](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_in_static_file_serving.md)

*   **Description:** If using `shelf_static` or similar for serving static files, improper configuration can allow attackers to access files outside the intended directory.
    *   **How Shelf Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `shelf_static` builds upon `shelf` to provide static file serving, utilizing `shelf`'s request handling. If the root directory for serving files is not properly restricted or if file paths are not sanitized, path traversal vulnerabilities can occur.
    *   **Example:** The application serves files from a `/public` directory. An attacker could request `/../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to access sensitive system files.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files, potential for further system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure the root directory for static file serving to be the least privileged directory necessary.
        *   Avoid allowing user-provided input to directly influence the file paths being served.
        *   Use `safe_url` or similar mechanisms to sanitize file paths.
