# Threat Model Analysis for dart-lang/shelf

## Threat: [Path Traversal](./threats/path_traversal.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing sequences like `..` or absolute paths to try and access files or directories outside the web application's intended root directory. The application uses the raw path provided by `shelf.Request` without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories on the server, potentially leading to data breaches, configuration leaks, or the ability to execute arbitrary code if write access is gained.

**Affected Shelf Component:** `shelf.Request.url.path` (the property providing the requested path).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the path received from `shelf.Request.url.path`.
*   Use the `package:path` library for secure path manipulation and joining.
*   Avoid directly using user-provided paths to access files. Instead, map validated user input to internal resource identifiers.
*   Enforce strict access controls on the file system.

## Threat: [Large Request Body Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/large_request_body_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends excessively large HTTP request bodies to the server. If the application doesn't implement limits on request body size, the server might consume excessive resources (memory, processing power), leading to performance degradation or service unavailability. `shelf` by default buffers the request body in memory.

**Impact:**  Service disruption or complete unavailability due to resource exhaustion.

**Affected Shelf Component:** `shelf.Request.read()` or accessing `shelf.Request.body` which buffers the entire request body.

**Risk Severity:** Medium *(Note: While previously marked Medium, the direct involvement of `shelf`'s buffering behavior and potential for significant impact might warrant considering this High in some contexts. However, the mitigation primarily lies on the application side.)*

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement middleware to enforce limits on the maximum allowed request body size.
*   Consider using streaming request handling (using `shelf.Request.read()` as a stream) and processing data in chunks to avoid loading the entire body into memory at once.
*   Configure web server or load balancer limits to restrict incoming request sizes.

## Threat: [Middleware Ordering Issues Leading to Security Bypass](./threats/middleware_ordering_issues_leading_to_security_bypass.md)

**Description:** The order in which middleware is added to the `shelf.Pipeline` is incorrect, allowing attackers to bypass security checks. For example, authentication middleware placed after a middleware serving static files could allow unauthorized access to those files.

**Impact:**  Bypassing authentication and authorization mechanisms, leading to unauthorized access to resources or functionalities.

**Affected Shelf Component:** `shelf.Pipeline` and the order in which `addMiddleware` is called.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully plan and document the order of middleware execution in the `Pipeline`.
*   Ensure security-critical middleware (authentication, authorization, input validation) is executed early in the pipeline.
*   Thoroughly test the middleware pipeline to ensure the intended order of execution and security checks.

## Threat: [Bypassing Security Middleware via Multiple Handlers](./threats/bypassing_security_middleware_via_multiple_handlers.md)

**Description:** The application defines multiple `Handler` instances, and security middleware is not consistently applied to all of them. Attackers might find routes handled by unprotected handlers, bypassing intended security measures.

**Impact:**  Circumventing security controls, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.

**Affected Shelf Component:** `shelf.Handler` and the mechanism for combining and routing requests to different handlers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure that security middleware is applied consistently to all relevant `Handler` instances.
*   Consider using a single `Pipeline` for the entire application or carefully manage the application of middleware across different routes.
*   Use routing libraries that provide mechanisms for applying middleware to groups of routes.
