## Deep Analysis: Header Injection via Malformed Headers in a Shelf Application

This document provides a detailed analysis of the "Header Injection via Malformed Headers" attack path within a Shelf application, as requested. We will explore the vulnerability, its potential impact, specific scenarios within a Shelf context, and recommended mitigation strategies.

**Attack Tree Path:**

**Attack: Header Injection via Malformed Headers**

*   **Condition:** Application or middleware processes headers without strict validation, allowing injection of control characters or unexpected data.
*   **Action:** Send a request with crafted headers that manipulate downstream processing (e.g., HTTP Response Splitting if forwarded to another service).

**Detailed Analysis:**

This attack path hinges on the principle of **insufficient input validation**. HTTP headers are structured as key-value pairs, separated by colons and newlines (CRLF - Carriage Return Line Feed). If an application or a piece of middleware doesn't properly sanitize or validate these headers, an attacker can inject malicious content by including control characters like newline characters (`\r`, `\n`) or other unexpected data within the header values.

**Breakdown of the Vulnerability:**

1. **Lack of Strict Validation:** The core issue is the absence or inadequacy of checks on incoming HTTP header values. This could manifest in several ways:
    * **Ignoring Control Characters:** The application or middleware might simply ignore or strip control characters without properly rejecting the request. This can still lead to unexpected behavior.
    * **Insufficient Sanitization:**  Attempting to sanitize by replacing certain characters might be flawed or incomplete, leaving loopholes for attackers.
    * **Assuming Correct Formatting:** The code might assume that all incoming headers adhere to the expected format without any validation.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries:** While Shelf itself provides tools for handling headers, vulnerabilities could exist in lower-level libraries used for parsing or processing HTTP requests.

2. **Injection of Control Characters:** Attackers leverage this lack of validation to inject control characters, primarily CRLF (`\r\n`). This is crucial for attacks like HTTP Response Splitting.

3. **Downstream Manipulation:** The injected control characters can then be interpreted by downstream systems (other servers, proxies, browsers) in unintended ways. This is where the real damage occurs.

**Specific Scenarios in a Shelf Application:**

Let's consider how this attack path could manifest in a Shelf application:

* **Directly in the Shelf Handler:** While less likely with direct usage of Shelf's `Response` object for setting headers, vulnerabilities could arise if the application logic manually constructs header strings without proper escaping. For example:

   ```dart
   import 'dart:io';
   import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';

   Response handler(Request request) {
     final maliciousHeaderValue = request.headers['X-Malicious'];
     if (maliciousHeaderValue != null) {
       // Vulnerable code: Directly incorporating user input into a header
       return Response.ok('Hello', headers: {
         'Custom-Header': 'User Value: $maliciousHeaderValue'
       });
     }
     return Response.ok('Hello');
   }
   ```

   If `maliciousHeaderValue` contains `\r\nEvil-Header: Malicious Value`, this could lead to header injection in the response.

* **Through Middleware:** Middleware is a more common point of vulnerability. Consider these examples:
    * **Logging Middleware:** Middleware that logs request headers might be susceptible if it doesn't properly escape or sanitize the header values before logging. An injected CRLF could corrupt log entries or even lead to log injection vulnerabilities.
    * **Authentication/Authorization Middleware:**  If authentication middleware relies on specific header values and doesn't validate them rigorously, attackers might inject headers to bypass authentication or escalate privileges.
    * **Reverse Proxy/Forwarding Middleware:** This is the most critical scenario for HTTP Response Splitting. If a Shelf application acts as a reverse proxy and forwards requests to other services, a malformed header in the incoming request could be forwarded without proper sanitization. The downstream service might then interpret the injected CRLF as the end of the headers and the beginning of the response body, leading to HTTP Response Splitting.

* **Interaction with External Services:** If the Shelf application makes requests to external services and constructs headers based on user input without proper validation, it could inject malicious headers into the outgoing request.

**Example: HTTP Response Splitting via Forwarding Middleware**

Imagine a simplified proxy middleware:

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Middleware createProxyMiddleware(String targetUrl) {
  return (innerHandler) {
    return (request) async {
      final client = http.Client();
      try {
        final forwardedRequest = http.Request(request.method, Uri.parse('$targetUrl${request.url.path}'));
        request.headers.forEach((name, value) {
          forwardedRequest.headers[name] = value; // Potentially vulnerable line
        });
        final response = await client.send(forwardedRequest);
        return Response(
          response.statusCode,
          body: await response.stream.bytesToString(),
          headers: response.headers,
        );
      } finally {
        client.close();
      }
    };
  };
}
```

If a request to the Shelf application includes a header like:

```
X-Forwarded-For: attacker.com\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n<html><body>Injected Content</body></html>
```

The `forwardedRequest.headers[name] = value;` line will blindly forward this malicious header. The downstream server might interpret the injected CRLF sequences, leading to the following response being sent to the client:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
... other headers ...
X-Forwarded-For: attacker.com
Content-Length: 0

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

<html><body>Injected Content</body></html>
```

The browser might process the injected HTML, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other malicious actions.

**Impact Assessment:**

The impact of Header Injection via Malformed Headers can range from minor inconveniences to severe security breaches:

* **HTTP Response Splitting:** This is the most well-known consequence. Attackers can inject arbitrary HTTP responses, leading to:
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious JavaScript.
    * **Cache Poisoning:**  Causing proxies or browsers to cache malicious content.
    * **Page Hijacking:** Displaying attacker-controlled content.
* **Security Bypass:** Manipulating authentication or authorization headers to gain unauthorized access.
* **Information Disclosure:** Injecting headers that reveal internal server information or configurations.
* **Log Injection:** Corrupting or manipulating log files, potentially hiding malicious activity.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Injecting headers that cause errors or crashes in downstream systems.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively prevent Header Injection via Malformed Headers in a Shelf application, the following strategies are crucial:

* **Strict Input Validation:**
    * **Reject Invalid Characters:**  Implement strict validation on all incoming header values. Reject requests containing control characters (especially CRLF) or other unexpected data.
    * **Regular Expression Matching:** Use regular expressions to enforce the expected format of headers.
    * **Whitelist Allowed Characters:** Define a set of allowed characters for header values and reject anything outside that set.

* **Output Encoding/Escaping:**
    * **Encode Header Values:** When setting headers programmatically, ensure that any user-provided data is properly encoded to prevent the interpretation of control characters. Dart's `Uri.encodeComponent()` can be helpful for encoding parts of header values.
    * **Use Framework Provided Methods:** Rely on Shelf's `Response` object and its methods for setting headers, as these often include built-in safeguards.

* **Middleware Security:**
    * **Review and Audit Middleware:** Carefully select and review all middleware used in the application. Ensure that they handle headers securely.
    * **Sanitize in Middleware:** Implement middleware specifically designed to sanitize incoming headers before they reach the application logic.
    * **Avoid Blind Forwarding:** If the application acts as a proxy, avoid blindly forwarding headers. Carefully select which headers to forward and sanitize their values.

* **Security Headers:**
    * **Implement Security Headers:** Utilize HTTP security headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `X-Content-Type-Options` to mitigate the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

* **Regular Updates:**
    * **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Ensure that Shelf and all its dependencies are updated to the latest versions to patch any known vulnerabilities.

* **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Regularly Assess Security:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including header injection flaws.

* **Framework Features:**
    * **Leverage Shelf's Capabilities:** While Shelf provides basic mechanisms for handling headers, understand its limitations and ensure you're using its features correctly.

**Conclusion:**

Header Injection via Malformed Headers is a significant security risk for Shelf applications, particularly when interacting with middleware or external services. By implementing strict input validation, proper output encoding, and carefully reviewing middleware, development teams can significantly reduce the attack surface and protect their applications from this type of vulnerability. A proactive approach to security, including regular audits and updates, is crucial for maintaining a secure Shelf application.
