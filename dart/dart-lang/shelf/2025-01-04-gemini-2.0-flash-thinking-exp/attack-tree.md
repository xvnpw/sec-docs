## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Middleware Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_middleware_exploitation.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within the application's middleware layer.
    *   **Attack: Middleware Order Dependence Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)**
        *   Condition: Security-relevant middleware is placed after vulnerable or exploitable middleware, allowing bypass.
        *   Action: Craft a request that exploits a vulnerability in an earlier middleware stage, bypassing security checks in later stages.
    *   **Attack: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware (Critical Node)**
        *   Condition: Application uses custom middleware with security flaws (e.g., injection vulnerabilities, authentication bypass).
        *   Action: Target vulnerabilities within the custom middleware logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Shelf Response Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_shelf_response_handling.md)

*   This path focuses on manipulating the application's responses to inject malicious content or disclose sensitive information.
    *   **Attack: Header Manipulation in Responses (Critical Node)**
        *   Condition: Application logic directly manipulates response headers using `response.headers` without proper escaping or validation.
        *   Action: Inject malicious headers into the response, potentially leading to XSS or other client-side vulnerabilities.
    *   **Attack: Body Manipulation in Responses via Handlers (Critical Node)**
        *   Condition: Application logic within handlers generates response bodies without proper encoding or sanitization.
        *   Action: Inject malicious scripts or content into the response body, leading to XSS or other client-side vulnerabilities (while the handler logic is the primary cause, `shelf` facilitates the delivery).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Interactions with Underlying Server (Less Direct Shelf Issue)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_interactions_with_underlying_server__less_direct_shelf_issue_.md)

*   This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the interaction between `shelf` and the underlying HTTP server.
    *   **Attack: HTTP Desync Vulnerabilities (If Shelf is used with a vulnerable server)**
        *   Condition: Mismatched interpretation of HTTP requests between `shelf` and the underlying HTTP server.
        *   Action: Craft requests that cause the server and `shelf` to disagree on request boundaries, leading to request smuggling and potential access to other users' requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Header Injection via Malformed Headers](./attack_tree_paths/header_injection_via_malformed_headers.md)

*   **Attack: Header Injection via Malformed Headers**
    *   Condition: Application or middleware processes headers without strict validation, allowing injection of control characters or unexpected data.
    *   Action: Send a request with crafted headers that manipulate downstream processing (e.g., HTTP Response Splitting if forwarded to another service).

## Attack Tree Path: [Middleware Order Dependence Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/middleware_order_dependence_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack: Middleware Order Dependence Vulnerabilities** (Described above in High-Risk Path)
        *   Condition: Security-relevant middleware is placed after vulnerable or exploitable middleware, allowing bypass.
        *   Action: Craft a request that exploits a vulnerability in an earlier middleware stage, bypassing security checks in later stages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_custom_middleware.md)

*   **Attack: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware** (Described above in High-Risk Path)
        *   Condition: Application uses custom middleware with security flaws (e.g., injection vulnerabilities, authentication bypass).
        *   Action: Target vulnerabilities within the custom middleware logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Header Manipulation in Responses](./attack_tree_paths/header_manipulation_in_responses.md)

*   **Attack: Header Manipulation in Responses** (Described above in High-Risk Path)
        *   Condition: Application logic directly manipulates response headers using `response.headers` without proper escaping or validation.
        *   Action: Inject malicious headers into the response, potentially leading to XSS or other client-side vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Body Manipulation in Responses via Handlers](./attack_tree_paths/body_manipulation_in_responses_via_handlers.md)

*   **Attack: Body Manipulation in Responses via Handlers** (Described above in High-Risk Path)
        *   Condition: Application logic within handlers generates response bodies without proper encoding or sanitization.
        *   Action: Inject malicious scripts or content into the response body, leading to XSS or other client-side vulnerabilities (while the handler logic is the primary cause, `shelf` facilitates the delivery).
