# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dart-lang/shelf

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation Middleware (Shelf Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation_middleware__shelf_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Develop a custom `shelf` Middleware Function:** Create a Dart function that conforms to the `shelf` `Middleware` type. This function will intercept `shelf` `Handler` calls.
    2.  **Access Request Data within Middleware:** Inside the middleware, use the `Request` object provided by `shelf` to access request headers, query parameters (`request.url.queryParameters`), and request body (`request.readAsString()`).
    3.  **Implement Sanitization and Validation Logic:** Within the middleware function, write Dart code to sanitize and validate the extracted request data. Utilize Dart's string manipulation, regular expressions, and data type checking capabilities.
        *   **Example Sanitization:**  Use `htmlEscape` from `dart:convert` for HTML escaping, or custom functions to remove or encode special characters.
        *   **Example Validation:** Use `int.tryParse`, `double.tryParse`, regular expressions (`RegExp`), or custom validation functions to check data types, formats, and ranges.
    4.  **Construct Validated Request or Reject Request:**
        *   **If Validation Passes:**  Allow the request to proceed down the `shelf` pipeline by calling the inner `Handler` provided to the middleware. You can optionally modify the `Request` object (though generally not recommended for sanitization middleware, prefer creating a new validated data object to pass along).
        *   **If Validation Fails:**  Return a `shelf` `Response` directly from the middleware. Use appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `Response.badRequest`) and provide informative error messages in the response body.
    5.  **Integrate Middleware into Shelf Pipeline:** Use `Cascade` or `Pipeline` from `shelf` to insert this custom middleware at the beginning of your application's request handling chain, ensuring it processes requests before any handlers.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity:** Sanitization within `shelf` middleware prevents injection of malicious scripts processed by `shelf` handlers and rendered in user browsers.
    *   **SQL Injection - High Severity:** Input validation in `shelf` middleware reduces the risk of SQL injection if handlers use validated data to construct database queries.
    *   **Command Injection - High Severity:**  `Shelf` middleware validation helps prevent command injection if handlers execute system commands based on validated input.
    *   **Path Traversal - Medium Severity:** Validation in `shelf` middleware can restrict access to unauthorized paths if handlers process file paths from validated input.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues - Medium Severity:** `Shelf` middleware validation ensures data processed by `shelf` handlers conforms to expected formats, improving data integrity within the application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS - High Reduction:**  `Shelf` middleware based sanitization effectively reduces XSS risks within the application's scope.
    *   **SQL Injection - High Reduction:**  `Shelf` middleware validation, when combined with secure database practices in handlers, significantly reduces SQL injection risks.
    *   **Command Injection - High Reduction:** `Shelf` middleware validation, when handlers avoid direct command execution with user input, greatly reduces command injection risks.
    *   **Path Traversal - Medium Reduction:** `Shelf` middleware validation can effectively reduce path traversal risks within the application's file handling logic.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues - Medium Reduction:** `Shelf` middleware validation improves data quality and reduces errors in data processed by `shelf` application logic.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in the project using `shelf`.
    *   Some handlers have input validation logic directly within them, but this is not consistently applied as `shelf` middleware.
    *   No dedicated `shelf` middleware for global input sanitization and validation is currently used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Dedicated `shelf` Middleware:** Need to create a reusable `shelf` `Middleware` component for input sanitization and validation.
    *   **Centralized Validation Rules in Middleware:**  Move existing validation logic from individual handlers into the dedicated `shelf` middleware for consistent application-wide input handling.
    *   **Comprehensive Request Data Handling in Middleware:**  Ensure the `shelf` middleware handles validation for all relevant parts of the `shelf` `Request` object (headers, query parameters, body).

## Mitigation Strategy: [HTTPS Enforcement via `shelf.serve` and `SecurityContext`](./mitigation_strategies/https_enforcement_via__shelf_serve__and__securitycontext_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain SSL/TLS Certificate and Key:** Acquire an SSL/TLS certificate and private key for your domain. This can be obtained from a Certificate Authority or using Let's Encrypt.
    2.  **Create a `SecurityContext` in Dart:** Use Dart's `SecurityContext` class to load your SSL/TLS certificate and private key.
        ```dart
        import 'dart:io';

        final securityContext = SecurityContext()
          ..useCertificateChain('path/to/your_certificate.pem')
          ..usePrivateKey('path/to/your_private_key.pem');
        ```
    3.  **Configure `shelf.serve` with `SecurityContext`:** When using `shelf.serve` to start your `shelf` application, provide the created `SecurityContext` as an argument. This tells `shelf` to use HTTPS.
        ```dart
        import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';
        import 'package:shelf/shelf_io.dart' as io;

        void main() async {
          final handler = ... // Your shelf handler
          await io.serve(handler, '0.0.0.0', 443, securityContext: securityContext);
          print('Serving at https://localhost:443');
        }
        ```
    4.  **Handle HTTP to HTTPS Redirection (Optional, but Recommended):**  While `shelf.serve` with `SecurityContext` enables HTTPS, it doesn't automatically redirect HTTP to HTTPS. For redirection, you can:
        *   **Use Reverse Proxy:** Configure a reverse proxy (like Nginx) in front of your `shelf` application to handle HTTP to HTTPS redirection. This is the more common and recommended approach for production deployments.
        *   **Implement Redirection Middleware in `shelf`:** Create a `shelf` middleware that checks if the request is HTTP and redirects it to the HTTPS equivalent URL.
    5.  **Configure HSTS Headers (via `shelf` Middleware or Reverse Proxy):** To enable HSTS, you can either:
        *   **Set HSTS Header in `shelf` Middleware:** Create a `shelf` middleware to add the `Strict-Transport-Security` header to `shelf` `Response` objects.
        *   **Configure HSTS in Reverse Proxy:** If using a reverse proxy, configure it to add the HSTS header. This is often simpler to manage in the reverse proxy configuration.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks - High Severity:** Using `shelf.serve` with `SecurityContext` enables HTTPS encryption, preventing MITM attacks on connections handled directly by `shelf`.
    *   **Data Tampering - High Severity:** HTTPS via `shelf.serve` ensures data integrity for traffic directly served by `shelf`.
    *   **Session Hijacking - High Severity:** HTTPS via `shelf.serve` protects session cookies for connections directly handled by `shelf`.
    *   **Phishing Attacks - Medium Severity:** HTTPS indicator provided by browsers for `shelf` served content can offer some protection against phishing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **MITM Attacks - High Reduction:**  Directly serving HTTPS with `shelf.serve` and `SecurityContext` effectively eliminates MITM risks for those connections.
    *   **Data Tampering - High Reduction:**  HTTPS via `shelf.serve` provides strong data integrity for direct `shelf` serving.
    *   **Session Hijacking - High Reduction:** HTTPS via `shelf.serve` significantly reduces session hijacking risks for direct `shelf` connections.
    *   **Phishing Attacks - Low Reduction:**  HTTPS indicator for `shelf` served content offers limited phishing protection.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   HTTPS is implemented in the production environment, but not directly via `shelf.serve` and `SecurityContext`.
    *   HTTPS is terminated at a reverse proxy (load balancer) in front of the `shelf` application.
    *   `shelf` application itself is likely running on HTTP internally.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Direct HTTPS Serving with `shelf.serve`:**  Project is not currently configured to use `shelf.serve` with `SecurityContext` for direct HTTPS serving.
    *   **HSTS Header Configuration (in `shelf` or Reverse Proxy):** HSTS header is not currently configured, either in `shelf` middleware or the reverse proxy.
    *   **HTTP to HTTPS Redirection Middleware (in `shelf` if needed):** If direct `shelf.serve` HTTPS is implemented, consider adding `shelf` middleware for HTTP to HTTPS redirection if a reverse proxy is not handling it.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting Middleware (Shelf Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_middleware__shelf_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Rate Limiting Storage Mechanism:** Decide how to store request counts for rate limiting. Options include:
        *   **In-Memory (SimpleCache from `package:simple_cache` or similar):** Suitable for single-instance deployments or development, but not scalable across multiple instances.
        *   **External Cache (Redis, Memcached):** Scalable and persistent, suitable for production environments with multiple instances. Requires adding a dependency and configuring connection.
        *   **Database:** Persistent, but potentially slower than cache for rate limiting checks.
    2.  **Implement a `shelf` Rate Limiting Middleware:** Create a Dart function that is a `shelf` `Middleware`. This middleware will:
        *   **Identify Client:** Determine how to identify clients (e.g., using `request.clientIp`, session ID from `shelf_session`, or API key).
        *   **Access Rate Limit Storage:**  Retrieve the request count for the client from the chosen storage mechanism.
        *   **Increment Request Count:** Increment the request count in storage for the client.
        *   **Check Rate Limit:** Compare the incremented request count against the defined rate limit for the time window.
        *   **Handle Rate Limit Exceeded:**
            *   If limit exceeded, return a `shelf` `Response` with 429 Too Many Requests status.
            *   Set `Retry-After` header in the `shelf` `Response` to indicate when the client can retry.
        *   **Allow Request if Within Limit:** If within limit, call the inner `Handler` to proceed with request processing.
    3.  **Configure Rate Limits in Middleware:** Make rate limits configurable (e.g., requests per minute, per hour) within the middleware, potentially using environment variables or configuration files.
    4.  **Apply Rate Limiting Middleware in `shelf` Pipeline:** Use `Cascade` or `Pipeline` to insert the rate limiting middleware early in your `shelf` application's request handling pipeline. You can apply it globally or selectively to specific routes using `shelf_router`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks - High Severity:** `Shelf` middleware based rate limiting protects `shelf` applications from DoS attacks by limiting request rates handled by `shelf`.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks - Medium Severity:** Rate limiting in `shelf` middleware slows down brute-force attempts targeting authentication endpoints handled by `shelf`.
    *   **Application Resource Exhaustion - Medium Severity:** `Shelf` middleware rate limiting prevents excessive requests from overwhelming `shelf` application resources.
    *   **Web Scraping - Low Severity:** `Shelf` middleware rate limiting can deter basic web scraping of content served by `shelf`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS Attacks - High Reduction:** `Shelf` middleware rate limiting provides a significant reduction in the impact of DoS attacks on the `shelf` application.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks - Medium Reduction:** `Shelf` middleware rate limiting makes brute-force attacks against `shelf` handled endpoints less effective.
    *   **Application Resource Exhaustion - Medium Reduction:** `Shelf` middleware rate limiting helps maintain `shelf` application stability under heavy load.
    *   **Web Scraping - Low Reduction:** `Shelf` middleware rate limiting offers limited protection against sophisticated web scraping.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented in the project using `shelf` middleware.
    *   No rate limiting is currently applied at the `shelf` application level.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **`shelf` Rate Limiting Middleware Implementation:** Need to develop a custom `shelf` `Middleware` for rate limiting.
    *   **Rate Limit Storage Integration:** Choose and integrate a storage mechanism (in-memory, Redis, etc.) for the `shelf` rate limiting middleware.
    *   **Rate Limit Configuration for `shelf` Middleware:** Define and configure appropriate rate limits within the `shelf` middleware for different routes or request types.
    *   **Integration into `shelf` Pipeline:**  Add the newly created rate limiting `shelf` middleware to the application's `shelf` pipeline.
