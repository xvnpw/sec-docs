## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Middleware Misconfiguration [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_middleware_misconfiguration__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This represents a broad category of attacks where the attacker takes advantage of incorrectly configured or implemented middleware within the `shelf` application. Middleware, in `shelf`, are components that can intercept and process HTTP requests and responses before they reach the main application handler. Misconfigurations can lead to a variety of security issues.
*   **Why Critical:** Successful exploitation of middleware misconfigurations can give an attacker significant control over the application's request/response flow, potentially bypassing security mechanisms entirely.
*   **Sub-Attack Vectors (High-Risk):**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Bypass Authentication Middleware [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_bypass_authentication_middleware__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a specific, high-impact instance of middleware misconfiguration. The attacker exploits flaws in the authentication middleware to gain access to protected resources without valid credentials. This could be due to:
    *   Logic errors in the middleware's code.
    *   Incorrect handling of authentication tokens (e.g., accepting expired tokens, weak signature verification).
    *   Improper path matching (e.g., the middleware doesn't protect all intended routes).
    *   Incorrect order of middleware execution (e.g., authentication happens *after* authorization).
    *   Use of weak cryptographic primitives.
*   **Why Critical:** Bypassing authentication is a direct path to unauthorized access, often granting the attacker the same privileges as a legitimate user.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thorough code review of the authentication middleware.
    *   Comprehensive unit and integration testing, including negative test cases.
    *   Fuzz testing to send unexpected inputs.
    *   Use of well-established authentication libraries within the middleware.
    *   Ensure correct middleware ordering.
    *   Regular security audits.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Leverage Handler Vulnerabilities (partially - focusing on Input Validation)](./attack_tree_paths/2__leverage_handler_vulnerabilities__partially_-_focusing_on_input_validation_.md)

*   **Sub-Attack Vectors (High-Risk):**

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Input Validation Bypass in Handlers [CRITICAL] (e.g., SQLi, XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_input_validation_bypass_in_handlers__critical___e_g___sqli__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack focuses on vulnerabilities within the application's handlers (the functions that process requests and generate responses) that arise from insufficient or incorrect input validation.  `shelf` itself doesn't handle input validation; it's the developer's responsibility.  The attacker sends crafted input that exploits these weaknesses.  The most critical types of input validation bypass are:
    *   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into input fields, allowing them to manipulate database queries, potentially reading, modifying, or deleting data.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into input fields, which is then executed in the browsers of other users, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the website.
*   **Why Critical (in the context of SQLi and XSS):** These specific types of input validation bypass can lead to severe consequences, including data breaches (SQLi) and compromise of user accounts (XSS).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (specifically High for SQLi and XSS)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation in *all* handlers. Validate data types, lengths, formats, and allowed characters. Use a whitelist approach whenever possible.
    *   Use parameterized queries or an ORM to prevent SQL injection. *Never* construct SQL queries by concatenating user input.
    *   Properly encode output to prevent XSS. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML encoding for HTML output, JavaScript encoding for JavaScript output).
    *   Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS.
    *   Regular security audits and penetration testing.
