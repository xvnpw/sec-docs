# Threat Model Analysis for dart-lang/shelf

## Threat: [Middleware Authentication Bypass](./threats/middleware_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Middleware Authentication Bypass

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious request that bypasses authentication checks implemented in custom middleware. This exploits incorrect middleware ordering, logic flaws, or vulnerabilities in how the middleware interacts with `shelf.Request` and `shelf.Response` objects. The attacker might manipulate headers, cookies, or exploit timing issues specific to the middleware's interaction with the Shelf pipeline.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, data breaches, impersonation of legitimate users, and potential for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Shelf Component:** Custom `Middleware` implementations, specifically those handling authentication. The `shelf.Pipeline` is directly involved due to the ordering and execution of middleware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure middleware is ordered correctly within the `shelf.Pipeline`, with authentication *before* authorization or data access.
        *   Thoroughly test authentication middleware with various attack vectors, focusing on how it handles `shelf.Request` properties and generates `shelf.Response` objects.
        *   Use secure session management techniques, validating that the middleware correctly handles session tokens within `shelf.Request` and `shelf.Response`.

## Threat: [Handler Hijacking via Routing](./threats/handler_hijacking_via_routing.md)

*   **Threat:** Handler Hijacking via Routing

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request URL that, due to overly permissive routing rules defined using `shelf.Router`, matches an unintended handler. The attacker exploits how `shelf.Router` matches paths and extracts parameters, potentially leading to unexpected handler execution.
    *   **Impact:** Access to unintended functionality, exposure of sensitive data, triggering of unauthorized actions.
    *   **Affected Shelf Component:** The `shelf.Router` component and its routing logic. This directly involves how `shelf.Router` processes `shelf.Request` objects to determine the appropriate handler.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use precise and restrictive routing rules within `shelf.Router`. Avoid overly broad regular expressions or wildcard matches.
        *   Prefer specific path matching over regular expressions when feasible.
        *   Thoroughly test all routing paths defined in `shelf.Router`, including edge cases and unexpected inputs, to ensure correct handler mapping.

## Threat: [Malicious Middleware Data Tampering](./threats/malicious_middleware_data_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Middleware Data Tampering

    *   **Description:** A malicious or compromised third-party middleware modifies `shelf.Request` or `shelf.Response` data in an unauthorized way. This could involve injecting malicious content, altering data values, or corrupting data integrity by manipulating the request/response objects passed through the `shelf.Pipeline`.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, execution of malicious code (XSS if response data is tampered with), unauthorized data modification.
    *   **Affected Shelf Component:** Any `Middleware` in the `shelf.Pipeline`, particularly third-party middleware. The core issue is the ability of middleware to modify `shelf.Request` and `shelf.Response` objects.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet any third-party middleware used, examining its interaction with `shelf.Request` and `shelf.Response`.
        *   Implement strict input validation and output encoding *after* all middleware in the `shelf.Pipeline` has processed the request/response.
        *   Regularly update all middleware dependencies.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Error Handling](./threats/information_disclosure_via_error_handling.md)

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Error Handling

    *   **Description:**  An attacker triggers an error within a `shelf.Handler` or `Middleware` that results in the application exposing sensitive information in the `shelf.Response`. This is due to inadequate custom error handling, causing Shelf's default error handling (which may expose details) to be used.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive information that can aid attackers, revealing implementation details.
    *   **Affected Shelf Component:**  Error handling logic within `Handler` functions and any custom error handling `Middleware`. Shelf's default error handling (if not overridden) is a primary concern, specifically how it constructs the `shelf.Response` in error cases.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement custom error handling middleware that intercepts exceptions and generates generic `shelf.Response` objects without sensitive details.
        *   Never expose raw exception details or stack traces in the `shelf.Response` sent to the client in a production environment.
        *   Configure a default error handler to catch any unhandled exceptions and return a safe `shelf.Response`.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Request Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service_via_request_flooding.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Request Flooding

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests to the `shelf.Server`, overwhelming server resources. Shelf itself does not provide built-in mechanisms to limit request rates, making the application vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:**  Application unavailability, service disruption.
    *   **Affected Shelf Component:**  The `shelf.Server` and all `Handler` and `Middleware` components, as they are all involved in processing requests. The lack of built-in rate limiting in `shelf.Server` is the direct vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting middleware to restrict the number of requests processed by `shelf.Server` from a single IP address or user.
        *   Use a reverse proxy or load balancer in front of the `shelf.Server` to provide additional DoS protection.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Large Request Bodies](./threats/denial_of_service_via_large_request_bodies.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Large Request Bodies

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends requests with excessively large request bodies to a `shelf.Handler`, consuming server resources. Shelf does not provide built-in request body size limits, making handlers vulnerable if they don't implement their own checks.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption.
    *   **Affected Shelf Component:** `Handler` functions that process `shelf.Request` bodies, and any `Middleware` that interacts with the request body. The lack of built-in limits on `shelf.Request` body size is the direct vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement middleware to limit the maximum size of the `shelf.Request` body.
        *   Use streaming techniques to process large request bodies in chunks, rather than loading the entire `shelf.Request.read()` result into memory at once.
