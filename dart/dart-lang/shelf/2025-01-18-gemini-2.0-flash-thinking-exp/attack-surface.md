# Attack Surface Analysis for dart-lang/shelf

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Request Path](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_request_path.md)

- **Description:** Attackers can manipulate the request path to access files or resources outside the intended directories on the server.
- **How Shelf Contributes:** `shelf` provides the raw request path (`request.url.path`) to the application, making it the application's responsibility to sanitize and validate it before using it to access resources.
- **Example:** A request to `/static/../../../etc/passwd` could be used to attempt to access the system's password file if the application directly uses the path to serve static files without proper checks.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential data breaches, and system compromise.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize the request path before using it to access resources.
    - **Use Path Joining Libraries:** Employ secure path joining functions provided by the operating system or libraries to prevent traversal.
    - **Restrict File Access:** Configure the application's file access permissions to limit access to only necessary directories.
    - **Chroot Environments:** Consider using chroot environments to further isolate the application's file system.

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection via Request Headers](./attack_surfaces/header_injection_via_request_headers.md)

- **Description:** Attackers inject malicious data into HTTP request headers, which the application might then use without proper sanitization, leading to unintended consequences.
- **How Shelf Contributes:** `shelf` exposes all request headers to the application through the `request.headers` map.
- **Example:** An attacker could inject a malicious `X-Forwarded-For` header to bypass IP-based access controls or logging mechanisms.
- **Impact:** Security bypasses, logging manipulation, potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in downstream systems that rely on these headers.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all incoming request headers before using them in application logic or when constructing outgoing requests or responses.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only access and use the headers that are absolutely necessary.
    - **Context-Aware Encoding:** Encode header values appropriately when using them in different contexts (e.g., logging, constructing other requests).

## Attack Surface: [Response Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/response_header_injection.md)

- **Description:** Attackers can potentially influence the response headers sent by the application, leading to security vulnerabilities on the client-side.
- **How Shelf Contributes:** `shelf` allows the application to set response headers through the `Response` object. If the application doesn't properly sanitize data used in header values, it can be exploited.
- **Example:** An attacker might be able to inject a malicious `Set-Cookie` header to perform session fixation or other cookie-based attacks if the application dynamically sets cookie values without proper escaping.
- **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie manipulation, bypassing security policies (e.g., Content Security Policy if manipulated), and other client-side vulnerabilities.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Strict Header Construction:**  Carefully construct response headers and avoid directly embedding user-provided or untrusted data without proper encoding.
    - **Use Secure Header Libraries:** Utilize libraries that provide secure header construction and encoding functionalities.
    - **Regular Security Audits:** Review the code that sets response headers for potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_middleware.md)

- **Description:** Security flaws in custom middleware components can introduce vulnerabilities into the application's request processing pipeline.
- **How Shelf Contributes:** `shelf`'s middleware system allows developers to insert custom logic into the request/response cycle. Vulnerabilities in this custom code are a direct consequence of using `shelf`'s extensibility.
- **Example:** A poorly implemented authentication middleware might incorrectly authorize requests, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization flaws, data leakage, and other vulnerabilities depending on the middleware's functionality.
- **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding principles when developing middleware.
    - **Thorough Testing:**  Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for middleware components, including security-focused test cases.
    - **Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews of middleware logic to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure middleware only has the necessary permissions and access to perform its intended function.
