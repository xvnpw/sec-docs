# Threat Model Analysis for dart-lang/shelf

## Threat: [Malformed Request Handling](./threats/malformed_request_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request with unexpected or malformed headers, methods, or body content. This could involve exceeding size limits, using invalid characters, or omitting required fields. The attacker aims to trigger errors or unexpected behavior in Shelf's request parsing logic.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting server resources, unexpected application behavior leading to errors or crashes, potential information disclosure through error messages.

**Affected Component:** `shelf`'s request parsing logic (within the `Request` object creation and handling).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation on all incoming request data (headers, body, method, URL).
*   Set appropriate limits for request body size and header lengths.
*   Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter out malicious requests.
*   Ensure the application handles parsing errors gracefully without revealing sensitive information.

## Threat: [Large Request Body Exhaustion](./threats/large_request_body_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends requests with excessively large bodies to overwhelm the server's resources (memory, CPU). This can be done by repeatedly sending large requests or sending a single, extremely large request.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), performance degradation, potential server crashes.

**Affected Component:** `shelf`'s request body handling (specifically how it reads and processes the `Request.read()` stream).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement request body size limits.
*   Use asynchronous processing and backpressure mechanisms when handling request bodies.
*   Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single source.
*   Consider using a reverse proxy with request size limits.

## Threat: [Middleware Ordering Bypass](./threats/middleware_ordering_bypass.md)

**Description:** Incorrect ordering of middleware can lead to security middleware being bypassed. For example, an authentication middleware placed after a middleware that handles routing might not be executed for all requests.

**Impact:** Security vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, potential data breaches.

**Affected Component:** `shelf`'s middleware pipeline and the order in which handlers are chained using `Cascade` or `Pipeline`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully plan and document the order of middleware execution.
*   Ensure that security-critical middleware (authentication, authorization, input validation) is placed early in the pipeline.
*   Thoroughly test the middleware pipeline to verify the execution order.
