## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Shelf](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_shelf.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH RISK PATH** - Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_-_exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**1. Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)**

*   This is a critical entry point for attackers. Weaknesses in how the application processes incoming requests can lead to various exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE** - Malicious Header Injection](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_-_malicious_header_injection.md)

**2. Malicious Header Injection (CRITICAL NODE)**

*   **HIGH RISK PATH - Inject arbitrary headers to bypass security checks (e.g., CORS):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a request with malicious headers designed to circumvent security policies implemented by the browser or server. For example, manipulating the `Origin` header to bypass CORS restrictions and access resources they shouldn't.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common web vulnerability, depends on application's header handling).
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Bypass security policies, unauthorized access).
    *   **Effort:** Low (Easily scriptable, readily available tools).
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be subtle, requires monitoring of header behavior).

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH RISK PATH** - Inject arbitrary headers to bypass security checks (e.g., CORS)](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_-_inject_arbitrary_headers_to_bypass_security_checks__e_g___cors_.md)

**HIGH RISK PATH - Inject arbitrary headers to bypass security checks (e.g., CORS):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a request with malicious headers designed to circumvent security policies implemented by the browser or server. For example, manipulating the `Origin` header to bypass CORS restrictions and access resources they shouldn't.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common web vulnerability, depends on application's header handling).

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH RISK PATH** - Exploit Response Handling Vulnerabilities **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_-_exploit_response_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**3. Exploit Response Handling Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)**

*   This category focuses on weaknesses in how the application constructs and sends responses, potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the client's browser or gain access to sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE** - Malicious Header Injection in Responses](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_-_malicious_header_injection_in_responses.md)

**4. Malicious Header Injection in Responses (CRITICAL NODE)**

*   **HIGH RISK PATH - If the application logic allows attacker-controlled data to be directly used in response headers, it can lead to vulnerabilities like HTTP Response Splitting:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects newline characters and malicious headers into a response header value. This can trick the server and client into interpreting the rest of the response as a new HTTP response, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or session hijacking.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common web vulnerability if not handled carefully).
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Cross-site scripting, session hijacking).
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Requires identifying injection points).
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires inspection of response headers).

## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE** - Information Disclosure via Error Handling](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_-_information_disclosure_via_error_handling.md)

**5. Information Disclosure via Error Handling (CRITICAL NODE)**

*   **Attack Vector:** The application's error handling mechanism, potentially using Shelf's default behavior, reveals sensitive information in error messages or stack traces. This information can include internal paths, database details, or other data that aids further attacks.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration).
    *   **Impact:** Low to Medium (Exposure of internal details, potential for further exploitation).
    *   **Effort:** Low (Triggering error conditions).
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Reviewing error logs and responses).

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH RISK PATH** - Exploit Lack of Built-in Security Features (Design Considerations) **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_-_exploit_lack_of_built-in_security_features__design_considerations___critical_node_.md)

**6. Exploit Lack of Built-in Security Features (Design Considerations) (CRITICAL NODE)**

*   This category highlights security vulnerabilities arising from features that `shelf` doesn't provide out-of-the-box, requiring developers to implement them.

## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE** - Absence of Built-in CSRF Protection](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_-_absence_of_built-in_csrf_protection.md)

**7. Absence of Built-in CSRF Protection (CRITICAL NODE)**

*   **HIGH RISK PATH - Shelf doesn't inherently provide CSRF protection, making applications vulnerable if not implemented by the developer:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker tricks a user's browser into making unintended requests to the application while the user is authenticated. This can lead to unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, such as changing passwords or making purchases.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (Common web application vulnerability if not addressed).
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Unauthorized actions on behalf of users).
    *   **Effort:** Low (Exploitation is relatively straightforward).
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires analysis of request origins and tokens).

## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE** - Absence of Built-in Rate Limiting](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_-_absence_of_built-in_rate_limiting.md)

**8. Absence of Built-in Rate Limiting (CRITICAL NODE)**

*   **Attack Vector:** Without rate limiting, an attacker can send a large number of requests to the application in a short period. This can lead to brute-force attacks against login forms or other sensitive endpoints, or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by overwhelming the server's resources.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the application's exposure and sensitivity).
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Service disruption, account lockout).
    *   **Effort:** Low (Simple scripting).
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Spike in requests from a single source).
