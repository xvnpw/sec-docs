# Attack Surface Analysis for dart-lang/json_serializable

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Over-Serialization (`toJson`)](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_over-serialization___tojson__.md)

*   **Description:** The `toJson` methods generated by `json_serializable` inadvertently serialize sensitive information that should not be exposed.
*   **How `json_serializable` Contributes:** It automatically serializes all public fields of a class unless explicitly excluded using annotations (`@JsonKey(ignore: true)`). This default behavior can lead to unintentional exposure of sensitive data.
*   **Example:** A Dart class includes a `passwordHash` field that gets serialized when using `toJson`, potentially exposing it if the JSON is transmitted or stored insecurely.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to account compromise or other security breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review the fields being serialized by `toJson`.
