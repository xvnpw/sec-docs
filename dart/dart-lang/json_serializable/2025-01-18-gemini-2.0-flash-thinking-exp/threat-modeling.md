# Threat Model Analysis for dart-lang/json_serializable

## Threat: [Missing Required Fields during Deserialization](./threats/missing_required_fields_during_deserialization.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides JSON input that is missing fields marked as required in the Dart class (either implicitly or explicitly with `@JsonKey(required: true)`). The `json_serializable` generated `fromJson` function might proceed without these fields, leading to null values where they are not expected, potentially causing `NullPointerExceptions` or incorrect application logic. An attacker might manipulate API requests or data files to omit these fields.

**Impact:** Application crashes due to null dereferences, incorrect application state, potential for data inconsistency if required data is missing.

**Affected Component:** Generated `fromJson` function.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize the `@JsonKey(required: true)` annotation to enforce the presence of required fields during deserialization (will throw an exception if missing).
* Implement explicit checks for null values after deserialization, especially for critical fields.
* Design your application logic to gracefully handle missing data or provide default values where appropriate.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data during Serialization](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_during_serialization.md)

**Description:** The application serializes Dart objects containing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys) into JSON, and this JSON is then transmitted or stored insecurely. An attacker intercepting or accessing this JSON could gain access to sensitive data.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential for identity theft or further attacks.

**Affected Component:** Generated `toJson` function.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully control which fields are included in the serialized JSON using `@JsonKey(ignore: true)` or by defining custom `toJson` methods that exclude sensitive data.
* Avoid serializing sensitive data unless absolutely necessary.
* Ensure that serialized JSON containing sensitive data is transmitted and stored securely (e.g., using HTTPS, encryption at rest).

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Large or Deeply Nested JSON during Deserialization](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_large_or_deeply_nested_json_during_deserialization.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends extremely large or deeply nested JSON structures to the application. The `json_serializable` generated `fromJson` function attempts to parse and deserialize this complex structure, potentially consuming excessive memory or processing time, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.

**Affected Component:** Generated `fromJson` function, JSON parsing library used internally.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the size and depth of incoming JSON data.
* Consider using streaming JSON parsing for very large payloads to avoid loading the entire structure into memory at once (though `json_serializable` primarily works with complete objects).
* Implement timeouts for deserialization operations to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
* Rate-limit incoming requests to prevent attackers from overwhelming the server with malicious JSON.

## Threat: [Exploiting Custom `fromJson` or `toJson` Logic](./threats/exploiting_custom__fromjson__or__tojson__logic.md)

**Description:** Developers might implement custom `fromJson` or `toJson` methods for more complex serialization/deserialization scenarios. If these custom methods contain vulnerabilities (e.g., improper input validation, insecure data handling), an attacker could exploit them by crafting specific JSON payloads or manipulating serialized data.

**Impact:** Depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom logic. Could range from data corruption to remote code execution if the custom logic interacts with external systems or executes code based on the input.

**Affected Component:** Custom `fromJson` and `toJson` methods.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and test all custom `fromJson` and `toJson` methods for potential vulnerabilities.
* Apply the same security principles to custom serialization/deserialization logic as you would to any other part of your application.
* Avoid performing complex or security-sensitive operations directly within custom serialization/deserialization logic.
