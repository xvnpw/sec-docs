## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious JSON Input](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_json_input.md)

**High-Risk Path: Supply Malicious JSON Input**

This path represents the risk associated with an attacker providing crafted JSON data to the application. It's high-risk because controlling the input is often achievable, and several specific attack vectors within this path have significant potential impact.

*   **Attack Vector: Type Mismatch Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides JSON data where the data type does not match the expected Dart type defined in the application's data models.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Can lead to runtime errors, unexpected default values being used, incorrect program logic execution, or even denial of service if error handling is poor.
    *   **Why it's Critical:** Type mismatches are common programming errors and relatively easy for an attacker to test and exploit.

*   **Attack Vector: Missing Required Fields Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   **Description:** An attacker omits fields in the JSON that are expected to be present (non-nullable without default values) in the corresponding Dart class.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Can cause exceptions during deserialization, leading to application crashes or the use of uninitialized or default values that result in an inconsistent application state.
    *   **Why it's Critical:** Developers might not always implement robust checks for the presence of required fields, making this a common vulnerability.

*   **Attack Vector: Large or Deeply Nested JSON Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends excessively large or deeply nested JSON structures to the application.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Can lead to denial of service (DoS) by consuming excessive server resources (CPU, memory), potentially causing the application to become unresponsive or crash due to stack overflow errors during deserialization.
    *   **Why it's Critical:** This is a well-known technique for causing DoS and can have an immediate and significant impact on application availability.

*   **Attack Vector: Malicious String Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious strings within the JSON data, containing escape sequences, special characters, or code that can be interpreted maliciously by downstream components after deserialization.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the string is rendered in a web page, SQL injection if the string is used in a database query, or other injection vulnerabilities depending on how the data is used.
    *   **Why it's Critical:** Injection attacks are a major security concern and can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Custom Serialization/Deserialization Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_custom_serializationdeserialization_logic.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Custom Serialization/Deserialization Logic**

This path highlights the risks introduced when developers implement custom serialization or deserialization logic, often using annotations like `@JsonKey` with `fromJson` or `toJson` functions.

*   **Attack Vector: Vulnerabilities in Custom `fromJson` Implementations (CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   **Description:**  Developers implement custom logic to handle the deserialization of specific fields. This custom code might contain vulnerabilities due to insecure coding practices.
    *   **Potential Impact:**  The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom code. It could range from incorrect data handling and application state corruption to more severe issues like remote code execution if the custom logic interacts with external systems or executes commands based on the input.
    *   **Why it's Critical:** Custom code is often a source of vulnerabilities because it's written by application developers and might not undergo the same level of scrutiny as the generated code. Lack of proper input validation, error handling, or insecure use of external resources can introduce significant risks.
