# Threat Model Analysis for dart-lang/json_serializable

## Threat: [Threat 1: Arbitrary Object Instantiation via Type Manipulation](./threats/threat_1_arbitrary_object_instantiation_via_type_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload that specifies a different Dart type than the one expected by the application. The attacker leverages `json_serializable`'s reliance on type information within the JSON (e.g., a hypothetical `"$type"` field) to instantiate an arbitrary class. If this attacker-controlled class has side effects in its constructor or `fromJson` factory, those side effects are executed.
    *   **Impact:**  This can lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker-chosen class has methods that perform sensitive actions (e.g., file system access, network connections, command execution) that are triggered during object creation or deserialization. This is a complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `fromJson` factory method generated by `json_serializable`. Specifically, the code that uses type information from the JSON to determine which class to instantiate. This is the core of the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **a. Strict Type Whitelisting (Essential):**  Within the `fromJson` factory, *hardcode* a whitelist of allowed types.  Do *not* trust any type information provided in the JSON.  Reject any JSON that doesn't match an allowed type. This is the primary defense.
        *   **b. Avoid Polymorphism with Untrusted Input:** If possible, do not use polymorphic deserialization (where the JSON determines the concrete type) with data from untrusted sources. If polymorphism is *absolutely* necessary, the whitelist is non-negotiable.
        *   **c. `checked: true` (Secondary Defense):** While not sufficient on its own, `checked: true` in `@JsonSerializable` adds a layer of runtime type checking that can help detect some mismatches *after* the object has been (potentially incorrectly) instantiated.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Denial of Service via Deeply Nested JSON](./threats/threat_2_denial_of_service_via_deeply_nested_json.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with excessively deep nesting. `json_serializable`'s generated `fromJson` methods recursively deserialize this structure.
    *   **Impact:**  This can consume excessive stack space and CPU cycles, leading to a stack overflow error or general resource exhaustion, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive (Denial of Service). This directly exploits the recursive nature of the generated code.
    *   **Affected Component:** The recursive deserialization logic within the generated `fromJson` methods. This is inherent to how `json_serializable` handles nested objects.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **a. Depth Limiting (Custom Deserializer/`fromJson` Modification):**  The most direct mitigation is to modify the generated `fromJson` factory (or use a custom `JsonConverter`) to track the nesting depth during deserialization. If the depth exceeds a predefined limit, throw an exception or reject the input. This directly addresses the recursive nature of the problem.
        *  **b. Input Size Limits (Less Direct, but Important):** Enforce limits on the *overall* JSON size *before* it reaches `json_serializable`. While this doesn't directly address the nesting issue, it provides a general defense against excessively large inputs.

## Threat: [Threat 3: Denial of Service via Large String/Array/Map Fields](./threats/threat_3_denial_of_service_via_large_stringarraymap_fields.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker sends JSON with extremely large strings, arrays, or maps *within* fields. `json_serializable` will attempt to allocate memory for these large fields during deserialization.
    *   **Impact:** This can lead to excessive memory allocation, potentially causing an out-of-memory error and a denial-of-service condition. This exploits how `json_serializable` handles the creation of these data structures.
    *   **Affected Component:** The generated `fromJson` methods, specifically the parts that handle the assignment of values to string, array, and map fields. The code generated by `json_serializable` is directly responsible for allocating memory for these fields.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **a. Field-Specific Size Limits (Custom `fromJson` / `JsonConverter`):**  Within custom `fromJson` factories or `JsonConverter` implementations, add checks to limit the length of strings and the size of arrays and maps. This directly addresses the problem within the `json_serializable`-generated code.

## Threat: [Threat 4:  Unvalidated `JsonConverter` Implementation](./threats/threat_4__unvalidated__jsonconverter__implementation.md)

*   **Description:** A developer implements a custom `JsonConverter` and introduces a vulnerability *within* the `fromJson` or `toJson` methods of the converter itself. This could be due to incorrect type handling, insufficient validation, or other logic errors *within the custom code*.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability within the `JsonConverter`. It could range from data corruption to arbitrary code execution (if the converter handles sensitive data or operations). This is a high risk because custom converters often handle complex or security-sensitive logic.
    *   **Affected Component:** The custom `JsonConverter` implementation. This is directly related to `json_serializable` because the vulnerability exists within a component specifically designed to integrate with it.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical, depending on the converter's purpose)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **a. Thorough Testing:** Extensively test the `JsonConverter` with a wide range of valid and invalid inputs, including edge cases and boundary conditions.
        *   **b. Security-Focused Code Review:** Have another developer with security expertise review the `JsonConverter` implementation, paying close attention to potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **c. Follow Best Practices:** Adhere to secure coding principles when implementing the `JsonConverter`, including input validation, error handling, and avoiding potentially dangerous operations.
