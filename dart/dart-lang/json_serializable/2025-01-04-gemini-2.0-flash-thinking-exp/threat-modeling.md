# Threat Model Analysis for dart-lang/json_serializable

## Threat: [Data Integrity Violation via Malicious Payloads](./threats/data_integrity_violation_via_malicious_payloads.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts JSON payloads to set object properties to malicious or unexpected values. They aim to manipulate the application's state or behavior by injecting harmful data through the deserialization process managed by `json_serializable`.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized data modification, bypassing business logic, potential for further attacks if the manipulated data is used in subsequent operations.

**Affected Component:** Deserialized Dart objects and the generated `fromJson` factory methods.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement validation logic after deserialization to ensure data conforms to expected constraints and business rules.
*   Sanitize and validate user-provided data before including it in JSON responses that will be deserialized.
*   Consider using immutable data structures where appropriate to prevent modification after deserialization.

## Threat: [Code Generation Vulnerabilities Leading to Insecure Deserialization](./threats/code_generation_vulnerabilities_leading_to_insecure_deserialization.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability in the `json_serializable` code generation logic itself could lead to the generation of insecure deserialization code. An attacker might exploit this by crafting specific Dart class definitions that trigger the generation of vulnerable code by `json_serializable`.

**Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution or other severe vulnerabilities if the generated code has flaws introduced by the code generator.

**Affected Component:** The `json_serializable` code generator itself.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the `json_serializable` package updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Review the generated code if dealing with highly sensitive data or critical application logic.
*   Report any suspected vulnerabilities in the `json_serializable` package to the maintainers.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data Through Default Serialization](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_through_default_serialization.md)

**Description:** By default, `json_serializable` serializes all public fields. An attacker observing the serialized JSON (e.g., through network traffic or logs) could gain access to sensitive information that was not intended for exposure because `json_serializable` included it in the output.

**Impact:** Leakage of sensitive information, privacy violations, potential for further attacks if exposed data is used for authentication or authorization.

**Affected Component:** Generated `toJson` methods.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use the `@JsonKey(ignore: true)` annotation to prevent specific fields from being serialized by `json_serializable`.
*   Define custom `toJson` methods to have explicit control over which data is included in the serialized output by `json_serializable`.
*   Carefully review the fields being serialized by `json_serializable`, especially when dealing with user data or sensitive information.

## Threat: [Build Process Compromise Leading to Malicious Code Injection](./threats/build_process_compromise_leading_to_malicious_code_injection.md)

**Description:** If the development environment or build pipeline is compromised, an attacker could inject malicious code into the serialization/deserialization code generated by `json_serializable` during the build process.

**Impact:** Introduction of backdoors, data exfiltration, or other malicious behavior within the application, potentially affecting all users due to the compromised generated code.

**Affected Component:** The `json_serializable` code generation process during the build.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the development environment and build pipeline.
*   Use trusted and verified dependencies.
*   Implement code signing and integrity checks for build artifacts.
*   Regularly audit the build process for security vulnerabilities.
