## Deep Analysis: Attack Tree Path - Provide Unexpected Data Types

**Context:** This analysis focuses on the "Provide Unexpected Data Types" attack path within the context of an application utilizing the `json_serializable` library in Dart. This library automates the process of converting JSON data to Dart objects and vice-versa.

**ATTACK TREE PATH:** Provide Unexpected Data Types

**CRITICALITY:** High

**Target:** Application's Type Safety and Data Integrity

**Detailed Analysis:**

This attack path exploits the fundamental assumption that the incoming JSON data adheres to the expected schema defined by the Dart classes and their corresponding `fromJson` methods generated by `json_serializable`. By providing JSON data where the types of values do not match the expected types in the Dart model, an attacker can potentially cause various issues, ranging from application crashes to more subtle logic errors and even security vulnerabilities.

**How the Attack Works:**

1. **Identify Target Data Structures:** The attacker first needs to understand the Dart classes used for deserialization, specifically those generated using `json_serializable`. This can be done through reverse engineering, analyzing API documentation (if available), or through trial and error. They will identify the expected data types for each field in these classes.

2. **Craft Malicious JSON Payload:** The attacker then crafts a JSON payload where one or more fields have values with types that deviate from the expected types defined in the Dart class.

3. **Send Malicious Payload:** This crafted JSON payload is then sent to the application through an API endpoint, a message queue, or any other mechanism where JSON data is consumed and deserialized using the generated `fromJson` methods.

4. **Exploitation:** Upon receiving the malicious payload, the application attempts to deserialize it using the `fromJson` method. The behavior at this point depends on how the `fromJson` method and the underlying Dart runtime handle type mismatches.

**Potential Impacts:**

* **Application Crashes/Exceptions:** The most immediate and obvious impact. If the `fromJson` method or the subsequent code attempts to perform operations expecting a specific data type (e.g., performing arithmetic on a string), it can lead to runtime exceptions and application crashes. This can result in denial of service.
* **Logic Errors and Unexpected Behavior:** Even if the application doesn't crash, providing incorrect data types can lead to subtle logic errors. For example:
    * Providing a string "true" for a boolean field might be interpreted as true, while providing an integer `1` might cause an error or be treated as a different boolean value depending on the implementation.
    * Providing a string for a numeric field might lead to unexpected calculations or comparisons if the application attempts to parse it later.
    * Providing a map or list where a primitive type is expected can lead to unexpected data structures being passed around, causing errors in subsequent processing.
* **Security Vulnerabilities:** In certain scenarios, providing unexpected data types can lead to more serious security vulnerabilities:
    * **Bypassing Validation:** If validation logic relies on the data being of a specific type, providing a different type might bypass these checks. For example, if a length check is expected on a string, providing an integer might skip the check.
    * **Type Confusion Vulnerabilities:** In languages with less strict type systems (though Dart is relatively strong), type confusion can lead to memory corruption or other low-level vulnerabilities. While less likely in Dart due to its sound type system, unexpected behavior can still be exploited.
    * **Data Injection:** If the deserialized data is used in database queries or other sensitive operations without proper sanitization, providing unexpected data types (e.g., strings containing SQL injection payloads where numbers are expected) could lead to data breaches.
* **Resource Exhaustion:** In some cases, processing unexpected data types could lead to inefficient code execution or resource consumption, potentially leading to denial of service.

**Context with `json_serializable`:**

`json_serializable` generates `fromJson` methods that typically perform basic type checking and conversion. However, the level of strictness can vary depending on the configuration and the underlying Dart runtime behavior.

* **Default Behavior:** By default, `json_serializable` generated code often performs implicit type conversions where possible (e.g., converting a string representation of a number to an integer). While convenient, this can be a vulnerability point if an attacker provides unexpected string values that might be incorrectly interpreted.
* **Nullable Types:** If a field is marked as nullable (e.g., `int?`), providing `null` or a completely different type might be handled gracefully, but it depends on how the application logic handles null values.
* **Custom `fromJson` Logic:** If developers implement custom `fromJson` logic within their classes, they have more control over type checking and error handling. However, if this logic is not robust, it can still be vulnerable to unexpected data types.
* **Generics and Complex Types:** When dealing with lists, maps, or other complex types, providing incorrect types within these structures can be challenging to handle correctly and can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

**Attack Vectors:**

* **Malicious API Requests:** Attacker directly sends crafted JSON payloads to API endpoints.
* **Compromised Data Sources:** If the application consumes data from external sources (databases, message queues) that are compromised, malicious JSON data can be injected.
* **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** An attacker intercepts and modifies JSON data in transit.
* **Internal System Errors:** While not directly malicious, errors in internal systems generating JSON data can inadvertently introduce unexpected data types.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Strict Type Checking:**
    * **Explicit Type Assertions:** Within custom `fromJson` methods, explicitly check the type of the incoming data before assigning it to the corresponding field.
    * **Consider Libraries for Schema Validation:** Integrate libraries like `dart_json_schema` or similar to validate the incoming JSON against a predefined schema before attempting deserialization. This provides a robust layer of defense against unexpected data types.
* **Robust Error Handling:**
    * **Catch `TypeError` Exceptions:** Implement `try-catch` blocks around the deserialization process to gracefully handle `TypeError` exceptions that might arise due to type mismatches.
    * **Log and Alert:** Log instances of deserialization failures with details about the unexpected data types encountered. Implement alerting mechanisms to notify administrators of potential attacks.
* **Input Sanitization and Validation:**
    * **Validate After Deserialization:** Even if the deserialization succeeds, perform further validation on the deserialized data to ensure it meets the expected constraints and business rules.
    * **Sanitize Input:** If the data originates from user input (even indirectly), sanitize it to remove potentially harmful characters or patterns.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit the access and permissions of the application to external data sources to minimize the impact of compromised sources.
* **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities related to data handling and deserialization.
* **Stay Updated with Library Security:** Keep the `json_serializable` library and other dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches and improvements.
* **Consider Alternatives for Highly Sensitive Data:** For extremely sensitive data, consider alternative serialization formats or custom parsing logic that provides more granular control over type checking and validation.

**Example Scenario:**

Consider a Dart class `User` defined as:

```dart
import 'package:json_annotation/json_annotation.dart';

part 'user.g.dart';

@JsonSerializable()
class User {
  final int id;
  final String name;
  final bool isActive;

  User({required this.id, required this.name, required this.isActive});

  factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$UserFromJson(json);

  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => _$UserToJson(this);
}
```

An attacker could send the following malicious JSON payload:

```json
{
  "id": "not_an_integer",
  "name": 123,
  "isActive": "maybe"
}
```

Depending on the Dart runtime and the specific version of `json_serializable`, this could lead to:

* A `TypeError` when trying to assign `"not_an_integer"` to an `int` field.
* The `name` field being implicitly converted to a string `"123"`.
* The `isActive` field potentially causing an error or being interpreted unexpectedly.

**Conclusion:**

The "Provide Unexpected Data Types" attack path is a significant concern for applications using `json_serializable`. While the library simplifies JSON handling, it relies on the assumption of well-formed and correctly typed input data. By understanding the potential impacts and implementing robust mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack and ensure the integrity and security of their applications. A proactive approach involving strict type checking, schema validation, and comprehensive error handling is crucial for defense.
