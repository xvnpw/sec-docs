## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Validation Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_validation_weaknesses.md)

This is a critical node because it represents the primary entry point for attackers to manipulate the data processed by the application. Weaknesses in input validation allow malicious data to bypass initial checks and potentially trigger vulnerabilities later in the application's lifecycle.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Parsing Errors](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_parsing_errors.md)

While the immediate impact might be low to medium (application crash or error message), frequent or strategically crafted malformed JSON can lead to denial of service if the parsing process is resource-intensive. This is a critical node as it represents a basic but effective way to disrupt the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Unexpected Data Types](./attack_tree_paths/provide_unexpected_data_types.md)

This is a critical node as it directly targets the type safety of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Incorrect Type for Expected Field](./attack_tree_paths/inject_incorrect_type_for_expected_field.md)

By providing a JSON value with a type different from what the Dart class expects, an attacker can trigger type errors, exceptions, or unexpected behavior in the generated code or subsequent application logic. This path is high-risk due to its high likelihood and potential for immediate disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Type That Causes Overflow or Underflow](./attack_tree_paths/inject_type_that_causes_overflow_or_underflow.md)

Injecting numerical values that exceed the limits of Dart's data types (e.g., very large integers) can lead to integer overflow or underflow. This can result in data corruption, incorrect calculations, and potentially exploitable security vulnerabilities depending on how the data is used. This path is high-risk due to the potential for data integrity issues and security implications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Values Outside Expected Range](./attack_tree_paths/provide_values_outside_expected_range.md)

This is a critical node as it targets the validity of data based on defined constraints.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Values Exceeding Data Type Limits](./attack_tree_paths/inject_values_exceeding_data_type_limits.md)

Similar to injecting incorrect types for overflow/underflow, this path focuses on exploiting the boundaries of data types, leading to potential data corruption or unexpected behavior. This path is high-risk for the same reasons as the overflow/underflow path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Values Violating Application-Specific Constraints](./attack_tree_paths/inject_values_violating_application-specific_constraints.md)

This attack vector targets the specific business logic and rules of the application. By providing values that are technically valid in terms of data type but violate application-defined constraints (e.g., negative quantity for an order), attackers can cause business logic errors, inconsistencies, or even security vulnerabilities. This path is high-risk because it directly targets the application's core functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Missing Required Fields](./attack_tree_paths/provide_missing_required_fields.md)

This is a critical node because the absence of expected data can lead to errors, inconsistent application state, and failures in application logic. While the immediate impact might not always be severe, it can create exploitable conditions or disrupt normal operation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Type System Mismatches](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_type_system_mismatches.md)

This is a critical node as it focuses on the differences between JSON's loosely typed nature and Dart's strong typing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Null Values in Non-Nullable Fields (if not handled correctly)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_null_values_in_non-nullable_fields__if_not_handled_correctly_.md)

This is a critical node and represents a common source of errors in Dart applications. If the application does not defensively handle null values in fields that are expected to be non-nullable, injecting `null` in the JSON can lead to null pointer exceptions and unexpected behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Code Generation Weaknesses (Less Likely but Possible)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_code_generation_weaknesses__less_likely_but_possible_.md)

This is a critical node because, while less likely than input validation issues, vulnerabilities in the generated `fromJson` methods could allow attackers to craft specific JSON payloads that expose edge cases in the parsing logic, leading to incorrect object instantiation or data population. This could potentially be leveraged to bypass security checks or manipulate application state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Side Effects (If Application Logic is Flawed)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_side_effects__if_application_logic_is_flawed_.md)

This is a critical node because it highlights that the security of the application extends beyond the serialization library itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit business logic vulnerabilities exposed through deserialized data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_business_logic_vulnerabilities_exposed_through_deserialized_data.md)

This path represents a significant risk. If the application logic makes assumptions about the validity or integrity of deserialized data without proper validation, attackers can craft malicious JSON payloads that, when deserialized, trigger unintended and potentially harmful actions within the application's business logic. This could lead to data manipulation, unauthorized actions, or other security breaches.
