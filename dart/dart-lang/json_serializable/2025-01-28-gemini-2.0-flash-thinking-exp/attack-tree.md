## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Compromise json_serializable's Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attackers target the dependencies of `json_serializable` (e.g., `build_runner`, `source_gen`, `analyzer`) as a weaker point of entry.
    *   Success here can lead to indirect compromise of the application through malicious build processes or generated code.
*   **Exploit Vulnerability in Dependency [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This is the action of actually leveraging a discovered vulnerability in a dependency.
    *   This could be a known, publicly disclosed vulnerability or a zero-day.
*   **Supply Chain Attack (Dependency Confusion) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Application resolves to malicious package during build [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Attackers create a malicious package with a name similar to a legitimate dependency.
        *   Due to misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in the build process, the application might inadvertently download and use the malicious package instead of the intended one.
        *   This allows attackers to inject malicious code into the build process, potentially affecting the generated code or the application itself.
*   **Exploit known vulnerability in dependency [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attackers leverage publicly available exploits or develop custom exploits for known vulnerabilities in `json_serializable`'s dependencies.
    *   Successful exploitation can lead to various impacts, from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the specific vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Misuse of Generated Code in Application [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL THREAT VECTOR]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_misuse_of_generated_code_in_application__high_risk_path___critical_threat_vector_.md)

*   **Application Logic Vulnerabilities related to Deserialized Data [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This is the most common and easily exploitable attack vector.
    *   It arises from vulnerabilities in the application's code that processes data deserialized by `json_serializable`.
*   **Lack of Input Validation on Deserialized Data [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Assume deserialized data is safe and valid without further checks [CRITICAL NODE - Common Mistake]:**
        *   Developers often mistakenly assume that data deserialized by `json_serializable` is inherently safe and valid.
        *   This leads to a failure to implement proper input validation.
    *   **Inject malicious data in JSON payload [CRITICAL NODE - Attack Method]:**
        *   Attackers craft malicious JSON payloads containing data designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the application logic.
        *   This malicious data is deserialized by the generated code and then processed by the vulnerable application logic.
    *   **Exploit application logic vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) using malicious data [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Impact]:**
        *   Due to the lack of input validation, the malicious data from the JSON payload can be used to exploit common application vulnerabilities such as:
            *   **SQL Injection:** Malicious data is used to manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.
            *   **Command Injection:** Malicious data is used to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
            *   Other application-specific vulnerabilities depending on how the deserialized data is used.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Build Process Vulnerabilities [MEDIUM RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_build_process_vulnerabilities__medium_risk_path_.md)

*   **Compromise Build Environment [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attackers target the build environment (developer machines, CI/CD pipelines) to inject malicious code or alter the application during the build process.
*   **Compromise Developer Machine [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Phishing attacks [CRITICAL NODE - Attack Vector]:**
        *   Attackers use social engineering tactics to trick developers into revealing credentials or installing malware.
    *   **Malware infection [CRITICAL NODE - Attack Vector]:**
        *   Attackers use malware (viruses, trojans, etc.) to compromise developer machines, gaining control over their development environment.
    *   **Gain access to developer's credentials [CRITICAL NODE - Consequence]:**
        *   Once a developer machine is compromised, attackers can steal developer credentials, allowing them to access other systems and resources, including the CI/CD pipeline and code repositories.
*   **Compromise CI/CD Pipeline [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Exploit vulnerabilities in CI/CD tools [CRITICAL NODE - Attack Vector]:**
        *   Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the CI/CD software itself (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
    *   **Inject malicious code into CI/CD configuration [CRITICAL NODE - Attack Vector]:**
        *   Attackers modify the CI/CD pipeline configuration to inject malicious steps or scripts into the build process.
    *   **Gain access to CI/CD secrets [CRITICAL NODE - Attack Vector]:**
        *   Attackers steal secrets stored in the CI/CD system (e.g., API keys, deployment credentials), allowing them to tamper with the build or deployment process.
