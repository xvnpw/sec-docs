# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dart-lang/json_serializable

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Input Validation After Deserialization](./mitigation_strategies/1__input_validation_after_deserialization.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation After Deserialization (json_serializable Context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify `json_serializable` Deserialization Points:** Locate all instances in your project where you are using `fromJson` methods generated by `json_serializable` to convert JSON data into Dart objects. These are the entry points for external data into your application via `json_serializable`.
    2.  **Define Validation Rules for Deserialized Objects:** For each Dart class deserialized using `json_serializable`, specify validation rules that must be enforced *after* the JSON structure is processed by `json_serializable`. These rules should focus on the *content* of the deserialized fields, as `json_serializable` primarily handles structure.
        *   **Example Rules:**  For a `User` class with an `email` field, a rule might be "email must be a valid email format". For an `age` field, a rule might be "age must be a positive integer between 0 and 120".
    3.  **Implement Validation Logic Post `fromJson`:**  Immediately after calling the `fromJson` method generated by `json_serializable`, invoke your validation logic. This can be implemented as:
        *   **Validation Methods within Model Classes:** Add validation methods directly to your `@JsonSerializable` classes that are called after deserialization.
        *   **Dedicated Validator Classes/Functions:** Create separate validator functions or classes that take the deserialized object as input and perform validation checks.
    4.  **Handle Validation Failures:**  Implement error handling to manage cases where validation fails. This should include:
        *   **Rejecting Invalid Data:** Prevent the application from processing data that fails validation.
        *   **Logging Errors:** Log validation failures for debugging and security monitoring purposes.
        *   **Returning Errors to the Source (If Applicable):** If the JSON data originates from an external source (e.g., API request), return appropriate error responses indicating validation failures.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Integrity Violation (High Severity):**  `json_serializable` itself does not validate data content. Malicious or malformed JSON, even if structurally correct for `json_serializable`, can introduce invalid or harmful data into your application, leading to data corruption or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Injection Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** If `json_serializable` deserializes string data from untrusted sources that is later used in contexts susceptible to injection (e.g., web rendering, database queries), and validation is missing, it can enable injection attacks.
    *   **Business Logic Errors (Medium Severity):**  Invalid data deserialized by `json_serializable` can violate business rules and cause application logic to malfunction, leading to incorrect outputs or application errors.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Integrity Violation (High Impact):**  Directly addresses the risk of invalid data entering the application through `json_serializable` deserialization, ensuring data processed is valid according to application rules.
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Impact):**  Mitigates injection risks by validating and sanitizing data *after* it has been processed by `json_serializable` but *before* it is used in potentially vulnerable contexts.
    *   **Business Logic Errors (High Impact):** Prevents application errors and unexpected behavior caused by invalid data that `json_serializable` might otherwise pass through without content validation.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic type enforcement by Dart during deserialization might be implicitly present. Some ad-hoc validation might exist in specific parts of the application, but likely not consistently applied after `json_serializable` deserialization.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Systematic and comprehensive input validation *specifically after* using `json_serializable`'s `fromJson` methods is likely missing across the project. Formalized validation rules tied to `json_serializable` models are probably not defined or consistently enforced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Secure Handling of Sensitive Data during Serialization and Deserialization with json_serializable](./mitigation_strategies/2__secure_handling_of_sensitive_data_during_serialization_and_deserialization_with_json_serializable.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Sensitive Data Handling (json_serializable Context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Fields in `@JsonSerializable` Classes:** Review your Dart classes annotated with `@JsonSerializable` and explicitly identify fields that contain sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys, PII).
    2.  **Control Serialization with `@JsonKey` and Custom Logic:** Utilize `@JsonKey` annotations and custom `toJson`/`fromJson` logic within your `@JsonSerializable` classes to manage how sensitive data is handled during serialization and deserialization:
        *   **`@JsonKey(ignore: true)` for Exclusion:**  If a sensitive field should *never* be serialized into JSON by `json_serializable`, annotate it with `@JsonKey(ignore: true)`. This prevents `json_serializable` from including it in the JSON output.
        *   **Custom `toJson` for Redaction/Omission:**  For more complex scenarios, implement a custom `toJson` method in your `@JsonSerializable` class. Within this method, you can conditionally omit sensitive fields or redact them (e.g., replace with placeholder values) before returning the JSON representation.
        *   **Custom `fromJson` for Secure Deserialization/Decryption:** If sensitive data is serialized in an encrypted form (outside of `json_serializable`'s direct handling), use a custom `fromJson` method to handle decryption *after* `json_serializable` has processed the basic JSON structure.
    3.  **Encryption Before Serialization (External to json_serializable, but relevant):** If sensitive data *must* be serialized, encrypt it *before* it is processed by `json_serializable`. Store the encrypted data in the fields that `json_serializable` will serialize. Decrypt after deserialization using custom `fromJson` logic as mentioned above.  This keeps `json_serializable` handling the structure, while encryption is managed separately.
    4.  **Avoid Logging Serialized Sensitive Data:**  When logging or debugging, be extremely cautious about logging the JSON output generated by `json_serializable` if it might contain sensitive data. Implement logging practices that prevent sensitive data from being exposed in logs.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure via Serialization (High Severity):**  `json_serializable` by default will serialize all annotated fields. If sensitive data is not explicitly excluded or handled, it can be inadvertently included in JSON output, leading to exposure through network transmission, storage, or logs.
    *   **Data Breach via Logs (Medium to High Severity):**  If serialized JSON containing sensitive data is logged in plain text, it creates a vulnerability where attackers gaining access to logs can compromise sensitive information.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure via Serialization (High Impact):**  Directly reduces the risk of sensitive data exposure by providing mechanisms within `json_serializable`'s annotation and customization capabilities to control what data is serialized and how.
    *   **Data Breach via Logs (High Impact):**  Mitigates the risk of logging sensitive data by emphasizing the need to control serialization and avoid logging JSON outputs that might contain sensitive information processed by `json_serializable`.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Developers might be generally aware of not logging passwords. Some sensitive fields might be manually excluded from serialization in specific, isolated cases.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Systematic identification and secure handling of *all* sensitive data fields within `@JsonSerializable` classes are likely missing. Consistent use of `@JsonKey(ignore: true)` or custom `toJson` logic for sensitive data is probably not enforced. Encryption workflows integrated with `json_serializable` for sensitive data are likely absent.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Code Review and Security Audits Focusing on json_serializable Usage](./mitigation_strategies/3__code_review_and_security_audits_focusing_on_json_serializable_usage.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Security-Focused Code Review & Audits (json_serializable Usage)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prioritize `json_serializable` Code in Security Reviews:** When conducting code reviews, specifically focus on code sections that utilize `json_serializable` for serialization and deserialization. Make this a dedicated area of scrutiny during reviews.
    2.  **Review Checklist for `json_serializable` Security:** Develop a code review checklist that includes specific security considerations related to `json_serializable` usage:
        *   **Input Validation Post-Deserialization:** Verify that proper input validation is implemented *after* using `fromJson` for all `@JsonSerializable` classes handling external data.
        *   **Sensitive Data Handling:** Check for correct usage of `@JsonKey(ignore: true)`, custom `toJson`, and custom `fromJson` for sensitive data fields in `@JsonSerializable` classes. Ensure sensitive data is not inadvertently serialized or logged.
        *   **Error Handling in Custom Logic:** If custom `toJson` or `fromJson` methods are used, review them for proper error handling and secure coding practices.
        *   **Correct `json_serializable` Annotations:** Verify that `@JsonSerializable` annotations and `@JsonKey` annotations are used correctly and securely, without misconfigurations that could lead to vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Security Audits Targeting `json_serializable` Integration:**  Include `json_serializable` usage as a specific focus area in periodic security audits.
        *   **Audit Scope:**  Ensure security audits explicitly cover the codebase related to `json_serializable`, including model classes, serialization/deserialization logic, and data validation processes around `json_serializable`.
        *   **Vulnerability Identification:** Audits should aim to identify potential security weaknesses arising from incorrect or insecure usage of `json_serializable`, misconfigurations, or missing security controls in code interacting with `json_serializable`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Logic Errors in Serialization/Deserialization (Medium to High Severity):**  Subtle errors in how `json_serializable` is used, custom logic within `@JsonSerializable` classes, or misconfigurations of annotations can introduce vulnerabilities that are difficult to detect automatically.
    *   **Misconfiguration of `json_serializable` (Medium Severity):**  Incorrectly applied `@JsonSerializable` or `@JsonKey` annotations can lead to unintended security consequences, such as accidentally serializing sensitive data or bypassing intended security measures.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Logic Errors in Serialization/Deserialization (High Impact):**  Reduces the risk of logic errors by having human reviewers specifically examine the code related to `json_serializable` for potential flaws and security weaknesses.
    *   **Misconfiguration of `json_serializable` (Medium Impact):** Helps identify and correct misconfigurations of `json_serializable` annotations and usage patterns that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Standard code reviews are likely performed, but might not specifically focus on `json_serializable` security aspects.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Security-focused code reviews with checklists tailored to `json_serializable` usage are likely not consistently performed. Periodic security audits with a specific scope covering `json_serializable` integration are probably not conducted.
