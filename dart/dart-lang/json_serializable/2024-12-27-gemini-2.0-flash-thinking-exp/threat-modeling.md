| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Type Confusion during Deserialization** | An attacker crafts malicious JSON data with types that are incompatible with the expected Dart types during deserialization. The `fromJson` method might create objects with incorrect types or values, potentially bypassing security checks or causing unexpected behavior. |  * **Data Integrity Compromise:** Deserialized objects have incorrect or unexpected values. * **Security Bypass:**  Incorrectly typed objects might bypass authorization or validation logic. * **Application Crash:** Unexpected types might lead to runtime errors. | `fromJson` methods generated for specific classes. | High | * **Strict Type Checking in `fromJson`:** Implement explicit type checks and validation within the generated `fromJson` methods. * **Utilize `JsonKey` annotations with `fromJson` and `toJson` converters for custom serialization/deserialization logic.** * **Consider using libraries like `built_value` for more robust type safety.** * **Implement schema validation on the incoming JSON data before deserialization.** |
| **Over-Serialization of Sensitive Data** | The generated `toJson` methods inadvertently serialize sensitive information that should not be included in the JSON output. This could be due to default behavior or lack of awareness of what's being serialized. | * **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive data is exposed in the JSON output, potentially accessible to unauthorized parties. * **Compliance Violations:**  Exposure of sensitive data might violate privacy regulations. | `toJson` methods generated for specific classes. | High | * **Carefully review the generated `toJson` methods.** * **Use `@JsonKey(ignore: true)` to explicitly exclude sensitive fields from serialization.** * **Create separate Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for different contexts to control what data is serialized.** * **Implement custom `toJson` logic using converters for more fine-grained control.** |
| **Deserialization to Unexpected States leading to Privilege Escalation** | An attacker crafts malicious JSON to set object properties to values that bypass intended logic or security checks. For example, setting an `isAdmin` flag to `true` during deserialization. | * **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker gains unauthorized access or the ability to perform privileged actions. * **Data Manipulation:**  Critical application state is altered in an unauthorized manner. | `fromJson` methods for classes containing sensitive state information or authorization flags. | Critical | * **Implement robust authorization and access control mechanisms that don't solely rely on the integrity of deserialized data.** * **Validate the state of deserialized objects before performing critical actions.** * **Consider using immutable data structures where appropriate to prevent unintended modifications after deserialization.** * **Employ the principle of least privilege in application design.** |
| **Malicious Code Injection during Code Generation** | An attacker compromises the development environment or dependencies of `json_serializable` (or related build tools) to inject malicious code into the generated `*.g.dart` files. | * **Supply Chain Attack:** Malicious code is introduced into the application build process. * **Remote Code Execution:** The injected code can execute arbitrary commands during build or runtime. * **Data Theft:**  Sensitive data can be exfiltrated during build or runtime. | The code generation process and the generated `*.g.dart` files. | Critical | * **Use dependency scanning tools to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in dependencies.** * **Implement secure build pipelines with integrity checks for dependencies.** * **Regularly audit and review the generated code for unexpected or suspicious patterns.** * **Use a controlled and isolated build environment.** * **Employ code signing for generated files to ensure integrity.** |
