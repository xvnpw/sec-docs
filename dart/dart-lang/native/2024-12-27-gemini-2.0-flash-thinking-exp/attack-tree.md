# Threat Model: Compromising Application Using dart-lang/native (High-Risk Sub-Tree)

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: Gain unauthorized control or access to the application's resources or data by exploiting vulnerabilities introduced through the use of `dart-lang/native`.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

└── Compromise Application via dart-lang/native *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
    ├── Exploit Vulnerabilities in Native Code [CRITICAL] *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
    │   ├── Memory Corruption *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
    │   │   └── Buffer Overflow (Input to Native) [CRITICAL] *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
    │   ├── Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Native Libraries [CRITICAL] *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
    ├── Manipulate Data Passed to Native Code *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
    │   └── Injection Attacks (Native Context) [CRITICAL] *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
    └── Application-Level Misuse of Native Integration *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
        └── Insufficient Input Validation Before Native Call [CRITICAL] *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors (High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes):**

**1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Native Code [CRITICAL] *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***:**

* **Description:** This encompasses exploiting security flaws directly within the native (C/C++) code that the Dart application interacts with. These vulnerabilities can arise from memory management errors, logic flaws, or other coding mistakes.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Memory Corruption *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***:**
        * **Buffer Overflow (Input to Native) [CRITICAL] *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***:** Sending more data to a native function than its allocated buffer can hold, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and hijacking control flow to execute arbitrary code.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Native Libraries [CRITICAL] *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***:** Exploiting known security flaws in external native libraries that the application links against. This relies on the presence of vulnerabilities in these dependencies.

**2. Manipulate Data Passed to Native Code *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***:**

* **Description:** This involves crafting malicious input data sent from the Dart application to the native code to trigger unintended and harmful behavior.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Injection Attacks (Native Context) [CRITICAL] *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***:**
        * **Command Injection:** If the native code executes system commands based on input from Dart, attackers can inject malicious commands to be executed on the underlying operating system.
        * **SQL Injection:** If the native code interacts with a database based on input from Dart, attackers can inject malicious SQL queries to access, modify, or delete data.
        * **Path Traversal:** If the native code handles file paths based on input from Dart, attackers can provide malicious file paths to access or manipulate files outside of the intended scope.

**3. Application-Level Misuse of Native Integration *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***:**

* **Description:** This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the Dart application utilizes the native integration, rather than flaws within the native code itself.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Insufficient Input Validation Before Native Call [CRITICAL] *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***:** Passing untrusted data directly to native functions without proper validation or sanitization. This makes the native code vulnerable to various attacks, including those listed above (e.g., buffer overflows, injection attacks).

**Focus on Mitigation:**

These High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes represent the most significant threats to the application's security when using `dart-lang/native`. Mitigation efforts should prioritize:

* **Secure Coding Practices for Native Code:** Rigorous memory management, input validation, and adherence to secure coding guidelines are crucial to prevent vulnerabilities in the native codebase.
* **Dependency Management:** Carefully select and regularly update third-party native libraries, monitoring for and patching known vulnerabilities.
* **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the Dart side *before* passing data to native functions. This is a critical defense against injection attacks and other forms of data manipulation.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the native code runs with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential impact of a successful exploit.
* **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessments specifically targeting these high-risk areas of the application.
