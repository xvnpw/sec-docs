## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving `package:native`

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Native Library Loading** | An attacker replaces the legitimate native library with a malicious one. The application, upon starting or during runtime, loads this compromised library, and `package:native` is then used to interact with it. | Code execution with application privileges, data theft, denial of service. | `package:native` (facilitating interaction with the loaded, malicious library). | **Critical** | - Verify the integrity of the native library using checksums or digital signatures before loading. - Load native libraries from trusted and read-only locations. - Implement file integrity monitoring for the native library. - Consider using secure boot mechanisms if applicable. |
| **Data Corruption via Incorrect FFI Mapping** | An attacker exploits vulnerabilities arising from incorrect type mapping or size assumptions when passing data between Dart and native code using `dart:ffi`. This can lead to buffer overflows or out-of-bounds access in native memory. | Data corruption, application crashes, potential code execution in native context. | `dart:ffi` (function calls and data marshalling). | **High** | - Rigorously define and enforce data structures and types used in FFI calls. - Use `Pointer.fromAddress` and `asTypedList` with extreme caution, ensuring correct size and type information. - Implement thorough input validation and sanitization on both Dart and native sides. - Utilize memory safety tools (e.g., AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer) during native library development and testing. |
| **Use-After-Free in Native Code Triggered by FFI** | The native library contains a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker crafts specific sequences of FFI calls using `package:native` to trigger this vulnerability, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. | Code execution in native context, data compromise. | `dart:ffi` (triggering vulnerable native functions). | **Critical** | - Follow secure coding practices in the native library, especially regarding memory management. - Conduct thorough static and dynamic analysis of the native library. - Utilize memory safety tools (e.g., AddressSanitizer) during native library development and testing. |
| **Integer Overflow/Underflow in Native Code via FFI Arguments** | An attacker provides large or negative integer values as arguments in FFI calls made through `package:native`, causing integer overflows or underflows in the native code. This can lead to unexpected behavior, buffer overflows, or other vulnerabilities. | Data corruption, potential code execution in native context. | `dart:ffi` (function calls and argument passing). | **High** | - Implement input validation and range checks for integer arguments on both Dart and native sides. - Use appropriate data types in native code to handle the expected range of values. |
| **Format String Vulnerability in Native Code Exposed via FFI** | The native library uses user-controlled input in format string functions (e.g., `printf` in C/C++). An attacker can craft malicious format strings passed from Dart via FFI using `package:native` to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations. | Information disclosure, potential code execution in native context. | `dart:ffi` (passing arguments to vulnerable native functions). | **Critical** | - Avoid using format string functions with user-controlled input in the native library. - If necessary, use safe alternatives or carefully sanitize format strings. |
| **Function Pointer Manipulation via Memory Corruption** | An attacker exploits a memory corruption vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow) in the native library, allowing them to overwrite function pointers. Subsequent calls to these corrupted function pointers made via `dart:ffi` can lead to arbitrary code execution. | Code execution with application privileges. | `dart:ffi` (calling manipulated function pointers). | **Critical** | - Follow secure coding practices in the native library to prevent memory corruption vulnerabilities. - Utilize memory safety tools during native library development and testing. - Implement code integrity checks if feasible. |
