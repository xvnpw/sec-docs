# Threat Model Analysis for dart-lang/http

## Threat: [URL Redirection/SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)](./threats/url_redirectionssrf__server-side_request_forgery_.md)

*   **1. Threat: URL Redirection/SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)**

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when used to construct the URL for an `http` request, redirects the request to an unintended destination.  The attacker might target internal services, cloud metadata endpoints (e.g., `169.254.169.254` on AWS, GCP, Azure), or other servers the application server can reach but the attacker cannot directly access. They might use schemes like `file://` or `gopher://` to interact with local services. The `http` package's functions are directly used to make the manipulated request.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal resources, data exfiltration, potential remote code execution on internal systems, denial of service against internal or external targets.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `http.get()`, `http.post()`, `http.put()`, `http.delete()`, `http.head()`, `http.patch()`, and any other functions that accept a URL as input (directly or indirectly through a `Request` object). The `Uri` class is also directly involved, as it's used to construct URLs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the network environment and accessible resources).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Validate all user-supplied input used in URL construction using a whitelist approach.  Allow only specific, expected characters and patterns.  Reject any input containing suspicious characters or schemes.
        *   **Use `Uri` Class Correctly:**  Always use the `Uri` class's named constructors (e.g., `Uri.https()`, `Uri.http()`) to build URLs.  Avoid string concatenation.  Use the `queryParameters` argument for query parameters, rather than manually encoding them.
        *   **URL Allowlist:** If possible, maintain a list of allowed URLs or URL prefixes.  Reject any request that doesn't match the allowlist.
        *   **Network Segmentation:**  Limit the network access of the application server to reduce the impact of successful SSRF attacks.
        *   **Avoid Relative URLs with Untrusted Base URLs:** If using relative URLs, ensure the base URL is a trusted, hardcoded value, not derived from user input.

## Threat: [Insecure TLS Configuration](./threats/insecure_tls_configuration.md)

*   **2. Threat: Insecure TLS Configuration**

    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a misconfigured TLS setup within the `http` package usage. This could involve the application accepting invalid or self-signed certificates without proper verification, or using weak cipher suites. This is most likely to occur when developers override the default TLS behavior using `IOClient` and a custom `SecurityContext`, or by misusing `badCertificateCallback`. The vulnerability is directly tied to how TLS is handled *within* the `http` client's configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, allowing the attacker to intercept and modify communication between the client and server, leading to data breaches and potential compromise of credentials.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `IOClient` (when used with a custom `SecurityContext`), `badCertificateCallback` (if improperly implemented).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Disable Certificate Verification in Production:**  Use the default `http` client behavior, which relies on the system's trusted certificate store.
        *   **Use `SecurityContext.defaultContext`:** If you need a custom `SecurityContext`, start with `SecurityContext.defaultContext` and modify it carefully.
        *   **Certificate Pinning:**  Implement certificate pinning to verify that the server's certificate matches a known, trusted certificate.
        *   **Strong Cipher Suites:**  Ensure that the application and server are configured to use strong, modern cipher suites.
        *   **Regularly Update CA Certificates:** Keep the system's trusted CA certificates up to date.
        *   **Avoid `badCertificateCallback` Unless Absolutely Necessary:** If you *must* use `badCertificateCallback` (e.g., for testing), ensure it's implemented securely and only used in controlled environments.  Never blindly return `true`.

## Threat: [Header Injection (Focus on Client-Side)](./threats/header_injection__focus_on_client-side_.md)

*   **3. Threat: Header Injection (Focus on Client-Side)**
    * **Description:** While header injection is often a server-side concern, *misuse* of the `http` package can *enable* it. If an attacker can control the values passed to the `headers` parameter of `http` methods (or the `Request` object), they *might* be able to inject headers that, while not directly exploitable on the client, could be used to exploit vulnerabilities *on the server*. This is a subtle but important distinction. The `http` package is the *conduit* for the injected headers. The focus here is on the client-side *creation* of the malicious request.
    * **Impact:** Potentially bypassing security controls on the *server*, cache poisoning, request smuggling (though less likely), influencing application logic on the *server-side*. The impact is realized on the server, but the vulnerability originates in the client's use of `http`.
    * **Affected Component:** The `headers` parameter of `http.get()`, `http.post()`, etc., and the `headers` property of the `Request` object.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (because the impact is on the server, and could be severe).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate any user-supplied data used to construct headers. Avoid directly using user input as header values without sanitization.
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Headers:** If possible, restrict the set of headers that the application is allowed to set.
        *   **Use a Dedicated Header Management Function:** Create a function or class that handles setting headers, ensuring consistent and secure header construction, and preventing the injection of arbitrary headers.
        *   **Avoid CRLF Sequences:** Ensure that user input cannot inject carriage return/line feed (CRLF) characters (`
`) into headers. While the `http` package and `Uri` class *should* handle this correctly if used properly, it's crucial to be aware of this potential issue and validate input accordingly.
