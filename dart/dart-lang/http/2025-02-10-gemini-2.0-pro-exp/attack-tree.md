# Attack Tree Analysis for dart-lang/http

Objective: To cause a denial of service, exfiltrate sensitive data, or execute arbitrary code on the server or client by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations specifically related to the `package:http` library's usage within the Dart application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Keep-Alive Starvation [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__-_keep-alive_starvation__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker sends HTTP requests with incomplete headers or very slow data transmission, keeping connections open for a long time. This exhausts the server's connection pool, preventing legitimate users from connecting.
*   **`package:http` Role:** `package:http` has configurable timeouts, but if the application developer sets excessively long timeouts or disables them, this attack becomes possible.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Service unavailability)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Enforce reasonable timeouts on all HTTP requests using `timeout()`.
    *   Monitor connection counts and response times.
    *   Consider using a reverse proxy (Nginx, HAProxy) for additional protection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Large Request Body [HIGH RISK] {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__-_large_request_body__high_risk__{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker sends a request with a very large body, consuming excessive server memory and potentially causing a crash.
*   **`package:http` Role:** `package:http` doesn't impose a request body size limit; it's the application's responsibility to enforce one.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Service crash, resource exhaustion)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement request body size limits using framework middleware (if available) or by checking `Content-Length` and reading the body in chunks.
    *   Abort requests exceeding the limit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exfiltration/Manipulation - Leaking Auth Tokens/Cookies [HIGH RISK] {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/data_exfiltrationmanipulation_-_leaking_auth_tokenscookies__high_risk__{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** If the Dart application acts as a proxy or forwards requests, it might inadvertently forward sensitive headers (like `Authorization` or `Cookie`) to unintended destinations, exposing credentials.
*   **`package:http` Role:** `package:http` sends the headers provided by the application; it doesn't automatically filter them.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High (Account compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement a strict allowlist/denylist for headers when forwarding requests.
    *   Only forward necessary and safe headers.
    *   Never blindly forward all headers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Execution (RCE/Client-Side) - Unsafe Deserialization [HIGH RISK] {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/code_execution__rceclient-side__-_unsafe_deserialization__high_risk__{critical}.md)

*    **Description:** If the application receives data (e.g., JSON or XML) via `package:http` and then deserializes it using a vulnerable parser, an attacker could exploit a deserialization vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.
*   **`package:http` Role:** `package:http` only provides the raw response body; the vulnerability lies in the *deserialization* process (e.g., using a custom `reviver` with `jsonDecode` that's unsafe, or a vulnerable XML parser).
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low
*   **Impact:** Very High (Arbitrary code execution)
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very High
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data if possible.
    *   If you *must* deserialize, use a safe deserialization library or configuration.
    *   For JSON, be cautious with custom `reviver` functions in `dart:convert`.
    *   For XML, use a well-vetted, secure parser and consider schema validation.
    *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the impact of potential client-side code execution.
