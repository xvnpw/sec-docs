# Deep Analysis: Unvalidated Redirects in Dart's `http` Package

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Unvalidated Redirects" vulnerability when using Dart's `http` package, specifically focusing on how the package's automatic redirect handling feature contributes to the risk. We aim to identify the precise mechanisms involved, potential attack vectors, and effective mitigation strategies, providing actionable guidance for developers.  This analysis will go beyond a simple description and delve into the code-level implications.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Dart's `http` package:**  We are *not* analyzing general HTTP redirect vulnerabilities; our focus is on how `http` handles them.
*   **Automatic Redirect Following:**  The core of the vulnerability lies in `http`'s ability to automatically follow redirects (3xx status codes).
*   **Client-side perspective:** We are analyzing the vulnerability from the perspective of a Dart application *using* the `http` package to make requests, not from the perspective of a server *sending* redirects.
*   **Version:** This analysis is relevant to all versions of `http` that support automatic redirect following.  Specific version-related quirks will be noted if discovered.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:** Examine the relevant source code of the `http` package (specifically the `Client` class and related methods) to understand how redirects are handled internally.
2.  **Vulnerability Reproduction:** Create simple Dart scripts that demonstrate the vulnerability by making requests to servers that issue redirects.
3.  **Attack Vector Exploration:**  Identify various ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability, considering different scenarios and potential payloads.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:**  Test and validate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies, including code examples.
5.  **Documentation Review:** Consult the official `http` package documentation and relevant Dart language specifications.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 4.1. Mechanism of Vulnerability

The `http` package, by default, automatically follows HTTP redirects.  This behavior is implemented within the `Client` class.  When a response with a 3xx status code (e.g., 301, 302, 307, 308) is received, and the `location` header is present, the `Client` automatically creates a new request to the URL specified in the `location` header.  This new request inherits characteristics from the original request, including:

*   **Headers:**  Headers like `Cookie`, `Authorization`, and custom headers are often forwarded.  This is the *primary security concern*.
*   **Method:**  The HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) *may* be preserved, depending on the specific redirect status code (307 and 308 preserve the method; 301, 302, and 303 traditionally change POST to GET, but this behavior is not strictly enforced by all clients/servers).
*   **Body:**  The request body is generally *not* forwarded on a redirect, except for 307 and 308 redirects.

The vulnerability arises because the `http` package, in its default configuration, does *not* perform any validation on the URL provided in the `location` header.  It blindly follows the redirect, regardless of the target domain or protocol.

### 4.2. Attack Vectors

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability in several ways:

1.  **Phishing:** The most common attack.  The attacker crafts a URL that initially points to a legitimate-looking domain (or a compromised resource on a legitimate domain).  This initial URL redirects the user to a phishing site that mimics the legitimate site, attempting to steal credentials or other sensitive information.  The user's browser will display the malicious URL, but the initial interaction might have appeared safe.

    *   **Example:**
        *   User clicks: `https://example.com/login?redirect=...` (attacker-controlled `redirect` parameter)
        *   `example.com` responds with 302 to `https://evil.com/login` (attacker-controlled site)
        *   `http` automatically follows, sending the user's request (potentially with cookies from `example.com`) to `evil.com`.

2.  **Open Redirect:**  Similar to phishing, but the attacker's goal might be to bypass security controls or redirect the user to a site that exploits browser vulnerabilities.  This can be used to circumvent same-origin policy (SOP) restrictions in some cases.

3.  **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - Limited:**  If the redirect points to an internal resource (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/admin`), the `http` client might follow the redirect, potentially exposing internal services.  This is less likely with `http` than with server-side libraries, as browsers typically restrict access to localhost from external origins.  However, if the Dart application is running in a context with access to internal networks (e.g., a server-side application or a desktop application), SSRF becomes a more significant concern.

4.  **Cookie Theft/Session Hijacking:** If the initial request includes cookies, and the redirect is to a different domain controlled by the attacker, those cookies will be sent to the attacker's server. This allows the attacker to potentially hijack the user's session.

5.  **Information Disclosure:** Even if the redirect doesn't lead to a full-blown phishing attack, it can leak sensitive information in the headers.  For example, custom headers containing API keys or authentication tokens could be exposed to the attacker.

### 4.3. Code Examples

**Vulnerable Code (Default Behavior):**

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() async {
  final url = Uri.parse('https://example.com/redirect?to=https://malicious.com'); // Attacker-controlled URL
  final response = await http.get(url);
  print('Final URL: ${response.request?.url}'); // Will print https://malicious.com
  print('Status Code: ${response.statusCode}');
}
```

**Mitigation 1: Disable Automatic Redirects (Most Secure):**

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

class NoRedirectClient extends http.BaseClient {
  final http.Client _inner = http.Client();

  @override
  Future<http.StreamedResponse> send(http.BaseRequest request) async {
    final response = await _inner.send(request);
    if (response.isRedirect) {
      // Handle redirect manually, or throw an error.
      throw Exception('Redirect detected: ${response.headers['location']}');
    }
    return response;
  }
    @override
  void close() {
    _inner.close();
    super.close();
  }
}

void main() async {
  final client = NoRedirectClient();
  final url = Uri.parse('https://example.com/redirect?to=https://malicious.com');
  try {
    final response = await client.get(url);
    print('Final URL: ${response.request?.url}');
    print('Status Code: ${response.statusCode}');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error: $e'); // Will print the redirect error.
  } finally {
    client.close();
  }
}
```

**Mitigation 2: Whitelist Redirect Targets:**

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

class WhitelistRedirectClient extends http.BaseClient {
  final http.Client _inner = http.Client();
  final List<String> allowedDomains = ['example.com', 'www.example.com'];

  @override
  Future<http.StreamedResponse> send(http.BaseRequest request) async {
    final response = await _inner.send(request);
    if (response.isRedirect) {
      final redirectUrl = Uri.parse(response.headers['location']!);
      if (!allowedDomains.contains(redirectUrl.host)) {
        throw Exception('Unauthorized redirect: ${redirectUrl.host}');
      }
    }
    return response;
  }
    @override
  void close() {
    _inner.close();
    super.close();
  }
}

void main() async {
  final client = WhitelistRedirectClient();
  final url = Uri.parse('https://example.com/redirect?to=https://malicious.com'); // This will now throw an exception
  try {
    final response = await client.get(url);
    print('Final URL: ${response.request?.url}');
    print('Status Code: ${response.statusCode}');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error: $e');
  } finally {
    client.close();
  }
}
```

**Mitigation 3: Check `response.isRedirect` and `response.headers['location']`:**
```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() async {
  final client = http.Client();
  final url = Uri.parse('https://example.com/redirect?to=https://malicious.com');
    final response = await client.get(url);
    if (response.isRedirect) {
      final redirectUrl = Uri.parse(response.headers['location']!);
      // Implement your logic to check the redirectUrl
      // For example, check against a whitelist, or display a warning to the user.
      print('Redirect detected to: ${redirectUrl}');
      if (redirectUrl.host != 'example.com')
      {
        print('Potentially dangerous redirect. Aborting.');
        client.close();
        return;
      }
    }
    print('Final URL: ${response.request?.url}');
    print('Status Code: ${response.statusCode}');
    client.close();
}
```

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategy Evaluation

*   **Disable Automatic Redirects:** This is the *most effective* mitigation.  It completely eliminates the attack surface by preventing the `http` client from automatically following any redirects.  The developer is forced to handle redirects manually, providing full control and visibility.  The downside is that it requires more code and careful handling of redirect responses.

*   **Whitelist Redirect Targets:** This is a good option if automatic redirects are necessary, but it requires careful maintenance of the whitelist.  Any legitimate redirect targets that are not on the whitelist will be blocked.  It's also crucial to ensure that the whitelist is implemented correctly and cannot be bypassed.  Consider using a robust URL parsing library to avoid potential parsing vulnerabilities.

*  **Check `response.isRedirect` and `response.headers['location']`:** This approach is less secure than disabling redirects entirely, but it allows for more flexibility. It's crucial to implement *thorough* validation of the `location` header before proceeding. This method is prone to errors if the validation logic is flawed.

### 4.5. Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Disabling Redirects:**  The recommended approach is to disable automatic redirects and handle them manually. This provides the highest level of security.

2.  **Use a Custom Client:**  Create a custom `Client` class (as shown in the examples) to encapsulate the redirect handling logic.  This makes the code more maintainable and easier to test.

3.  **Thoroughly Validate Redirect URLs:** If you must use automatic redirects, implement a strict whitelist and validate the `location` header using a robust URL parsing library.  Consider all potential attack vectors, including relative URLs, different protocols, and unusual characters.

4.  **Educate Developers:** Ensure that all developers working with the `http` package are aware of this vulnerability and the recommended mitigation strategies.

5.  **Regularly Review Code:**  Periodically review the code that handles HTTP requests and redirects to ensure that the mitigation strategies are still in place and effective.

6.  **Consider Security Audits:** For critical applications, consider performing regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including unvalidated redirects.

7. **Stay Updated:** Keep the `http` package and its dependencies up-to-date to benefit from any security patches or improvements.
