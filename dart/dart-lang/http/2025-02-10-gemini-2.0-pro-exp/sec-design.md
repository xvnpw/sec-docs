Okay, let's create a design document for the Dart `http` package, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Dart `http` package is a fundamental building block for many Dart and Flutter applications that need to interact with web services.  It's a community-maintained, open-source project, crucial for the Dart ecosystem's health.

Priorities:

*   Provide a stable, reliable, and easy-to-use API for making HTTP requests.
*   Maintain compatibility across different Dart platforms (web, server, mobile).
*   Ensure the package is performant and doesn't introduce unnecessary overhead.
*   Keep the package up-to-date with evolving web standards and security best practices.
*   Maintain a good developer experience, making it easy to contribute and report issues.

Goals:

*   Enable Dart developers to easily consume and interact with HTTP-based APIs.
*   Facilitate the development of network-connected applications in Dart.
*   Provide a composable and extensible API for handling various HTTP scenarios.

Business Risks:

*   Vulnerabilities in the `http` package could be exploited to compromise applications that use it, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or other security incidents.  This is the *most critical risk* due to the package's widespread use.
*   Performance issues or bugs in the package could negatively impact the performance and reliability of dependent applications.
*   Lack of support for newer HTTP features or protocols could limit the capabilities of applications built with the package.
*   Inadequate documentation or a difficult-to-use API could hinder adoption and lead developers to use less secure alternatives.
*   Lack of maintenance or slow response to security issues could erode trust in the package and the Dart ecosystem.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Code Reviews: All changes to the `http` package go through a code review process on GitHub. (Implemented in: GitHub pull request workflow).
*   security control: Static Analysis: The Dart analyzer is used to identify potential code quality and security issues. (Implemented in: CI workflows, developer tooling).
*   security control: Automated Tests: The package has a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests to ensure functionality and prevent regressions. (Implemented in: CI workflows, `test/` directory).
*   security control: Dependency Management: Dependencies are managed using `pubspec.yaml` and `pubspec.lock` files, ensuring consistent and reproducible builds. (Implemented in: project files).
*   security control: Fuzz testing: The project uses fuzz testing to check for unexpected inputs. (Implemented in: fuzz/ directory).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The package relies on the underlying platform's HTTP client implementations (e.g., `dart:io`'s `HttpClient` on the server, the browser's `fetch` API on the web).  Vulnerabilities in these underlying implementations are outside the direct control of the `http` package.
*   accepted risk: The package does not provide built-in mechanisms for advanced security features like mutual TLS (mTLS) or OAuth. Developers are responsible for implementing these features using other libraries or custom code if needed.
*   accepted risk: The package does not automatically handle all possible HTTP error conditions or edge cases. Developers are responsible for implementing appropriate error handling and retry logic in their applications.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   security control: Implement a security policy (SECURITY.md) that clearly outlines how to report security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Consider adding more fuzzing tests to cover a wider range of input scenarios.
*   security control: Explore the use of static analysis tools specifically designed for security vulnerability detection (e.g., SAST tools).

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The package should provide a way to easily set authentication headers (e.g., Basic, Bearer).
    *   The package should not store or manage credentials directly. Credential management is the responsibility of the application.

*   Authorization:
    *   The package should not handle authorization logic. Authorization is the responsibility of the application and the server it communicates with.

*   Input Validation:
    *   The package should validate user-provided URLs to prevent common injection vulnerabilities.
    *   The package should properly encode data sent in requests (e.g., URL encoding, escaping special characters).

*   Cryptography:
    *   The package should rely on the underlying platform's TLS/SSL implementation for secure communication over HTTPS.
    *   The package should not implement its own cryptographic algorithms.

3.  **GitHub Repository:** The central repository stores the source code and triggers CI workflows.
4.  **GitHub Actions (CI):**  GitHub Actions is used as the CI/CD system.  Workflows are triggered on pull requests and pushes to the main branch.
5.  **Dart Analyzer:** The Dart analyzer runs static analysis checks to identify code quality and potential security issues.
6.  **Unit & Integration Tests:** The test suite is executed to ensure functionality and prevent regressions.
7.  **Fuzz Tests:** Fuzz tests are executed to check for unexpected inputs.
8.  **Build Artifact (e.g., Docker Image):** If all checks pass, a build artifact is created.  For a server-side application, this is typically a Docker image.
9.  **Container Registry:** The Docker image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   Code reviews (GitHub pull requests).
*   Static analysis (Dart analyzer).
*   Automated tests (unit and integration tests).
*   Fuzz testing.
*   Dependency management (`pubspec.yaml` and `pubspec.lock`).
*   Use of a CI/CD system (GitHub Actions) to automate the build and testing process.
*   Container image scanning (if applicable, using tools like Trivy or Clair).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Making HTTP requests to external services: This is the core functionality of the `http` package and is essential for any application that relies on it to communicate with web services.
*   Maintaining the stability and reliability of the Dart ecosystem: The `http` package is a foundational component, and its health is critical to the overall success of Dart and Flutter.

Data to Protect:

*   Data transmitted over HTTP: This includes any data sent to or received from external services. The sensitivity of this data depends on the specific application and the services it interacts with.  Examples include:
    *   **High Sensitivity:** User credentials, personal data, financial information, API keys.
    *   **Medium Sensitivity:** Session tokens, configuration data.
    *   **Low Sensitivity:** Publicly available data.
*   Source code of the `http` package: While the code is open source, protecting it from unauthorized modification is important to prevent the introduction of malicious code.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA) that apply to applications using the `http` package? This would influence the security controls needed in the applications themselves.
*   What is the expected threat model for typical applications using the `http` package?  Are they primarily web applications, mobile apps, or server-side applications? This helps prioritize security considerations.
*   What level of support is expected for older versions of Dart and the `http` package? This impacts the ability to backport security fixes.

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: We assume a moderate risk appetite, balancing the need for rapid development and innovation with the importance of security. The project is community-driven, so resources for security may be limited.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: We assume that developers using the `http` package are responsible for implementing appropriate security controls in their own applications, including authentication, authorization, and data validation.
*   DESIGN: We assume that the underlying platform's HTTP client implementations are reasonably secure. We also assume that developers will use HTTPS for sensitive data transmission.
