# Threat Model Analysis for dart-lang/http

## Threat: [URL Injection](./threats/url_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the URL used in an HTTP request by injecting malicious characters or code. This is done by exploiting insufficient input validation or sanitization when constructing the URL string using the `http` library's functions. The attacker might redirect the request to a malicious server, access unintended resources on the legitimate server, or bypass security checks.

**Impact:** Data breaches (accessing sensitive information), redirection to phishing sites, execution of unintended server-side actions, compromise of server integrity.

**Affected Component:** `Uri.parse` function, `http.get`, `http.post`, `http.put`, `http.delete`, `http.head`, `http.patch` functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use parameterized queries or properly encode user-supplied data when constructing URLs.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data that influences the URL.
*   Avoid directly concatenating user input into URL strings.
*   Utilize the `Uri` class's methods for building URLs safely.

## Threat: [Body Manipulation (for POST/PUT/PATCH requests)](./threats/body_manipulation__for_postputpatch_requests_.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the request body content in POST, PUT, or PATCH requests made using the `http` library. This is achieved by exploiting insufficient input validation or sanitization when constructing the request body using the library's functions. The attacker might inject malicious data, alter existing data, or introduce unexpected parameters.

**Impact:** Data corruption, injection of malicious payloads, unauthorized data modification, potential exploitation of server-side vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** The `body` parameter in `http.Request` constructor, `http.post`, `http.put`, `http.patch` functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all data included in the request body.
*   Use appropriate encoding (e.g., JSON encoding) when constructing the request body.
*   Avoid directly concatenating unsanitized user input into the request body when using the `http` library.
*   Implement server-side validation of the request body content.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (due to improper `http` client configuration)](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks__due_to_improper__http__client_configuration_.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application (using the `http` library) and the server. This is possible if the application doesn't enforce HTTPS or disables certificate validation within the `http` client's configuration. The attacker can eavesdrop on the communication, steal sensitive data, and potentially modify the data in transit.

**Impact:** Data breaches, session hijacking, data manipulation, injection of malicious content.

**Affected Component:** The underlying network communication handled by the `Client` class, specifically its SSL/TLS configuration.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always use HTTPS (`https://`) for all sensitive communications.**
*   **Ensure proper SSL/TLS certificate validation is enabled in the `http` client configuration.** Do not disable certificate verification in production environments.
*   Consider using certificate pinning within the `http` client for enhanced security in specific scenarios.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the `dart-lang/http` Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the__dart-langhttp__library_itself.md)

**Description:** The `dart-lang/http` library, like any software, might contain undiscovered vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities in the library code to compromise the application's communication or even the application itself.

**Impact:** Various impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** Any part of the `dart-lang/http` library code.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep the `http` package updated to the latest stable version.** This ensures you have the latest security patches.
*   Monitor security advisories and release notes for the `dart-lang/http` library.
*   Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in your code and dependencies.
