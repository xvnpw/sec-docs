### 4. Deep Analysis: Inject Malicious Headers

#### 4.1. Understanding the Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Headers

Header Injection is a type of web security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can control or influence the HTTP headers sent by a web application.  In the context of request construction, this means an attacker can inject malicious or unexpected headers into an HTTP request being built by the application.

**How it works:**

Applications often construct HTTP requests dynamically, sometimes incorporating user-provided input into various parts of the request, including headers. If this user input is not properly sanitized or validated before being used to set HTTP headers, an attacker can inject malicious content.

**Why it's a risk:**

HTTP headers control various aspects of communication between the client and server. By injecting malicious headers, an attacker can potentially:

*   **Session Hijacking:** Inject headers like `Cookie` to manipulate or steal session cookies.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Inject headers like `Content-Type` or `X-XSS-Protection` to bypass security measures or trigger XSS vulnerabilities (though less common directly via request headers, more relevant in response header injection).
*   **Cache Poisoning:** Inject headers that influence caching behavior, potentially causing malicious content to be cached and served to other users.
*   **Open Redirect:** In some scenarios, manipulate headers related to redirects.
*   **Bypass Security Controls:**  Inject headers to circumvent security mechanisms or access control.

In the context of `dart-lang/http`, the vulnerability arises when developers use user-controlled input to directly set or modify HTTP headers without proper validation or sanitization.

#### 4.2. Technical Details and Exploitation with `dart-lang/http`

The `dart-lang/http` library provides flexibility in constructing HTTP requests, including the ability to set custom headers.  The primary way to set headers is through the `headers` parameter in request methods like `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, etc., and when creating a `Request` object directly.

**Vulnerable Scenario:**

Imagine an application that allows users to customize a report by specifying certain parameters, and for some reason, the application decides to include a user-provided value as a custom header in the HTTP request to fetch the report data.

**Dart Code Example (Vulnerable):**

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() async {
  // Simulate user input for a custom header value
  String userHeaderValue = "My-Custom-Header: malicious\r\nX-Malicious-Header: injected"; // Attacker input

  // Construct headers map, potentially including user input directly
  Map<String, String> headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'User-Agent': 'MyDartApp',
    'Custom-User-Header': userHeaderValue, // Directly using user input! VULNERABLE!
  };

  final url = Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/report');

  try {
    final response = await http.get(url, headers: headers);

    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      print('Report fetched successfully!');
      print('Response body: ${response.body}');
    } else {
      print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}');
    }
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error during request: $e');
  }
}
```

**Explanation of Vulnerability:**

In this vulnerable example, the `userHeaderValue` is directly incorporated into the `headers` map without any sanitization. An attacker can craft a malicious `userHeaderValue` containing newline characters (`\r\n`) followed by additional headers.  When the `http` library sends this request, it will interpret the injected newline characters as header separators, effectively injecting new headers into the request.

**Example Attack Payload:**

If an attacker provides the following as `userHeaderValue`:

```
"Value\r\nX-Injected: Malicious"
```

The resulting HTTP request headers sent by the `dart-lang/http` library (simplified representation) might look something like this:

```
GET /report HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: MyDartApp
Custom-User-Header: Value
X-Injected: Malicious  <-- INJECTED HEADER!
```

The attacker has successfully injected the `X-Injected: Malicious` header. While this specific example might seem harmless, attackers can inject headers with more serious consequences, depending on the application's backend and how it processes headers.

**Potential Impact Scenarios:**

*   **Cache Poisoning (if backend caches based on headers):**  Injecting headers that influence caching directives could lead to cache poisoning.
*   **Unexpected Backend Behavior:**  Depending on the backend application logic, injected headers might trigger unintended actions or bypass security checks.
*   **Information Disclosure (less direct in request header injection):** In some complex scenarios, injected headers could indirectly lead to information disclosure.

#### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies and Secure Coding Practices with `dart-lang/http`

To prevent header injection vulnerabilities when using `dart-lang/http`, developers should implement the following mitigation strategies:

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**

    *   **Strictly Validate User Input:**  Never directly use user-provided input as header values without rigorous validation. Define allowed characters, formats, and lengths for header values.
    *   **Sanitize Input:**  If user input must be used in headers, sanitize it to remove or encode potentially harmful characters, especially newline characters (`\r`, `\n`).  Consider using a whitelist approach, only allowing known safe characters.
    *   **Avoid User-Controlled Headers if Possible:**  Re-evaluate the necessity of allowing user-controlled headers. If possible, avoid using user input directly in headers altogether.  Consider alternative methods to achieve the desired functionality, such as using request parameters instead of headers.

2.  **Use Parameterized Queries Instead of Headers for Data Transfer (When Applicable):**

    *   If the goal is to pass data to the server, prefer using URL parameters or request body data (e.g., JSON, form data) instead of custom headers whenever feasible. This reduces the risk of header injection.

3.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) and other Security Headers (For Response Header Injection Prevention - Indirectly Relevant):**

    *   While this analysis focuses on request header injection, be aware that response header injection is a more common and often higher-impact vulnerability.  Implement security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) in your backend application to mitigate risks associated with response header manipulation (which could be indirectly related if request header injection somehow influences response headers).

**Secure Code Example (Mitigated):**

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'dart:convert'; // For encoding

void main() async {
  // Simulate user input for a custom header value
  String userHeaderValueUnsafe = "Value\r\nX-Malicious: Injected"; // Attacker input
  String userHeaderValueSafe;

  // 1. Input Validation and Sanitization (Example: Whitelist approach)
  String allowedChars = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9\-_]+$'; // Allow alphanumeric, hyphen, underscore
  if (RegExp(allowedChars).hasMatch(userHeaderValueUnsafe)) {
    userHeaderValueSafe = userHeaderValueUnsafe; // Input is considered safe based on whitelist
  } else {
    userHeaderValueSafe = 'Invalid-Header-Value'; // Default safe value if input is invalid
    print('Warning: User-provided header value is invalid and has been replaced.');
  }

  // OR 2. Sanitization (Example: Encoding newline characters - less ideal for headers)
  // userHeaderValueSafe = Uri.encodeComponent(userHeaderValueUnsafe); // Encoding might not be sufficient for header injection prevention

  // Construct headers map with sanitized/validated user input
  Map<String, String> headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'User-Agent': 'MyDartApp',
    'Custom-User-Header': userHeaderValueSafe, // Using sanitized/validated input
  };

  final url = Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/report');

  try {
    final response = await http.get(url, headers: headers);

    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      print('Report fetched successfully!');
      print('Response body: ${response.body}');
    } else {
      print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}');
    }
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error during request: $e');
  }
}
```

**Explanation of Secure Code:**

*   **Input Validation (Whitelist Example):** The secure example demonstrates input validation using a regular expression whitelist (`allowedChars`). It checks if the `userHeaderValueUnsafe` matches the allowed pattern. If it does, it's considered safe; otherwise, a default safe value is used.
*   **Sanitization (Encoding - Less Recommended for Headers):**  While encoding (like `Uri.encodeComponent`) can be used for sanitization in some contexts, it's generally less effective for preventing header injection because newline characters might still be interpreted as header separators after encoding in certain scenarios.  Whitelist validation is generally a stronger approach for headers.
*   **Using Sanitized Input:** The `userHeaderValueSafe` (the validated/sanitized version) is used when constructing the `headers` map, ensuring that malicious input is not directly injected.

#### 4.4. Detection and Prevention Tools and Techniques

*   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools that can analyze Dart code for potential vulnerabilities, including insecure header handling. These tools can identify code patterns where user input is directly used in headers without proper validation.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools to perform runtime testing of the application. DAST tools can send crafted HTTP requests with malicious headers to identify if the application is vulnerable to header injection.
*   **Manual Code Review:** Conduct thorough manual code reviews, specifically focusing on code sections where HTTP requests are constructed and headers are set, especially when user input is involved.
*   **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):**  While WAFs primarily protect against attacks targeting the server, they can sometimes detect and block requests with suspicious headers, providing a layer of defense.
*   **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities, including header injection, in your Dart applications.

### 5. Actionable Insights and Conclusion

The "Inject Malicious Headers" attack vector, while seemingly simple, can pose a real security risk if developers are not careful when constructing HTTP requests using libraries like `dart-lang/http`. Directly using unsanitized user input to set HTTP headers can lead to various security vulnerabilities, including session hijacking, cache poisoning, and unexpected backend behavior.

**Key Actionable Insights:**

*   **Prioritize Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data that might be used in HTTP headers.
*   **Avoid User-Controlled Headers When Possible:** Re-evaluate the necessity of user-controlled headers and explore alternative approaches like using request parameters.
*   **Adopt Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines and best practices when working with HTTP requests and headers in Dart.
*   **Utilize Security Testing Tools:** Integrate SAST and DAST tools into your development pipeline to automatically detect potential header injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address security weaknesses in your applications.

By understanding the mechanics of header injection attacks and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability in their Dart applications using the `dart-lang/http` library and build more secure software.
