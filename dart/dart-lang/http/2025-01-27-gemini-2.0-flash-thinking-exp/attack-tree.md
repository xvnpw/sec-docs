## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application Using dart-lang/http [CRITICAL NODE: Root Goal]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_using_dart-langhttp__critical_node_root_goal_.md)

This is the ultimate attacker objective. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing harm to the application utilizing the `dart-lang/http` library.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities (Application Misuse of http) [CRITICAL NODE: Client-Side Misuse]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities__application_misuse_of_http___critical_node_client-side_misus_f58089c3.md)

This category represents vulnerabilities arising from developers incorrectly using the `dart-lang/http` library. It's not a flaw in the library itself, but in how it's integrated into the application's code.
    *   Focus should be on secure coding practices when using the library.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Insecure Request Construction [CRITICAL NODE: Insecure Request Construction]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__insecure_request_construction__critical_node_insecure_request_construction_.md)

This critical node highlights vulnerabilities stemming from improperly constructing HTTP requests using the `dart-lang/http` library.
    *   Attack Vectors:
        *   **URL Manipulation:**
            *   **Inject Malicious Parameters [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker injects malicious parameters into the URL, often through user-controlled input that is not properly sanitized.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** Medium (Data exfiltration, unauthorized actions)
                *   **Effort:** Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                *   **Actionable Insight:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data used in URL construction. Use parameterized queries where possible.
        *   **Header Injection [HIGH RISK PATH START]:**
            *   **Inject Malicious Headers [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker injects malicious headers into the HTTP request, often through user-controlled input used in header values.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** Medium (Session hijacking, XSS, cache poisoning)
                *   **Effort:** Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                *   **Actionable Insight:** Sanitize user input used in custom headers. Be cautious about allowing user-controlled header values.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Insecure HTTP Client Configuration [CRITICAL NODE: Insecure Client Config]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__insecure_http_client_configuration__critical_node_insecure_client_config_.md)

This critical node represents vulnerabilities arising from misconfiguring the `dart-lang/http` client.
    *   Attack Vectors:
        *   **Disabled TLS/SSL Verification [CRITICAL NODE: Disabled TLS Verification] [HIGH RISK PATH START]:**
            *   **Disable Certificate Verification [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE: Disable Cert Verification]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  TLS/SSL certificate verification is disabled, often mistakenly left in production after being used for testing or development.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common developer mistake)
                *   **Impact:** High (MITM attacks, data interception)
                *   **Effort:** Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
                *   **Actionable Insight:** **Never disable TLS/SSL certificate verification in production.** Enforce strict certificate validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Network-Level Vulnerabilities (Indirectly related to http, but relevant in context) [CRITICAL NODE: Network Vulnerabilities]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_network-level_vulnerabilities__indirectly_related_to_http__but_relevant_in_context___crit_199f3d30.md)

This category addresses network-level attacks that can compromise the security of HTTP communication facilitated by `dart-lang/http`.
    *   Focus is on ensuring secure network communication practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks [CRITICAL NODE: MITM Attacks] [HIGH RISK PATH START]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks__critical_node_mitm_attacks___high_risk_path_start_.md)

This critical node represents the threat of Man-in-the-Middle attacks, where an attacker intercepts communication between the application and the server.
    *   Attack Vectors:
        *   **Network Interception [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE: Network Interception]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the server, often on insecure networks like public Wi-Fi.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium (On insecure networks)
                *   **Impact:** High (Data interception, credential theft)
