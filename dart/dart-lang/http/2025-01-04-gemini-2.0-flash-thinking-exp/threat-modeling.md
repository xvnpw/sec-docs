# Threat Model Analysis for dart-lang/http

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate user-controlled input that is used to construct URLs within the application's code. By injecting malicious URLs, the attacker can force the application to make requests using `http` library functions to unintended destinations.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal resources, potential compromise of other systems within the network, data breaches, denial of service against internal services, and exfiltration of sensitive information.
*   **Affected Component:** `http.get`, `http.post`, `http.put`, `http.delete`, and other functions that facilitate making HTTP requests based on provided URLs. Specifically, the URL parameter passed to these functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data that influences the target URL.
    *   Utilize allow-lists to define permissible target domains or IP ranges.
    *   Avoid directly constructing URLs from user input.
    *   Consider using a URL parsing library to validate and normalize URLs before using them with the `http` library.
    *   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF if it occurs.

## Threat: [Header Injection](./threats/header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious HTTP headers by manipulating user-controlled input that is directly incorporated into the `headers` parameter of requests made using the `http` library. This can lead to various vulnerabilities, such as cache poisoning or session fixation.
*   **Impact:** Cache poisoning leading to serving malicious content, session hijacking or fixation, bypassing security checks, and potential information disclosure.
*   **Affected Component:** The `headers` parameter in `http.get`, `http.post`, `http.put`, `http.delete`, and other request functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid directly using user input to construct HTTP headers.
    *   If user input must be included in headers, strictly validate and sanitize the input to prevent newline characters (`\n`, `\r`) and other control characters.
    *   Use the `http` library's methods for setting headers in a safe and controlled manner, avoiding direct string concatenation.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (related to certificate validation)](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks__related_to_certificate_validation_.md)

*   **Description:** While the `http` library supports HTTPS, improper configuration or handling of certificate validation can leave the application vulnerable to MitM attacks. An attacker intercepting the communication can eavesdrop on or manipulate the data exchanged between the application and the server if certificate validation is disabled or improperly implemented by the application using the `http` library.
*   **Impact:** Confidential information disclosure, data tampering, and potential injection of malicious content.
*   **Affected Component:** The underlying TLS/SSL implementation used by the `http` library and how the application configures or interacts with it.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that the application relies on the default, secure certificate validation provided by the operating system or platform.
    *   Avoid disabling certificate validation unless absolutely necessary and with a thorough understanding of the risks.
    *   Consider using certificate pinning for critical connections to enforce trust in specific certificates.
    *   Keep the underlying operating system and TLS libraries updated.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization (if handling serialized data in responses)](./threats/insecure_deserialization__if_handling_serialized_data_in_responses_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application receives serialized data (e.g., JSON, XML) in the response obtained via the `http` library and deserializes it without proper validation, an attacker could potentially manipulate the server's response to inject malicious data. This could lead to code execution on the client side or other unexpected behavior.
*   **Impact:** Client-side code execution, application crashes, data corruption, and potential information disclosure.
*   **Affected Component:** The response handling logic, specifically when processing the response body obtained from the `http` library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize data received in the response before deserialization.
    *   Use safe deserialization methods and avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources without proper validation.
    *   Define expected data structures and validate the received data against these structures.

## Threat: [Reliance on insecure or deprecated HTTP features](./threats/reliance_on_insecure_or_deprecated_http_features.md)

*   **Description:** The application might inadvertently rely on insecure or deprecated HTTP features (e.g., basic authentication over non-HTTPS) when using the `http` library, exposing credentials or other sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of credentials or sensitive data transmitted over insecure connections.
*   **Affected Component:** The configuration and usage of specific features provided by the `http` library, such as authentication mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow security best practices for HTTP usage.
    *   Prefer secure alternatives to deprecated features (e.g., OAuth 2.0 instead of basic authentication over HTTP).
    *   Always use HTTPS for transmitting sensitive information, including authentication credentials when using the `http` library.

## Threat: [Dependency vulnerabilities in `http` library itself](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in__http__library_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities might exist within the `dart-lang/http` library itself or its dependencies.
*   **Impact:** Potential for various security vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the library. This could range from remote code execution to information disclosure.
*   **Affected Component:** The `dart-lang/http` library and its transitive dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update the `http` library to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories related to the `http` library and its dependencies.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies.
