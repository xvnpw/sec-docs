# Attack Surface Analysis for dart-lang/http

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Request Parameters](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_request_parameters.md)

**Description:** The application constructs HTTP request elements (URLs, headers, body) using untrusted input without proper validation or sanitization.

**How `http` Contributes:** The `http` package provides methods to construct and send requests, but it doesn't enforce input validation. If the application uses user-provided data directly in request parameters, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker modifies a URL parameter like `https://example.com/search?query=<script>alert('XSS')</script>` which, if not properly handled by the server, could lead to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The `http.get()` function would send this crafted URL.

**Impact:**  Can lead to various attacks like XSS, server-side request forgery (SSRF), or unintended data manipulation on the server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user-provided data before using it in HTTP requests. Use whitelisting and regular expressions where appropriate.
* **Parameter Encoding:**  Properly encode data used in URLs and request bodies using methods provided by the `http` package or dedicated encoding libraries.
* **Avoid Direct String Concatenation:**  Use parameterized queries or builder patterns offered by backend frameworks to construct URLs safely.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

**Description:** The application configures the `http` client to use insecure TLS/SSL settings, weakening the security of the connection.

**How `http` Contributes:** The `http` package allows customization of TLS/SSL settings through the `Client` class, including the `badCertificateCallback`. Misusing these options can introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:**  Disabling certificate verification using `Client(badCertificateCallback: (cert, host, port) => true)` allows the application to connect to servers with invalid or self-signed certificates, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact:**  Sensitive data transmitted over the connection can be intercepted and read by attackers.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enable Certificate Verification:**  Ensure the default certificate verification is enabled. Avoid using `badCertificateCallback` in production.
* **Use Strong TLS Protocols:**  Configure the client to use only strong and modern TLS protocols.
* **Pin Certificates (Advanced):**  For highly sensitive applications, consider certificate pinning to further restrict accepted certificates.

## Attack Surface: [Cookie Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/cookie_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The application mishandles cookies received from or sent to servers, potentially exposing session information or other sensitive data.

**How `http` Contributes:** The `http` package manages cookies automatically. If the application doesn't enforce secure cookie practices, vulnerabilities can arise.

**Example:**  The application receives a session cookie without the `HttpOnly` flag. A malicious JavaScript on the page could then access this cookie and send it to a third-party server, leading to session hijacking.

**Impact:**  Session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Server-Side Cookie Configuration:** Ensure the backend sets appropriate cookie flags (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`).
* **Avoid Storing Sensitive Data in Cookies:**  Do not store highly sensitive information directly in cookies. Use session identifiers instead.
* **Secure Cookie Storage (Client-Side):** If the application needs to store cookies client-side, use secure storage mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Requests](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_requests.md)

**Description:** The application unintentionally includes sensitive data (API keys, secrets, personal information) in HTTP requests.

**How `http` Contributes:** The `http` package facilitates sending various types of data in requests. If developers are not careful, they might inadvertently include sensitive information in URLs, headers, or bodies.

**Example:**  An API key is included directly in the URL as a query parameter: `https://api.example.com/data?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY`. This key could be logged in server access logs or browser history.

**Impact:**  Leakage of sensitive credentials or personal data, potentially leading to unauthorized access or identity theft.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid Including Secrets in URLs:**  Never include API keys, passwords, or other secrets in URL parameters.
* **Use Secure Transmission Methods:**  Transmit sensitive data in the request body over HTTPS.
* **Use Secure Headers:**  Utilize appropriate HTTP headers for authentication (e.g., `Authorization` with bearer tokens) instead of embedding credentials in URLs.
