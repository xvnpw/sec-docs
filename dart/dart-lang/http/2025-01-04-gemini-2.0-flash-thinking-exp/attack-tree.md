## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate HTTP Requests](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_http_requests.md)

- Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Data into Request Parameters [CRITICAL NODE]
    - Description: Attackers inject malicious data into URL parameters or request body parameters.
    - Potential Impact: Data breaches, unauthorized actions, application errors, SQL injection (if backend is vulnerable).
    - Mitigation: Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data used to construct HTTP requests. Use parameterized queries or equivalent mechanisms.

- Attack Vector: Arbitrary Header Injection [CRITICAL NODE]
    - Description: Attackers inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the request.
    - Potential Impact: Bypassing security checks, cache poisoning, HTTP response splitting, session hijacking, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    - Mitigation: Sanitize header values to prevent CRLF injection. Carefully control which headers can be set by user input. Use the library's built-in mechanisms for setting headers securely.

- Attack Vector: Target Internal or Restricted Endpoints [HIGH RISK PATH]
    - Attack Vector: Exploit Lack of Access Control when Building URLs [CRITICAL NODE]
        - Description: Attackers manipulate URLs to access internal or restricted endpoints that should not be publicly accessible.
        - Potential Impact: Access to sensitive data, internal functionality, administrative interfaces.
        - Mitigation: Enforce strict server-side access control. Avoid exposing internal endpoints directly. Implement proper authorization checks.

- Attack Vector: Bypass Security Measures [HIGH RISK PATH]
    - Attack Vector: Tamper with headers like `Authorization` or `Cookie` [CRITICAL NODE]
        - Description: Attackers modify authentication or session cookies/headers if the application relies solely on client-provided values.
        - Potential Impact: Account takeover, unauthorized access to resources.
        - Mitigation: Implement robust server-side authentication and authorization mechanisms. Do not rely solely on client-provided headers for security. Use secure session management techniques.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in HTTP Response Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_http_response_handling.md)

- Attack Vector: Insecure Deserialization of Response Data [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
    - Description: The application deserializes response bodies (e.g., JSON, XML) without proper validation, leading to code execution or other vulnerabilities.
    - Potential Impact: Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service.
    - Mitigation: Use safe deserialization practices. Validate the structure and types of deserialized data. Consider using libraries that offer protection against deserialization vulnerabilities.

- Attack Vector: Open Redirect Vulnerability [HIGH RISK PATH]
    - Description: The application uses a server-provided URL in a redirect without proper validation, allowing attackers to redirect users to malicious sites.
    - Potential Impact: Phishing attacks, malware distribution, redirection to attacker-controlled content.
    - Mitigation: Validate and sanitize redirect URLs. Avoid blindly following redirects from untrusted sources. Consider limiting redirects to a predefined list of safe domains.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse of Client-Side Features](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_of_client-side_features.md)

- Attack Vector: Storing Sensitive Data in Local Storage/Cookies Unencrypted [CRITICAL NODE]
    - Description: The application stores sensitive data (e.g., API keys, session tokens) in local storage or cookies without encryption.
    - Potential Impact: Exposure of sensitive user data, account compromise.
    - Mitigation: Encrypt sensitive data stored locally or in cookies. Use appropriate HTTP flags for cookies (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`).

- Attack Vector: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Injected Content [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
    - Description: The application renders data received from HTTP responses without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the user's browser.
    - Potential Impact: Account takeover, data theft, malware injection, defacement.
    - Mitigation: Implement proper output encoding and sanitization when rendering data received from HTTP responses. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP).
