## Deep Dive Analysis: Header Injection Threat in Dart `http` Library

This document provides a deep dive analysis of the "Header Injection" threat within the context of a Dart application utilizing the `https://github.com/dart-lang/http` library. We will explore the mechanics of the attack, its potential impact, and provide detailed recommendations for mitigation.

**1. Understanding the Threat: Header Injection**

Header injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into a request. This occurs when user-controlled input is directly incorporated into the header section of an HTTP request without proper sanitization or validation.

In the context of the Dart `http` library, the primary attack vector lies within the `headers` parameter of various request methods like `http.get`, `http.post`, `http.put`, and `http.delete`. If an application directly uses user input to construct the values within this `headers` map, it becomes vulnerable.

**How it Works:**

The core of the vulnerability stems from the way HTTP headers are structured. Each header consists of a name, a colon, a space, and a value, followed by a carriage return and a line feed (`\r\n`) to denote the end of the header. An attacker can exploit this by injecting these newline characters within user-controlled input.

By injecting `\r\n`, an attacker can effectively terminate the current header and start a new one. This allows them to introduce arbitrary headers, potentially overriding existing ones or adding entirely new ones.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine an application that allows users to set a custom "User-Agent" header. A vulnerable implementation might look like this:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void makeRequest(String userInput) async {
  final headers = {'User-Agent': userInput};
  final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://example.com'), headers: headers);
  print(response.body);
}

// An attacker provides the following input:
// "MyCustomAgent\r\nX-Malicious-Header: Injected Value"

// The resulting HTTP request headers would look like:
// User-Agent: MyCustomAgent
// X-Malicious-Header: Injected Value
```

**2. Deeper Look at the Technical Implications**

* **HTTP Protocol Exploitation:** The attack directly manipulates the fundamental structure of the HTTP protocol. By injecting `\r\n`, the attacker leverages the protocol's delimiter for header separation.
* **`http` Library's Role:** While the `http` library itself doesn't inherently introduce the vulnerability, it provides the mechanism (`headers` parameter) through which unsanitized user input can be passed, leading to the injection. The library trusts the provided `headers` map to contain valid header key-value pairs.
* **Encoding Considerations:** While less common for basic header injection, encoding issues could potentially complicate or obfuscate the attack. For instance, different character encodings might represent newline characters in various ways. However, standard UTF-8 encoding for headers generally makes `\r\n` the primary concern.

**3. Impact Analysis: Beyond the Description**

The provided description outlines the key impacts, but let's delve deeper:

* **Cache Poisoning:**
    * **Mechanism:** Injecting headers like `X-Forwarded-Host` or `Host` can trick caching proxies into associating malicious content with a legitimate domain. Subsequent requests from other users might then be served the poisoned content.
    * **Severity:** High. Can lead to widespread distribution of malware, phishing pages, or misinformation.
    * **Specific Example:** Injecting `X-Forwarded-Host: attacker.com` could cause a caching proxy to store content from `attacker.com` as if it originated from the intended domain.

* **Session Hijacking or Fixation:**
    * **Mechanism:** Injecting the `Cookie` header allows an attacker to set a specific session ID for the user. This can lead to session fixation, where the attacker forces the user to use a known session ID, allowing them to hijack the session later.
    * **Severity:** Critical. Direct access to user accounts and sensitive data.
    * **Specific Example:** Injecting `Cookie: sessionid=attacker_controlled_id` could fix the user's session ID to a value known by the attacker.

* **Bypassing Security Checks:**
    * **Mechanism:** Applications might rely on specific headers for authentication, authorization, or other security checks. Attackers could inject headers to bypass these checks.
    * **Severity:** Medium to High, depending on the bypassed security mechanism.
    * **Specific Example:** If an application checks for a specific `X-Internal-Request: true` header for internal access, an attacker could inject this header to gain unauthorized access.

* **Information Disclosure:**
    * **Mechanism:** While less direct, injecting certain headers might reveal information about the server or application configuration.
    * **Severity:** Low to Medium. Could aid in further attacks.
    * **Specific Example:** Injecting a header that causes the server to return a verbose error message containing internal paths or configurations.

**4. Real-World Scenarios and Examples**

Consider these scenarios:

* **Custom Analytics Integration:** An application allows users to specify a custom URL for sending analytics data. If the application naively constructs the request headers using user input for the URL, header injection is possible. An attacker could inject a `Location` header to redirect the analytics data to their own server.
* **API Integrations:** An application interacts with a third-party API and allows users to customize certain request headers. Without proper sanitization, attackers could inject headers to manipulate the API's behavior or potentially gain unauthorized access.
* **Webhooks:** If an application receives webhook requests and uses user-provided data to construct outgoing requests, header injection vulnerabilities can arise.

**5. Code Examples: Vulnerable vs. Secure**

**Vulnerable Code:**

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<void> sendCustomRequest(String targetUrl, String customHeaderValue) async {
  final headers = {'X-Custom-Header': customHeaderValue};
  try {
    final response = await http.get(Uri.parse(targetUrl), headers: headers);
    print('Response status: ${response.statusCode}');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error: $e');
  }
}

// Potential Attack:
// sendCustomRequest('https://example.com', 'injected\r\nX-Malicious: true');
```

**Secure Code:**

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<void> sendCustomRequestSecure(String targetUrl, String customHeaderValue) async {
  // Strict validation and sanitization of user input
  final sanitizedHeaderValue = customHeaderValue.replaceAll(RegExp(r'[\r\n]'), '');

  final headers = {'X-Custom-Header': sanitizedHeaderValue};
  try {
    final response = await http.get(Uri.parse(targetUrl), headers: headers);
    print('Response status: ${response.statusCode}');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error: $e');
  }
}

// Even with malicious input, the output will be sanitized:
// sendCustomRequestSecure('https://example.com', 'injected\r\nX-Malicious: true');
// Resulting header: X-Custom-Header: injectedX-Malicious: true
```

**6. Defense in Depth: A Multi-Layered Approach**

While the provided mitigation strategies are accurate, let's expand on them within a defense-in-depth context:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization (Primary Defense):**
    * **Strict Validation:**  Define clear rules for what constitutes a valid header value. This might involve whitelisting allowed characters or formats.
    * **Sanitization:**  Remove or encode potentially harmful characters like `\r` and `\n`. The `replaceAll` method with a regular expression is a common approach.
    * **Contextual Escaping:** While less relevant for headers directly, understanding the context in which user input is used is crucial for choosing the appropriate escaping mechanism.

* **Leveraging the `http` Library Safely:**
    * **Prefer the `headers` Map:**  Directly use the `headers` parameter as a map of key-value pairs. This allows the library to handle the underlying header formatting and encoding, reducing the risk of manual errors.
    * **Avoid String Concatenation:**  Never directly concatenate user input into header strings. This is the most common source of header injection vulnerabilities.

* **Security Headers (Mitigation and Detection):**
    * **Consider setting appropriate security headers on the server-side:** While not directly preventing header injection in outgoing requests, server-side security headers like `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) and `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) can mitigate the impact of certain attacks that might be facilitated by header injection.

* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    * **Manual Code Reviews:**  Specifically look for instances where user input is used to construct HTTP headers.
    * **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):**  Utilize SAST tools to automatically identify potential header injection vulnerabilities in the codebase.
    * **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools to simulate attacks and identify vulnerabilities in a running application. This can include fuzzing the header inputs.

* **Security Training for Developers:**
    * Ensure developers understand the risks associated with header injection and best practices for secure coding.

**7. Specific Recommendations for the Development Team**

* **Establish a Strict Policy:** Implement a clear policy against directly using unsanitized user input in HTTP headers.
* **Code Review Focus:**  Make header handling a primary focus during code reviews. Specifically look for string concatenation or direct insertion of user input into the `headers` parameter values.
* **Centralized Header Handling:** Consider creating utility functions or classes to manage header construction, ensuring consistent sanitization and validation across the application.
* **Input Validation Library:** Explore using existing Dart libraries that provide robust input validation and sanitization functionalities.
* **Testing Strategy:**  Incorporate specific test cases to check for header injection vulnerabilities. This includes testing with input containing `\r`, `\n`, and other control characters.
* **Security Awareness:** Regularly remind the development team about common web security vulnerabilities like header injection.

**8. Conclusion**

Header injection, while seemingly simple, poses a significant threat to applications using the `http` library. By understanding the underlying mechanics of the attack and its potential impact, development teams can implement effective mitigation strategies. The key is to treat user input as untrusted and consistently apply validation and sanitization techniques, particularly when constructing HTTP headers. Prioritizing the safe usage of the `http` library's features and adopting a defense-in-depth approach will significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability. This deep analysis provides the necessary context and actionable recommendations to proactively address this threat.
