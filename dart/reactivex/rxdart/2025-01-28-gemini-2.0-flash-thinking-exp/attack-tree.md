## Attack Tree Path: [1. Stream Manipulation Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__stream_manipulation_attacks__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers aim to disrupt the intended flow and processing of data within RxDart streams. This path encompasses techniques to inject malicious data, interrupt streams, or cause denial of service.

    *   **1.1 Data Injection into Streams [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:**  Attackers focus on inserting unauthorized or malicious data into RxDart streams, particularly through `Subject` or `StreamController` components.
            *   **1.1.1 Inject Malicious Data into Subject/StreamController [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Description:**  Gaining unauthorized access to a `Subject` or `StreamController` (due to insecure access control or exposed endpoints) and injecting malicious data.
                *   **Impact:** Medium - Data corruption, application logic bypass, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) potential if data is rendered in UI without sanitization.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on application architecture and access control measures.
                *   **Effort:** Low - If unauthorized access is achieved, data injection is typically straightforward.
                *   **Skill Level:** Low - Requires basic understanding of APIs and data injection techniques.
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Detection depends on the effectiveness of logging and input validation mechanisms. Anomalous data patterns might be detectable.
                *   **Actionable Insight:** Implement strict access control for Subjects and StreamControllers. Avoid exposing them directly to untrusted sources. Sanitize all data received from streams before using it in sensitive operations or rendering it in the UI.

    *   **1.2 Stream Interruption/Denial of Service [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Attackers attempt to disrupt the availability and reliability of RxDart streams, leading to a denial of service or application instability.
            *   **1.2.1 Backpressure Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Description:** Flooding a stream with data at a rate faster than the application can process, leading to backpressure issues and resource exhaustion.
                *   **Impact:** Medium to High - Denial of Service (DoS), application instability, potential crashes.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Especially if streams are exposed to external, potentially malicious data sources.
                *   **Effort:** Low - Simple flooding attacks can be easily launched if stream inputs are accessible.
                *   **Skill Level:** Low - Requires basic understanding of network traffic and flooding techniques.
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium - High traffic volume and resource exhaustion are typically easily monitored and detected.
                *   **Actionable Insight:** Implement robust backpressure handling mechanisms using RxDart operators (e.g., `buffer`, `throttleTime`, `debounceTime`, `sampleTime`) or custom backpressure strategies. Continuously monitor stream processing performance and resource utilization.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Subject and StreamController Abuse [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__subject_and_streamcontroller_abuse__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target the core components of RxDart streams - `Subject` and `StreamController` - to gain unauthorized control and manipulate application behavior.
    *   **2.1 Unauthorized Access to Subjects/StreamControllers [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities that lead to unauthorized access to `Subject` or `StreamController` instances. This could be due to insecure API design, lack of proper encapsulation, or coding errors.
        *   **Impact:** High - Data injection, stream manipulation, Denial of Service (DoS), bypassing application logic, potentially leading to broader system compromise.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends heavily on application architecture and secure coding practices.
        *   **Effort:** Low - If exposure exists, gaining access is often straightforward.
        *   **Skill Level:** Low - Requires basic understanding of APIs and access control principles.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Detection depends on monitoring access patterns and API usage. Unusual access patterns to these components should be flagged.
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Enforce strict encapsulation and access control for Subjects and StreamControllers. Avoid exposing them directly to external or untrusted components. Utilize private variables and accessors to control access.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Vulnerabilities in Custom RxDart Extensions/Operators (If Applicable) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__vulnerabilities_in_custom_rxdart_extensionsoperators__if_applicable___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application utilizes custom RxDart operators or extensions, vulnerabilities within their implementation can be exploited.
    *   **3.1 Logic Errors in Custom Operators [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Description:**  Introducing logic errors or security flaws during the development of custom RxDart operators (created using `StreamTransformer` or extending `Operator`). These errors can be similar to typical software vulnerabilities.
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High - Data corruption, application logic bypass, Denial of Service (DoS), and in severe cases, potential for arbitrary code execution if operators interact with external systems insecurely.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium - Depends on the complexity of custom operators and the rigor of testing and code review processes.
        *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires reverse engineering and understanding the logic of custom operators to identify and exploit flaws.
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires RxDart operator development expertise and code analysis skills to identify logic errors.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard - Detection depends on the nature of the logic error. Thorough code review and testing are crucial for prevention. Runtime detection can be challenging without specific monitoring of operator behavior.
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Implement rigorous code review and testing processes for all custom RxDart operators. Apply secure coding practices during their development. Consider using well-established, built-in RxDart operators whenever possible to reduce the attack surface. Conduct security testing specifically focused on custom operators.
