## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Backpressure Handling using RxDart Operators](./mitigation_strategies/implement_backpressure_handling_using_rxdart_operators.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify High-Volume Streams:** Pinpoint RxDart streams that are expected to emit data at a high rate, potentially overwhelming consumers.
    2.  **Select RxDart Backpressure Operators:** Choose appropriate RxDart operators to manage data flow:
        *   `throttleTime(duration)`:  Reduces event emission frequency to at most once per `duration`. Useful for UI events or rate-limiting.
        *   `debounceTime(duration)`: Emits only after a period of silence of `duration`. Good for filtering rapid bursts of events, like search input.
        *   `buffer(Stream other)` / `bufferCount(int count)` / `bufferTime(duration)`: Collects events into lists based on a trigger stream, count, or time window. Useful for batch processing.
        *   `sample(Stream sampler)`: Emits the latest event when the `sampler` stream emits. Good for periodic data snapshots.
        *   `window(Stream windowBoundary)` / `windowCount(int count)` / `windowTime(duration)`: Similar to `buffer`, but emits Observables/Streams of events instead of lists.
        *   `pairwise()`: Emits pairs of consecutive events. Useful for change detection.
        *   `onBackpressureBuffer()`, `onBackpressureDrop()`, `onBackpressureLatest()`:  Explicitly handle backpressure scenarios by buffering, dropping, or keeping the latest event when the consumer is slow.
    3.  **Apply Operators in Stream Pipelines:** Integrate the selected backpressure operators into your RxDart stream pipelines *before* the consumer that might be overwhelmed.
    4.  **Tune Operator Parameters:** Adjust the parameters of operators (e.g., `duration`, `count`, buffer size) based on application performance and expected data rates.
    5.  **Monitor Resource Usage:** Observe memory and CPU usage, especially under load, to verify backpressure operators are effectively preventing resource exhaustion.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to Resource Exhaustion (High Severity):** Uncontrolled stream data can lead to unbounded buffering, causing memory exhaustion and application crashes, resulting in DoS.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS due to Resource Exhaustion (High Reduction):** RxDart backpressure operators effectively control data flow, significantly reducing the risk of DoS by preventing resource exhaustion.
*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined. Backpressure handling using RxDart operators should be implemented in data-intensive RxDart streams, especially those receiving external or high-frequency data.
*   **Missing Implementation:** To be determined. Review RxDart stream pipelines, particularly those handling user input, sensor data, or network streams, to identify missing backpressure operator implementations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Error Handling with RxDart Error Operators](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_error_handling_with_rxdart_error_operators.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical Streams:** Determine RxDart streams where errors can disrupt application functionality or lead to security issues.
    2.  **Utilize RxDart Error Handling Operators:** Implement error handling using RxDart operators:
        *   `onErrorResumeNext(Stream<T> Function(dynamic error, StackTrace stackTrace) resumeFunction)`:  Switches to a fallback stream when an error occurs, allowing recovery and continued operation.
        *   `onErrorReturn(T Function(dynamic error, StackTrace stackTrace) returnValue)`: Returns a default value when an error occurs, providing a fallback without stream termination.
        *   `onErrorReturnWith(T returnValue)`: Returns a constant default value on error.
        *   `retry(int count)` / `retryWhen(Stream<dynamic> Function(Observable<dynamic> errors) retryWhenFactory)`: Automatically retries failed operations, potentially with a backoff strategy (using `retryWhen`), for transient errors.
    3.  **Strategic Operator Placement:** Place error handling operators strategically in stream pipelines to catch errors at appropriate points and prevent propagation to critical parts of the application.
    4.  **Centralized Error Logging (with caution):**  Use `doOnError` operator to log errors occurring within streams. *Be cautious not to log sensitive information directly in error messages.* Log error types and relevant context instead.
    5.  **Avoid Unhandled Exceptions:** Ensure all critical RxDart streams have error handling to prevent unhandled exceptions from crashing the application.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Application Instability and Crashes (High Severity):** Unhandled errors in RxDart streams can lead to application crashes and service disruptions.
        *   **Inconsistent Application State (Medium Severity):** Error propagation without handling can leave the application in an unpredictable state, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Information Disclosure through Error Messages (Low to Medium Severity):**  While less direct, verbose error messages (if not handled and logged securely) could potentially reveal implementation details.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Application Instability and Crashes (High Reduction):** RxDart error handling operators prevent crashes and improve application stability by gracefully handling errors.
        *   **Inconsistent Application State (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the risk of the application entering inconsistent states due to stream errors.
*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined. Error handling using RxDart operators should be implemented in all critical RxDart streams, especially those involved in data processing, network requests, and user interactions.
*   **Missing Implementation:** To be determined. Review RxDart stream pipelines, focusing on error handling. Ensure error handling operators are used appropriately and comprehensively for different error scenarios.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Managing Side Effects with RxDart `doOn` Operators](./mitigation_strategies/managing_side_effects_with_rxdart__doon__operators.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Side Effects in Streams:** Locate all side effects (e.g., API calls, database updates, logging, UI changes) performed within RxDart stream pipelines.
    2.  **Encapsulate Side Effects with `doOn` Operators:** Use RxDart's `doOn` operators to manage side effects in a controlled manner:
        *   `doOnNext(void Function(T value) onData)`: Perform side effects for each emitted data event.
        *   `doOnError(void Function(dynamic error, StackTrace stackTrace) onError)`: Perform side effects when an error occurs (e.g., logging errors).
        *   `doOnDone(void Function() onDone)`: Perform side effects when the stream completes.
        *   `doOnListen(void Function() onListen)`: Perform side effects when the stream is first listened to.
        *   `doOnCancel(void Function() onCancel)`: Perform side effects when the stream subscription is cancelled.
    3.  **Isolate Side Effects:**  Use `doOn` operators to isolate side effects to specific points in the stream, making them more auditable and manageable. Avoid embedding complex side effect logic directly within `map`, `filter`, or `flatMap` operators.
    4.  **Secure Side Effect Logic:** Within the functions passed to `doOn` operators, implement security best practices for any external interactions (input validation, output sanitization, authorization, secure communication).
    5.  **Review `doOn` Logic Regularly:** Periodically review the logic within `doOn` operators to ensure side effects are still necessary, secure, and aligned with security policies.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** If side effects in `doOn` operators interact with external systems without proper input validation, injection vulnerabilities can arise.
        *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Side effects interacting with external systems without authorization checks in `doOn` can lead to unauthorized data access.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity):** If side effects in `doOn` operators update UI based on stream data without sanitization, XSS vulnerabilities can occur.
        *   **Unintended Data Modification (Medium Severity):** Uncontrolled side effects in `doOn` operators could inadvertently modify data in unexpected ways.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Reduction):** Using `doOn` for side effects allows for focused security checks within these specific points, reducing injection risks if properly secured.
        *   **Unauthorized Access (High Reduction):** Authorization logic within `doOn` operators can effectively prevent unauthorized access during side effect execution.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Reduction):** Output sanitization within `doOn` operators that update UI can mitigate XSS risks.
        *   **Unintended Data Modification (Medium Reduction):** Controlled side effects within `doOn` operators reduce the chance of unintended data modifications.
*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined. Side effect management using `doOn` operators should be considered wherever RxDart streams trigger external actions or modify application state.
*   **Missing Implementation:** To be determined. Review RxDart stream pipelines that perform side effects. Ensure `doOn` operators are used to encapsulate and manage these side effects, and that security best practices are applied within the `doOn` logic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Addressing Concurrency with RxDart Schedulers](./mitigation_strategies/addressing_concurrency_with_rxdart_schedulers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand RxDart Concurrency Model:** Recognize that RxDart streams are inherently concurrent and operations can execute on different threads or event loops depending on the scheduler.
    2.  **Choose Appropriate RxDart Schedulers:** Select RxDart schedulers based on the nature of stream operations and concurrency needs:
        *   `ComputeScheduler()`: For CPU-bound operations, offloads work to background threads, preventing blocking the main thread.
        *   `EventScheduler()`: For I/O-bound operations, utilizes the event loop, suitable for non-blocking operations.
        *   `ImmediateScheduler()`: Executes operations immediately on the current thread. Use sparingly in concurrent scenarios as it can lead to blocking.
        *   `TrampolineScheduler()`: Executes operations sequentially in a queue, useful for avoiding stack overflow in recursive or nested stream scenarios.
    3.  **Apply Schedulers with `subscribeOn()` and `observeOn()`:** Use `subscribeOn(Scheduler scheduler)` to specify the scheduler for the *source* of the stream and `observeOn(Scheduler scheduler)` to specify the scheduler for *operators and consumers* in the stream pipeline.
    4.  **Minimize Shared Mutable State:**  Reduce shared mutable state accessed by concurrent stream operations to minimize the risk of race conditions. Favor immutable data structures and functional programming principles within stream logic.
    5.  **Concurrency Testing:** Test RxDart streams under concurrent conditions to identify and resolve potential race conditions or concurrency-related issues.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Race Conditions and Data Corruption (High Severity):** Concurrent access to shared mutable state in RxDart streams without proper scheduler management can lead to race conditions and data corruption.
        *   **Unpredictable Application Behavior (Medium Severity):** Race conditions can cause unpredictable application behavior and make debugging difficult, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Race Conditions and Data Corruption (High Reduction):** Using appropriate RxDart schedulers and minimizing shared mutable state significantly reduces the risk of race conditions and data corruption.
        *   **Unpredictable Application Behavior (Medium Reduction):** Improves application stability and predictability by mitigating concurrency-related issues through scheduler management.
*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined. Scheduler usage in RxDart should be considered wherever streams perform concurrent operations, especially when dealing with shared resources or state.
*   **Missing Implementation:** To be determined. Review RxDart stream pipelines for potential concurrency issues. Ensure appropriate schedulers are used with `subscribeOn` and `observeOn` to manage concurrency and prevent race conditions. Consider refactoring to minimize shared mutable state.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Sanitization within RxDart Streams using `map` Operator](./mitigation_strategies/data_sanitization_within_rxdart_streams_using__map__operator.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data Streams:** Pinpoint RxDart streams that carry sensitive information that needs to be protected (e.g., user PII, credentials).
    2.  **Implement Data Masking/Transformation with `map`:** Use the `map` operator within RxDart stream pipelines to transform and sanitize sensitive data *before* it is logged, displayed, or transmitted externally.
        *   **Redaction:** Replace sensitive parts of data with placeholders (e.g., asterisks).
        *   **Anonymization:** Transform data to remove identifying information while preserving utility.
        *   **Encryption (for specific use cases):** Encrypt sensitive data within the stream if it needs to be protected in transit or at rest (though encryption is often better handled at a lower level).
    3.  **Strategic `map` Operator Placement:** Place `map` operators for sanitization strategically in the stream pipeline, ensuring data is sanitized before reaching potentially insecure sinks (logging, UI, external APIs).
    4.  **Regularly Review Sanitization Logic:** Periodically review the data sanitization logic within `map` operators to ensure it is still effective and meets security requirements.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Exposure of sensitive data through logs, debugging output, or insecure external integrations if streams are not sanitized.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data (High Severity):** While sanitization doesn't prevent unauthorized access directly, it reduces the impact of a breach by limiting the exposure of *raw* sensitive data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Reduction):** Data sanitization using RxDart `map` operator significantly reduces the risk of exposing raw sensitive data in logs or external systems.
*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined. Data sanitization using `map` should be implemented in RxDart streams that handle sensitive data, especially before logging, displaying, or transmitting data externally.
*   **Missing Implementation:** To be determined. Review RxDart stream pipelines that process sensitive data. Ensure `map` operators are used to sanitize data appropriately before it reaches potentially insecure destinations.
