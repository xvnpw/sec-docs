# Attack Surface Analysis for reactivex/rxdart

## Attack Surface: [1. Uncontrolled Resource Consumption through Stream Operators](./attack_surfaces/1__uncontrolled_resource_consumption_through_stream_operators.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can exploit RxDart stream operators that buffer or window data based on user-controlled parameters to induce excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory), leading to a critical Denial of Service (DoS). This is especially critical when operators are used in core application logic handling critical resources.
*   **RxDart Contribution:** RxDart operators like `buffer`, `window`, `debounce`, `throttle`, and `sample`, when configured with unbounded or excessively large parameters derived from untrusted input, directly enable resource exhaustion attacks within the reactive stream processing.
*   **Example:** An application uses `bufferTime(Duration(seconds: user_provided_seconds))` to aggregate events for a critical payment processing stream. An attacker provides an extremely large value for `user_provided_seconds`, causing the application to buffer an unbounded number of events, leading to memory exhaustion and failure of payment processing.
*   **Impact:** Critical Denial of Service (DoS) impacting core application functionality, system instability, potential financial loss if critical transactions are disrupted.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation & Parameter Limits:** Implement rigorous validation and sanitization for all user-provided inputs that control parameters of RxDart operators. Enforce strict maximum limits on buffer sizes, window durations, and counts.
    *   **Resource Quotas & Monitoring:** Implement resource quotas for stream processing operations. Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) in real-time and trigger alerts or circuit breakers when resource consumption exceeds safe thresholds.
    *   **Backpressure & Rate Limiting:** Employ robust backpressure strategies to control data flow and prevent overwhelming the application. Implement rate limiting on input streams to restrict the rate of data entering the reactive pipeline.

## Attack Surface: [2. Data Injection and Manipulation via Subjects](./attack_surfaces/2__data_injection_and_manipulation_via_subjects.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can directly inject malicious data or commands into critical application logic by exploiting improperly secured RxDart Subjects (like `PublishSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`). This allows bypassing intended application logic and manipulating core functionalities, potentially leading to critical security breaches.
*   **RxDart Contribution:** RxDart Subjects, acting as both Observables and Observers, provide a direct injection point into reactive streams if they are inadvertently exposed or lack proper access control. This vulnerability is directly introduced by the dual nature of Subjects in RxDart.
*   **Example:** A `PublishSubject` is used to dispatch commands to a critical system component responsible for access control decisions. If this Subject is exposed through a vulnerable API or internal component, an attacker can inject commands to bypass access checks, granting unauthorized access to sensitive resources or functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Critical security breach, unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, privilege escalation, potential for remote code execution if injected data is processed unsafely downstream in critical components.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege & Access Control:**  Severely restrict access to Subjects. Ensure only highly trusted and authorized components can emit events into Subjects, especially those controlling critical functionalities. Employ strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Input Sanitization & Command Validation:** Treat all data received through Subjects as untrusted input. Implement extremely strict input validation and command sanitization before processing data emitted into Subjects, especially for Subjects controlling critical operations. Use whitelisting for allowed commands and data formats.
    *   **Observable Exposure Only:**  Expose read-only Observables derived from Subjects for external or less trusted components. Never expose Subjects directly when security is paramount.
    *   **Secure Design & Code Review:** Design reactive pipelines with security in mind. Conduct thorough security code reviews focusing on Subject usage and data flow to identify and eliminate potential injection points.

## Attack Surface: [3. Backpressure Management and Denial of Service (High Load)](./attack_surfaces/3__backpressure_management_and_denial_of_service__high_load_.md)

*   **Description:**  Insufficient backpressure management in RxDart applications, particularly when handling high-volume data streams from external sources or during peak load, can lead to buffer overflows, memory exhaustion, and a High severity Denial of Service (DoS) under realistic operational conditions.
*   **RxDart Contribution:** RxDart's efficient stream processing can exacerbate backpressure issues if not explicitly addressed. The library's ability to handle high data rates makes it crucial to implement backpressure strategies to prevent resource exhaustion under heavy load, a direct concern when using RxDart for high-throughput systems.
*   **Example:** An application using RxDart processes real-time market data from a financial exchange. During peak trading hours, the data volume surges. Without proper backpressure handling, the application's buffers overflow, leading to memory exhaustion and a service disruption during a critical trading period, resulting in financial losses and operational downtime.
*   **Impact:** High severity Denial of Service (DoS) under realistic load conditions, service disruption during peak usage, potential financial losses or operational downtime in time-sensitive applications.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Proactive Backpressure Implementation:**  Implement robust backpressure strategies from the design phase using appropriate RxDart operators like `throttleLatest`, `sample`, `debounce`, `onBackpressureBuffer`, or custom backpressure logic tailored to the application's load profile.
    *   **Load Testing & Capacity Planning:** Conduct thorough load testing to simulate peak load scenarios and identify backpressure bottlenecks. Perform capacity planning to ensure sufficient resources are provisioned to handle expected data volumes and peak loads with implemented backpressure strategies.
    *   **Dynamic Backpressure Adjustment:** Implement dynamic backpressure adjustment mechanisms that can adapt to changing data rates and load conditions. Consider using reactive backpressure strategies that automatically adjust based on consumer demand.
    *   **Circuit Breakers & Fallbacks:** Implement circuit breaker patterns to gracefully handle backpressure-induced failures. Design fallback mechanisms to maintain partial functionality or provide informative error messages during high load situations instead of complete service disruption.
