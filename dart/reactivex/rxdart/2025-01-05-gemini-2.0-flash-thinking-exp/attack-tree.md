## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into Streams](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_streams.md)

*   ** CRITICAL NODE ** Send crafted events or data through a `Subject` or `StreamController` that, when processed by the application's RxDart logic, leads to unintended consequences.

**1. Inject Malicious Data into Streams:**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies points in the application where data enters RxDart streams, such as through `Subject` instances or `StreamController` sinks. They then craft malicious data payloads designed to exploit weaknesses in the application's data processing logic within the stream pipeline.
*   **Critical Node:** **Send crafted events or data through a `Subject` or `StreamController`**: This is the direct action of injecting the malicious data. The attacker leverages their ability to send data into the stream, bypassing intended validation or sanitization mechanisms.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Depending on how the application processes the injected data, this can lead to various outcomes, including:
    *   **Data Corruption:**  The malicious data might overwrite or corrupt existing data within the application's state.
    *   **Incorrect Calculations or Logic:** The injected data could skew calculations or trigger unintended branches in the application's logic.
    *   **Code Execution:** In severe cases, if the application processes the data in a way that allows for interpretation as code (e.g., through dynamic evaluation or serialization/deserialization vulnerabilities), the attacker could achieve remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Error Handling Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_error_handling_logic.md)

*   ** CRITICAL NODE ** Cause errors in streams to trigger vulnerable error handling logic, potentially revealing sensitive information or causing denial of service.

**2. Exploit Error Handling Logic:**

*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker intentionally triggers errors within RxDart streams to observe the application's error handling behavior. They aim to exploit vulnerabilities in how errors are managed, such as revealing sensitive information in error messages or causing denial of service through repeated error triggering.
*   **Critical Node:** **Cause errors in streams to trigger vulnerable error handling logic**: This involves the attacker actively inducing errors within the stream. This could be done by providing invalid input, manipulating external dependencies, or exploiting edge cases in the stream processing.
*   **Potential Consequences:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Error messages might inadvertently expose sensitive data, internal application details, or configuration information that can be used for further attacks.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Repeatedly triggering errors that consume significant resources or lead to application crashes can result in a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Missing Error Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_missing_error_handling.md)

*   ** CRITICAL NODE ** Cause errors that are not properly handled, leading to application crashes or unexpected behavior.

**3. Exploit Missing Error Handling:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target streams where error handling is absent or insufficient. By triggering errors in these streams, they can cause the application to crash, behave unexpectedly, or enter an undefined state.
*   **Critical Node:** **Cause errors that are not properly handled**: The attacker focuses on triggering error conditions in parts of the stream pipeline where no `catchError` or similar error handling mechanisms are in place.
*   **Potential Consequences:**
    *   **Application Crashes:** Unhandled exceptions can lead to immediate application termination.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** The application might enter an inconsistent or unpredictable state, leading to further errors or security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Resource Consumption](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_resource_consumption.md)

*   ** CRITICAL NODE ** Create Infinite Streams
            *   Introduce logic that creates streams that emit events indefinitely, leading to resource exhaustion (memory or CPU).

**4. Create Infinite Streams:**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates the application or its data sources to create streams that emit events indefinitely. This can quickly consume system resources, leading to denial of service.
*   **Critical Node:** **Introduce logic that creates streams that emit events indefinitely**: This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how streams are created based on external input or by directly manipulating the sources of stream data.
*   **Potential Consequences:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The continuous emission of events consumes CPU, memory, and network resources.
    *   **Denial of Service:** The application becomes unresponsive or unavailable due to resource overload.

## Attack Tree Path: [Memory Leaks through Stream Subscriptions](./attack_tree_paths/memory_leaks_through_stream_subscriptions.md)

*   ** CRITICAL NODE ** Fail to properly dispose of stream subscriptions, leading to memory leaks over time.

**5. Memory Leaks through Stream Subscriptions:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit the application's failure to properly manage stream subscriptions. By triggering actions that create subscriptions that are never cancelled, they can cause a gradual accumulation of memory, eventually leading to application crashes.
*   **Critical Node:** **Fail to properly dispose of stream subscriptions**: The attacker doesn't directly cause this, but the vulnerability lies in the application's code. The attacker might trigger the creation of many short-lived components that subscribe to streams but don't unsubscribe when they are no longer needed.
*   **Potential Consequences:**
    *   **Application Slowdown:** As memory usage increases, the application's performance degrades.
    *   **Eventual Crash:**  The application eventually runs out of memory and crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Interactions with External Systems](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_interactions_with_external_systems.md)

*   ** CRITICAL NODE ** Vulnerabilities in Data Sources Emitting Streams
            *   Compromise external data sources that emit data as streams, injecting malicious data that is then processed by the application.

**6. Vulnerabilities in Data Sources Emitting Streams:**

*   **Attack Vector:**  If the application relies on external data sources that emit data as streams, compromising these sources allows attackers to inject malicious data directly into the application's data flow.
*   **Critical Node:** **Compromise external data sources that emit data as streams**: This involves targeting the security of the external system itself, which is outside the direct control of the application's developers but has a direct impact on its security.
*   **Potential Consequences:**
    *   **Injection of Malicious Data:** Similar to directly injecting data into application streams, this can lead to data corruption, incorrect logic, or even code execution within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsecured Communication Channels for Streams](./attack_tree_paths/unsecured_communication_channels_for_streams.md)

*   ** CRITICAL NODE ** If streams are used to communicate between different parts of the application or with external services, exploit unsecured communication channels.

**7. Unsecured Communication Channels for Streams:**

*   **Attack Vector:** If RxDart streams are used for communication between different parts of the application or with external services, using unsecured channels makes the data vulnerable to interception and manipulation.
*   **Critical Node:** **If streams are used to communicate between different parts of the application or with external services, exploit unsecured communication channels**: This highlights a lack of encryption or authentication on the communication channel used to transmit stream data.
*   **Potential Consequences:**
    *   **Data Interception (Eavesdropping):** Attackers can intercept sensitive data being transmitted through the streams.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify the data in transit, potentially leading to incorrect processing or malicious actions.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Attackers can intercept and relay communication, potentially impersonating legitimate parties or injecting malicious data.
