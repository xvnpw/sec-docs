# Attack Surface Analysis for reactivex/rxdart

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Data Entering Observable Streams](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_data_entering_observable_streams.md)

**Description:** Applications using RxDart process data streams. If this data isn't validated *before* RxDart operators process it, vulnerabilities arise.

**How RxDart Contributes:** RxDart manages these streams, making them a central point for injecting malicious data that propagates through application logic.

**Example:** User input fed directly into a `Subject` is used in a `map` operator to build a database query without sanitization, leading to potential injection attacks.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access, potential remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement input validation *before* data enters RxDart streams.
* Sanitize data within RxDart operators using transformation functions.
* Use type checking and schema validation within the stream pipeline.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom RxDart Operators or Transformations](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_custom_rxdart_operators_or_transformations.md)

**Description:** Custom RxDart operators or transformations, if insecurely developed, introduce vulnerabilities.

**How RxDart Contributes:** RxDart's extensibility allows custom operators, which become attack vectors if not secure.

**Example:** A custom operator for file uploads has a buffer overflow, allowing a crafted file to crash the application or execute code.

**Impact:** Application crashes, unexpected behavior, potential remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow secure coding practices for custom RxDart operators.
* Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing of custom operators.
* Prefer simpler, standard operators over complex custom logic where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Uncontrolled Access to `Subject` Sinks](./attack_surfaces/uncontrolled_access_to__subject__sinks.md)

**Description:** Exposing the `sink` of a `Subject` without access control allows attackers to inject data, bypassing intended logic.

**How RxDart Contributes:** `Subject`s in RxDart offer a direct way to push data into a stream; unsecured access is a vulnerability.

**Example:** A `BehaviorSubject`'s `sink` managing application state is exposed via a public API, allowing direct state manipulation.

**Impact:** Data manipulation, bypassing application logic, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Encapsulate `Subject` instances and their sinks to prevent unauthorized access.
* Implement access control mechanisms for `Subject` sinks.
* Use read-only stream interfaces when external access is needed without modification.
