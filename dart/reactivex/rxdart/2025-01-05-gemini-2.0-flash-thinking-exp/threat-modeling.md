# Threat Model Analysis for reactivex/rxdart

## Threat: [Unintended Data Exposure through Stream Leaks](./threats/unintended_data_exposure_through_stream_leaks.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive data that is inadvertently included in a stream with a wider scope than necessary. This might involve monitoring communication channels, exploiting vulnerabilities in subscriber components, or simply observing logs that contain the exposed data flowing through the RxDart `Stream`.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential regulatory violations.

**Affected RxDart Component:** `Stream`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict data filtering and transformation within stream pipelines to only emit necessary information.
* Carefully define the scope and visibility of streams, limiting access to authorized components.
* Utilize operators like `map` and `where` to sanitize and filter data early in the stream processing.
* Review stream usage to ensure no sensitive data is being broadcast unnecessarily.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Unbounded Streams](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_unbounded_streams.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit a stream that continuously emits data without proper termination or backpressure handling. By triggering events that cause excessive data emission or by simply observing the resource consumption, they can cause the application or its components to become unresponsive due to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory) while processing the RxDart `Stream`.

**Impact:** Application or component unavailability, service disruption, potential financial loss due to downtime.

**Affected RxDart Component:** `Stream`, particularly when lacking backpressure mechanisms or proper termination logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement backpressure strategies using operators like `buffer`, `throttleTime`, or `debounceTime` to manage the rate of data consumption.
* Ensure streams have clear completion conditions or mechanisms for termination when no longer needed.
* Use operators like `take` or `takeUntil` to limit the number of emitted items.
* Monitor resource consumption of components handling streams.

## Threat: [Subject Misuse for Unauthorized Data Injection](./threats/subject_misuse_for_unauthorized_data_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access or control over a component that can push data into a `Subject` could inject malicious or incorrect data into the stream. This could disrupt application logic, manipulate data flow within the RxDart stream, or even trigger unintended actions.

**Impact:** Data corruption, application malfunction, potential for further exploitation depending on the injected data.

**Affected RxDart Component:** `Subject` (e.g., `PublishSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully control access to Subjects, ensuring only authorized components or services can push data.
* Implement validation and sanitization of data pushed into Subjects.
* Consider using more restricted stream types if external input is not required.
* Implement authentication and authorization checks before allowing data to be pushed into Subjects.

## Threat: [Replay Attacks on Replay Subjects](./threats/replay_attacks_on_replay_subjects.md)

**Description:** An attacker could potentially intercept and replay previously emitted values from a `ReplaySubject` or similar subject. This could be used to replay actions, bypass authentication checks (if tokens are replayed from the RxDart `ReplaySubject`), or gain access to previously broadcasted sensitive information.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access, replay of sensitive actions, exposure of past sensitive data.

**Affected RxDart Component:** `ReplaySubject`, `BehaviorSubject` (to a lesser extent if the initial value is sensitive).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid storing sensitive information in replayable subjects if possible.
* Implement appropriate expiration or invalidation mechanisms for values emitted by replayable subjects.
* Consider the security implications of using replayable subjects in sensitive contexts.
* Use time-based validation for replayed data.
