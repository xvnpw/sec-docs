# Threat Model Analysis for reactivex/rxdart

## Threat: [Uncontrolled Data Streams Leading to Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/uncontrolled_data_streams_leading_to_resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could flood a `Subject` or a `Stream` with a massive amount of data. This could be achieved by exploiting an exposed endpoint that feeds data into a `Subject` or by compromising an external data source that feeds a `Stream`. The application would then attempt to process this excessive data, consuming significant CPU, memory, and network resources.
*   **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive, potentially crashing or becoming unavailable to legitimate users. This constitutes a Denial of Service.
*   **Affected RxDart Component:** `Subject` (e.g., `PublishSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`), `Stream` (especially those connected to external data sources).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement backpressure strategies using operators like `throttleTime`, `debounce`, `buffer` with limits, or `sample`.
    *   Validate and sanitize data entering `Subjects` and `Streams`.
    *   Implement rate limiting on endpoints that allow external data to be pushed into `Subjects`.
    *   Monitor resource usage and implement alerts for unusual activity.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Streams](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_streams.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information in the data flowing through `Streams`. An attacker gaining access to application logs, monitoring systems, or debugging information could then intercept this sensitive data. This could also occur if the `Stream` data is persisted without proper encryption or access controls.
*   **Impact:** Confidential information (e.g., user credentials, personal data, API keys) could be exposed, leading to privacy violations, identity theft, or unauthorized access to other systems.
*   **Affected RxDart Component:** `Stream`, all operators that process data within the `Stream` pipeline.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review the data flowing through `Streams`, especially those handling sensitive information.
    *   Implement data masking or filtering to remove sensitive data before logging or monitoring.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    *   Restrict access to application logs and monitoring systems.
    *   Avoid logging entire `Stream` events in production environments.

## Threat: [Data Injection through Exposed Subjects](./threats/data_injection_through_exposed_subjects.md)

*   **Description:** If `Subjects` are exposed through APIs or other interfaces without proper authorization or validation, an attacker could inject malicious or unexpected data into the application's reactive flow. This injected data could then be processed by downstream operators, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**  Application logic can be manipulated, leading to data corruption, unexpected application behavior, or even remote code execution if the injected data is processed unsafely downstream.
*   **Affected RxDart Component:** `Subject` (e.g., `PublishSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict access to `Subjects`. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control who can publish data to them.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on data pushed to `Subjects`.
    *   Consider using immutable data structures within `Streams` to prevent unintended modifications.
