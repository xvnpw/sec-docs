# Attack Surface Analysis for reactivex/rxdart

## Attack Surface: [Uncontrolled Subject Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/uncontrolled_subject_data_injection.md)

**Attack Surface:** Uncontrolled Subject Data Injection

* **Description:**  Malicious or unintended data can be injected into the application's data streams through publicly accessible or poorly secured `Subject` instances (like `PublishSubject`).
* **How RxDart Contributes:** `Subject`s, particularly `PublishSubject`, allow external entities to emit new values into the stream. If access to the `sink` or `add` method of a `Subject` is not properly controlled, untrusted sources can inject arbitrary data.
* **Example:** A chat application using a `PublishSubject` for message broadcasting. If the `sink` is exposed without authentication, an attacker could inject malicious messages visible to all users.
* **Impact:** Denial of service (by flooding the stream), data manipulation, triggering unintended application behavior, potentially leading to further exploits depending on how the injected data is processed.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Restrict Access:**  Limit access to `Subject` sinks to authorized components only. Avoid exposing them directly to external systems or untrusted code.
    * **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any data received through `Subject`s before processing it.
    * **Use Appropriate Subject Types:** Consider using `BehaviorSubject` or `ReplaySubject` with carefully managed initial values and buffer sizes if uncontrolled emission is a concern.
    * **Implement Authentication/Authorization:**  If external systems need to emit events, implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Stream Operators](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_stream_operators.md)

**Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Custom Stream Operators

* **Description:**  If developers create custom stream operators, these operators might contain security vulnerabilities if not implemented with security considerations in mind.
* **How RxDart Contributes:** RxDart allows developers to extend its functionality by creating custom operators. If these operators have flaws, they introduce new attack vectors.
* **Example:** A custom operator that performs a complex data transformation but has a buffer overflow vulnerability, allowing an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.
* **Impact:**  The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom operator, ranging from denial of service to arbitrary code execution.
* **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding practices when developing custom operators.
    * **Thorough Testing and Review:**  Implement rigorous testing and code reviews for all custom operators, paying close attention to potential security flaws.
    * **Input Validation within Operators:**  Ensure custom operators properly validate and sanitize any data they process.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure custom operators only have the necessary permissions and access to resources.
