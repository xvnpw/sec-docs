# Attack Tree Analysis for reactivex/rxdart

Objective: Compromise application functionality or data by exploiting weaknesses related to the use of the RxDart library (focusing on high-risk areas).

## Attack Tree Visualization

```

│       └── **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Streamed Data **[CRITICAL NODE]**
│           └── Inject malicious script through a stream that updates UI elements without proper sanitization.
├── **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Improper Subscription Management
│   └── Memory Leaks due to Unmanaged Subscriptions
│       └── Trigger events that create subscriptions that are not properly disposed of, leading to memory exhaustion over time.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Stream Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_stream_manipulation__critical_node_.md)

This represents a broad category of attacks targeting the flow of data within the application's reactive streams.
    * Attackers aim to intercept, modify, or inject malicious data into these streams to compromise functionality or data integrity.
    * Successful exploitation of this node can lead to various downstream attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Inject Malicious Data into Stream [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_stream__critical_node_.md)

This attack vector focuses on inserting harmful data into the application's data streams.
    * If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate data entering streams, attackers can inject malicious payloads.
    * This is a critical entry point for several types of attacks, including XSS, SQL Injection (though less likely directly via RxDart streams intended for UI), and command injection (in very specific, poorly designed scenarios).

## Attack Tree Path: [**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Streamed Data [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_streamed_data__critical_node_.md)

This specific attack involves injecting malicious scripts into data streams that are used to update UI elements.
    * If the application directly renders data from streams without proper escaping or sanitization, the injected script will be executed in the user's browser.
    * This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, and other client-side attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Improper Subscription Management**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_improper_subscription_management.md)

This category of attacks targets the lifecycle management of RxDart subscriptions.
    * Failure to properly unsubscribe from streams can lead to resource leaks and unexpected behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Memory Leaks due to Unmanaged Subscriptions**](./attack_tree_paths/memory_leaks_due_to_unmanaged_subscriptions.md)

This occurs when subscriptions to streams are not disposed of when they are no longer needed.
    * Each unmanaged subscription continues to hold references to objects, preventing garbage collection and leading to increased memory consumption over time.
    * Eventually, this can lead to performance degradation, application instability, and crashes due to out-of-memory errors.
