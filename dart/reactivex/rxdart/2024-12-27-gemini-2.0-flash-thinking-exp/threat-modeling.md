## High and Critical RxDart Threats

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the RxDart library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & How) | Impact | Affected RxDart Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Uncontrolled Data Injection via Subjects** | An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `onNext`, `onError`, or `onComplete` methods of a `Subject` (e.g., `PublishSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`) and injects malicious or unexpected data. This could be due to insecure access control or a vulnerability in a component interacting directly with the Subject. | Data corruption, unexpected application behavior, potential for further exploitation if the injected data triggers vulnerabilities in downstream components (e.g., code injection if the data is used to construct commands). | `Subject` (specifically `PublishSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`) | High | Implement strict access control on Subjects, ensuring only authorized components can push data. Validate and sanitize all data *before* pushing it into Subjects. Consider using immutable data structures to prevent modification after emission. |
| **Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Streams** | An attacker triggers the creation of streams that never complete or emit data indefinitely without proper disposal mechanisms. This leads to memory leaks, CPU exhaustion, or other resource depletion, causing a Denial of Service (DoS). This might involve exploiting logic that creates streams based on external input without proper lifecycle management within RxDart. | Denial of Service (DoS), application instability, performance degradation, potential for crashes. | `Stream`, `Observable`, `Subscription` | High | Ensure proper disposal of stream subscriptions using `dispose()` or `cancel()` when they are no longer needed. Utilize operators like `takeUntil`, `takeWhile`, or `timeout` to limit the lifespan of streams. Implement monitoring for resource usage related to streams. Consider using `RefCountedResource` for shared resources managed by streams. |
| **Denial of Service via Backpressure Exploitation** | An attacker intentionally overwhelms the application by producing data at a rate that significantly exceeds the consumer's capacity within an RxDart stream. This leads to excessive buffering, memory exhaustion, and ultimately a Denial of Service. This involves exploiting a lack of or insufficient backpressure handling in the RxDart stream pipeline. | Denial of Service (DoS), application instability, performance degradation, potential for crashes. | Streams, Backpressure strategies (`buffer`, `debounce`, `throttleTime`, `sample`, `auditTime`) | High | Implement robust backpressure strategies appropriate for the data flow using RxDart's backpressure operators. Monitor stream performance and resource usage. Implement rate limiting or throttling mechanisms at the source of data production *before* it enters the RxDart stream, if possible. Use operators like `onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, or `onBackpressureLatest` appropriately. |
| **Security Vulnerabilities in Custom Operators** | An attacker exploits security flaws within custom RxDart operators created by developers. These flaws could include improper data handling, resource leaks, or vulnerabilities to injection attacks if the operator processes external input without sanitization within the RxDart stream. | Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially leading to data corruption, information disclosure, or DoS. | Custom Operators | High (if critical vulnerability exists) | Thoroughly review and test custom operators for security vulnerabilities. Follow secure coding practices when developing operators. Avoid performing security-sensitive operations directly within custom operators without careful consideration. Consider using well-established and tested operators from the RxDart library or reputable sources. |
| **Code Injection via Dynamically Constructed Stream Logic** | An attacker injects malicious code if stream logic (e.g., operator chains) is dynamically constructed based on user input or external data without proper sanitization within the RxDart context. This allows the attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code within the application's context by manipulating how RxDart streams are built and processed. | Arbitrary code execution, data manipulation, complete compromise of the application. | Dynamically constructed stream pipelines | Critical | Avoid dynamically constructing stream logic based on untrusted input. If necessary, use a safe and well-defined Domain Specific Language (DSL) or a limited set of pre-defined stream configurations. Implement strict input validation and sanitization before using any external data to construct RxDart stream logic. |
