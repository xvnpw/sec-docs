## Attack Tree Path: [1. Manipulate Stream Data](./attack_tree_paths/1__manipulate_stream_data.md)

*   **1.1 Inject Malicious Events (High-Risk Path):** This is the most direct way to corrupt data within the RxDart streams.

    *   **1.1.1 Exploit Unvalidated Input to `Subject` [CRITICAL]:**  The core vulnerability. If input isn't validated *before* entering the stream, the attacker can inject arbitrary data.
        *   **1.1.1.1 Craft input that bypasses application-level validation:** The attacker crafts input that appears valid on the surface but contains malicious payloads or exploits subtle flaws in the validation logic.
            *   Likelihood: High
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Novice
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   **1.1.1.2 Use a Subject that is exposed to untrusted sources [CRITICAL]:**  A direct connection between user input (or any untrusted source) and a `Subject` is a major security flaw.
            *   Likelihood: High
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Very Low
            *   Skill Level: Novice
            *   Detection Difficulty: Easy

    *   **1.1.2 Exploit Weaknesses in Custom Stream Operators:**
        *   **1.1.2.3 Logic errors in the custom operator's transformation logic [CRITICAL]:**  If a custom operator has flaws in its data transformation logic, an attacker might be able to manipulate the data even if the initial input was validated. This requires the attacker to understand the operator's intended behavior and find a way to subvert it.
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: Medium to High
            *   Effort: Medium
            *   Skill Level: Intermediate
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Leak Stream Data](./attack_tree_paths/2__leak_stream_data.md)

*   **2.1 Unauthorized Stream Subscription:** The attacker gains access to data they shouldn't have.

    *   **2.1.1 Gain access to a `Subject` or `Stream` that should be private. [CRITICAL]:** This is the fundamental goal of data leakage attacks.
        *   **2.1.1.3 Exploit logical errors in the application code that inadvertently expose a stream. [CRITICAL]:**  This is often due to programming mistakes, such as accidentally making a stream public or accessible through an unintended pathway.
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Intermediate
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Disrupt Stream Processing (Denial of Service)](./attack_tree_paths/3__disrupt_stream_processing__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **3.1 Overload Stream with Events (High-Risk Path):**  The attacker floods the system with data, causing it to slow down or crash.

    *   **3.1.1 Flood a `Subject` with a high volume of events [CRITICAL]:**  The attacker sends a massive number of events to a `Subject`, overwhelming its processing capacity and any downstream subscribers.
        *   **3.1.1.1 Exploit any exposed `Subject` that accepts input from an untrusted source. [CRITICAL]:**  This is the easiest way to execute a DoS attack. If a `Subject` is directly connected to an untrusted source without rate limiting, it's highly vulnerable.
            *   Likelihood: High
            *   Impact: Medium to High
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Novice
            *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
