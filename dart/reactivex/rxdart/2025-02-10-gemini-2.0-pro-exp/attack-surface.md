# Attack Surface Analysis for reactivex/rxdart

## Attack Surface: [Stream Logic Errors](./attack_surfaces/stream_logic_errors.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect use of RxDart operators (e.g., `switchMap`, `debounce`, `combineLatest`, `merge`, etc.) leads to unexpected application behavior, potentially bypassing security controls or causing data corruption.
    *   **RxDart Contribution:** RxDart's rich operator set increases complexity, making it easier to introduce subtle logic errors that affect stream processing.  The asynchronous nature of these operations makes debugging more difficult.
    *   **Example:** A `combineLatest` operator is used to combine a stream of user roles with a stream of resource access permissions.  If the roles stream emits an update *before* the permissions stream has completed initialization, the combined stream might temporarily grant incorrect access.
    *   **Impact:** Bypass of security controls (e.g., rate limiting, input validation, authorization checks), data corruption, unexpected state transitions, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific logic error and its consequences).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thorough Testing:** Extensive unit and integration tests covering all stream operators and their combinations, including edge cases, error conditions, and timing-related scenarios.  Focus on testing the *intended behavior* and *unintended consequences* of operator misuse.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Focused code reviews specifically examining the use of RxDart operators and their interactions.  Reviewers should have a strong understanding of RxDart's semantics.
        *   **Linting:** Utilize linters with RxDart-specific rules (if available) to catch common operator misuse and potential logic errors.
        *   **Simplified Logic:** Prefer simpler stream logic where possible. Break down complex streams into smaller, more manageable, and independently testable units.
        *   **Formal Verification (Advanced):** In highly critical systems (e.g., financial applications, medical devices), consider formal verification techniques to mathematically prove the correctness of stream logic.

## Attack Surface: [Error Handling Failures](./attack_surfaces/error_handling_failures.md)

*   **Description:** Unhandled errors within RxDart streams can propagate unexpectedly, leading to application crashes, inconsistent state, or bypass of security checks.
    *   **RxDart Contribution:** RxDart's error handling model requires explicit handling of errors within streams using `onError` callbacks or operators like `catchError`.  Errors can be easily overlooked or mishandled, especially in complex stream pipelines.
    *   **Example:** A stream processing user input encounters an invalid data format error during a critical authentication step.  If the error is not caught and handled, the application might skip subsequent validation steps, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes (DoS), inconsistent application state, bypass of security checks (authentication, authorization), data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the error and its consequences).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling using `onError` callbacks or operators like `catchError` and `retry` *at every stage* of the stream pipeline where errors might occur.
        *   **Graceful Recovery:** Ensure that error handling logic leads to a graceful recovery of the application to a safe and consistent state.  Avoid leaving the application in an undefined or partially updated state.
        *   **Logging:** Log all errors appropriately, including context information (e.g., user ID, input data, timestamp) to aid in debugging and auditing.
        *   **Global Error Handler:** Consider using a global error handler to catch any unhandled stream errors and prevent application crashes.  This acts as a last line of defense.
        *   **Defensive Programming:** Anticipate potential errors and implement defensive programming techniques (e.g., input validation, boundary checks) to prevent them from occurring in the first place.

## Attack Surface: [Subject State Exposure](./attack_surfaces/subject_state_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data stored in `BehaviorSubject` or `ReplaySubject` instances can be exposed to unauthorized components or users if access is not properly controlled.
    *   **RxDart Contribution:** `BehaviorSubject` and `ReplaySubject` hold and replay values to *all* new subscribers, making them potential points of data leakage if not managed carefully.  This is a fundamental characteristic of these subject types.
    *   **Example:** A `BehaviorSubject` storing a user's session token.  If a new, unauthorized component subscribes to this subject (perhaps due to a coding error or a dependency injection misconfiguration), it could gain access to the token and impersonate the user.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data (e.g., authentication tokens, personal information, financial data), potential for privilege escalation or impersonation, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the data).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Access Control:** Carefully control the scope and access to `BehaviorSubject` and `ReplaySubject` instances.  Use private fields and restrict access to authorized components using dependency injection or other access control mechanisms.
        *   **Data Minimization:** Avoid storing sensitive data *directly* in subjects if possible.  Instead, use derived streams or other mechanisms to provide only the *necessary* information to subscribers, transforming or filtering the sensitive data as needed.
        *   **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data stored within subjects to protect it from unauthorized access even if the subject is exposed.  Use appropriate key management practices.
        *   **Value Clearing:** Clear the subject's value (e.g., set to `null` or a default value) when the sensitive data is no longer needed or when the user logs out.  This minimizes the window of exposure.
        *   **Short-Lived Subjects:** Use short-lived subjects for sensitive data, disposing of them as soon as they are no longer required.  This reduces the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in RxDart and its Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_rxdart_and_its_dependencies.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities may exist in the RxDart library itself or its dependencies.
    * **RxDart Contribution:** RxDart is a third-party library, and like any software, it may contain vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in RxDart's `combineLatest` operator that could lead to unexpected behavior under certain conditions.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability; could range from minor issues to critical security exploits.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (Low to Critical, depending on the vulnerability). Can be High to Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Updated:** Regularly update RxDart and all its dependencies to the latest versions to receive security patches.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in RxDart and its dependencies.
        *   **Security Advisories:** Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE) for any reported issues related to RxDart.
        *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit project dependencies to identify and address any outdated or vulnerable packages.
