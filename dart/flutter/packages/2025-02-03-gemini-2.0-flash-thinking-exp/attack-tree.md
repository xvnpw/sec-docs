```

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerable Package Code](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerable_package_code.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities directly within the code of a Flutter package used by the application.
*   **Critical Node: 1.1.3. Exploit Identified Vulnerability in Package Code:** This is the point where a known vulnerability (CVE) in a package is actively exploited.
    *   **e.g., Remote Code Execution (RCE) (High Risk Path):**  Attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the application's environment due to a package vulnerability.
    *   **e.g., Data Breach/Information Disclosure (High Risk Path):** Attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive data due to a package vulnerability.
*   **Critical Node: 1.2.3. Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerability in Package Code:** This is the point where a previously unknown vulnerability (zero-day) in a package is exploited.
    *   **e.g., Same as 1.1.3 (RCE, Data Breach) (High Risk Path):** Similar to exploiting known vulnerabilities, but using a zero-day, making detection harder initially.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies) of Flutter packages.
*   **High Risk Path: 2.2. Exploit Vulnerable Transitive Dependency:** Focuses on vulnerabilities hidden deeper in the dependency tree.
*   **Critical Node: 2.2.3. Exploit Vulnerability in Transitive Dependency:**  The point where a vulnerability in a transitive dependency is exploited.
    *   **e.g., Same as 1.1.3 (RCE, Data Breach) (High Risk Path):**  Similar impact as exploiting direct package vulnerabilities, but often overlooked due to focus on direct dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Supply Chain Compromise of Packages](./attack_tree_paths/3__supply_chain_compromise_of_packages.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Compromising the application by using a package that has been maliciously altered or injected into the supply chain.
*   **High Risk Path: 3.2. Compromised Package Maintainer Account:**  Attackers target package maintainer accounts to inject malicious code.
    *   **Critical Node: 3.2.2. Publish Malicious Package Versions via Compromised Account:**  The critical action of publishing malicious package versions after gaining control of a maintainer account.
*   **Critical Node: 3.3. Compromised Package Build/Release Pipeline:** Attackers compromise the automated systems used to build and release packages.
    *   **Critical Node: 3.3.2. Inject Malicious Code during Package Build/Release Process:** The point where malicious code is injected into the package during the automated build process.
*   **Critical Node: 3.4. Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attack:** Attackers exploit naming similarities to trick applications into downloading malicious packages instead of intended ones.
    *   **Critical Node: 3.4.3. Application inadvertently downloads and uses malicious package:** The point where the application mistakenly downloads and uses a malicious package due to dependency confusion.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Package Misuse by Developers](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_package_misuse_by_developers.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Compromising the application due to insecure or incorrect usage of Flutter packages by developers.
*   **High Risk Path: 4.1. Insecure Package Configuration:** Developers using packages with insecure default settings or misconfiguring security options.
    *   **High Risk Path: 4.1.1. Use Default, Insecure Package Settings:** Relying on default package configurations that are not secure.
    *   **High Risk Path: 4.1.2. Package exposes insecure configuration options:** Packages offer configuration options that, if misused, weaken security.
        *   **e.g., Exposed API keys, credentials in package configuration (High Risk Path):** Developers inadvertently expose sensitive credentials through package configuration.
*   **High Risk Path: 4.2. Improper Input Validation when using Packages:** Developers failing to validate input before passing it to package functions, leading to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Critical Node: 4.2.2. Package vulnerability triggered by lack of input validation:** The point where a package vulnerability is exploited because the application didn't validate input.
*   **High Risk Path: 4.4. Exposed Sensitive Data via Package:** Packages unintentionally or intentionally expose sensitive data.
    *   **High Risk Path: 4.4.1. Package logs or stores sensitive data insecurely:** Packages logging or storing sensitive data in an insecure manner.
    *   **High Risk Path: 4.4.3. Developer exposes sensitive data by incorrect package use:** Developers misusing package features and inadvertently exposing sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Outdated Packages](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_outdated_packages.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of Flutter packages used by the application.
*   **High Risk Path: 5.1. Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Older Package Versions:** Targeting applications that use outdated packages with known CVEs.
*   **Critical Node: 5.1.3. Exploit Known Vulnerability in Outdated Package:** The point where a known vulnerability in an outdated package is exploited.
