# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Flutter packages repository provides a collection of officially maintained packages that extend the core functionality of the Flutter framework. This repository is crucial for the Flutter ecosystem, enabling developers to build more complex and feature-rich applications.

- Business priorities and goals:
  - Provide high-quality, reliable, and secure packages to the Flutter developer community.
  - Expand the capabilities of the Flutter framework through well-maintained and feature-rich packages.
  - Encourage adoption of Flutter by providing a comprehensive ecosystem of tools and libraries.
  - Maintain the reputation and trust of the Flutter framework and ecosystem.

- Most important business risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in packages could compromise applications built using them, damaging the reputation of Flutter and the packages repository.
  - Unreliable or poorly maintained packages could hinder developer productivity and adoption of Flutter.
  - Supply chain attacks targeting the packages repository could distribute malicious code to a large number of developers.
  - Downtime or unavailability of the packages repository or related services (like pub.dev) could disrupt Flutter development workflows.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security controls:
  - security control: Code review process for contributions to the repository. (Implemented in: GitHub pull request review process)
  - security control: Automated testing (unit, integration, etc.) to ensure package quality and identify potential issues. (Implemented in: GitHub Actions workflows within the repository)
  - security control: Static analysis and linting tools to enforce code quality and security best practices. (Implemented in: GitHub Actions workflows within the repository)
  - security control: Dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in package dependencies. (Likely implemented in: GitHub Actions workflows or internal Google security tooling)
  - security control: Access control to the repository via GitHub permissions, limiting who can commit and merge code. (Implemented in: GitHub repository settings)
  - security control: Usage of GitHub's security features like Dependabot for vulnerability alerts. (Implemented in: GitHub repository settings)
  - security control: Publicly accessible repository, allowing community scrutiny and vulnerability reporting. (Implemented in: GitHub repository settings)

- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in packages due to the complexity of software and the open-source nature of the project.
  - accepted risk: Risk of malicious contributions being merged despite code review, although mitigated by review processes and community scrutiny.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on third-party dependencies, which may introduce vulnerabilities outside of the direct control of the Flutter team.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation process for each package to improve supply chain transparency.
  - security control: Integrate automated security scanning tools (SAST/DAST) into the CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process, including a security contact and public security policy.
  - security control: Perform regular security audits and penetration testing of critical packages and infrastructure.
  - security control: Implement signing of packages to ensure integrity and authenticity when distributed via pub.dev.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Only authorized Flutter team members should be able to commit and publish packages. (Implemented via GitHub authentication and repository permissions)
  - Authorization:
    - Granular access control within the repository to manage permissions for different packages and functionalities. (Implemented via GitHub teams and repository settings)
  - Input validation:
    - Ensure all inputs to the packages (e.g., API parameters, configuration files) are properly validated to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities. (Responsibility of package developers, enforced through code review and testing)
  - Cryptography:
    - Packages should utilize cryptography correctly and securely when handling sensitive data. (Responsibility of package developers, guided by security best practices and code review)
    - Protect sensitive data used in the build and deployment process, such as API keys and signing certificates. (Implemented via secure secret management in CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure)

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
  - Distribution of secure and reliable Flutter packages to developers.
  - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the Flutter package ecosystem.
  - Protecting the reputation and trust of the Flutter framework and packages.

- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
  - Source code of Flutter packages: High sensitivity. Compromise could lead to vulnerabilities in Flutter applications and intellectual property theft.
  - Package signing keys (if implemented): Critical sensitivity. Compromise could allow attackers to publish malicious packages.
  - Credentials for publishing to pub.dev: High sensitivity. Compromise could allow unauthorized package publishing.
  - Build environment secrets and configurations: Medium sensitivity. Could be exploited to compromise the build process.
  - Package metadata (package names, versions, descriptions): Low sensitivity. Publicly available information, but integrity is important.
