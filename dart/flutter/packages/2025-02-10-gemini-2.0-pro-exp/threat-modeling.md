# Threat Model Analysis for flutter/packages

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Package](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_package.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package or compromises an existing package on pub.dev (or another package repository). The malicious code could be directly in the package's main code, in a dependency, or even injected during the build process via a malicious build script. The attacker might use obfuscation techniques. The attacker's goal is to execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete application compromise.
        *   Data theft (user credentials, personal information, API keys).
        *   Remote code execution on the user's device.
        *   Installation of malware or ransomware.
        *   Cryptojacking.
        *   Reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any part of the package's code: `lib` directory, build scripts (`build.dart`), and transitive dependencies. Functions/modules handling sensitive data or system API interactions are high-risk.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thorough Package Vetting:** Prioritize packages from trusted authors/organizations with strong history and positive feedback. Examine source code (if available) for suspicious patterns.
        *   **Version Pinning:** Specify *exact* package versions in `pubspec.yaml` (e.g., `package_name: 1.2.3`). Avoid version ranges unless absolutely necessary.
        *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit dependencies using `dart pub outdated` and vulnerability databases (OSV, Snyk, GitHub Security Advisories).
        *   **Static Analysis:** Employ static analysis tools to detect malicious code patterns or known vulnerable dependencies.
        *   **Limited Permissions:** Application should request only minimum necessary permissions.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Review critical dependencies' code, especially those handling sensitive data or security operations.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerable Dependency](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerable_dependency.md)

*   **Description:** A package (or its transitive dependency) contains a known or unknown security vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, injection flaw, insecure deserialization). An attacker crafts input or exploits a condition to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker *exploits* an existing flaw, not modifying the package.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Similar to malicious code injection (but unintentional vulnerability).
        *   Data breaches.
        *   Denial of service.
        *   Remote code execution.
        *   Privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific module/function/class within the package (or its dependency) containing the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depends on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep packages up-to-date: `dart pub upgrade`. Prioritize security updates.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use automated scanners (OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, Dependabot) to find known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Dependency Tree Analysis:** Understand the full dependency tree (`dart pub deps`) to identify weak points and assess transitive dependency vulnerabilities.
        *   **Security Advisories:** Monitor security advisories/mailing lists for Flutter, Dart, and common packages.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion Attack](./threats/dependency_confusion_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package on a public repository (pub.dev) with the *same name* as a private/internal package. The attacker relies on misconfigured package managers/build systems to prioritize the *public* (malicious) package.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Execution of attacker's malicious code instead of internal code.
        *   Data theft.
        *   Remote code execution.
        *   Application compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire package being "confused" is replaced. Attacker's code replaces the legitimate internal package.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Scoped Packages:** Use scoped package names (e.g., `@your-company/your-package`) to prevent naming collisions. *This is the best mitigation.*
        *   **Private Package Repositories:** Host private packages on a secure, private repository (private pub.dev, private GitHub repo, JFrog Artifactory).
        *   **Explicit Source Configuration:** Configure `pub` to prioritize the private repository. Use `dependency_overrides` in `pubspec.yaml` during development. Configure CI/CD to use correct sources.
        *   **Verification of Package Sources:** Review package source URLs during installation/updates to ensure they're from the expected location (your private repo).

## Threat: [Typo-Squatting Attack](./threats/typo-squatting_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package with a name *very similar* to a popular package (e.g., `http_client` vs. `http-client`). The attacker relies on developer typos when adding dependencies.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Execution of attacker's malicious code.
        *   Data theft.
        *   Remote code execution.
        *   Application compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire typo-squatted package. Attacker's code replaces the intended package.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Package Name Entry:** Double-check package names in `pubspec.yaml`.
        *   **Code Completion:** Use IDE code completion/auto-import to avoid typos.
        *   **Package Verification:** Before adding a dependency, verify name and author on pub.dev.
        *   **Copy and Paste:** Copy the package name directly from pub.dev into your `pubspec.yaml`.
