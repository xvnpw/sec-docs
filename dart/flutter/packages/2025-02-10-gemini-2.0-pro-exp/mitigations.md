# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for flutter/packages

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous Package Selection and Vetting](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous_package_selection_and_vetting.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Criteria:** Define clear criteria for acceptable packages. This includes:
        *   Source (prefer `flutter/packages` and well-known publishers).
        *   Popularity (downloads, likes, pub points).
        *   Maintenance activity (recent commits, issue resolution).
        *   License compatibility (MIT, BSD, etc.).
        *   Documentation quality.
    2.  **Initial Screening:** Before adding *any* new package, perform a quick initial screening against the criteria. Reject packages that clearly fail.
    3.  **Deeper Review (Critical Packages):** For packages handling sensitive data, security functions, or having a large impact:
        *   **Manual Code Review:** Examine the *package's* source code for common vulnerabilities (input validation, data storage, hardcoded credentials, deprecated APIs, DoS potential).
        *   **Maintainer Investigation:** Research the *package* maintainer's reputation and responsiveness.
        *   **Alternative Search:** Actively look for alternative *packages* that might be more secure or better maintained.
    4.  **Document Decisions:** Keep a record of why each *package* was chosen (or rejected), including the review findings.
    5.  **Regular Re-evaluation:** Periodically (e.g., every 3-6 months) re-evaluate existing *packages* against the criteria, especially if there are updates or security advisories.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Packages (High Severity):** Packages intentionally designed to steal data, install malware, or disrupt the application.
    *   **Vulnerable Packages (High to Medium Severity):** Packages with unintentional security flaws that can be exploited.
    *   **Abandoned Packages (Medium Severity):** Packages that are no longer maintained, increasing the risk of unpatched vulnerabilities.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (High Severity):** Attacks where a legitimate package is compromised at the source. (This mitigation helps *reduce* the risk, but doesn't eliminate it entirely).
    *   **License Violations (Low to Medium Severity):** Using a package with a license that is incompatible with your project.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Packages:** Significantly reduces the risk of introducing malicious code *from packages*.
    *   **Vulnerable Packages:** Reduces the likelihood of using *packages* with known or easily discoverable vulnerabilities.
    *   **Abandoned Packages:** Reduces the risk of relying on unmaintained *package* code.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Provides some level of defense by favoring well-maintained and reputable *packages*.
    *   **License Violations:** Prevents legal issues related to improper *package* usage.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   [Example: *We have a basic checklist for package selection, but no formal code review process for critical packages.  Checklist is in the `docs/package_selection.md` file.*]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Example: *We need to implement a formal code review process specifically for critical packages.  We also need to establish a regular schedule for re-evaluating existing packages.*]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Analysis and Vulnerability Scanning](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_analysis_and_vulnerability_scanning.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Tool:** Select a vulnerability scanning tool that specifically targets Dart/Flutter *packages* (e.g., `dart pub outdated --mode=security`, Snyk, Dependabot).
    2.  **Integrate into CI/CD:** Add the *package* scanning tool to your continuous integration/continuous delivery pipeline.
    3.  **Configure Scanning:** Set up the tool to scan for vulnerabilities in both direct and transitive *dependencies (packages)*.
    4.  **Automated Alerts:** Configure alerts for when *package* vulnerabilities are found.
    5.  **Triage Vulnerabilities:** When a *package* vulnerability is detected:
        *   **Assess Severity:** Determine the severity.
        *   **Investigate Impact:** Understand how the *package* vulnerability could affect your application.
        *   **Prioritize Remediation:** Address high-severity *package* vulnerabilities immediately.
    6.  **Remediation:**
        *   **Update Package:** If a patched version of the *package* is available, update.
        *   **Alternative Package:** If no patch is available, consider switching to a different *package*.
        *   **Fork and Fix (Last Resort):** If necessary, fork the *package* and apply the fix.
    7.  **Regular Manual Checks:** Periodically run `dart pub outdated --mode=security` manually.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable Packages (High to Medium Severity):** *Packages* with known security flaws.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (High Severity):** Helps detect if a previously safe *package* has been compromised.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Low Probability, High Severity):** Scanning tools can quickly identify *package* vulnerabilities once they become known.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerable Packages:** Significantly reduces the risk of using *packages* with known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Provides a crucial early warning system for compromised *packages*.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Improves the speed of response when new *package* vulnerabilities are disclosed.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   [Example: *We have Dependabot enabled on our GitHub repository. We also run `dart pub outdated --mode=security` manually before each release.*]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Example: *We need to integrate `dart pub outdated --mode=security` into our CI/CD pipeline to run on every build. We should also explore Snyk for more comprehensive *package* scanning.*]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Package Pinning and Version Control](./mitigation_strategies/package_pinning_and_version_control.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Precise Versioning:** In your `pubspec.yaml` file, specify exact *package* versions (e.g., `my_package: 1.2.3`), *not* version ranges.
    2.  **`pubspec.lock`:** Always commit the `pubspec.lock` file. This locks down the exact versions of all *dependencies (packages)*.
    3.  **Controlled Updates:** When updating *packages*:
        *   **Review Changelogs:** Carefully read the changelog for the new *package* version.
        *   **Test Thoroughly:** Run tests after updating *packages*.
        *   **Staged Rollouts (If Possible):** Consider a staged rollout.
    4.  **Avoid `pub get` in Production:** Do *not* run `pub get` on production servers. Use pre-built artifacts.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unexpected Breaking Changes (Medium Severity):** Prevents *package* updates that introduce incompatible changes.
    *   **Vulnerable Packages (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental upgrades to a vulnerable *package* version.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity):** Reduces the window of opportunity for a compromised *package* to be introduced.
    *   **Inconsistent Builds (Medium Severity):** Ensures builds are reproducible.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unexpected Breaking Changes:** Eliminates breakages due to automatic *package* updates.
    *   **Vulnerable Packages:** Reduces the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through *package* updates.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Provides a layer of defense by requiring explicit *package* updates.
    *   **Inconsistent Builds:** Guarantees consistent builds.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   [Example: *We always commit our `pubspec.lock` file. We use precise version numbers in `pubspec.yaml`.*]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Example: *We need to implement a more rigorous process for reviewing changelogs and testing before updating packages.*]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Forking and Maintaining (Last Resort)](./mitigation_strategies/forking_and_maintaining__last_resort_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical, Unmaintained Packages:** Identify *packages* that are essential but unmaintained.
    2.  **Assess Vulnerabilities:** Determine if the *package* has vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Fork the Repository:** Create a fork of the *package's* repository.
    4.  **Apply Security Fixes:** Apply security patches to your forked version of the *package*.
    5.  **Maintain the Fork:** Regularly update your fork and address new vulnerabilities in the *package*.
    6.  **Consider Upstreaming:** Contribute fixes back to the original *package* project (if possible).
    7.  **Update `pubspec.yaml`:** Point your `pubspec.yaml` to your forked *package* repository.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Abandoned Packages (Medium Severity):** Allows continued use of a critical *package* while addressing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerable Packages (High to Medium Severity):** Provides a way to fix vulnerabilities in the *package* when the maintainer is unresponsive.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Abandoned Packages:** Eliminates the risk of relying on unmaintained *package* code with known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerable Packages:** Allows you to directly address security issues within the *package*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   [Example: *We have not forked any packages yet.*]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Example: *We need to identify any critical, unmaintained packages that might require forking in the future.*]
