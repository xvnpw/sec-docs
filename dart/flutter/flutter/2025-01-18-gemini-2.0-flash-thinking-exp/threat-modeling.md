# Threat Model Analysis for flutter/flutter

## Threat: [Insecure Data Transmission over Platform Channels](./threats/insecure_data_transmission_over_platform_channels.md)

**Threat:** Insecure Data Transmission over Platform Channels
*   **Description:** An attacker could intercept communication between the Flutter UI and native code (Android/iOS) if the data transmitted over platform channels (provided by Flutter) is not encrypted. This allows them to eavesdrop on sensitive information being exchanged.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential for data manipulation if the attacker can inject messages.
*   **Affected Component:** `flutter/flutter/packages/flutter/lib/services/platform_channel.dart` (`MethodChannel`, `EventChannel`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Encrypt sensitive data before sending it over platform channels.
    *   Use secure protocols or libraries for communication within the native implementation of the platform channel.
    *   Avoid transmitting highly sensitive information through platform channels if possible, or use alternative secure communication methods.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Native Functionality via Platform Channels](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_native_functionality_via_platform_channels.md)

**Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Native Functionality via Platform Channels
*   **Description:** A malicious actor could exploit overly permissive or poorly designed platform channel interfaces (defined within the Flutter framework for communication with native code) to access sensitive native APIs or data that should not be exposed to the Flutter layer. This could involve invoking native functions with unintended parameters or accessing protected resources through the established communication bridge.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to device features or data, potential for remote code execution if vulnerable native APIs are exposed through the Flutter-defined channel.
*   **Affected Component:**  `flutter/flutter/packages/flutter/lib/services/platform_channel.dart` (the mechanism itself), and specific platform channel method implementations defined by the developer using Flutter's APIs.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege when designing platform channel interfaces. Only expose necessary functionality through the methods defined using Flutter's platform channel APIs.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the native side for data received from Flutter through the platform channel.
    *   Enforce proper authorization and authentication checks within the native code before granting access to sensitive resources accessed via the Flutter-initiated platform channel calls.

## Threat: [JavaScript Interop Vulnerabilities (Flutter for Web)](./threats/javascript_interop_vulnerabilities__flutter_for_web_.md)

**Threat:** JavaScript Interop Vulnerabilities (Flutter for Web)
*   **Description:** When Flutter for web (a component of the `flutter/flutter` repository) interacts with JavaScript code using Flutter's provided interop mechanisms, vulnerabilities in the JavaScript code or the interop layer itself can be exploited. This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or other client-side vulnerabilities within the context of the Flutter web application.
*   **Impact:** XSS attacks, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft within the web application.
*   **Affected Component:** `flutter/flutter/packages/flutter_web_plugins/lib/src/js.dart` (the `js` package used for interop), and the underlying mechanisms within Flutter for web that handle JavaScript communication.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and validate all data received from JavaScript before using it in Flutter.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when writing JavaScript code that interacts with Flutter through the provided interop APIs.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate XSS attacks in the Flutter web application.
    *   Regularly update the Flutter framework to benefit from security patches in the web rendering and interop components.
