# Attack Surface Analysis for flutter/flutter

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Platform Channel Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_platform_channel_communication.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the communication bridge between Dart code and native platform code (Android/iOS/Desktop). Improper handling of data passed through these channels can lead to various exploits.

**How Flutter Contributes:** Flutter relies on Platform Channels for accessing platform-specific functionalities. This introduces a boundary where data serialization, deserialization, and native code execution occur, creating potential vulnerabilities if not handled securely.

**Example:** A Flutter app sends user input to native code via a Platform Channel to perform a database query. If the native code doesn't sanitize this input, it could be vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution in the native context, privilege escalation, data breaches, application crashes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on both the Dart and native sides of the Platform Channel.
    *   Use type-safe data passing mechanisms and avoid relying on raw strings for sensitive data.
    *   Minimize the amount of data passed through Platform Channels.
    *   Thoroughly review and test native code implementations called via Platform Channels for security vulnerabilities.
    *   Utilize secure serialization/deserialization libraries.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Flutter Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_flutter_plugins.md)

**Description:** Security flaws present in third-party Flutter packages (plugins) obtained from pub.dev or other sources.

**How Flutter Contributes:** Flutter's ecosystem encourages the use of plugins to extend functionality. Relying on external code introduces the risk of inheriting vulnerabilities present in those plugins.

**Example:** A popular image processing plugin has a buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker could craft a malicious image that, when processed by the plugin, allows for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:**  Application crashes, arbitrary code execution, data breaches, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Carefully vet and audit the source code of plugins before using them.
    *   Choose plugins from reputable and well-maintained sources.
    *   Keep plugin dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Utilize static analysis tools to scan plugin code for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider the principle of least privilege when granting permissions requested by plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Native Libraries (FFI)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_native_libraries__ffi_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities introduced when Flutter applications interact with native libraries using Foreign Function Interface (FFI).

**How Flutter Contributes:** Flutter allows developers to call native code directly using FFI. If these native libraries have vulnerabilities or the interaction is not handled securely, it expands the attack surface.

**Example:** A Flutter application uses an FFI binding to a C library with a known buffer overflow. Passing overly long input from the Flutter side could trigger this vulnerability.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, memory corruption, application crashes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Thoroughly audit and test any native libraries used via FFI for security vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement strict input validation before passing data to native functions.
    *   Use memory-safe programming practices in the native code.
    *   Keep native library dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Build Process Compromise](./attack_surfaces/build_process_compromise.md)

**Description:**  Malicious actors compromising the build environment used to create the Flutter application, leading to the injection of malicious code into the final application.

**How Flutter Contributes:** The Flutter build process involves compiling Dart code and integrating native components. Vulnerabilities in the build pipeline can be exploited to inject malicious code.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the developer's machine or the CI/CD pipeline and modifies the build scripts to include malware in the final application binary.

**Impact:**  Distribution of malware to end-users, data theft, compromised application functionality.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Secure the development and build environments.
    *   Implement strong access controls and authentication for build systems.
    *   Use trusted and verified build tools and dependencies.
    *   Regularly scan build environments for malware and vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement code signing to ensure the integrity of the application.
