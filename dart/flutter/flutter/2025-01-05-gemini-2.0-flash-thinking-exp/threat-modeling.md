# Threat Model Analysis for flutter/flutter

## Threat: [Dart VM Exploitation](./threats/dart_vm_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability within the Dart Virtual Machine (VM), which is a core component of the Flutter Engine. This could involve crafting specific inputs or exploiting memory management flaws to execute arbitrary code within the application's process, bypassing Flutter's safeguards.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access to device resources, or denial of service. This directly impacts the security and integrity of applications built with Flutter.
*   **Affected Component:** Dart VM (within the Flutter Engine).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the Flutter SDK updated to the latest stable version, as updates often include security patches for the Dart VM. This is the primary way to address known vulnerabilities in the core Flutter framework.
    *   Monitor security advisories related to the Dart language and Flutter framework published by the Flutter team.

## Threat: [Platform Channel Data Tampering](./threats/platform_channel_data_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication over Platform Channels, a mechanism provided by Flutter to interact with native platform code (Android/iOS/Desktop). They could then modify the data being exchanged between the Dart code and the native side, potentially manipulating application behavior or gaining unauthorized access to native functionalities exposed through the platform channels. This vulnerability lies within Flutter's interop layer.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions performed by the application by manipulating native functionalities, potential privilege escalation on the native platform by exploiting insecurely implemented native code accessible via platform channels.
*   **Affected Component:** Platform Channels (specifically the `MethodChannel`, `BasicMessageChannel`, or `EventChannel` classes within the Flutter framework).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Encrypt sensitive data before passing it over Platform Channels. This adds a layer of protection against interception and modification.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on both the Dart and native sides of the channel to prevent malicious data from being processed.
    *   Carefully review and secure the native code that is being invoked through Platform Channels, as vulnerabilities there can be exploited via this interface provided by Flutter.
