# Threat Model Analysis for flutter/flutter

## Threat: [Malicious Package Installation (Typosquatting/Compromise)](./threats/malicious_package_installation__typosquattingcompromise_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker publishes a malicious package to `pub.dev` with a name similar to a popular package (typosquatting) or compromises a legitimate package and injects malicious code. A developer unknowingly installs this package.
    *   **How:** The attacker relies on developers making typographical errors or failing to thoroughly vet package sources. For compromised packages, the attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in the package maintainer's account or infrastructure.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Code execution in the developer's environment.
    *   Inclusion of malicious code in the final application, leading to data theft, unauthorized actions, or other malicious behavior on user devices.
    *   Compromise of build servers or CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Affected Flutter Component:**
    *   `pubspec.yaml` (dependency management file)
    *   Dart/Flutter code that uses the malicious package.
    *   Potentially, the entire application.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if the malicious package is widely used or grants extensive access) or High (if the package has limited functionality or is used in a less critical part of the app).  Classifying as **Critical** due to the potential for widespread impact.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Careful Package Selection:** Double-check package names, author details, and repository URLs before installing. Look for established packages with good reputations and active maintenance.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools like `dart pub outdated --mode=security` (for known vulnerabilities) and third-party dependency vulnerability scanners (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot) to automatically detect known malicious or vulnerable packages.
        *   **Version Pinning:** Pin dependencies to specific versions in `pubspec.yaml` (e.g., `package_name: ^1.2.3` instead of `package_name: any`). This prevents automatic updates to potentially compromised versions. Regularly review and update these pinned versions.
        *   **Private Package Repository:** For internal or sensitive dependencies, use a private package repository (e.g., JFrog Artifactory, GitLab Package Registry) to control access and reduce the risk of external compromise.
        *   **Package Signature Verification:** If the package repository and packages support it, verify package signatures to ensure authenticity.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Include dependency review as part of the code review process.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Limit the permissions and capabilities of build servers and CI/CD pipelines to reduce the impact of a compromised package.

## Threat: [Compiled Dart Code Modification](./threats/compiled_dart_code_modification.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains root/administrator access to the device (mobile or desktop) and modifies the compiled Flutter application binary or associated data files.
    *   **How:** This requires significant access to the device. The attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in the operating system or use social engineering to gain root/admin privileges.  While this *affects* Flutter, the root cause is OS-level security.  However, Flutter's compilation to native code *does* present a target.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete control over the application's behavior.
    *   Data theft, unauthorized actions, bypassing security controls.
    *   Installation of backdoors or other malware.
*   **Affected Flutter Component:**
    *   The compiled application binary (e.g., `.apk` on Android, `.app` on iOS, `.exe` on Windows).
    *   Associated data files.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if successful).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Code Signing:** Use code signing (where supported by the platform) to ensure the integrity of the application binary. This helps detect unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Obfuscation:** Use code obfuscation techniques to make reverse engineering and modification more difficult. *Note:* Obfuscation is not a strong security measure on its own, but it can increase the effort required for an attacker.
        *   **Secure Storage:** Store sensitive data securely using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android, DPAPI on Windows). Do not store sensitive data directly in the application binary or easily accessible data files.
        *   **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):** Consider using RASP techniques (if available and appropriate for the platform) to detect and respond to runtime attacks, such as code injection or memory tampering. This is a more advanced technique.
        *   **Tamper Detection (Limited):** Implement basic tamper detection mechanisms (e.g., checksums of critical files), but be aware that these can often be bypassed by sophisticated attackers.

## Threat: [Platform Channel Data Tampering](./threats/platform_channel_data_tampering.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker intercepts or modifies data being passed between the Flutter (Dart) side and the native (platform-specific) side of an application via platform channels.
    *   **How:** This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the native code handling the platform channel, or using techniques like man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks if the communication is not properly secured.  This is *directly* related to Flutter's architecture.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Manipulation of application behavior.
    *   Data theft or corruption.
    *   Bypassing security controls implemented on either the Dart or native side.
*   **Affected Flutter Component:**
    *   `MethodChannel`, `EventChannel`, `BasicMessageChannel` (Flutter platform channel APIs).
    *   The native code that implements the platform channel handlers.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate all data received from platform channels on *both* the Dart and native sides. Do not assume that data from either side is trustworthy.
        *   **Secure Communication:** If sensitive data is being transmitted, use secure communication protocols (e.g., encryption, authentication) for platform channel communication. This might involve using platform-specific security APIs.
        *   **Minimize Platform Channel Usage:** Where possible, favor pure Dart implementations over platform channels to reduce the attack surface.
        *   **Secure Native Code:** Write secure native code, following best practices for the specific platform (e.g., avoiding buffer overflows, using memory-safe languages).
        *   **Code Reviews:** Thoroughly review the native code that interacts with platform channels, paying close attention to security vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Third-Party Package (Information Leakage/Code Execution)](./threats/insecure_third-party_package__information_leakagecode_execution_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a third-party Flutter/Dart package to gain access to sensitive information or execute arbitrary code.
    *   **How:** The attacker identifies a vulnerability in a package (e.g., a logging library that inadvertently exposes sensitive data, a networking library with a security flaw, or a package with a remote code execution vulnerability).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data leakage (e.g., user credentials, API keys, personal information).
    *   Remote code execution within the context of the Flutter application.
    *   Potential for further attacks based on the leaked information or compromised code.
*   **Affected Flutter Component:**
    *   The vulnerable third-party package.
    *   Any Flutter code that uses the package.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the vulnerability and its impact). Classifying as **Critical** due to the potential for code execution.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Package Vetting:** Carefully evaluate third-party packages before using them. Consider factors like popularity, maintenance activity, security history, and code quality.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency vulnerability scanners to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in packages.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep packages updated to the latest versions to patch security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Least Privilege:** If a package requires permissions, grant it only the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for the packages you use.

## Threat: [Improper Permission Handling Leading to Privilege Escalation via Platform Channels](./threats/improper_permission_handling_leading_to_privilege_escalation_via_platform_channels.md)

* **Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** The attacker crafts malicious input to a Flutter app's platform channel that interacts with native code responsible for handling permissions. This input exploits a vulnerability in the *native* code's permission handling logic, leading to the attacker gaining elevated privileges *through* the Flutter app.
    * **How:** The Flutter app requests a permission (perhaps legitimately), but the native code handling the response or subsequent actions related to that permission has a flaw. The attacker sends crafted data through the platform channel that triggers this flaw. This is distinct from simply requesting too many permissions; it's about exploiting a vulnerability *exposed* by the platform channel interaction.
* **Impact:**
    * Unauthorized access to sensitive data or system resources beyond what the Flutter app itself was granted.
    * Potential for the attacker to perform actions on the device with elevated privileges.
* **Affected Flutter Component:**
    * `MethodChannel`, `EventChannel`, `BasicMessageChannel` (Flutter platform channel APIs).
    * The *vulnerable* native code that implements the platform channel handlers and interacts with permission APIs.
* **Risk Severity:** High.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developer:**
        * **Secure Native Code:**  This is paramount. The native code handling permissions must be written with extreme care, following all security best practices for the target platform (Android, iOS, etc.). This includes robust input validation, secure coding techniques to prevent buffer overflows and other memory corruption issues, and adherence to the principle of least privilege.
        * **Input Sanitization:**  Even if the native code is believed to be secure, sanitize *all* data passed through the platform channel from the Dart side.  Don't trust the Dart code to provide safe input.
        * **Code Reviews:**  Thoroughly review the native code, specifically focusing on the permission handling logic and any interactions with platform APIs related to security.
        * **Minimize Platform Channel Surface:**  Reduce the complexity of platform channel interactions.  The less native code involved, the smaller the attack surface.
        * **Fuzz Testing:** Consider fuzz testing the native code that handles platform channel input, specifically targeting the permission-related functionality.
