# Attack Surface Analysis for flutter/flutter

## Attack Surface: [Dart VM Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dart_vm_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within the Dart Virtual Machine (VM) that executes Dart code.
*   **Flutter Contribution:** Flutter applications are built upon and directly execute within the Dart VM. Vulnerabilities in the VM directly compromise Flutter applications.
*   **Example:** A memory corruption bug in the Dart VM allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by crafting specific Dart code that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Keep Flutter SDK updated to the latest stable version. Flutter updates often include Dart VM security patches.
        *   Report any suspected Dart VM crashes or unusual behavior to the Flutter team.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Keep applications updated to the latest versions released by developers.

## Attack Surface: [Flutter Engine (C++) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/flutter_engine__c++__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within the Flutter Engine, the C++ core responsible for rendering, platform interactions, and core framework functionalities.
*   **Flutter Contribution:** The Flutter Engine is a fundamental component of the framework. Engine vulnerabilities directly and broadly affect all Flutter applications across platforms.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow in the Flutter Engine's rendering logic is exploited by providing specially crafted image data, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, application crashes, information disclosure, potential for complete application compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Keep Flutter SDK updated to the latest stable version. Flutter updates include Flutter Engine security patches.
        *   Report any suspected Flutter Engine crashes or rendering issues to the Flutter team.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Keep applications updated to the latest versions released by developers.

## Attack Surface: [Skia Graphics Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/skia_graphics_library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws in the Skia Graphics Library, used by the Flutter Engine for rendering UI elements.
*   **Flutter Contribution:** Flutter relies on Skia as its primary rendering engine. Skia vulnerabilities directly impact the security and stability of Flutter applications' UI rendering.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in Skia's image decoding process is exploited by displaying a malicious image, leading to a denial of service or potentially code execution during rendering.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, application crashes, UI rendering corruption, potentially code execution depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Keep Flutter SDK updated. Flutter updates will include updated Skia versions with security patches.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Keep applications updated to the latest versions released by developers.

## Attack Surface: [DOM XSS in Flutter Web](./attack_surfaces/dom_xss_in_flutter_web.md)

*   **Description:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Flutter web applications arising from unsafe Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation when Flutter compiles to JavaScript.
*   **Flutter Contribution:** Flutter web applications are compiled to JavaScript and interact with the browser's DOM.  If Flutter code improperly handles dynamic content or user input in web context, it can introduce DOM XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A Flutter web app dynamically generates HTML based on user input without proper sanitization. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through user input, which is then executed in other users' browsers when they view the page, due to Flutter's generated JavaScript interacting unsafely with the DOM.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information theft, full compromise of user session within the web application.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Sanitize all user input before displaying it in the DOM within Flutter web applications. Utilize appropriate sanitization libraries or Flutter widgets designed for safe HTML rendering in web contexts.
        *   Adhere to secure coding practices for web development, specifically concerning DOM manipulation and JavaScript interactions.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to significantly mitigate the potential impact of XSS vulnerabilities in Flutter web applications.
