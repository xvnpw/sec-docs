# Attack Surface Analysis for flutter/devtools

## Attack Surface: [Unintentional Production Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unintentional_production_exposure.md)

Description:  Accidental deployment of a production build with DevTools enabled, making internal application details and functionality accessible to end-users or attackers.
How DevTools Contributes: DevTools *is* the mechanism for introspection and manipulation; its presence in a production build is the vulnerability.
Example: An attacker discovers a publicly available app and finds they can connect to a DevTools instance, revealing API endpoints, internal data structures, and allowing them to modify the application's state.
Impact:
    Complete application compromise.
    Data exfiltration (user data, API keys, etc.).
    Application manipulation and defacement.
    Denial of Service.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    Conditional Compilation: Use preprocessor directives (`#if !kReleaseMode`) to *completely exclude* DevTools code from release builds. This is the most robust solution.
    Automated Build Checks: Implement CI/CD pipeline checks that fail the build if DevTools-related code or configurations are detected in release artifacts. This could involve analyzing the compiled code for specific symbols or patterns.
    Code Review Policies: Enforce strict code review policies that explicitly require verification of DevTools disabling for release builds.

## Attack Surface: [Network Exposure During Development](./attack_surfaces/network_exposure_during_development.md)

Description:  The DevTools service, even when used in development, is often exposed on the local network, potentially allowing access from other devices on the same network.
How DevTools Contributes: DevTools operates as a network service, creating a listening port that can be accessed remotely. This is inherent to its functionality.
Example: A developer working on a shared Wi-Fi network has their DevTools port scanned and accessed by another user on the network, who can then view application data and potentially interfere with the development process.
Impact:
    Leakage of pre-release features or sensitive development data.
    Interference with the development workflow.
    Potential (though less likely) compromise of the developer's machine through DevTools vulnerabilities.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Local Firewall: Configure the developer's machine's firewall to block incoming connections to the DevTools port from all sources except localhost (127.0.0.1).
    VPN Usage:  Always use a VPN when working on untrusted networks (e.g., public Wi-Fi, coffee shops).
    Network Segmentation:  If feasible, place development machines on a separate, isolated network segment with restricted access.
    VM/Containerization: Run the development environment and application within a virtual machine or container. This isolates the DevTools service from the host machine's network.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Service Extension Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/malicious_service_extension_exploitation.md)

Description:  Vulnerabilities in custom DevTools service extensions (accessed via `postEvent`) can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause other harmful effects.
How DevTools Contributes: DevTools provides the `postEvent` mechanism and service extension framework, which are *directly* used in this attack.
Example: An attacker sends a crafted `postEvent` message to a poorly-written service extension that uses `eval()` on the input, leading to arbitrary code execution within the application's context (via DevTools).
Impact:
    Arbitrary code execution.
    Data corruption or leakage.
    Denial of Service.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Secure Coding:  Adhere to secure coding practices when developing service extensions.  Avoid dangerous functions like `eval()`.
    Input Validation:  Thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* data received through `postEvent` before processing it.  Use a whitelist approach where possible.
    Code Reviews:  Conduct rigorous code reviews of service extension code, focusing on security aspects.
