## Attack Tree Path: [1. Abuse DevTools Features](./attack_tree_paths/1__abuse_devtools_features.md)

   *   **Goal:** Misuse legitimate DevTools features for malicious purposes. This leverages *intended* functionality in an *unintended* way.

   *   **Critical Node: Extract Sensitive Data**
      *   **Description:** Use built-in DevTools features to access information that should not be exposed.
      *   **High Likelihood/Impact Node: Memory View/Network**
          *   **Description:** Inspect the application's memory or network traffic to find sensitive data.
          *   **Attack Steps:**
              1.  Connect to the running Flutter application via DevTools.
              2.  Navigate to the Memory or Network inspector.
              3.  Browse memory regions or network requests/responses.
              4.  Identify and extract sensitive data, such as:
                  *   API keys
                  *   Authentication tokens
                  *   User credentials (usernames, passwords)
                  *   Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
                  *   Session identifiers
                  *   Internal application data (e.g., database connection strings)
          *   **Likelihood:** High. DevTools provides direct access to this information, and developers often work with sensitive data during debugging.
          *   **Impact:** High to Very High. The impact depends on the sensitivity of the data exposed.  Exposure of credentials or API keys can lead to complete system compromise.
          *   **Effort:** Very Low. DevTools features are readily available and easy to use.
          *   **Skill Level:** Novice. Requires basic understanding of DevTools and how to navigate its interface.
          *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Requires monitoring DevTools usage and looking for suspicious activity (e.g., accessing specific memory locations or unusual network requests).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Network Interception (MITM)](./attack_tree_paths/2__network_interception__mitm_.md)

   *   **Goal:** Intercept the communication between DevTools and the Flutter application. This is a classic Man-in-the-Middle attack.

   *   **Critical Node: No Auth on WS Connection**
      *   **Description:** The WebSocket connection between DevTools and the application lacks authentication. This is the *core vulnerability* enabling this attack path.
      *   **High Likelihood/Impact Node: Capture DevTools Traffic**
          *   **Description:** Monitor and record all communication between DevTools and the application.
          *   **Attack Steps:**
              1.  Gain access to the same network as the developer's machine and the device/emulator running the Flutter application.
              2.  Use a network sniffing tool (e.g., Wireshark, tcpdump) to capture network traffic.
              3.  Filter the traffic to isolate the WebSocket connection to the DevTools port (typically, a port in the range of 9100+).
              4.  Analyze the captured traffic to extract sensitive information, including:
                  *   All data displayed in DevTools (memory contents, network requests, logs, etc.)
                  *   Any data sent between the application and DevTools, even if not explicitly displayed.
          *   **Likelihood:** High. Many development environments lack network security, and sniffing unencrypted traffic is straightforward.
          *   **Impact:** High to Very High. The attacker gains access to *all* information exchanged between DevTools and the application, potentially including highly sensitive data.
          *   **Effort:** Low. Network sniffing tools are readily available and easy to use.
          *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate. Requires understanding of network protocols (specifically WebSockets) and traffic analysis tools.
          *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Requires monitoring network traffic and looking for unauthorized connections to the DevTools port.  Encrypted traffic (TLS/SSL) would make this much harder to detect.
