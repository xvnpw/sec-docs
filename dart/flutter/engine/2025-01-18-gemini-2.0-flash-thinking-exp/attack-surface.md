# Attack Surface Analysis for flutter/engine

## Attack Surface: [Platform Channel Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/platform_channel_data_injection.md)

**Description:** Malicious or unexpected data is injected through platform channels and processed insecurely on the native side.

**How Engine Contributes:** The engine *provides the platform channel mechanism* for communication between Dart and native code. The engine's design necessitates this bridge, and vulnerabilities arise when developers fail to secure the native side of this communication.

**Example:** A Flutter app sends a user-provided string through a platform channel to a native function that executes a shell command. If the native code doesn't sanitize the string, an attacker could inject shell commands.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, privilege escalation, data breaches on the native platform.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developer:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the native side for all data received through platform channels. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases. Avoid direct execution of shell commands with user-provided input. Employ the principle of least privilege for native code operations.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Corruption in Native Code](./attack_surfaces/memory_corruption_in_native_code.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, use-after-free, or double-free errors exist within the Flutter Engine's C++ codebase or its dependencies (like Skia).

**How Engine Contributes:** The engine's core rendering and platform interaction logic *is implemented in C++*. Memory management flaws within *the engine's own code* or its tightly coupled dependencies are direct vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A malformed image is processed by the Skia library (part of the Flutter Engine), leading to a buffer overflow that allows an attacker to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, arbitrary code execution on the device.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Engine Developers (Flutter Team):** Employ secure coding practices, perform thorough code reviews and static analysis, utilize memory safety tools during development, and promptly address reported security vulnerabilities.
* **Application Developers:** Stay updated with Flutter Engine releases and apply patches promptly. Report any suspected memory corruption issues to the Flutter team.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Native API Usage via Platform Channels](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_native_api_usage_via_platform_channels.md)

**Description:** The native code interacting with Flutter through platform channels uses native APIs in an insecure manner, exposing vulnerabilities.

**How Engine Contributes:** The engine *facilitates the invocation of native code* through platform channels. While the engine itself doesn't dictate *how* native APIs are used, it provides the pathway for this interaction, making it a relevant attack surface.

**Example:** A Flutter app uses a platform channel to access a native function that reads a file path provided by the Dart side. If the native code doesn't validate the file path, an attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the device.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, file system manipulation, privilege escalation depending on the API.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developer:**  Validate and sanitize all inputs received from Flutter before using them in native API calls. Implement proper access controls and permissions for native operations. Follow the principle of least privilege when accessing native resources.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the Skia Rendering Engine](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_skia_rendering_engine.md)

**Description:** Security flaws exist within the Skia graphics library, which is used by the Flutter Engine for rendering UI.

**How Engine Contributes:** The engine *directly integrates and relies on Skia* for all its rendering operations. Skia is a core component of the Flutter Engine's functionality.

**Example:** A specially crafted image displayed in a Flutter app exploits a vulnerability in Skia's image decoding logic, leading to a crash or potentially remote code execution.

**Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, potentially remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Engine Developers (Flutter Team & Skia Team):**  Maintain up-to-date versions of Skia, promptly address reported security vulnerabilities in Skia.
* **Application Developers:** Stay updated with Flutter Engine releases that include updated Skia versions.
