# Attack Tree Analysis for flutter/engine

Objective: Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulate application functionality, or cause denial of service by exploiting vulnerabilities within the Flutter Engine, potentially leading to data breaches, financial loss, or reputational damage for the application and its users.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rendering Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rendering_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Maliciously Crafted Content [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Deliver Malicious Image/Font:** An attacker delivers a specially crafted image or font file.
    * **Engine Fails to Sanitize/Process Securely:** The Flutter Engine's image or font decoding or rendering libraries contain vulnerabilities that are triggered by the malicious file, potentially leading to:
        * **Impact:** High (Code Execution, Denial of Service)
* **Integer Overflows/Buffer Overflows in Rendering [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Trigger Rendering of Specific Content:** An attacker triggers the rendering of specific content designed to exploit memory management flaws.
    * **Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability:** The Flutter Engine's rendering pipeline has low-level memory management issues (integer overflows or buffer overflows).
        * **Impact:** High (Code Execution, Denial of Service)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Input Injection via Platform Channels [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Send Malicious Data via Platform Channel:** An attacker sends malicious data through a Flutter Platform Channel.
    * **Engine Fails to Sanitize Input Before Native Call:** The Flutter Engine does not properly sanitize this input before passing it to native platform code.
        * **Impact:** High (Code Execution, Data Manipulation)

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Platform Communication](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_platform_communication.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Exploit Platform Channel Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Intercept/Manipulate Platform Channel Messages:** An attacker intercepts or manipulates messages being sent over a Flutter Platform Channel.
    * **Engine Lacks Secure Communication Protocol:** The Platform Channel communication lacks sufficient security measures (e.g., encryption, integrity checks).
        * **Impact:** High (Data Breach, Functionality Manipulation)
* **Manipulate Native Code Interactions [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Trigger Specific Engine Functionality:** An attacker triggers a specific function within the Flutter Engine.
    * **Engine Calls Vulnerable Native Code:** This function call leads to the execution of vulnerable native code (either within the engine itself or in a linked native library).
        * **Impact:** High (Code Execution, Privilege Escalation)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of the Engine](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_the_engine.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Identify Vulnerable Third-Party Library [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Engine Uses Vulnerable Dependency:** The Flutter Engine relies on a third-party library that has a known security vulnerability.
        * **Impact:** High (Varies depending on the vulnerability in the dependency)
