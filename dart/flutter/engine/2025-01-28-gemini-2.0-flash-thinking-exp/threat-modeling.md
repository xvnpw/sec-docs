# Threat Model Analysis for flutter/engine

## Threat: [Native Code Buffer Overflow](./threats/native_code_buffer_overflow.md)

Description: An attacker exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Flutter Engine's C++ code. By crafting malicious input that exceeds buffer boundaries, they can overwrite memory, potentially injecting and executing arbitrary code within the application process.
Impact: Arbitrary code execution, data breaches, complete application compromise, potential system-level compromise.
Affected Engine Component: Various C++ modules within the engine (e.g., Skia integration, platform channel handling, input processing).
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies: Regularly update to the latest Flutter version to benefit from engine vulnerability fixes. Implement rigorous code reviews and static analysis for custom engine builds to identify and eliminate buffer overflows. Adhere to memory safety best practices in native platform channel implementations (C/C++). Utilize operating system security features like ASLR and DEP to mitigate exploit success.

## Threat: [Dart VM Sandbox Escape](./threats/dart_vm_sandbox_escape.md)

Description: An attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability in the Dart VM's security sandbox. This allows them to bypass the intended isolation and execute code outside the Dart VM's restricted environment, potentially gaining access to system resources or executing arbitrary native code.
Impact: Arbitrary code execution, elevation of privilege, access to sensitive data beyond application scope, potential system-level compromise.
Affected Engine Component: Dart Virtual Machine (VM), specifically the sandbox implementation and security boundaries.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies: Keep Flutter Engine updated to receive Dart VM security patches. Apply the principle of least privilege to application design, limiting access to sensitive resources to minimize sandbox escape impact. Consider security audits of the Dart VM for highly sensitive applications (typically beyond the scope of most developers).

## Threat: [Vulnerable Third-Party Dependency (e.g., in Skia, ICU)](./threats/vulnerable_third-party_dependency__e_g___in_skia__icu_.md)

Description: The Flutter Engine relies on third-party libraries. A critical or high severity vulnerability in one of these dependencies (like Skia or ICU) is exploited through the Flutter Engine, affecting applications using the vulnerable engine version.
Impact:  Impact depends on the specific dependency vulnerability, potentially ranging from Denial of Service to Arbitrary Code Execution, Information Disclosure, or other severe consequences.
Affected Engine Component: The specific vulnerable third-party library integrated into the Flutter Engine (e.g., Skia, ICU, etc.).
Risk Severity: High to Critical (depending on the specific dependency and vulnerability)
Mitigation Strategies: Maintain up-to-date Flutter Engine versions, as updates include patched dependency versions. Implement dependency scanning for custom engine builds to proactively identify vulnerable libraries. Monitor security advisories related to Flutter Engine dependencies to stay informed about potential risks.

## Threat: [Compromised Flutter Engine Binaries (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/compromised_flutter_engine_binaries__supply_chain_attack_.md)

Description: An attacker compromises the Flutter Engine binaries during the build, distribution, or download process. This could involve injecting malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities directly into the engine. Developers unknowingly use this compromised engine, distributing the malicious engine within their applications to end-users.
Impact: Widespread malware distribution, backdoors in applications, complete compromise of applications using the compromised engine, severe reputational damage and loss of user trust.
Affected Engine Component: The entire Flutter Engine binary distribution.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies: Download Flutter SDK and Engine binaries exclusively from official and trusted sources (flutter.dev, official GitHub repositories). Verify download integrity using checksums if available. Secure the Flutter Engine build pipeline (for custom builds) against unauthorized access and tampering, following software supply chain security best practices. Implement code signing for Flutter Engine binaries (if distributing custom engines) and application binaries to ensure authenticity and enable verification.
