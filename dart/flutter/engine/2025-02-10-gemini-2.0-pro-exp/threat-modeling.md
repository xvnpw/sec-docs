# Threat Model Analysis for flutter/engine

## Threat: [Skia/Impeller Buffer Overflow](./threats/skiaimpeller_buffer_overflow.md)

*   **Threat:** Skia/Impeller Buffer Overflow

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input (image, font, animation) exploiting a buffer overflow in Skia or Impeller.  The overflow allows overwriting memory, leading to arbitrary code execution. The attacker delivers this data through various means (network, file, compromised plugin *if the engine doesn't properly validate the plugin's output*).
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Engine Component:** Skia graphics library (image decoding, font rendering, path rendering) or Impeller graphics library (various rendering stages).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Keep Flutter Engine/Skia/Impeller updated to the *latest* versions. Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for *all* data influencing rendering. Fuzz test the application's handling of image and font data.
        *   **User:** Keep the application updated. Avoid untrusted content.

## Threat: [`dart:ffi` Memory Corruption (Engine's Handling)](./threats/_dartffi__memory_corruption__engine's_handling_.md)

*   **Threat:** `dart:ffi` Memory Corruption (Engine's Handling)

    *   **Description:** While the vulnerability originates in native code, the *engine's* `dart:ffi` interface is the attack vector. If the engine doesn't provide sufficient safeguards or sandboxing, a vulnerability in native code accessed via `dart:ffi` can lead to RCE. The attacker provides malicious input to the native code through the FFI interface, triggering a memory corruption vulnerability. *This entry focuses on the engine's role in facilitating the attack, not the native code itself.*
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), system compromise.
    *   **Affected Engine Component:** `dart:ffi` interface (the bridge between Dart and native code). The engine's lack of robust isolation or validation mechanisms is the key issue.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**  Treat `dart:ffi` as a *high-risk* area.  Assume *all* native code is potentially vulnerable. Implement robust input validation and sanitization *on the Dart side* before passing data to native code. Explore sandboxing techniques to isolate native code execution. Advocate for engine-level improvements to `dart:ffi` security. Prefer platform channels where possible, and ensure those channels are secure.
        *   **User:** No direct mitigation, relies on developer best practices.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin RCE (Engine's Role in Validation)](./threats/malicious_plugin_rce__engine's_role_in_validation_.md)

* **Threat:** Malicious Plugin RCE (Engine's Role in Validation)
  * **Description:** A malicious plugin contains native code with a vulnerability. While the vulnerability is in the *plugin's* code, the *engine's* responsibility is to validate and potentially sandbox plugins. If the engine doesn't adequately validate the plugin's output or isolate its execution, the plugin's vulnerability can lead to RCE. *This entry focuses on the engine's role in plugin security, not the plugin itself.*
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the application, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Engine Component:** Plugin management system within the engine (how plugins are loaded, validated, and their communication with the engine is handled). Platform channel implementation (if the engine doesn't enforce secure communication).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Advocate for and utilize any engine-level plugin security features (sandboxing, validation, permission systems). Implement robust input validation and sanitization for *all* data received from plugins via platform channels or `dart:ffi`. Treat all plugin interactions as potentially untrusted.
        *   **User:** No direct mitigation, relies on developer and engine best practices.

## Threat: [Platform Channel Message Spoofing (Engine's Enforcement)](./threats/platform_channel_message_spoofing__engine's_enforcement_.md)

*   **Threat:** Platform Channel Message Spoofing (Engine's Enforcement)

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts/modifies messages between Flutter (Dart) and native code via platform channels.  The *engine's* responsibility is to ensure secure communication. If the engine doesn't enforce message integrity and authenticity, the attacker can trigger vulnerabilities in native code or cause unexpected behavior. *This focuses on the engine's role in securing the channel, not the native code itself.*
    *   **Impact:** Varies (DoS, Information Disclosure, Privilege Escalation, RCE) depending on the native code.
    *   **Affected Engine Component:** Platform channel implementation (the engine's mechanism for inter-process communication).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical depending on the native code)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Advocate for engine-level security features for platform channels (e.g., built-in message authentication). Implement robust input validation and sanitization on *both* sides. Use secure data formats. Consider cryptographic techniques for message integrity if the engine doesn't provide them.
        *   **User:** No direct mitigation, relies on developer and engine best practices.

## Threat: [WebAssembly (Wasm) Escape (Flutter Web - Engine Compiler)](./threats/webassembly__wasm__escape__flutter_web_-_engine_compiler_.md)

*   **Threat:** WebAssembly (Wasm) Escape (Flutter Web - Engine Compiler)

    *   **Description:**  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the *Dart-to-Wasm compilation process* (part of the Flutter Engine) or a bug in the browser's Wasm runtime to escape the Wasm sandbox.  This allows access to the browser's JavaScript environment and potentially the OS. *This entry focuses on the engine's compiler as a potential source of the vulnerability.*
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially RCE in the browser, access to browser data, potential system compromise.
    *   **Affected Engine Component:**  Dart-to-WebAssembly compiler (within the Flutter Engine's web build process).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical depending on browser vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Keep the Flutter Engine and Dart SDK updated. Monitor for security advisories related to WebAssembly and the Dart-to-Wasm compiler. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP).
        *   **User:** Keep the web browser updated.
