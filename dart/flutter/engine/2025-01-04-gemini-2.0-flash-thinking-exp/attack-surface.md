# Attack Surface Analysis for flutter/engine

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Platform Channel Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_platform_channel_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the exchange of data between Dart code and native platform code via platform channels.
    *   **How Engine Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The engine provides the mechanism for platform channel communication, but it doesn't inherently enforce strict validation or sandboxing of data passed across this boundary.
    *   **Example:** A malicious native plugin receives user input from Dart through a platform channel and executes it as a shell command without proper sanitization, leading to arbitrary code execution on the device.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data breaches, privilege escalation on the user's device.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on both the Dart and native sides of the platform channel.
            *   Minimize the amount of data and functionality exposed through platform channels.
            *   Avoid passing sensitive data directly through platform channels without encryption or other security measures.
            *   Use well-defined data structures and protocols for communication to reduce ambiguity and potential for misinterpretation.
            *   Regularly audit and review native code interacting with platform channels for security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Rendering Engine Vulnerabilities (Skia)](./attack_surfaces/rendering_engine_vulnerabilities__skia_.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or security flaws within the Skia graphics library, which is used by the Flutter Engine for rendering UI elements.
    *   **How Engine Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The engine directly integrates and relies on Skia for all rendering operations. Vulnerabilities in Skia become vulnerabilities in Flutter applications.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted image or font is loaded by the Flutter application, exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability in Skia's image decoding or font rendering logic, leading to a crash or potentially remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), potential remote code execution, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Stay updated with the latest stable version of the Flutter SDK, which includes updated versions of Skia with security patches.
            *   Be mindful of loading assets from untrusted sources and implement checks if necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Handling of Untrusted Assets](./attack_surfaces/improper_handling_of_untrusted_assets.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the engine's handling of external resources like images, fonts, or other data files loaded by the application.
    *   **How Engine Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The engine provides mechanisms for loading and processing these assets. If the engine's decoding or processing logic has vulnerabilities, malicious assets can exploit them.
    *   **Example:** A Flutter application loads a specially crafted SVG image from an untrusted website. A vulnerability in the engine's SVG parsing library allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Avoid loading assets from untrusted or unverified sources.
            *   Implement robust validation and sanitization of all external assets before processing them.

## Attack Surface: [Dart VM Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dart_vm_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within the Dart Virtual Machine (VM) itself, which executes the Dart code in Flutter applications.
    *   **How Engine Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The Flutter Engine embeds and relies on the Dart VM for executing the application's logic. Vulnerabilities in the VM directly affect the security of Flutter applications.
    *   **Example:** A carefully crafted sequence of Dart code triggers a bug in the Dart VM's garbage collector, leading to memory corruption and potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the application's execution flow.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application's process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Stay updated with the latest stable version of the Flutter SDK, which includes updated and patched versions of the Dart VM.
            *   Adhere to secure coding practices in Dart to minimize the likelihood of triggering VM vulnerabilities.
