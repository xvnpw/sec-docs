# Threat Model Analysis for flutter/engine

## Threat: [Malicious Native Code Execution via Platform Channels](./threats/malicious_native_code_execution_via_platform_channels.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious data or exploit vulnerabilities in the application's Dart code to send crafted messages through platform channels. This could trick the native side into executing arbitrary code provided by the attacker, potentially bypassing security restrictions of the Flutter environment.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the device, including data exfiltration, installation of malware, and remote control.
    *   **Affected Component:** Platform Channel Interface, Native Code Interop
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data received from Dart code on the native side before processing or using it in system calls.
        *   Implement robust authorization and authentication mechanisms on the native side to restrict access to sensitive functionalities.
        *   Minimize the amount of native code exposed through platform channels.
        *   Use secure coding practices in native code to prevent buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and other common exploits.
        *   Regularly audit and review the native code interacting with platform channels.

## Threat: [Skia Rendering Engine Vulnerabilities Leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/skia_rendering_engine_vulnerabilities_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could provide specially crafted image data or rendering instructions that exploit vulnerabilities within the Skia graphics library (used by the Flutter Engine for rendering). This could lead to memory corruption and potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's process.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution within the application's context, potentially leading to data breaches or further system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Skia Rendering Pipeline
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the Flutter SDK and Engine are updated to the latest stable version, which includes the latest security patches for Skia.
        *   Avoid processing untrusted image sources directly. Sanitize or validate image data before rendering.
        *   Consider using image loading libraries that perform security checks and protect against known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dart VM Vulnerabilities Enabling Code Injection](./threats/dart_vm_vulnerabilities_enabling_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities within the Dart Virtual Machine (VM) itself to inject and execute arbitrary Dart code within the application's isolate. This could bypass application logic and security measures implemented in Dart.
    *   **Impact:**  Ability to manipulate application data, bypass security checks, potentially escalate privileges within the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dart VM Interpreter, Dart Runtime
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Flutter SDK updated to benefit from security patches in the Dart VM.
        *   Adhere to secure coding practices in Dart to minimize potential attack vectors.
        *   Be aware of known vulnerabilities in the Dart language and runtime environment.
