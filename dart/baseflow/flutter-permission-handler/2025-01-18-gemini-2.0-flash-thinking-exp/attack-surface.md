# Attack Surface Analysis for baseflow/flutter-permission-handler

## Attack Surface: [Platform Channel Data Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/platform_channel_data_injectionmanipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could potentially intercept or manipulate data being sent between the Flutter application and the native platform code via platform channels used by `flutter-permission-handler`.

**How flutter-permission-handler Contributes:** The package *directly* relies on platform channels to communicate permission requests and status updates with the underlying Android and iOS systems. This communication pathway, facilitated by the package, is a potential point of interception or manipulation.

**Example:** A malicious application running on the same device intercepts the platform channel communication initiated by `flutter-permission-handler` and modifies a response to indicate a permission is granted when it was actually denied by the user.

**Impact:** Bypassing permission checks, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive resources or functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Ensure data serialization and deserialization on platform channels used by `flutter-permission-handler` are robust and resistant to manipulation.
    * Implement additional checks on the Flutter side to verify the integrity of permission status received from the native side via the package's methods.

## Attack Surface: [Native Code Vulnerabilities in Permission Handling](./attack_surfaces/native_code_vulnerabilities_in_permission_handling.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities might exist in the underlying native Android or iOS code responsible for handling permission requests, which `flutter-permission-handler` interacts with.

**How flutter-permission-handler Contributes:** The package acts as a *direct interface* to this native code. Exploiting vulnerabilities in the native permission handling could be triggered through the package's functionalities and the specific native calls it makes.

**Example:** A bug in the Android permission system allows an application to bypass the user consent dialog under specific circumstances. `flutter-permission-handler` might inadvertently trigger this bug through its permission request flow by using a vulnerable native API call.

**Impact:**  Granting of permissions without user consent, potential privilege escalation, or unexpected application behavior.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Stay updated with the latest security advisories for the target platforms (Android and iOS) to understand potential vulnerabilities in the native APIs used by `flutter-permission-handler`.
    * Test the application on various platform versions to identify potential inconsistencies or vulnerabilities in permission handling that might be exposed through the package's usage.
