## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Manipulate User Permission Granting](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_manipulate_user_permission_granting.md)

This node represents the attacker's goal of influencing the user's decision to grant permissions. Success here is crucial for subsequent attacks that rely on having those permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Overlay Attacks on Permission Dialogs (Platform Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_overlay_attacks_on_permission_dialogs__platform_specific_.md)

**Critical Node: Display Fake Permission Dialogs:**
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious application, possibly disguised as a legitimate one or running in the background, draws an overlay on top of the legitimate application's permission dialog. This fake dialog mimics the appearance of the real one but grants permissions to the malicious application instead.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (More prevalent on Android due to less restrictive overlay permissions).
*   **Impact:** High (User unknowingly grants sensitive permissions to a malicious application).
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding overlay techniques and potentially bypassing OS restrictions).
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by OS or security apps that monitor for overlay activity).

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Display Fake Permission Dialogs](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_display_fake_permission_dialogs.md)

This fake dialog mimics the appearance of the real one but grants permissions to the malicious application instead.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** **CRITICAL NODE: Social Engineering Targeting Permission Rationale**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_critical_node_social_engineering_targeting_permission_rationale.md)

**Critical Node: Social Engineering Targeting Permission Rationale:**
*   **Attack Vector:** The application presents misleading or deceptive reasons for requesting permissions. This could involve exaggerating the necessity of the permission for basic functionality or falsely claiming it's required for a specific feature the user wants to access.
    *   **Mislead User about the Necessity of Permissions:**
        *   **Likelihood:** High (Relies on exploiting user trust and lack of technical understanding).
        *   **Impact:** Medium (User grants unnecessary permissions, potentially increasing the attack surface).
        *   **Effort:** Low (Requires crafting persuasive messaging).
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Difficult to detect programmatically as it relies on user interpretation).

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** **CRITICAL NODE: Leverage Granted Permissions for Malicious Actions**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_critical_node_leverage_granted_permissions_for_malicious_actions.md)

This node represents the point where the attacker, having successfully obtained permissions, uses them to achieve their malicious goals.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Leverage Granted Permissions for Malicious Actions](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_leverage_granted_permissions_for_malicious_actions.md)

This node represents the point where the attacker, having successfully obtained permissions, uses them to achieve their malicious goals.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Gain Unauthorized Access to Protected Resources](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_gain_unauthorized_access_to_protected_resources.md)

This path focuses on using granted permissions to access data or device features that should be protected.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Access Sensitive Data (Contacts, Location, Storage)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_access_sensitive_data__contacts__location__storage_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Once permissions for contacts, location, or storage are granted, the application can access and potentially exfiltrate this sensitive user data.
        *   **Exfiltrate Data from the Device:**
            *   **Likelihood:** High (If the relevant permissions are granted).
            *   **Impact:** High (Data breach, privacy violation).
            *   **Effort:** Low (Once permission is granted, data access and exfiltration are relatively straightforward).
            *   **Skill Level:** Beginner.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Depends on monitoring data access patterns and network traffic).

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Control Device Features (Camera, Microphone)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_control_device_features__camera__microphone_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** With camera and microphone permissions, the application can activate these sensors without the user's explicit knowledge or consent, enabling spying or recording.
        *   **Spy on User or Perform Unauthorized Actions:**
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If the relevant permissions are granted and the app is malicious).
            *   **Impact:** High (Severe privacy violation, potential for blackmail or other harm).
            *   **Effort:** Low (Once permission is granted, accessing and using the camera/microphone is simple).
            *   **Skill Level:** Beginner.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** High (Difficult to detect without specific monitoring of sensor usage).

## Attack Tree Path: [Spy on User or Perform Unauthorized Actions](./attack_tree_paths/spy_on_user_or_perform_unauthorized_actions.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If the relevant permissions are granted and the app is malicious).
