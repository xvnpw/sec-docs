# Attack Tree Analysis for baseflow/flutter-permission-handler

Objective: To gain unauthorized access to sensitive user data or device capabilities by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the `flutter-permission-handler` plugin or its implementation within a Flutter application.

```

## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Goal 1: Bypass Permission Checks](./attack_tree_paths/sub-goal_1_bypass_permission_checks.md)

The attacker aims to circumvent the permission checks, gaining access to resources without proper authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Incorrect Status Handling](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_incorrect_status_handling.md)

The application incorrectly interprets or handles the permission status returned by the `flutter-permission-handler` plugin.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Misconfigured `openAppSettings()`](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_misconfigured__openappsettings___.md)

**Description:** The application misuses the `openAppSettings()` function. This could involve not checking the permission status *after* the user returns from the app settings, leading to an incorrect assumption about the permission state.  The app might also direct the user to the wrong settings screen.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Medium (user confusion, potential data leakage if the app proceeds without the permission)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (detectable through user testing and code review)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Developer Error in Status Logic](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_developer_error_in_status_logic.md)

**Description:** The developer introduces a logical error in the code that checks the permission status.  This could be a simple mistake like inverting a boolean condition or using the wrong comparison operator, causing the app to proceed as if a permission is granted when it's actually denied or permanently denied.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (depending on the specific permission and the nature of the error; could lead to unauthorized data access)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires code review or dynamic analysis to identify the logical flaw)

## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Goal 2: Escalate Granted Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/sub-goal_2_escalate_granted_permissions.md)

The attacker leverages legitimately granted permissions but uses them in a way that exceeds the intended scope or accesses unintended resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Misuse of Permission Handler APIs](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_misuse_of_permission_handler_apis.md)

The application incorrectly utilizes the plugin's API, leading to unintended consequences related to permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Requesting Excessive Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_requesting_excessive_permissions.md)

**Description:** The application requests more permissions than it strictly needs for its functionality. This increases the attack surface; if the application is compromised in some other way, the attacker gains access to more data or device capabilities than they would have if only necessary permissions were requested.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (increases the potential damage from a successful compromise)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (detectable through code review and by examining the app's permission requests)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2 Ignoring `isLimited` Status (iOS)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_ignoring__islimited__status__ios_.md)

**Description:**  Specifically on iOS, when requesting photo library access, the user can grant "limited" access, allowing the app to access only selected photos. If the application ignores the `isLimited` status and treats it as `isGranted`, it might attempt to access the entire photo library.  This could lead to a crash or, if a further vulnerability exists, unauthorized access to all photos.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (potential for unauthorized access to a user's entire photo library)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires code review and testing on iOS devices)
