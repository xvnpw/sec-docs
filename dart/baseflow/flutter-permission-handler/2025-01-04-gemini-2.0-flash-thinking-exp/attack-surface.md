# Attack Surface Analysis for baseflow/flutter-permission-handler

## Attack Surface: [Platform Channel Communication Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/platform_channel_communication_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:**  The `flutter-permission-handler` relies on Flutter's platform channels to communicate with native Android and iOS code for requesting and checking permissions. Vulnerabilities can arise from insecure serialization/deserialization or lack of integrity checks on messages exchanged.
    * **How `flutter-permission-handler` Contributes:** The package initiates and processes these platform channel messages. If the package or the underlying Flutter framework has vulnerabilities in how these messages are handled, it creates an attack vector.
    * **Example:** A malicious app or a compromised component on the device could potentially intercept or forge platform channel messages related to permission requests. For instance, it might send a fake "permission granted" response even if the user denied it.
    * **Impact:**  Bypassing permission checks, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive resources (camera, location, contacts, etc.) or triggering unintended application behavior based on false permission status.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Keep the `flutter-permission-handler` package and Flutter framework updated to benefit from security patches. Thoroughly test the application's behavior based on different permission states. Consider implementing additional integrity checks on data received via platform channels, although this might be complex.
        * **Users:** Keep their device operating system updated to ensure the underlying platform channel implementation is secure. Be cautious about installing apps from untrusted sources.
