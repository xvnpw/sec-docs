# Threat Model Analysis for baseflow/flutter-permission-handler

## Threat: [Incorrect Permission Status Reporting](./threats/incorrect_permission_status_reporting.md)

**Description:** A flaw in the `flutter-permission-handler` package's logic causes it to report an incorrect permission status (e.g., reporting "granted" when the permission is actually "denied," or vice-versa). This could stem from bugs in the platform-specific implementations within the package or in its cross-platform abstraction logic.

**Impact:** The application might perform actions that require a permission that is not actually granted, leading to unexpected errors, crashes, or security vulnerabilities (e.g., trying to access location data when the location permission is denied, but the app thinks it's granted).

**Affected Component:**  `PermissionStatus` enumeration within the package, platform-specific permission checking implementations within the package (e.g., Android's `checkSelfPermission` wrapper, iOS's `authorizationStatus` wrapper).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly test permission-dependent features on different platforms and OS versions.
*   Monitor the `flutter-permission-handler` repository for reported issues related to status reporting and update the package promptly.
*   Consider implementing platform-specific checks using native APIs as a fallback for critical functionalities if inconsistencies are suspected.

## Threat: [Bypassing System Permission Dialogs (Theoretical)](./threats/bypassing_system_permission_dialogs__theoretical_.md)

**Description:** A severe vulnerability within the `flutter-permission-handler` package could theoretically allow an attacker to craft a request that bypasses the standard operating system permission dialogs. This would allow the application to gain permissions without explicit user consent due to a flaw in how the package interacts with the OS permission system.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of user privacy and security. The application could access sensitive data, device features, and perform actions without the user's knowledge or consent.

**Affected Component:**  Permission request functions (`request()`) within the package, the package's internal communication with platform-specific permission granting mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only use well-vetted and actively maintained packages like `flutter-permission-handler`.
*   Regularly review the package's source code for any suspicious or potentially malicious behavior (though this is often impractical for most developers).
*   Rely on the operating system's security mechanisms and trust the integrity of the Flutter framework and its ecosystem.
*   Keep the operating system and Flutter framework updated to benefit from security patches that might address underlying vulnerabilities that could be exploited by such a package flaw.

## Threat: [Platform-Specific Permission Bypass in the Package](./threats/platform-specific_permission_bypass_in_the_package.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability might exist in the platform-specific implementation (Android or iOS) *within* the `flutter-permission-handler` package. This flaw could allow attackers to bypass permission checks or gain unauthorized access to resources specifically on that platform due to an error in the package's native code or its interaction with the OS.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to platform-specific resources and functionalities, potentially leading to data breaches or other security compromises on the affected platform.

**Affected Component:** Platform-specific implementations within the package (e.g., Android implementation using Java/Kotlin, iOS implementation using Swift/Objective-C).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stay updated with the latest versions of the package, as maintainers often address platform-specific vulnerabilities.
*   If critical security concerns arise, consider implementing platform-specific checks using native APIs as a temporary workaround while waiting for a package update.
*   Report any suspected platform-specific vulnerabilities to the package maintainers.
