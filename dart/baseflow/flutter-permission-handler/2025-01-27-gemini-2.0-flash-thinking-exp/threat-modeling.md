# Threat Model Analysis for baseflow/flutter-permission-handler

## Threat: [Bypassing Permission Checks](./threats/bypassing_permission_checks.md)

Description: An attacker exploits a vulnerability within the `flutter_permission_handler` package itself. This could involve crafting specific inputs or exploiting code flaws to circumvent the package's permission status checks. An attacker might gain unauthorized access to protected device resources (camera, location, storage, etc.) without the user's consent, even if the application *believes* permissions are not granted.
Impact: Critical. Complete compromise of user privacy and security. Unauthorized access to sensitive data and device functionalities. Potential data theft, malware installation, or device manipulation. Application reputation damage.
Affected Component: `flutter_permission_handler` package core logic (potentially across all modules, depending on the vulnerability). Specifically, functions responsible for checking permission status (e.g., `checkPermission`, `requestPermissions`).
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Developers:
    *   Regularly update `flutter_permission_handler`:
    *   Implement server-side validation:
    *   Conduct security audits:
*   Users:
    *   Keep applications updated:
    *   Monitor application permissions:

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in `flutter_permission_handler` or its Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in__flutter_permission_handler__or_its_dependencies.md)

Description: `flutter_permission_handler` or its underlying dependencies (platform-specific libraries, Flutter framework itself) might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application or the user's device. This is a general software supply chain risk.
Impact: Critical to High. Depending on the vulnerability, impacts could range from application crashes and data breaches to remote code execution and complete device compromise.
Affected Component: `flutter_permission_handler` package itself and its transitive dependencies (both Dart and native platform dependencies).
Risk Severity: Critical to High (depending on the nature and severity of the vulnerability).
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Developers:
    *   Regular Dependency Updates:
    *   Dependency Scanning:
    *   Security Monitoring:
    *   Vulnerability Management Process:
*   Users:
    *   Keep applications updated:
    *   Trust reputable developers:
