*   **Uncontrolled Emission in Subjects**
    *   **Description:**  A `Subject` (like `PublishSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`) allows external code to directly inject data into a stream. If access to the `add()` method of a Subject is not properly controlled, malicious or unintended data can be introduced.
    *   **How RxDart Contributes:** RxDart provides the `Subject` classes as a way to imperatively push data into streams, making this direct injection possible.
    *   **Example:** A publicly accessible API endpoint allows sending data that is directly piped into a `PublishSubject` without validation. An attacker sends malicious data that triggers a vulnerability downstream.
    *   **Impact:**  Application state corruption, unexpected behavior, triggering of vulnerabilities in downstream components, potential denial of service if the injected data causes resource exhaustion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to the `add()` method of Subjects. Encapsulate Subjects and provide controlled methods for adding data.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization before data is added to a Subject.
        *   Consider using immutable data patterns to minimize the impact of potentially malicious data.
        *   Use operators like `map` or `filter` immediately after the Subject to sanitize or validate incoming data.

*   **Resource Exhaustion through Unbounded Streams**
    *   **Description:** RxDart allows creating streams that can emit an unlimited number of events. If these streams are not properly managed, an attacker might be able to trigger a large number of emissions, leading to memory exhaustion or CPU overload.
    *   **How RxDart Contributes:** RxDart's core concept of streams and operators allows for the creation of complex data flows, and without careful management, these flows can become unbounded.
    *   **Example:** A stream connected to a real-time data source is not properly terminated or buffered. An attacker floods the data source, causing the application to consume excessive resources trying to process the events.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, application crashes, performance degradation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use operators like `take`, `takeUntil`, `timeout`, or `buffer` to limit the number of events processed or the duration of the stream.
        *   Implement backpressure mechanisms if dealing with high-volume data sources.
        *   Monitor resource usage and implement safeguards to prevent excessive consumption.
