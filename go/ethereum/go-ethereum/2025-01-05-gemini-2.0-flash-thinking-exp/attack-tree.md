## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Go-Ethereum](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_go-ethereum.md)

**Critical Node:**
* This represents the ultimate success of the attacker.
* It signifies a complete breach where the attacker has achieved their objective of gaining unauthorized control over the application or its data by exploiting Go-Ethereum.

## Attack Tree Path: [Crash the Process](./attack_tree_paths/crash_the_process.md)

**Critical Node:**
* Successful exploitation leads to the Go-Ethereum process crashing.
* This results in application downtime, loss of service, and potential data inconsistencies.
* It disrupts the application's core functionality and can be easily noticeable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Go-Ethereum API Vulnerabilities (RPC/IPC)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_go-ethereum_api_vulnerabilities__rpcipc_.md)

**Critical Node:**
* The API is the primary interface for external interaction with Go-Ethereum.
* Compromising the API allows attackers to bypass intended security measures and directly interact with the Go-Ethereum node.
* This can lead to a wide range of attacks, including unauthorized actions, data manipulation, and information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Go-Ethereum Key Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_go-ethereum_key_management_vulnerabilities.md)

**Critical Node:**
* Private keys are essential for controlling Ethereum accounts and signing transactions.
* Compromising key management allows attackers to gain complete control over the application's associated Ethereum accounts.
* This can result in significant financial loss, unauthorized transactions, and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send crafted data via RPC/IPC](./attack_tree_paths/send_crafted_data_via_rpcipc.md)

**High-Risk Path:**
* Likelihood: Low
* Impact: Significant (Process crash, potential code execution)
* Effort: Medium
* Skill Level: Advanced
* Detection Difficulty: Medium
* This path involves exploiting potential memory corruption vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted data through the Go-Ethereum API. While Go is memory-safe, vulnerabilities can exist in native code integrations or complex logic. The potential for significant impact makes this a high-risk path despite the lower likelihood.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal private keys during key exchange (if vulnerable)](./attack_tree_paths/steal_private_keys_during_key_exchange__if_vulnerable_.md)

**High-Risk Path:**
* Likelihood: Very Low
* Impact: Critical (Complete account compromise)
* Effort: Medium to High
* Skill Level: Advanced
* Detection Difficulty: Hard
* This path involves a Man-in-the-Middle attack to intercept and steal private keys during the key exchange process. While the likelihood is very low if secure protocols are used, the impact of private key theft is critical, making this a high-risk path requiring strong preventative measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_bypass.md)

**High-Risk Path:**
* Likelihood: Low to Medium (Exploit weaknesses), Medium (Leverage default/weak configurations)
* Impact: Significant (Unauthorized access to API)
* Effort: Low to Medium (Exploit weaknesses), Minimal (Leverage default/weak configurations)
* Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate (Exploit weaknesses), Novice (Leverage default/weak configurations)
* Detection Difficulty: Medium (Exploit weaknesses), Easy (Leverage default/weak configurations)
* This path allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the Go-Ethereum API. Exploiting weaknesses in authentication mechanisms requires some skill, but leveraging default or weak configurations is a common and easily exploitable vulnerability, making this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage default or weak configurations](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_default_or_weak_configurations.md)

**High-Risk Path:**
* This is a sub-path of Authentication Bypass.
* It has a medium likelihood due to the tendency for default configurations to be insecure.
* The impact is significant as it grants unauthorized API access.
* The effort required is minimal, and even novice attackers can exploit this.
* Detection is easy if proper security checks are in place, but often overlooked.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Parameter Handling](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_parameter_handling.md)

**High-Risk Path:**
* Likelihood: Low
* Impact: Critical (Remote code execution)
* Effort: Medium
* Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
* Detection Difficulty: Medium
* This path involves injecting malicious code or commands through API parameters due to insufficient input validation. While the likelihood of achieving remote code execution might be lower if proper security measures are in place, the critical impact makes this a high-risk path that needs careful attention.

## Attack Tree Path: [Key Extraction](./attack_tree_paths/key_extraction.md)

**High-Risk Path:**
* Likelihood: Very Low (Exploit keystore), Medium (Access insecure locations)
* Impact: Critical (Complete account compromise)
* Effort: High (Exploit keystore), Low to Medium (Access insecure locations)
* Skill Level: Advanced (Exploit keystore), Beginner to Intermediate (Access insecure locations)
* Detection Difficulty: Very Hard (Exploit keystore), Easy to Hard (Access insecure locations)
* This path focuses on obtaining private keys. Directly exploiting vulnerabilities in Go-Ethereum's keystore is less likely. However, accessing keys stored in insecure locations due to developer errors or misconfigurations is a more probable scenario with critical impact, making this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access keys stored in insecure locations](./attack_tree_paths/access_keys_stored_in_insecure_locations.md)

**High-Risk Path:**
* This is a sub-path of Key Extraction.
* It has a medium likelihood due to potential developer oversights in key storage.
* The impact is critical as it leads to complete account compromise.
* The effort can range from low (if keys are in plain text) to medium (if they are somewhat obfuscated but not properly encrypted).
* The skill level required is relatively low, making it accessible to a wider range of attackers. Detection can vary from easy to hard depending on how well the keys are hidden.
