# Threat Model Analysis for ethereum/go-ethereum

## Threat: [Private Key Exposure through Insecure Storage](./threats/private_key_exposure_through_insecure_storage.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the storage where `go-ethereum`'s keystore files are located (if used). This could be due to weak file permissions or lack of encryption on the storage medium. The attacker can then copy the encrypted key files and attempt to brute-force the password offline.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the associated Ethereum address(es) if the attacker cracks the keystore password. The attacker can steal funds and execute arbitrary transactions.

**Affected `go-ethereum` Component:** `accounts` module, specifically the keystore functionality.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize `go-ethereum`'s built-in keystore functionality with **strong, unique passwords**.
* Implement robust file system permissions to restrict access to the keystore directory and files.
* Encrypt the storage medium where the keystore is located using full-disk encryption or similar technologies.
* Consider using hardware wallets or secure enclaves for managing highly sensitive keys, bypassing the need to store them directly with `go-ethereum`.

## Threat: [Private Key Leakage via Memory Dumps or Logs (Related to `go-ethereum`'s Internal Operations)](./threats/private_key_leakage_via_memory_dumps_or_logs__related_to__go-ethereum_'s_internal_operations_.md)

**Description:** While less common in application code, if the application interacts with `go-ethereum` in a way that causes the library itself to temporarily hold decrypted private keys in memory or log them (e.g., during signing operations with verbose logging enabled), an attacker gaining access to memory dumps or logs could potentially extract these keys. This is more likely a concern if custom key management or signing mechanisms are implemented that deviate from standard `go-ethereum` practices.

**Impact:** Compromise of associated Ethereum addresses, leading to potential fund theft and unauthorized actions.

**Affected `go-ethereum` Component:** Potentially the `accounts` module's signing functions or internal logging mechanisms if excessively verbose.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid implementing custom key management or signing logic unless absolutely necessary. Rely on `go-ethereum`'s secure key management features.
* Ensure logging levels are appropriately configured in production environments to avoid excessive logging of sensitive data.
* Implement secure memory management practices if directly interacting with key material in memory (though this should generally be avoided when using `go-ethereum`'s standard features).
* Secure access to server memory dumps and logs.

## Threat: [Reliance on Untrusted or Malicious Ethereum Nodes](./threats/reliance_on_untrusted_or_malicious_ethereum_nodes.md)

**Description:** The application uses `go-ethereum`'s `ethclient` to connect to an Ethereum node controlled by an attacker or a compromised node. This malicious node can provide false or manipulated blockchain data to the application through the `go-ethereum` client.

**Impact:** The application might make decisions based on incorrect information retrieved via `go-ethereum`, leading to flawed logic, incorrect displays, or even financial loss if transactions are based on this false data.

**Affected `go-ethereum` Component:** `ethclient` (for connecting to nodes), `rpc` (for communication with the node through `ethclient`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure `go-ethereum`'s `ethclient` to connect only to trusted and reputable Ethereum nodes (e.g., Infura, Alchemy, self-hosted and verified nodes).
* Implement mechanisms within the application to verify the integrity of critical data received from the node, potentially by cross-referencing with data from other trusted sources or using block explorers.
* Consider using light clients or state proofs for data verification if full node reliance is a significant concern, although this adds complexity.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration of RPC Endpoints](./threats/insecure_configuration_of_rpc_endpoints.md)

**Description:** If the `go-ethereum` node running the RPC server (if the application embeds a node or connects to a locally running one) has its RPC endpoints exposed without proper authentication and authorization, attackers could potentially interact with the node directly through `go-ethereum`'s RPC interface, bypassing the application's intended access controls.

**Impact:** Attackers could send arbitrary transactions using the node's configured accounts, retrieve sensitive blockchain data managed by the node, or even disrupt the node's operation.

**Affected `go-ethereum` Component:** `rpc` package, specifically the HTTP and WebSocket server configurations within a `go-ethereum` node process.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure the `go-ethereum` node's RPC endpoints to only listen on localhost or specific trusted networks.
* Implement strong authentication mechanisms for RPC access (e.g., API keys, JWT) if external access is necessary.
* Restrict the available RPC methods to only those necessary for the application's functionality using configuration options.
* Use a firewall to limit access to RPC ports.
