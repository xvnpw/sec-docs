# Attack Surface Analysis for ethereum/go-ethereum

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated/Unauthorized RPC Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticatedunauthorized_rpc_access.md)

*   **Description:** The `go-ethereum` node exposes an RPC interface (HTTP or WebSocket) that allows interaction with the node's functionalities. Without proper authentication or authorization, anyone who can reach this interface can interact with the node.
    *   **How go-ethereum Contributes:** `go-ethereum` provides the functionality to enable and configure the RPC interface. If the configuration is not secured, the interface becomes an open attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker scans for open ports and finds your application's server with the `go-ethereum` RPC port exposed (e.g., default port 8545). They can then use tools like `curl` or `web3.js` to send RPC requests to your node, potentially accessing sensitive information or triggering actions. For instance, they could call `eth_getBalance` to check account balances or `eth_sendTransaction` if the node's wallet is unlocked.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (account balances, transaction history), unauthorized transaction execution, denial of service (by flooding the node with requests), potential compromise of the node's private keys if the wallet is unlocked.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable the RPC interface if not needed.
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms: Use API keys, JWT tokens, or other robust authentication methods to verify the identity of clients making RPC requests.
        *   Implement authorization controls: Restrict access to specific RPC methods based on the client's permissions.
        *   Bind the RPC interface to specific IP addresses or networks: Limit access to trusted sources.
        *   Use HTTPS/WSS for RPC communication: Encrypt the communication channel to protect sensitive data in transit.
        *   Utilize firewalls: Restrict access to the RPC port at the network level.

## Attack Surface: [Peer-to-Peer Networking Exploits](./attack_surfaces/peer-to-peer_networking_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** `go-ethereum` participates in the Ethereum peer-to-peer network to synchronize the blockchain and interact with other nodes. Vulnerabilities in the P2P protocol implementation can be exploited to disrupt the node's operation or influence its view of the network.
    *   **How go-ethereum Contributes:** `go-ethereum` implements the Ethereum P2P networking protocol. Bugs or vulnerabilities within this implementation are inherent risks.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the message handling logic of the P2P protocol could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted message that crashes your `go-ethereum` node, causing a denial of service. Alternatively, an attacker could exploit a discovery protocol weakness to isolate your node from the legitimate network.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, network isolation, potential for influencing the node's view of the blockchain (though this is generally harder to achieve in practice with robust implementations).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep go-ethereum updated: Regularly update to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes in the P2P implementation.
        *   Monitor peer connections: Observe your node's peer connections for suspicious activity or a sudden drop in peer count.
        *   Use reputable and well-maintained `go-ethereum` forks (if applicable): Ensure the codebase has undergone security scrutiny.
        *   Consider network segmentation: Isolate your `go-ethereum` node within a secure network segment.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Private Key Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_private_key_management.md)

*   **Description:** `go-ethereum` can be used to manage Ethereum private keys. Improper storage or handling of these keys can lead to their compromise.
    *   **How go-ethereum Contributes:** `go-ethereum` provides functionalities for generating, importing, and storing private keys in keystore files. If these functionalities are used without proper security considerations, it introduces risk.
    *   **Example:** Your application stores private keys directly in its configuration files or in a database without encryption, relying on `go-ethereum`'s key management functions but neglecting secure storage practices. An attacker gaining access to the application's server could easily retrieve these keys.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the associated Ethereum accounts, leading to theft of funds or unauthorized actions on the blockchain.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never store private keys directly in the application's codebase or configuration files.
        *   Utilize secure key storage solutions: Hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger, Trezor), secure enclaves, or dedicated key management systems.
        *   Encrypt keystore files with strong passwords: If using `go-ethereum`'s keystore functionality, enforce strong password policies.
        *   Consider using key derivation functions (KDFs) with high work factors: Ensure the password hashing is resistant to brute-force attacks.
        *   Implement access controls for key storage: Restrict access to the files or systems where keys are stored.
