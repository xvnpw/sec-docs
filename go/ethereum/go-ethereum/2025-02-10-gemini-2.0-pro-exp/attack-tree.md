```

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Node's RPC/IPC/WebSockets Interface](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_node's_rpcipcwebsockets_interface.md)

*   **Description:** This is a primary attack vector focusing on gaining unauthorized access to the geth node's control interfaces.
*   **Impact:** High (Full control of the node, ability to steal funds, manipulate transactions, disrupt service)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Authentication Bypass (!!! Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_authentication_bypass__!!!_critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Circumventing the authentication mechanisms protecting the RPC/IPC/WebSockets interfaces.
*   **Impact:** High (Direct access to node's functionalities)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Weak Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_weak_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting weak, default, or easily guessable passwords/API keys used for authentication.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Enforce strong, unique passwords.
        *   Use API keys instead of passwords.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication.
        *   Regularly rotate credentials.
        *   Use a secrets management solution.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 No Authentication (Default) (!!! Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_no_authentication__default___!!!_critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting the lack of authentication on the RPC/IPC interface, often due to misconfiguration or unintentional exposure.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if exposed)
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Always explicitly configure authentication for all interfaces.
        *   Use `--authrpc.jwtsecret` for JWT-based authentication on the RPC.
        *   Restrict IPC access to localhost or a trusted network using firewall rules.
        *   Regularly audit network configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Denial of Service (DoS) on RPC/IPC Interface](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_denial_of_service__dos__on_rpcipc_interface.md)

* **Description:** Attack that aims to make RPC/IPC interface unavailable.
* **Impact:** Medium-High

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Slowloris (Slow HTTP)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_slowloris__slow_http_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exhausting server resources by opening many connections and sending data very slowly.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium-High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        * Configure appropriate timeouts and connection limits.
        * Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) with rate limiting.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2 Resource Starvation (CPU/Mem)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_resource_starvation__cpumem_.md)

*   **Description:**  Sending computationally expensive requests to exhaust CPU or memory.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium-High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        * Implement rate limiting and resource quotas.
        * Monitor resource usage and set alerts.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Attack Smart Contracts via Node](./attack_tree_paths/3__attack_smart_contracts_via_node.md)

*   **Description:** This category focuses on attacks that leverage the geth node as a conduit to exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3 Reentrancy (!!! Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_reentrancy__!!!_critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in smart contracts where a malicious contract can repeatedly call back into the calling contract before the first invocation completes, potentially leading to unexpected state changes and theft of funds.  While primarily a smart contract issue, geth's transaction handling can influence the attack's success.
    *   **Impact:** High (Potential for significant financial loss)

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3.1 Exploit geth's handling of reentrant calls](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_1_exploit_geth's_handling_of_reentrant_calls.md)

*   **Description:**  Leveraging potential subtle flaws in how geth processes transactions in its pool, specifically related to the order and handling of reentrant calls.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Keep geth up-to-date.
        *   Thoroughly audit smart contracts for reentrancy vulnerabilities.
        *   Use established patterns to prevent reentrancy (e.g., Checks-Effects-Interactions).

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3.2 Exploit geth's handling of gas limits during reentrancy](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_2_exploit_geth's_handling_of_gas_limits_during_reentrancy.md)

*   **Description:**  Similar to 3.3.1, but focusing on potential issues with how geth enforces gas limits within the context of reentrant calls.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Keep geth up-to-date.
        *   Thoroughly test smart contracts for reentrancy and gas limit issues.
        *   Use `eth_estimateGas` carefully and with safety margins.
