# Attack Surface Analysis for ethereum/go-ethereum

## Attack Surface: [1. Unauthorized RPC/IPC Access](./attack_surfaces/1__unauthorized_rpcipc_access.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain control of the Geth node through exposed and unprotected RPC or IPC interfaces.
*   **How `go-ethereum` Contributes:** Geth provides RPC/IPC interfaces for node management and interaction.  Improper configuration exposes these interfaces.
*   **Example:** An attacker finds a Geth node with the HTTP-RPC interface exposed on port 8545 without authentication.  They use the `personal_unlockAccount` method (if enabled) to unlock a wallet and then use `eth_sendTransaction` to transfer all funds to their own address.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the node, including potential theft of all funds, manipulation of the blockchain state, and disruption of node operation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never expose RPC to the public internet without strong authentication.**
    *   Use a firewall to restrict access to trusted IP addresses only.
    *   Prefer IPC over network-based RPC when possible (more secure by design).
    *   Enable only the *absolutely necessary* RPC methods using command-line flags (`--http.api`, `--ws.api`, `--authrpc.jwtsecret`).
    *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms (JWT, API keys, TLS client certificates).
    *   Use a reverse proxy with WAF capabilities to filter malicious requests.
    *   Regularly audit the RPC configuration and access logs.

## Attack Surface: [2. Malicious Peers (P2P Network Attacks)](./attack_surfaces/2__malicious_peers__p2p_network_attacks_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers operate malicious nodes on the P2P network to disrupt, deceive, or isolate legitimate nodes.
*   **How `go-ethereum` Contributes:** Geth relies on a P2P network for communication and consensus.  This inherently exposes the node to interactions with potentially malicious peers.
*   **Example:** An attacker launches an Eclipse attack, surrounding a target Geth node with malicious peers.  The target node becomes isolated from the legitimate network and receives only false information, potentially leading it to accept invalid blocks or transactions.
*   **Impact:** Node isolation, acceptance of invalid data, denial-of-service, potential double-spending (if the node is tricked into accepting a minority chain).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use a curated list of trusted bootnodes (and hardcode their enode URLs if possible).
    *   Implement peer scoring and blacklisting mechanisms (Geth has some built-in, but custom logic may be needed).
    *   Limit the maximum number of connected peers.
    *   Monitor peer behavior for anomalies (e.g., excessive requests, invalid data).
    *   Validate data received from peers rigorously.
    *   Use static peers for critical connections (peers that are always connected).
    *   Regularly update Geth to benefit from the latest P2P security improvements.

## Attack Surface: [3. Chain Reorganization (Reorg) Attacks](./attack_surfaces/3__chain_reorganization__reorg__attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers with significant hash power (or stake) attempt to rewrite portions of the blockchain, potentially causing double-spending.
*   **How `go-ethereum` Contributes:** Geth implements the blockchain consensus mechanism, making it susceptible to reorgs if the underlying network is attacked.
*   **Example:** An attacker with substantial hash power secretly mines a longer chain and then publishes it, invalidating previously confirmed transactions on the shorter, public chain.  This allows them to double-spend coins.
*   **Impact:** Double-spending, loss of funds, invalidation of transactions, loss of trust in the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Wait for a sufficient number of confirmations before considering a transaction final.  The required number of confirmations depends on the value of the transaction and the risk tolerance.
    *   Monitor for deep reorgs using Geth's events and APIs.
    *   Consider using multiple, independent Geth nodes for critical confirmations.
    *   Be aware of the risks associated with low-liquidity or low-hashrate chains.

## Attack Surface: [4. Geth Code Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/4__geth_code_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities within the `go-ethereum` codebase itself could be exploited.
*   **How `go-ethereum` Contributes:** This is a direct risk stemming from the Geth software.
*   **Example:** A newly discovered remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Geth's networking layer allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable nodes.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial-of-service, data corruption, complete node compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for RCE), High (for other serious bugs)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Stay up-to-date with the *latest stable* Geth releases.**  This is the *most important* mitigation.
    *   Monitor security advisories from the Ethereum Foundation and the Geth team.
    *   Use a specific, well-tested version of Geth and avoid using development or unstable builds in production.
    *   Consider contributing to Geth's security audits and bug bounty programs.
    *   Implement robust monitoring and intrusion detection systems to detect and respond to potential exploits.

## Attack Surface: [5. Weak Key Management (If Geth Manages Keys)](./attack_surfaces/5__weak_key_management__if_geth_manages_keys_.md)

* **Description:** If Geth is used to manage private keys, weak security practices can lead to key compromise.
    * **How `go-ethereum` Contributes:** Geth provides key management functionality (keystore files).
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to a server running Geth and finds unencrypted keystore files or discovers a weak password protecting the keystore.
    * **Impact:** Complete loss of funds associated with the compromised keys.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always** use strong, unique passwords to encrypt keystore files.
        *   Consider using hardware wallets or secure enclaves for key storage.
        *   Never store unencrypted private keys.
        *   Limit access to the server where Geth and its keystore files are stored.
        *   Regularly audit key management practices.
        *   Use multi-signature wallets for increased security.
        *   Avoid unlocking accounts for extended periods.
