# Threat Model Analysis for ethereum/go-ethereum

## Threat: [Chain Split Exploitation](./threats/chain_split_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Chain Split Exploitation
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in `go-ethereum`'s consensus implementation to cause the node to follow an invalid chain or participate in a chain split. This could involve crafting specific blocks or network messages that trigger consensus bugs within `go-ethereum`'s core logic.
*   **Impact:** Inconsistent blockchain state for the application, potential financial losses if the application relies on the correct chain state, disruption of application functionality due to operating on a minority chain.
*   **Affected go-ethereum component:** Consensus Engine (e.g., `eth/downloader`, `eth/gasprice`, `core/block_validator`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `go-ethereum` updated to the latest stable version to benefit from consensus bug fixes and security patches.
    *   Monitor node synchronization status and chain health regularly using `go-ethereum`'s metrics or external monitoring tools.
    *   Implement robust chain monitoring and alerting mechanisms in the application to detect chain splits or anomalies, potentially by cross-referencing with other independent Ethereum clients.
    *   Consider running multiple, diverse Ethereum clients (beyond just `go-ethereum`) for redundancy and consensus cross-validation at the application level.

## Threat: [Unauthenticated RPC Access](./threats/unauthenticated_rpc_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthenticated RPC Access
*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the `go-ethereum` node's RPC API because it is exposed without authentication or authorization. The attacker can then send arbitrary RPC commands directly to the `go-ethereum` node, bypassing application-level security.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (account balances, node status, internal configuration), ability to send unauthorized transactions directly through the node, denial of service by overloading the node with RPC requests, potential manipulation of node configuration if writable RPC APIs are exposed, leading to further compromise of the node and potentially the application.
*   **Affected go-ethereum component:** RPC API (`rpc` package, HTTP/WS server within `go-ethereum`)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable public RPC access:**  Restrict RPC access to localhost or specific trusted networks using firewall rules or `go-ethereum` configuration options (`--http.addr`, `--http.host`, `--http.vhosts`) to limit network exposure of the RPC interface.
    *   **Enable RPC authentication:** Configure and enforce authentication for RPC access using `go-ethereum`'s `--http.api` and `--http.auth` flags, utilizing strong passwords or API keys managed by `go-ethereum`.
    *   **Use HTTPS for RPC:**  Enable HTTPS for RPC endpoints (`--http.tls*` flags in `go-ethereum`) to encrypt communication and protect credentials in transit to and from the `go-ethereum` RPC interface.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for RPC APIs:** Only enable absolutely necessary RPC APIs using `--http.api` and `--ws.api` in `go-ethereum`, disabling potentially dangerous or unnecessary APIs that could be abused through the RPC interface.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via P2P Flooding](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_p2p_flooding.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via P2P Flooding
*   **Description:** An attacker floods the `go-ethereum` node with excessive P2P network traffic, exploiting vulnerabilities or limitations in `go-ethereum`'s P2P networking implementation to overwhelm its network resources (bandwidth, connection limits, processing power) and cause denial of service at the `go-ethereum` node level.
*   **Impact:** Node unresponsiveness, inability to synchronize with the Ethereum network, disruption of application functionality that depends on the `go-ethereum` node being online and synchronized, potential node crash due to resource exhaustion.
*   **Affected go-ethereum component:** P2P Networking (`p2p` package, network stack within `go-ethereum`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Configure P2P rate limiting and connection limits within `go-ethereum`:** Use `go-ethereum` configuration options to limit incoming connections and network traffic (`--maxpeers`, `--maxpendpeers`) to control resource consumption by the P2P network.
    *   **Implement network monitoring and anomaly detection at the system level:** Monitor network traffic patterns to identify and respond to potential flooding attacks targeting the `go-ethereum` node's P2P port.
    *   **Use firewalls to filter P2P traffic:**  Restrict incoming P2P connections to known and trusted peers if possible, or implement rate limiting at the firewall level to protect the `go-ethereum` node from excessive external P2P traffic.
    *   **Ensure sufficient system resources for `go-ethereum`:** Provision adequate network bandwidth, CPU, and memory for the `go-ethereum` node to handle expected P2P traffic and potential spikes.

## Threat: [Plaintext Private Key Storage](./threats/plaintext_private_key_storage.md)

*   **Threat:** Plaintext Private Key Storage
*   **Description:** Private keys used by the application or managed by `go-ethereum` are stored in plaintext on disk or in memory by misconfiguration or insecure practices when using `go-ethereum`'s key management features. This makes them easily accessible to an attacker who gains access to the system where `go-ethereum` is running.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of associated Ethereum accounts managed by `go-ethereum`, loss of funds held in those accounts, ability for the attacker to impersonate the application or user controlling those accounts, irreversible financial losses and reputational damage.
*   **Affected go-ethereum component:** Key Management (`accounts/keystore`, `crypto/ecies`, `crypto/secp256k1` within `go-ethereum`)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never store private keys in plaintext when using `go-ethereum`:** Absolutely avoid storing private keys directly in code, configuration files, logs, or unencrypted storage accessible to `go-ethereum`.
    *   **Utilize `go-ethereum`'s encrypted keystore:**  Use `go-ethereum`'s built-in keystore functionality (`accounts/keystore`) to store private keys encrypted with strong passwords managed by `go-ethereum`.
    *   **Implement robust access controls on `go-ethereum`'s keystore:**  Restrict file system permissions and access to `go-ethereum`'s keystore directory to only the necessary user and processes running `go-ethereum`.
    *   **Consider Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) with `go-ethereum`:** For high-security applications, integrate HSMs with `go-ethereum` to generate, store, and manage private keys in a tamper-proof hardware environment, leveraging `go-ethereum`'s HSM support if available.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
*   **Description:** `go-ethereum` relies on various external libraries. Known or newly discovered vulnerabilities in these dependencies are exploited by attackers to compromise the `go-ethereum` node or the application interacting with it. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in libraries used for cryptography, networking, data processing, or other functionalities within `go-ethereum`'s dependency tree.
*   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, including denial of service of the `go-ethereum` node, information disclosure from the node's memory or file system, remote code execution on the server running `go-ethereum`, or complete system compromise.
*   **Affected go-ethereum component:** Dependencies (various external libraries used by `go-ethereum` and managed by its build system)
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability and its exploitability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update `go-ethereum` and its dependencies:** Stay up-to-date with the latest stable versions of `go-ethereum` to benefit from dependency updates and vulnerability patches included in `go-ethereum` releases.
    *   **Dependency scanning and vulnerability monitoring for `go-ethereum`'s dependencies:** Implement automated tools to scan `go-ethereum`'s dependencies for known vulnerabilities and monitor for new vulnerability disclosures affecting those dependencies.
    *   **Use dependency management tools for `go-ethereum`'s build process:** Employ tools like `go modules` to manage `go-ethereum`'s dependencies and ensure consistent and secure dependency versions are used in builds.
    *   **Review security advisories related to `go-ethereum` and its dependencies:**  Subscribe to security advisories for `go-ethereum` and its upstream dependencies to be proactively informed of potential vulnerabilities and apply necessary updates or mitigations promptly.
