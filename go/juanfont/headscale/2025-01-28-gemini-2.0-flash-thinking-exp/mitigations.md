# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for juanfont/headscale

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Headscale Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_headscale_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitoring Releases:** Subscribe to Headscale's release announcements (e.g., GitHub releases, mailing lists) to stay informed about new versions and security updates.
    2.  **Regular Updates:** Establish a process for regularly updating Headscale to the latest stable version. Test updates in a staging environment before deploying to production.
    3.  **Automated Updates (Carefully):** Consider automating Headscale updates using scripting or configuration management tools, but ensure thorough testing and rollback procedures are in place.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Headscale Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Patches known security vulnerabilities in Headscale itself, preventing exploitation by attackers.
*   **Impact:** **High** risk reduction for known Headscale vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** **Partial**. Release announcements are monitored. Updates are performed manually every few months.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated update process is not implemented. Updates are not performed as frequently as recommended.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Strong Secrets:** Generate strong, random secrets for `DERP_API_SECRET` and other sensitive configuration parameters. Use tools like `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate secrets.
    2.  **Configuration Review:** Thoroughly review all Headscale configuration options and understand their security implications. Configure options according to security best practices and the principle of least privilege within Headscale's capabilities.
    3.  **Secure Storage:** Store the Headscale configuration file with appropriate file permissions (e.g., `chmod 600 headscale.yaml`, owned by the Headscale user). Restrict access to the configuration file to only authorized users and processes.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Compromise (High Severity):** Weak or default secrets can be easily compromised, allowing unauthorized access to the Headscale server and control over the VPN.

    2.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for administrative access to Headscale. This can be achieved through reverse proxy integration with an identity provider that supports MFA (e.g., using Authelia, Keycloak, or cloud provider's IAM).
    3.  **Node Authentication Policies:**  Carefully choose node authentication methods. If possible, move away from pre-shared keys to more robust methods like OIDC integration for user-based authentication and authorization.
    4.  **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Implement and rigorously test Headscale ACLs to enforce the principle of least privilege. Define granular rules to restrict network access between nodes based on roles and responsibilities. Regularly review and update ACLs.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Weak authentication or lack of authorization controls within Headscale can allow unauthorized users or nodes to access the Headscale network and resources.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):**  Insufficient authorization controls within Headscale can allow users or nodes to gain access to resources beyond their intended privileges within the VPN.
*   **Impact:** **High** risk reduction for unauthorized access and **Medium** risk reduction for privilege escalation.
*   **Currently Implemented:** **Partial**. Strong passwords are enforced for admin users. Basic ACLs are implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated node inventory and audit processes within Headscale are not implemented. Formal node removal process using Headscale features is not defined.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Segmentation within the VPN (using Headscale ACLs)](./mitigation_strategies/network_segmentation_within_the_vpn__using_headscale_acls_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **ACL Refinement:** Utilize Headscale ACLs to segment the VPN network logically. Define granular ACL rules to restrict communication between different groups of nodes based on their roles and responsibilities within Headscale.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**

    *   **DNS Leakage (Low Severity):** Prevents sensitive DNS queries from being exposed to external DNS resolvers, by managing DNS configuration within Headscale.
*   **Impact:** **Medium** risk reduction for DNS spoofing/hijacking and **Low** risk reduction for DNS leakage.
*   **Currently Implemented:** **No**. Headscale's DNS configuration features are not actively utilized. Nodes are currently using default public DNS resolvers or external resolvers, not managed by Headscale.
