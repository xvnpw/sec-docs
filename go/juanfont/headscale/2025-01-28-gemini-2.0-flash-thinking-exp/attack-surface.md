# Attack Surface Analysis for juanfont/headscale

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Headscale API Endpoint](./attack_surfaces/exposed_headscale_api_endpoint.md)

*   **Description:** The Headscale server's API endpoint, essential for client communication and management, becomes a primary target when exposed, especially to the internet.
*   **Headscale Contribution:** Headscale *requires* an API endpoint for its core functionality (node registration, key exchange, policy management). This endpoint is the central control plane and a necessary component of Headscale's architecture.
*   **Example:** An attacker from the internet attempts brute-force attacks on the `/register` API endpoint to guess API keys or exploits unpatched vulnerabilities in Headscale's API handling logic to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Headscale control plane, allowing attackers to register malicious nodes, disrupt network operations, or exfiltrate network configuration data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict API Access:** Implement firewall rules to limit access to the Headscale API endpoint to only necessary IP ranges or networks. Consider using a VPN or bastion host for administrative access.
    *   **Strong API Authentication:** Enforce strong API key generation and rotation policies. Avoid default or weak API keys.
    *   **Rate Limiting and DoS Protection:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints within Headscale or using a reverse proxy/WAF to prevent brute-force attacks and DoS attempts.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Updates:** Keep Headscale updated to patch known vulnerabilities in the API. Conduct regular security audits of the API endpoints and Headscale codebase.
    *   **HTTPS Enforcement:** Ensure all API communication is over HTTPS with strong TLS configurations within Headscale to protect data in transit.

## Attack Surface: [Headscale Web UI Vulnerabilities (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/headscale_web_ui_vulnerabilities__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** The optional Headscale Web UI, while providing convenience, introduces typical web application vulnerabilities directly within the Headscale application.
*   **Headscale Contribution:** Headscale *optionally* includes a Web UI for easier administration. This integrated web application layer is part of the Headscale project and its attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the Headscale Web UI code to inject malicious JavaScript, potentially stealing administrator session cookies or performing actions on behalf of an administrator.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized administrative access to Headscale, leading to full control over the managed network.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (if enabled and exposed)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Web UI if Unnecessary:** If command-line administration is sufficient, disable the Web UI in Headscale's configuration to eliminate this attack surface.
    *   **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding within the Headscale Web UI codebase to prevent XSS and injection attacks.
    *   **Secure Authentication and Authorization:** Use strong password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA) if possible, and robust session management for Web UI access within Headscale's authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Regular Security Updates:** Keep Headscale updated to benefit from patches and security fixes for the Web UI components.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy within the Headscale Web UI to mitigate XSS risks.

## Attack Surface: [Node Key Compromise](./attack_surfaces/node_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Compromise of node authentication keys, managed by Headscale, allows attackers to impersonate legitimate nodes and gain unauthorized network access.
*   **Headscale Contribution:** Headscale is responsible for generating, storing, and distributing node keys. Vulnerabilities or weaknesses in Headscale's key management processes directly contribute to the risk of key compromise.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Headscale server's database or configuration files where node keys are stored (even if encrypted) due to a vulnerability in Headscale's security practices. They then use a compromised key to register a malicious node via Headscale and gain unauthorized access to the private network.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the private network, lateral movement, data breaches, and disruption of network services.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Key Storage within Headscale:** Ensure Headscale encrypts node keys at rest in its database or configuration files using strong encryption algorithms.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Headscale Server:** Limit access to the Headscale server and its data stores to only authorized personnel and processes to protect key material managed by Headscale.
    *   **Regular Key Rotation:** Implement a policy for regular rotation of node keys within Headscale to limit the lifespan of potentially compromised keys.
    *   **Secure Key Distribution by Headscale:** Ensure Headscale uses secure channels for key distribution to nodes during the registration process.
    *   **Monitoring for Suspicious Node Registrations:** Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual node registration activity within Headscale that might indicate key compromise or unauthorized node additions.

## Attack Surface: [API Input Validation Failures](./attack_surfaces/api_input_validation_failures.md)

*   **Description:** Insufficient validation of inputs to the Headscale API, a core component of Headscale, can lead to various injection vulnerabilities directly within Headscale's API handling.
*   **Headscale Contribution:** Headscale's API design and implementation are directly responsible for handling inputs. Lack of proper input validation in Headscale's API handlers is a vulnerability within Headscale itself.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious node registration request with specially crafted data in fields like hostname or user data, exploiting a command injection vulnerability in the Headscale server's processing logic *within Headscale's code*.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Headscale server, data breaches, denial of service, or compromise of the control plane.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation in Headscale API:** Implement comprehensive input validation on all API endpoints within Headscale's codebase. Validate data types, formats, lengths, and ranges in Headscale's API handlers.
    *   **Output Encoding in Headscale API:** Properly encode outputs within Headscale's API responses to prevent injection attacks when data is used in responses or logs.
    *   **Security Code Reviews of Headscale Code:** Conduct regular security code reviews of Headscale's codebase, specifically focusing on API input handling, to identify and fix input validation vulnerabilities.
    *   **Use Secure Coding Practices in Headscale Development:** Ensure Headscale developers follow secure coding practices to avoid common injection vulnerabilities in the API implementation.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure default configurations shipped with Headscale can create immediate vulnerabilities upon deployment if users fail to properly secure them.
*   **Headscale Contribution:** Headscale's default configuration settings, as provided out-of-the-box, directly influence the initial security posture of a deployment. Insecure defaults are a direct contribution from the Headscale project.
*   **Example:** Headscale is deployed using default API keys or weak TLS settings that are part of the default configuration. An attacker discovers these defaults (e.g., through documentation or common knowledge) and uses them to gain unauthorized access to the API or intercept communication with a newly deployed Headscale instance.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromise of the Headscale control plane from the initial deployment stage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Change Default API Keys Immediately:** Mandate and clearly document the necessity to immediately change all default API keys upon installation of Headscale.
    *   **Enforce Strong TLS Configuration by Default:** Configure Headscale to use strong TLS versions and cipher suites as the default, and discourage or disable weak or outdated protocols in the default configuration.
    *   **Minimize Insecure Defaults:** Review all default configuration settings in Headscale and minimize the use of insecure defaults. Provide secure defaults where possible.
    *   **Security Hardening Guides and Prominent Warnings:** Provide clear and prominent security hardening guides and warnings in Headscale documentation, emphasizing the importance of changing default settings and securing the deployment.
    *   **Automated Security Checks Post-Installation:** Consider providing or recommending automated security checks that users can run after installation to identify insecure default configurations.
