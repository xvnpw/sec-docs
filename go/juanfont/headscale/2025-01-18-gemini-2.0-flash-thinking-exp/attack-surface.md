# Attack Surface Analysis for juanfont/headscale

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass on Headscale Server](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass_on_headscale_server.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Authentication Bypass on Headscale Server
    - **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Headscale's authentication mechanisms allow unauthorized individuals to gain administrative access to the Headscale server.
    - **How Headscale Contributes:** Headscale acts as the central authentication authority for the Tailscale network it manages. A flaw here directly compromises the control plane.
    - **Example:** An attacker exploits a bug in the password reset functionality or a session management vulnerability to log in as an administrator without valid credentials.
    - **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Tailscale network managed by Headscale, including the ability to add/remove nodes, inspect traffic metadata, and potentially disrupt connectivity.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:
        - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Headscale administrative users.
        - Regularly audit and update authentication mechanisms and dependencies.
        - Enforce strong password policies.
        - Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.
        - Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing focusing on authentication.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure API Access Control](./attack_surfaces/insecure_api_access_control.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Insecure API Access Control
    - **Description:**  Lack of proper authorization checks or vulnerabilities in the Headscale API allow unauthorized actions to be performed.
    - **How Headscale Contributes:** Headscale exposes an API for managing the Tailscale network. Weak access controls on this API can be exploited.
    - **Example:** An attacker uses an API endpoint without proper authentication or with insufficient permissions to register a rogue node or modify DNS settings.
    - **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of the Tailscale network configuration, potential introduction of malicious nodes, and disruption of services.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:
        - Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
        - Follow the principle of least privilege when granting API access.
        - Thoroughly validate all input to API endpoints to prevent injection attacks.
        - Implement rate limiting on API requests to prevent abuse.

## Attack Surface: [Coordination Server Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/coordination_server_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Coordination Server Denial of Service (DoS)
    - **Description:**  Attackers flood the Headscale coordination server with requests, making it unavailable for legitimate clients.
    - **How Headscale Contributes:** Headscale's core function is to act as the coordination server for Tailscale clients. Its availability is crucial for network operation.
    - **Example:** An attacker sends a large number of registration requests or heartbeat signals to the Headscale server, overwhelming its resources and preventing legitimate clients from connecting or staying connected.
    - **Impact:** Disruption of the Tailscale network, preventing users from connecting to their private network.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:
        - Implement rate limiting on incoming requests to the coordination server.
        - Deploy Headscale behind a load balancer with DDoS protection.
        - Optimize Headscale's resource usage and scalability.
        - Consider using a more robust message queue or distributed system for coordination if scalability is a major concern.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Authentication Credentials or Keys](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_authentication_credentials_or_keys.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Insecure Storage of Authentication Credentials or Keys
    - **Description:**  Headscale stores authentication credentials or cryptographic keys in an insecure manner.
    - **How Headscale Contributes:** Headscale needs to store information necessary for authenticating users and nodes. Insecure storage puts this data at risk.
    - **Example:** Headscale stores user passwords in plaintext or uses weak encryption for storing node authentication keys in its database or configuration files.
    - **Impact:** Compromise of user accounts and the ability to impersonate legitimate nodes, leading to unauthorized access and control over the network.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:
        - Use strong, industry-standard hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with salt for storing user passwords.
        - Encrypt sensitive data at rest, including authentication keys, using strong encryption algorithms.
        - Implement proper access controls to the storage location of sensitive data.
        - Regularly rotate encryption keys.
