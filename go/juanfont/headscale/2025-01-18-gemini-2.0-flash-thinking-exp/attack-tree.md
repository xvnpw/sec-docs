    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploit API Vulnerabilities (e.g., Authentication Bypass, Authorization Flaws)
        *   **Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the Headscale API to bypass authentication or authorization checks, potentially leading to full control.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploit Underlying OS/Infrastructure Vulnerabilities
        *   **Description:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in the operating system or infrastructure hosting the Headscale server to gain access.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Obtain Headscale Admin Credentials (e.g., Phishing, Credential Stuffing, Default Credentials)
        *   **Description:** Attackers use social engineering, credential reuse, or guess default credentials to gain administrative access to the Headscale server.
*   **Leverage Access to Compromise Network:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Modify Network Policies to Allow Unauthorized Access
        *   **Description:** Once the Headscale server is compromised, attackers can modify network policies to grant themselves access to the target application or other resources.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Impersonate a Valid Node to Access Application
        *   **Description:** With access to the Headscale server, attackers can obtain node keys and impersonate legitimate nodes to access the application.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Inject Malicious Code into Headscale Configuration
        *   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious code into the Headscale configuration to achieve persistent compromise or execute code on managed nodes.
