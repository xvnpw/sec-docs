# Threat Model Analysis for juanfont/headscale

## Threat: [Headscale Server Compromise](./threats/headscale_server_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Headscale server. This could be achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities in the Headscale software itself, compromising the underlying operating system, or through stolen credentials. Once inside, the attacker can manipulate the database, API, and potentially the server's file system.

**Impact:**  Complete control over the WireGuard network managed by Headscale. This includes:
*   Adding malicious nodes to the network.
*   Removing legitimate nodes, causing disruption.
*   Modifying node configurations (allowed IPs, routes) to intercept or redirect traffic.
*   Accessing stored pre-authentication keys or other sensitive data.
*   Potentially pivoting to other systems within the network.
**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Insecure Pre-Authentication Key Management](./threats/insecure_pre-authentication_key_management.md)

**Description:** Pre-authentication keys are used to initially register nodes. If these keys are generated with weak entropy, stored insecurely (e.g., in plain text, easily accessible locations within Headscale's storage), or transmitted over insecure channels, an attacker could obtain them. They could then register unauthorized nodes on the network.

**Impact:** Unauthorized nodes gaining access to the WireGuard network, potentially eavesdropping on traffic, launching attacks from within the network, or disrupting network operations.
**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [User Impersonation/Account Takeover on Headscale](./threats/user_impersonationaccount_takeover_on_headscale.md)

**Description:** If Headscale's user management features (if enabled) are vulnerable to attacks like brute-forcing, credential stuffing, or session hijacking, an attacker could gain access to legitimate user accounts. This allows them to manage the network through the Headscale interface.

**Impact:** An attacker could perform actions as a legitimate user, such as adding/removing nodes, modifying configurations, or potentially gaining insights into the network topology.
**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Bypassing Access Controls (ACLs)](./threats/bypassing_access_controls__acls_.md)

**Description:** If Headscale's Access Control List (ACL) implementation has vulnerabilities, an attacker might be able to bypass these controls. This could allow unauthorized communication between nodes that should be isolated.

**Impact:**  Compromised network segmentation, allowing malicious nodes to access sensitive resources or launch attacks against other nodes that should be protected.
**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Malicious Routing](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_malicious_routing.md)

**Description:** An attacker who has compromised the Headscale server or a malicious node could manipulate routing information managed by Headscale. This could involve advertising incorrect routes, leading to traffic being dropped, misdirected, or looped, effectively causing a denial of service for parts or all of the network.

**Impact:**  Disruption of network connectivity, making resources inaccessible.
**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Insecure API Interactions](./threats/insecure_api_interactions.md)

**Description:** If your application interacts with Headscale's API in an insecure manner (e.g., exposing API keys, vulnerable API endpoints provided by Headscale), attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to interact with Headscale without proper authorization.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized management of the WireGuard network, potentially leading to the same impacts as a Headscale server compromise, but potentially with a more limited scope depending on the exposed API functionality.
**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Headscale Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_headscale_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Headscale relies on various software dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could potentially be exploited to compromise the Headscale server.

**Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or other security breaches on the Headscale server.
**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Compromised Headscale Releases](./threats/compromised_headscale_releases.md)

**Description:** Although unlikely, a malicious actor could potentially compromise Headscale releases, introducing backdoors or vulnerabilities into the software.

**Impact:**  Widespread compromise of systems using the compromised Headscale release, potentially allowing for complete control over the managed WireGuard networks.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
