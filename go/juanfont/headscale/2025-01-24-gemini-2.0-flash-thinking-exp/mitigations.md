## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure TLS Configuration for Headscale](./mitigation_strategies/secure_tls_configuration_for_headscale.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain Valid TLS Certificate:** Acquire a valid TLS certificate for your Headscale server's domain or hostname. This can be obtained from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) like Let's Encrypt, or through your organization's internal certificate management system.
    2.  **Configure Headscale TLS Settings:**  Modify your Headscale server configuration file (`config.yaml`) to specify the paths to your TLS certificate (`tls_cert_path`) and private key (`tls_key_path`). Ensure these paths are correctly configured and accessible by the Headscale server process.
    3.  **Enforce HTTPS:** Configure Headscale to enforce HTTPS for all web interface and API communication. This is typically the default behavior when TLS is configured, but double-check your configuration to ensure HTTP is disabled or redirects to HTTPS.
    4.  **Utilize Strong Cipher Suites (via Reverse Proxy if applicable):** If using a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Caddy) in front of Headscale, configure the reverse proxy to use strong and modern TLS cipher suites. This ensures secure encryption algorithms are used for communication. Headscale itself relies on the Go standard library for TLS, which generally uses secure defaults, but a reverse proxy provides more granular control.
    5.  **Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) (via Reverse Proxy if applicable):** If using a reverse proxy, enable HSTS in the reverse proxy configuration. This header instructs browsers to always connect to your Headscale server over HTTPS, preventing downgrade attacks.
    6.  **Regularly Renew Certificates:** Implement a process for automatic renewal of your TLS certificates, especially if using Let's Encrypt which has short-lived certificates. Ensure certificate renewal is monitored and alerts are in place for failures.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and eavesdropping on communication between Headscale clients and the server, protecting sensitive data like authentication tokens and network traffic information.
    *   **Data Confidentiality Breach (High Severity):** Ensures the confidentiality of data transmitted between clients and the Headscale server, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    *   **Session Hijacking (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of session hijacking by encrypting communication and protecting session cookies or tokens from being intercepted.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** High risk reduction. Effectively mitigates MITM attacks on the Headscale communication channel.
    *   **Data Confidentiality Breach:** High risk reduction. Significantly enhances the confidentiality of data in transit.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Medium risk reduction. Makes session hijacking significantly more difficult.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt is used and configured in `config.yaml`. HTTPS is enforced.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Strong cipher suite configuration and HSTS are not explicitly configured (relying on defaults, could be improved via reverse proxy). Automated monitoring for certificate renewal failures is not fully implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Headscale Access Control Lists (ACLs) Implementation](./mitigation_strategies/headscale_access_control_lists__acls__implementation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Network Access Policy:** Clearly define your organization's network access policy within the Tailscale/Headscale network. Determine which users or groups should have access to specific resources (servers, services, other clients).
    2.  **Translate Policy to Headscale ACL Rules:** Convert your network access policy into Headscale ACL rules. Utilize Headscale's ACL syntax to define rules based on:
        *   **Users and Groups:**  Use Headscale user and group identifiers to control access based on user identity.
        *   **Tags:**  Tag Headscale nodes (clients and servers) with descriptive tags (e.g., `tag:webservers`, `tag:developers`). Use these tags in ACL rules to control access to groups of nodes.
        *   **IP Addresses/Subnets:** While less granular, you can use IP addresses or subnets in ACL rules for specific scenarios.
        *   **Destinations:** Specify destination ports and protocols in ACL rules to control access to specific services running on nodes.
    3.  **Implement ACLs in `acl_policy.yaml`:** Create or modify the `acl_policy.yaml` file in your Headscale server configuration directory. Define your ACL rules in YAML format according to Headscale's ACL syntax.
    4.  **Apply ACL Policy:**  Instruct Headscale to load and enforce the `acl_policy.yaml` file. This is typically done by restarting the Headscale server or using a command to reload the configuration.
    5.  **Test and Validate ACLs:** Thoroughly test your ACL configuration after implementation and after any changes. Use tools like `tailscale ping` and `nmap` from different clients to verify that access is allowed or denied as intended.
    6.  **Regularly Review and Audit ACLs:** Periodically review your ACL policy and configuration to ensure they remain aligned with your security requirements and network changes. Audit logs related to ACL decisions (if available in Headscale or through logging integration) to monitor ACL effectiveness.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Lateral Movement within Headscale Network (High Severity):** Prevents compromised or malicious nodes from accessing resources they are not authorized to reach within the Tailscale network.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Resources (High Severity):** Restricts access to critical servers, databases, or internal services only to authorized users and clients.
    *   **Data Breach due to Excessive Access (High Severity):** Limits the potential scope of a data breach by enforcing the principle of least privilege and preventing broad, unrestricted access.
    *   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Mitigates potential damage from insider threats by limiting the network access available to users based on their roles and responsibilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Lateral Movement within Headscale Network:** High risk reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of lateral movement and limits the impact of node compromise.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Resources:** High risk reduction. Enforces access control and prevents unauthorized access to critical assets.
    *   **Data Breach due to Excessive Access:** High risk reduction. Minimizes the potential damage from a data breach by limiting access scope.
    *   **Insider Threats:** Medium risk reduction. Makes it more difficult for insiders to abuse their network access.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic ACLs are defined in `acl_policy.yaml` to restrict access to specific server tags.
*   **Missing Implementation:** ACLs are not yet granular enough to fully segment the network based on user groups and application needs. ACL policy documentation is lacking. Regular ACL review and auditing process is not formally established. Testing and validation of ACL changes are not consistently performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Headscale Software Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_headscale_software_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Headscale Release Channels:** Regularly monitor Headscale's official release channels, such as the GitHub repository's releases page, mailing lists, or community forums, for announcements of new versions and security updates.
    2.  **Establish Update Schedule:** Define a regular schedule for updating your Headscale server and client software. Prioritize security updates and aim for timely patching of known vulnerabilities. Consider a monthly or quarterly update cycle, or more frequent updates for critical security patches.
    3.  **Test Updates in Staging Environment:** Before deploying updates to your production Headscale server, thoroughly test them in a staging or testing environment that mirrors your production setup. This helps identify potential compatibility issues, regressions, or unexpected behavior introduced by the update.
    4.  **Apply Server Updates:** Follow the official Headscale upgrade instructions to update your Headscale server to the latest stable version. This typically involves replacing the Headscale server binary and restarting the service.
    5.  **Promote Client Updates:** Encourage or enforce Headscale client updates across all connected devices. Communicate update instructions to users and provide guidance on how to update their clients. For managed devices, consider using automated software deployment tools to push client updates.
    6.  **Verify Update Success:** After applying updates, verify that the Headscale server and clients are running the expected versions and that all functionalities are working as intended. Monitor Headscale logs for any errors or issues after updates.
    7.  **Implement Rollback Plan:** Have a documented rollback plan in place in case an update introduces critical issues or instability in your production environment. This plan should outline the steps to revert to the previous Headscale version.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Headscale Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from exploiting publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities present in older versions of Headscale server and client software.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploitation (Medium Severity - Reduced Window):** While updates cannot prevent zero-day exploits, staying up-to-date reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities before patches are available.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Headscale Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction. Eliminates known vulnerabilities as potential attack vectors, significantly improving security posture.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploitation:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the time window during which zero-day vulnerabilities can be exploited, demonstrating proactive security management.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Headscale server updates are performed manually when new versions are noticed, but not on a strict schedule. Client updates are largely manual and user-dependent.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal update schedule is not defined. Staging environment for Headscale updates is not fully utilized. Automated client update mechanisms are not in place. Rollback plan is not formally documented and tested.
