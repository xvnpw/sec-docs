# Threat Model Analysis for juanfont/headscale

## Threat: [Headscale Server Compromise](./threats/headscale_server_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Headscale server. This could be achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities in the Headscale software or through stolen credentials for the Headscale application itself. Once inside, the attacker could manipulate the entire Tailscale network managed by Headscale.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Network Access:** The attacker can issue new keys and join the private network, accessing sensitive resources managed by Headscale.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker can revoke legitimate keys through Headscale, disrupting access for authorized users and services.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify node metadata within Headscale, potentially redirecting traffic or impersonating legitimate nodes.
*   **Credential Theft:** The attacker might access stored secrets or credentials used by Headscale for integrations.

**Affected Component:** Headscale Server (core application, API, authentication modules)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Headscale server software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for the Headscale admin interface.
*   Regularly audit access logs and monitor for suspicious activity on the Headscale server.
*   Implement network segmentation to limit the blast radius if the Headscale server is compromised.
*   Securely store any sensitive configuration files or credentials used by Headscale.

## Threat: [Insecure Headscale API Usage](./threats/insecure_headscale_api_usage.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the Headscale API to perform unauthorized actions. This could involve bypassing authentication or authorization checks within the Headscale API, or exploiting known API flaws in Headscale itself.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Node Management:**  The attacker could register rogue nodes, delete legitimate nodes, or modify node configurations through the Headscale API.
*   **Access Control Bypass:** The attacker could manipulate access control lists or group memberships managed by Headscale to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The attacker might be able to retrieve sensitive information about the network configuration or node details via the Headscale API.

**Affected Component:** Headscale API (specific endpoints related to node management, ACLs, etc.)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Securely authenticate and authorize all requests to the Headscale API.
*   Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks targeting the Headscale API.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting API access to Headscale.
*   Regularly review and update the API access tokens or keys used by applications interacting with Headscale.
*   Monitor API usage for suspicious patterns or unauthorized access attempts against the Headscale API.

## Threat: [Rogue Node Registration](./threats/rogue_node_registration.md)

**Description:** An attacker manages to register a malicious or unauthorized node with the Headscale server. This could be achieved by exploiting weaknesses in the node registration process implemented by Headscale or by compromising existing registration keys managed by Headscale.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Network Access:** The rogue node gains access to the private network managed by Headscale and its resources.
*   **Data Interception or Manipulation:** The rogue node could potentially intercept or manipulate traffic within the network controlled by Headscale.
*   **Lateral Movement:** The rogue node could be used as a stepping stone to attack other nodes within the private network managed by Headscale.

**Affected Component:** Headscale Node Registration Handler (logic responsible for verifying and adding new nodes)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for node registration within Headscale (e.g., pre-shared keys, OIDC).
*   Regularly review and revoke unused or suspicious node registrations within Headscale.
*   Implement node authorization policies within Headscale to control what registered nodes can access.
*   Monitor for unexpected new node registrations in Headscale.

## Threat: [Headscale Database Compromise](./threats/headscale_database_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the database used by Headscale to store its configuration and state. This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities in how Headscale interacts with the database or through weak database credentials used by Headscale.

**Impact:**
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:**  The attacker could access sensitive information like node keys (even if encrypted), access control policies, and user details managed by Headscale.
*   **Data Tampering:** The attacker could modify database records to grant unauthorized access, revoke legitimate access, or disrupt network functionality managed by Headscale.
*   **Loss of Network Configuration:**  In a severe case, the attacker could delete or corrupt the database, leading to a loss of the Tailscale network configuration managed by Headscale.

**Affected Component:** Headscale Database (data storage layer accessed and managed by Headscale)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the database server with strong passwords and access controls, ensuring Headscale's access is also restricted.
*   Ensure the database software is up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements in Headscale's database interactions to prevent SQL injection attacks.
*   Encrypt sensitive data at rest within the database.
*   Regularly back up the Headscale database.

## Threat: [Exposure of Headscale Admin Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_headscale_admin_credentials.md)

**Description:** The administrative credentials for the Headscale web interface or API are exposed through phishing, social engineering, or insecure storage. This directly compromises the security of the Headscale application.

**Impact:**
*   **Full Control of Headscale:** An attacker with admin credentials can perform any action on the Headscale server, leading to the consequences outlined in the "Headscale Server Compromise" threat.

**Affected Component:** Headscale Admin Authentication Module

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for all Headscale admin accounts.
*   Educate users about phishing and social engineering attacks.
*   Securely store any administrative credentials if they need to be stored at all (preferably avoid storing them).
*   Regularly review and rotate Headscale admin credentials.
