# Deep Analysis: Pre-shared Keys (PSKs) and Node Approval in Headscale

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of the "Pre-shared Keys (PSKs) and Node Approval" mitigation strategy in Headscale.  This includes assessing its ability to prevent unauthorized node registration and mitigate man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks during the registration process.  We will also identify potential weaknesses, implementation gaps, and areas for improvement.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the described mitigation strategy *as implemented within Headscale itself*.  It does *not* cover:

*   Security of the underlying operating system or network infrastructure.
*   Security of the Tailscale control plane (if used in conjunction with Headscale).
*   Physical security of devices running Headscale or connecting to it.
*   Security of the method used to distribute PSKs (this is acknowledged as a critical external factor).
*   Other potential attack vectors against Headscale *after* a node has been successfully registered.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Review of Headscale Documentation and Code:** Examine the official Headscale documentation and relevant parts of the source code (from the provided GitHub repository) to understand the intended functionality and implementation details of PSKs and node approval.
2.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify specific attack scenarios related to unauthorized node registration and MITM attacks during registration.  Consider how an attacker might attempt to bypass the mitigation strategy.
3.  **Implementation Analysis:**  Evaluate the provided configuration example and CLI commands to determine if they align with best practices and effectively address the identified threats.
4.  **Gap Analysis:**  Identify any potential weaknesses or gaps in the mitigation strategy, considering both technical and procedural aspects.
5.  **Recommendations:**  Propose specific recommendations to strengthen the mitigation strategy and address any identified gaps.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Mitigation Strategy

### 2.1 Review of Headscale Documentation and Code (Brief Summary)

Headscale's design, as evident from its documentation and code, incorporates PSKs as a core mechanism for controlling node registration.  The `pre_auth_keys` section in `config.yaml` allows administrators to define keys with specific properties (reusability, expiration, associated user).  The CLI provides commands for listing and approving nodes, enabling manual verification.  The code enforces that a node must present a valid PSK before it can even attempt to register, and the server will not allow communication with unapproved nodes.

### 2.2 Threat Modeling

Let's consider some specific attack scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: Brute-Force PSK Guessing:** An attacker attempts to register a node by repeatedly trying different PSK values.
*   **Scenario 2: PSK Leakage:** An attacker obtains a valid PSK through social engineering, compromise of a user's device, or interception of insecure communication during PSK distribution.
*   **Scenario 3: Replay Attack (with Reusable PSK):** An attacker intercepts a legitimate node registration request (containing a reusable PSK) and replays it to register their own malicious node.
*   **Scenario 4: MITM during Registration:** An attacker intercepts the initial registration request, even with a valid PSK, and attempts to impersonate either the node or the Headscale server.
*   **Scenario 5: Bypassing Manual Approval:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Headscale server or CLI to approve a node without proper authorization.
*   **Scenario 6: Social Engineering of Administrator:** An attacker convinces the Headscale administrator to approve a malicious node through deception.

### 2.3 Implementation Analysis

The provided implementation steps are generally sound:

*   **`config.yaml` Configuration:** The example `pre_auth_keys` configuration demonstrates the correct way to define PSKs, including setting expiration times and associating them with users.  The use of `reusable: false` for one key is a good practice for one-time registrations.  `reusable: true` should be used with extreme caution and only when absolutely necessary.
*   **Strong PSK Generation:** The recommendation to use `openssl rand -base64 32` is excellent.  This generates a cryptographically secure 256-bit key (32 bytes encoded in Base64).
*   **Secure PSK Distribution:** The emphasis on secure distribution is crucial.  This is an external factor, but its importance cannot be overstated.
*   **Manual Node Approval:**  The use of `headscale nodes list` and `headscale nodes approve <node-id>` is the correct procedure for manual approval.  This is a critical step to prevent unauthorized nodes from joining the network.
*   **Out-of-Band Verification:** This is a vital procedural step.  It provides an independent confirmation of the node's identity, mitigating the risk of social engineering or compromised PSKs.

### 2.4 Gap Analysis

While the strategy is strong, there are potential gaps and areas for improvement:

*   **Rate Limiting (Brute-Force Protection):** Headscale should implement rate limiting on registration attempts.  This would prevent attackers from rapidly trying different PSKs.  Without rate limiting, a sufficiently motivated attacker could potentially brute-force a weaker PSK.
*   **Reusable PSK Risks:**  The use of `reusable: true` is inherently risky.  If a reusable PSK is compromised, it can be used to register multiple malicious nodes.  This should be avoided whenever possible.  If reusable keys *must* be used, they should have very short expiration times and be revoked immediately after use.
*   **PSK Revocation:**  Headscale should provide a mechanism to easily revoke PSKs.  If a PSK is suspected of being compromised, it should be immediately revoked to prevent further use.  This might involve deleting the key from `config.yaml` and restarting the Headscale service.
*   **Audit Logging:**  Headscale should log all registration attempts, including successful and failed attempts, along with the PSK used (or at least a hash of it) and the IP address of the requesting node.  This would aid in detecting and investigating potential attacks.
*   **Alerting:**  Headscale should provide alerting capabilities to notify administrators of suspicious activity, such as repeated failed registration attempts or the use of a revoked PSK.
*   **MITM Protection during Registration:** While PSKs help, they don't fully protect against MITM attacks *during* the registration process itself.  The underlying Tailscale protocol (using WireGuard) provides strong encryption, but the initial key exchange could still be vulnerable.  This is a more complex issue, and Headscale relies on Tailscale's security here.
*   **Node Identity Verification (Beyond PSK):**  The PSK only proves that the node possesses the key.  It doesn't guarantee the node's *identity* or *integrity*.  Stronger verification might involve checking a node's unique hardware identifier or requiring a certificate signed by a trusted authority.
* **Missing Implementation:** As mentioned in original document, if administrator will not configure `pre_auth_keys` or will not use manual approval, then mitigation strategy will not work.

### 2.5 Recommendations

1.  **Implement Rate Limiting:** Add rate limiting to Headscale's registration process to mitigate brute-force PSK guessing attacks.
2.  **Minimize/Avoid Reusable PSKs:**  Strongly discourage the use of `reusable: true`.  If unavoidable, use very short expiration times and immediate revocation.
3.  **Implement PSK Revocation:**  Provide a clear and easy mechanism to revoke PSKs.
4.  **Enhance Audit Logging:**  Log all registration attempts, including details like PSK (or hash), IP address, and success/failure status.
5.  **Implement Alerting:**  Add alerting for suspicious registration activity.
6.  **Consider Additional Node Identity Verification:** Explore options for verifying node identity beyond just the PSK, such as hardware identifiers or certificates.
7.  **Document Best Practices:**  Clearly document all recommended security practices, including secure PSK distribution, out-of-band verification, and the importance of manual approval.
8.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the Headscale code and configuration to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
9. **Enforce Configuration:** Add startup checks to Headscale that verify the presence and validity of the `pre_auth_keys` configuration.  If the configuration is missing or invalid, Headscale should refuse to start and log a clear error message.
10. **Automated Approval (Conditional):** While manual approval is generally recommended, consider providing an *option* for automated approval *only if* additional strong authentication factors are present (e.g., a valid client certificate *in addition to* the PSK). This should be clearly documented as a less secure option.
11. **Educate Administrators:** Provide clear and concise training materials for Headscale administrators, emphasizing the importance of following all security procedures.

## 3. Conclusion

The "Pre-shared Keys (PSKs) and Node Approval" mitigation strategy in Headscale is a strong foundation for securing node registration.  When implemented correctly, it significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized node registration and MITM attacks.  However, there are potential gaps, particularly related to brute-force attacks, reusable PSKs, and the need for robust logging and alerting.  By implementing the recommendations outlined above, the effectiveness of this mitigation strategy can be further enhanced, providing a more secure and resilient Headscale deployment. The most critical aspect is the *combination* of PSKs with *mandatory* manual approval and out-of-band verification.  Without these procedural steps, the technical controls are significantly weakened.
