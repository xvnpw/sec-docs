Okay, let's create a design document for the Headscale project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Headscale is an open-source implementation of the Tailscale control server. Tailscale is a commercial VPN service that emphasizes ease of use and secure connectivity using WireGuard. Headscale aims to provide a self-hostable, privacy-respecting alternative for users who want full control over their network coordination.

Business Priorities:

- Provide a stable and reliable alternative to the commercial Tailscale control server.
- Maintain feature parity with the essential functionalities of Tailscale's control server.
- Ensure the security and privacy of user networks.
- Foster a community-driven development model.
- Enable self-hosting for individuals and organizations.
- Minimize operational overhead for users.

Business Goals:

- Attract users who are looking for self-hosted VPN solutions.
- Grow a community of contributors to enhance and maintain the project.
- Establish Headscale as a trusted and respected project in the networking and security space.
- Provide a viable option for organizations that require strict data control and compliance.

Most Important Business Risks:

- Security vulnerabilities in Headscale could compromise the privacy and security of user networks, leading to data breaches and reputational damage.
- Lack of scalability could limit the adoption of Headscale by larger organizations.
- Inability to keep up with Tailscale's feature development could make Headscale less attractive to users.
- Insufficient community engagement could lead to project stagnation and abandonment.
- Legal challenges related to intellectual property or licensing could hinder the project's development and distribution.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

- security control: Uses WireGuard, a modern and secure VPN protocol, for data transport. (Described in WireGuard documentation and Headscale's code)
- security control: Implements mutual TLS (mTLS) for authentication between clients and the server. (Described in Headscale's code and configuration)
- security control: Go language, memory safe. (Described in Go language specification)
- security control: Uses gRPC for internal communication, which can be secured with TLS. (Described in Headscale's code and gRPC documentation)
- security control: Access control mechanisms to manage user and device permissions. (Described in Headscale's code and documentation)
- security control: Regular updates and security patches are released to address vulnerabilities. (Described in Headscale's GitHub repository and release notes)
- security control: Containerized deployment using Docker, which provides some level of isolation. (Described in Headscale's documentation and Dockerfile)
- security control: Support for HTTPS for the web UI and API. (Described in Headscale's configuration)

Accepted Risks:

- accepted risk: Relies on the security of the underlying operating system and infrastructure.
- accepted risk: The security of the WireGuard protocol itself is an assumption (though it is generally considered secure).
- accepted risk: User misconfiguration could lead to security vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Dependent on third-party libraries, which could introduce vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Single point of failure. Headscale is a central point of coordination, and its compromise would affect the entire network.

Recommended Security Controls:

- security control: Implement a robust auditing and logging system to track all administrative actions and network events.
- security control: Integrate with a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to securely store and manage sensitive information like API keys and certificates.
- security control: Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect the web UI and API from common web attacks.
- security control: Provide detailed security documentation and best practices for users to follow.
- security control: Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a potential breach.
- security control: Consider implementing a multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanism for administrative access.

Security Requirements:

- Authentication:
    - All clients and the server must mutually authenticate using strong cryptographic methods (mTLS with WireGuard keys).
    - Administrative access to the Headscale server should require strong authentication, potentially including MFA.
    - API access should be authenticated using API keys or other secure tokens.

- Authorization:
    - A robust access control system must be in place to manage which users and devices can connect to the network.
    - Granular permissions should be available to control access to specific resources and functionalities.
    - The principle of least privilege should be enforced.

- Input Validation:
    - All user-supplied input, including configuration parameters and API requests, must be strictly validated to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    - Data received from clients should be treated as untrusted and validated before processing.

- Cryptography:
    - WireGuard's built-in cryptography should be used for all data in transit.
    - TLS should be used to secure all communication between clients, the server, and any external services.
    - Strong cryptographic algorithms and key lengths should be used throughout the system.
    - Cryptographic keys should be managed securely, following best practices for key generation, storage, and rotation.
