# Attack Surface Analysis for juanfont/headscale

## Attack Surface: [Control Plane Network Exposure](./attack_surfaces/control_plane_network_exposure.md)

*Description:* The `headscale` server's listening network port is a direct target for network-based attacks.
*How Headscale Contributes:* `headscale` *requires* network accessibility to function; its core purpose is to manage a network. The listening port is inherently exposed.
*Example:* An attacker scans for open ports, identifies the `headscale` service, and launches a denial-of-service attack.
*Impact:* Denial of service for legitimate nodes; potential service information leakage.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Firewall:** Restrict access to the `headscale` port to authorized IPs/networks *only*.
    *   **Reverse Proxy:** Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy) for TLS termination, rate limiting, and request filtering. This adds a crucial layer of defense.
    *   **TLS Configuration:** Ensure strong TLS configurations on the reverse proxy (modern ciphers, HSTS).
    *   **Monitoring:** Implement network monitoring and IDS to detect suspicious traffic.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_weaknesses.md)

*Description:* Flaws in `headscale`'s authentication or authorization logic allow unauthorized network access or administrative control.
*How Headscale Contributes:* `headscale` *is* the authentication and authorization authority for the network. Vulnerabilities here directly compromise security.
*Example:* A bug allows bypassing authentication, letting an attacker register a rogue node and access the network. Or, a privilege escalation vulnerability grants administrative control to a regular user.
*Impact:* Unauthorized network access, data breaches, compromise of other nodes, complete `headscale` server control.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Use strong, rotated API keys. Avoid weak passwords.
    *   **Secure OIDC:** If using OIDC, ensure secure provider configuration and rigorous token validation.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on authentication attempts (API and OIDC).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Enforce minimal access rights. Carefully design ACLs.
    *   **Code Review:** Regularly review `headscale` code, focusing on authentication/authorization.
    *   **MFA:** Enforce multi-factor authentication for administrative access.

## Attack Surface: [Node Registration Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/node_registration_vulnerabilities.md)

*Description:* Weaknesses in the node registration process allow attackers to register malicious nodes or manipulate existing registrations.
*How Headscale Contributes:* `headscale` *manages* the entire node registration process. Vulnerabilities here directly impact the network's integrity.
*Example:* An attacker exploits a registration API vulnerability to register a node without a valid pre-shared key, gaining network access.
*Impact:* Unauthorized network access, potential man-in-the-middle attacks, service disruption.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Pre-Shared Keys:** Use PSKs or other strong authentication for node registration.
    *   **Input Validation:** Strictly validate all data received during registration.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit registration request rates to prevent flooding.
    *   **Registration Approval:** Consider a mechanism for approving new node registrations.

## Attack Surface: [API Endpoint Security](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoint_security.md)

*Description:* The `headscale` API, used for management, is a significant attack surface if unsecured.
*How Headscale Contributes:* The API is a *core component* of `headscale`, providing programmatic access to all management functions.
*Example:* An attacker finds an unauthenticated API endpoint that allows modifying ACLs, granting themselves access to sensitive resources. Or, a SQL injection vulnerability allows data extraction.
*Impact:* Unauthorized access, network configuration changes, data breaches, complete `headscale` server control.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Enforce strong authentication and authorization for *all* API access.
    *   **Input Validation:** Rigorous input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API requests.
    *   **API Security Testing:** Regularly perform penetration testing and fuzzing of the API.
    *   **Least Privilege (API Keys):** Scope API keys to the minimum necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*Description:* `headscale` relies on external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these can be exploited.
*How Headscale Contributes:* `headscale`'s security is *directly tied* to its dependencies. A dependency vulnerability is a `headscale` vulnerability.
*Example:* A vulnerability in a Go library used by `headscale` allows remote code execution.
*Impact:* Remote code execution, data breaches, complete server control.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (e.g., `go mod`).
    *   **Regular Updates:** Update dependencies to their latest secure versions.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use SCA tools to scan for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Pinning (with Caution):** Consider pinning, but balance with prompt security updates.
