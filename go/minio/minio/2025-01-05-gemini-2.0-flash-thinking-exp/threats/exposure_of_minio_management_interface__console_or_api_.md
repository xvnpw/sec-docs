        print("**Attack Vectors:**")
        print("* **Direct Internet Exposure:** The most straightforward vector where the MinIO instance is directly accessible on a public IP without proper protection.")
        print("* **Compromised Internal Network:** An attacker gaining access to the internal network where MinIO resides can exploit the lack of internal authentication.")
        print("* **Cloud Misconfigurations:** Incorrectly configured security groups or network access controls in cloud environments can expose the interfaces.")
        print("* **Supply Chain Attacks:** Compromised dependencies or tools used in deployment could potentially expose the interfaces during setup.")
        print("* **Credential Compromise:** Weak or default credentials (e.g., `minioadmin`/`minioadmin`) are a prime target.\n")

        print("**Technical Details of Exploitation:**")

        print("**Mitigation Strategies (Recommendations for Development Team):**")
        print("* **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the MinIO instance within a private network segment. Restrict access to the management ports (9001 and the API port) from the public internet.")
        print("* **Firewall Rules:** Implement strict firewall rules to allow access to the management interfaces only from trusted internal networks or specific authorized IPs.")

        print("    * **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Implement policies that require complex passwords and regular password changes for administrative users.")
        print("    * **Utilize MinIO's IAM (Identity and Access Management):** Leverage MinIO's built-in IAM features to create granular access control policies. Follow the principle of least privilege.")
        print("    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA for all administrative accounts to add an extra layer of security.")
        print("* **Secure API Key Management:** If using the administrative API programmatically, ensure API keys are securely stored (e.g., using a secrets manager) and rotated regularly. Avoid embedding keys in code.")
        print("* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in the MinIO setup and surrounding infrastructure.")
        print("* **Keep MinIO Up-to-Date:** Regularly update MinIO to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.")
        print("* **Monitoring and Logging:**")
        print("    * Enable comprehensive logging for all administrative actions and API calls.")
        print("    * Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts or unauthorized API calls.")
        print("* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that even internal systems or users have only the necessary permissions to interact with MinIO, minimizing the impact of a potential compromise elsewhere.\n")

        print("**Detection and Monitoring:**")
        print("* **Monitor Network Traffic:** Look for unusual traffic patterns to the management ports from unexpected sources.")
        print("* **Analyze Authentication Logs:** Track failed login attempts and successful logins from unfamiliar locations or at unusual times.")
        print("* **Monitor API Call Logs:**  Review API call logs for unauthorized actions or calls from suspicious sources.")
