# Threat Model Analysis for minio/minio

## Threat: [Use of Weak or Default Access Keys](./threats/use_of_weak_or_default_access_keys.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to guess or find default MinIO access keys (e.g., if they were not changed after installation). They could then use these keys to authenticate directly with the MinIO server and access resources.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to all data within MinIO, potential data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
    *   **Affected Component:** IAM (Authentication)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Overly Permissive Bucket Policies](./threats/overly_permissive_bucket_policies.md)

*   **Description:**  Misconfigured MinIO bucket policies can grant excessive permissions (e.g., `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, `s3:DeleteObject`) to unauthorized users or even the public. An attacker can directly exploit these policies to interact with the MinIO server and access, modify, or delete data they shouldn't have access to.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data tampering, data loss, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Bucket Policies (IAM)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Publicly Accessible Buckets due to Misconfiguration](./threats/publicly_accessible_buckets_due_to_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:**  MinIO bucket configurations might unintentionally allow public read access (or even write access). Attackers can then directly access the objects within that MinIO bucket without any authentication.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data stored in MinIO to the public internet, potential data breaches, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Bucket Policies (IAM)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Insufficient Encryption at Rest](./threats/insufficient_encryption_at_rest.md)

*   **Description:** If MinIO's server-side encryption is not enabled or configured correctly, data stored on the underlying storage managed by MinIO can be accessed if that storage is compromised.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches if the underlying storage managed by MinIO is accessed by unauthorized individuals.
    *   **Affected Component:** Server-Side Encryption Module
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Insufficient Encryption in Transit](./threats/insufficient_encryption_in_transit.md)

*   **Description:** If HTTPS is not enforced for communication with the MinIO server, data transmitted between clients (including the application) and MinIO can be intercepted and read by attackers performing man-in-the-middle attacks. This is a direct configuration concern of the MinIO server.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data during transmission to and from the MinIO server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Networking/API endpoints
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks against MinIO](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_against_minio.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could flood the MinIO server directly with a large number of requests, overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable.
    *   **Impact:** Application downtime, inability to access or store data in MinIO, disruption of services relying on MinIO.
    *   **Affected Component:** API endpoints, Request Handling Module
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Exploitation of MinIO API Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_minio_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities in MinIO's S3-compatible API could be directly exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code on the MinIO server, or cause other harm.
    *   **Impact:**  Wide range of potential impacts, including data breaches, service disruption, and complete compromise of the MinIO instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** API endpoints, various modules depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

## Threat: [Exposure of MinIO Management Interface (Console or API)](./threats/exposure_of_minio_management_interface__console_or_api_.md)

*   **Description:** If the MinIO Console or administrative API endpoints are directly exposed to the internet without proper authentication and authorization, attackers can gain administrative control over the MinIO instance.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the MinIO instance, including access to all data, ability to modify configurations, and potential to disrupt service.
    *   **Affected Component:** MinIO Console, Administrative API endpoints
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Insecure Network Configuration](./threats/insecure_network_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  If the network on which the MinIO server is running is not properly secured (e.g., open ports, lack of firewall rules), attackers might be able to directly access the MinIO server and its services.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to MinIO, potential exploitation of vulnerabilities within MinIO, denial of service against MinIO.
    *   **Affected Component:** Networking infrastructure (impacting MinIO)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
