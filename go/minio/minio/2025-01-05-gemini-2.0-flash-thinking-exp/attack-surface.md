# Attack Surface Analysis for minio/minio

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Access/Secret Keys](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_accesssecret_keys.md)

*   **Description:**  MinIO relies on access and secret keys for authentication. Using default or easily guessable keys allows unauthorized access.
*   **How MinIO Contributes:** MinIO's authentication mechanism is directly tied to these keys. Default keys are often provided for initial setup.
*   **Example:** An administrator deploys MinIO and forgets to change the default `minioadmin:minioadmin` credentials. An attacker finds these credentials online and gains full access to the storage.
*   **Impact:** Critical data breach, unauthorized data manipulation, service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Immediately change default access and secret keys during initial setup.
    *   Enforce strong password policies for MinIO users.
    *   Regularly rotate access and secret keys.
    *   Store keys securely (e.g., using secrets management tools).

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive IAM Policies](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_iam_policies.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies can grant excessive privileges to users or roles.
*   **How MinIO Contributes:** MinIO's built-in IAM system allows defining granular access control. Misconfiguration directly leads to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A policy grants `s3:GetObject` and `s3:PutObject` permissions on a sensitive bucket to a user who only needs read access to a specific prefix. This user's account is compromised, and the attacker can now upload malicious files.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, potential privilege escalation within the MinIO environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining IAM policies.
    *   Regularly review and audit IAM policies to ensure they are still appropriate.
    *   Use specific resource ARNs in policies to limit access to only necessary buckets and objects.
    *   Utilize conditions in IAM policies for more fine-grained control (e.g., based on IP address).

## Attack Surface: [Exploitable MinIO API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitable_minio_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Bugs or flaws in MinIO's S3-compatible API implementation can be exploited by sending specially crafted requests.
*   **How MinIO Contributes:** MinIO exposes an API for interacting with the storage. Vulnerabilities within this API are inherent to MinIO.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific version of MinIO allows an attacker to bypass authentication checks by sending a malformed request, granting them unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, this can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service, or even remote code execution on the MinIO server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep MinIO updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for MinIO to stay informed about new threats.
    *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious requests before they reach MinIO.
    *   Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing of the MinIO deployment.

## Attack Surface: [Publicly Accessible Buckets](./attack_surfaces/publicly_accessible_buckets.md)

*   **Description:**  Misconfigured bucket policies can allow anonymous access to read, write, or list objects within a bucket.
*   **How MinIO Contributes:** MinIO's bucket policy configuration directly controls public access.
*   **Example:** A developer accidentally sets a bucket policy allowing public read access to a bucket containing sensitive customer data. This data is now exposed to anyone on the internet.
*   **Impact:**  Data breach, exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly review and audit bucket policies to ensure they are not overly permissive.
    *   Explicitly block public access unless absolutely necessary and with careful consideration.
    *   Utilize bucket encryption to protect data even if access controls are misconfigured.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Server-Side Encryption](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_server-side_encryption.md)

*   **Description:** If server-side encryption is not enabled or consistently applied, data at rest is vulnerable to unauthorized access if the underlying storage is compromised.
*   **How MinIO Contributes:** MinIO offers server-side encryption options. The choice and implementation of encryption are within MinIO's configuration.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized physical access to the storage disks where MinIO data is stored. Without server-side encryption, the attacker can directly access the unencrypted object data.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable server-side encryption for all buckets containing sensitive data.
    *   Choose a strong encryption algorithm and manage encryption keys securely.
    *   Enforce encryption at the bucket level to prevent accidental uploads of unencrypted data.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in MinIO Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_minio_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** MinIO relies on various underlying libraries and components. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect MinIO's security.
*   **How MinIO Contributes:** MinIO's functionality depends on these external libraries.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a widely used Go library that MinIO depends on. Attackers could potentially exploit this vulnerability through MinIO.
*   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the dependency vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the specific dependency vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep MinIO updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for dependency vulnerabilities.
    *   Regularly scan MinIO's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
    *   Monitor security advisories for the libraries MinIO uses.
