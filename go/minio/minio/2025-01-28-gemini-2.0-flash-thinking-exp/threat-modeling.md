# Threat Model Analysis for minio/minio

## Threat: [Weak or Default Access Keys and Secret Keys](./threats/weak_or_default_access_keys_and_secret_keys.md)

*   **Threat:** Weak or Default Access Keys and Secret Keys
    *   **Description:** An attacker might attempt to guess or find default access keys and secret keys that were not changed from initial setup or are easily predictable. They could use brute-force attacks or search for exposed configuration files.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to MinIO buckets and objects. This can lead to data breaches, data manipulation (uploading malicious files, deleting data), or denial of service (deleting critical data).
    *   **MinIO Component Affected:** Authentication Module, API Endpoints
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Generate strong, random access keys and secret keys during MinIO setup.
        *   Never use default keys in production environments.
        *   Implement regular key rotation policies.

## Threat: [Insecure Key Management](./threats/insecure_key_management.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Key Management
    *   **Description:** An attacker who gains access to application code, configuration files, or environment variables where MinIO access keys and secret keys are stored insecurely (e.g., plain text, easily decrypted) can extract these credentials.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of credentials leading to unauthorized access to MinIO buckets and objects. This can result in data breaches, data modification, or data deletion.
    *   **MinIO Component Affected:** Authentication Module, Configuration Management
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize dedicated secrets management services (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   Store keys in environment variables with restricted access at the operating system level.
        *   Encrypt configuration files containing credentials.
        *   Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in application code.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive Bucket Policies](./threats/overly_permissive_bucket_policies.md)

*   **Threat:** Overly Permissive Bucket Policies
    *   **Description:**  An attacker, either internal or external (if they gain some level of access), could exploit overly permissive bucket policies that grant more access than necessary. For example, a policy allowing public write access or granting `s3:GetObject` to everyone when it's not needed.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. Potential for data breaches if sensitive data is exposed. Data integrity issues if data is modified maliciously.
    *   **MinIO Component Affected:** Authorization Module, Bucket Policy Engine
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege when defining bucket policies.
        *   Carefully review and test bucket policies before deployment.
        *   Regularly audit bucket policies to ensure they remain appropriate.

## Threat: [Lack of Proper Access Control Lists (ACLs) or Bucket Policies Enforcement](./threats/lack_of_proper_access_control_lists__acls__or_bucket_policies_enforcement.md)

*   **Threat:** Lack of Proper ACLs or Bucket Policies Enforcement
    *   **Description:**  Due to misconfiguration or software bugs, ACLs or bucket policies might not be correctly enforced by MinIO. This could lead to unintended access levels, potentially making buckets publicly accessible or granting incorrect permissions to users.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, potential data breaches, and data manipulation. Data leakage if sensitive information becomes publicly accessible.
    *   **MinIO Component Affected:** Authorization Module, ACL Enforcement, Bucket Policy Engine
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly configure and test ACLs and bucket policies.
        *   Regularly audit access control configurations to ensure they are correctly applied.
        *   Keep MinIO server software updated to patch potential bugs related to policy enforcement.

## Threat: [Data Breaches due to Unauthorized Access](./threats/data_breaches_due_to_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Breaches due to Unauthorized Access
    *   **Description:** Exploitation of any of the authentication and authorization vulnerabilities listed above (weak keys, insecure key management, permissive policies, etc.) leading to an attacker gaining unauthorized access to MinIO and exfiltrating sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, reputational damage, regulatory fines (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.), legal liabilities, loss of customer trust.
    *   **MinIO Component Affected:** Entire MinIO system, Storage Backend, API Endpoints

## Threat: [Data at Rest Encryption Misconfiguration](./threats/data_at_rest_encryption_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Threat:** Data at Rest Encryption Misconfiguration
    *   **Description:**  Server-side encryption (SSE) for data at rest is either not enabled for MinIO buckets storing sensitive data, or it is misconfigured (e.g., using weak encryption algorithms, insecure key management for encryption keys). If physical storage is compromised, data is exposed.
    *   **Impact:** If storage media (disks, etc.) is physically compromised or stolen, data at rest can be accessed without encryption, leading to a data breach.
    *   **MinIO Component Affected:** Storage Backend, Encryption Module (SSE)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable server-side encryption (SSE) for all buckets containing sensitive data.
        *   Choose strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
        *   Manage encryption keys securely, preferably using external key management systems (KMS).

## Threat: [Data in Transit Encryption Misconfiguration](./threats/data_in_transit_encryption_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Threat:** Data in Transit Encryption Misconfiguration
