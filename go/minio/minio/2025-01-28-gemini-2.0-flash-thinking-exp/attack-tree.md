## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit MinIO Configuration Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_minio_configuration_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Targeting common misconfigurations in MinIO deployments that weaken security.
    * **Breakdown:**
        * **Default Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            - **Find Default Credentials (e.g., `minioadmin:minioadmin`):**
                - **Vector:**  Attempting to use well-known default credentials for MinIO administrative access. These are often publicly documented.
            - **Access MinIO Console/API with Default Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                - **Vector:**  Using the found default credentials to log in to the MinIO web console or authenticate against the MinIO API (S3 compatible).
        * **Insecure Network Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            - **MinIO Exposed to Public Internet without proper firewall [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                - **Vector:**  Deploying MinIO instances directly accessible from the public internet without network-level access controls (firewalls, network segmentation).
            - **Exploit Publicly Accessible MinIO Instance [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                - **Vector:**  Attacking a publicly exposed MinIO instance to exploit any configuration weaknesses or vulnerabilities.
        * **Insufficient Access Control Policies [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            - **Weak or overly permissive bucket policies [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                - **Vector:**  Configuring MinIO bucket policies that grant excessive permissions to users or roles, allowing unintended access to sensitive data.
            - **Exploit Weak Policies to Access Restricted Buckets/Objects [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                - **Vector:**  Leveraging overly permissive policies to gain access to buckets and objects that should be restricted based on the principle of least privilege.
        * **Lack of HTTPS/TLS Enforcement [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            - **MinIO configured to use HTTP instead of HTTPS [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                - **Vector:**  Setting up MinIO to communicate over unencrypted HTTP instead of secure HTTPS/TLS.
            - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack to Intercept Credentials/Data [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                - **Vector:**  Performing a Man-in-the-Middle attack on the network path between a client and the MinIO server when HTTP is used.
            - **Capture Access Keys/Secret Keys [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                - **Vector:**  Sniffing network traffic during a MitM attack to capture MinIO access keys and secret keys transmitted in plaintext over HTTP.
            - **Access MinIO API with Stolen Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                - **Vector:**  Using the captured access keys and secret keys to authenticate against the MinIO API and gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Buckets/Objects [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_bucketsobjects__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Achieving unauthorized access to data stored in MinIO buckets, regardless of the initial method of compromise. This is the central goal of most attacks against MinIO.
    * **Breakdown:**
        * **Read Sensitive Data [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            - **Vector:**  Once unauthorized access is gained, reading and downloading sensitive objects stored in MinIO buckets, leading to confidentiality breaches.
        * **Modify Data (Integrity Compromise) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            - **Vector:**  Modifying or tampering with data stored in MinIO buckets, leading to data corruption, application malfunction, or supply chain attacks if the data is used by other systems.
        * **Delete Data (Availability Impact) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            - **Vector:**  Deleting objects or entire buckets in MinIO, causing data loss, application downtime, and business disruption.

**Attack Vector:**  Actions taken by an attacker *after* gaining unauthorized access to MinIO, focusing on the impact on data.
    * **Breakdown:**

                - **Vector:**  Achieving initial unauthorized access through any of the configuration weaknesses or other attack paths.
            - **Exfiltrate sensitive data stored in MinIO [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                - **Vector:**  Transferring sensitive data from compromised MinIO buckets to an attacker-controlled location, resulting in a data breach.
                - **Result:** Data Breach, Confidentiality Compromise [HIGH RISK PATH]
        * **Data Manipulation/Tampering [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            - **Gain unauthorized access to buckets/objects (via any of the above methods) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                - **Vector:**  Achieving initial unauthorized access.
            - **Modify or tamper with data stored in MinIO [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                - **Vector:**  Altering data within MinIO buckets, potentially injecting malicious content, corrupting data, or manipulating application logic that relies on this data.
                - **Result:** Application Integrity Compromise, Data Corruption [HIGH RISK PATH]
