# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for minio/minio

## Mitigation Strategy: [Change Default Access Credentials](./mitigation_strategies/change_default_access_credentials.md)

**Description:**
    1.  Modify the `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY` and `MINIO_SECRET_KEY` environment variables or configuration settings used to start the Minio server.
    2.  Generate strong, unique credentials instead of using the default `minioadmin:minioadmin`. Use a password manager or a secure random generator to create keys with sufficient length and complexity.
    3.  Restart the Minio server for the new credentials to be applied.
    4.  Update any applications, scripts, or tools that interact with Minio to use these new access keys.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity) - Exploitation of default Minio credentials grants immediate administrative access to the Minio instance.

**Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access: High Risk Reduction - Eliminates the risk of trivial exploitation via well-known default Minio credentials.

**Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, implemented in production and staging Minio deployments using environment variables managed by a secrets system.

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   Enforcement in local development environments is inconsistent. Developers might still use default credentials for local Minio instances.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Access Control Policies (IAM and Bucket Policies)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_access_control_policies__iam_and_bucket_policies_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  Define granular access control using Minio's IAM policies for user and group permissions and Bucket Policies for bucket-level access control.
    2.  Create specific Minio users and groups for different applications or roles instead of relying on the root user.
    3.  Craft Bucket Policies to restrict access based on users, groups, actions, and resources within specific buckets.
    4.  Avoid overly broad policies using wildcards (`*`) unless absolutely necessary. Be specific with allowed actions and resources in Minio policies.
    5.  Regularly review and update Minio IAM and Bucket Policies as application needs evolve.
    6.  Test Minio policies to ensure they function as intended and don't grant unintended permissions.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity) -  Permissive Minio policies can lead to unauthorized access to data and Minio functionalities.
    *   Data Breach (High Severity) -  Weak Minio access control can enable attackers to access sensitive data stored in Minio.
    *   Data Manipulation/Deletion (Medium Severity) -  Insufficient Minio access control can allow unauthorized modification or deletion of data within Minio.

**Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access: High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces unauthorized access by enforcing granular Minio permissions.
    *   Data Breach: High Risk Reduction - Minimizes data breach potential by limiting access within Minio to authorized entities.
    *   Data Manipulation/Deletion: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces unauthorized data changes by controlling write and delete permissions in Minio.

**Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. IAM is used for user separation. Bucket policies are used for some critical buckets but not universally applied in Minio.

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent application of Bucket Policies across all Minio buckets, especially those with sensitive data.  Need a more systematic approach to Minio policy management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Rotate Access Keys](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_rotate_access_keys.md)

    1.  Establish a policy for periodic rotation of Minio access keys and secret keys.
    2.  Automate the Minio key rotation process, ideally integrated with a secrets management system.
    3.  The Minio rotation process should include: generating new Minio keys, updating applications to use the new keys, and deactivating old Minio keys after a grace period.
    4.  Ensure the Minio key rotation is seamless and doesn't disrupt services relying on Minio.
    5.  Log and monitor Minio key rotation events for auditing.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Compromised Credentials (Medium Severity) - Limits the lifespan and impact of compromised Minio access keys.

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automation of Minio key rotation is needed. Integration with secrets management for automated Minio key lifecycle management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS for All Access](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_https_for_all_access.md)

**Description:**

    2.  Ensure all clients (applications, `mc` tool, Minio Console) connect to Minio using `https://`.
    3.  Configure network infrastructure (firewall, load balancer) to redirect or block HTTP access to Minio, enforcing HTTPS only.
    4.  Automate TLS certificate renewal for Minio to maintain continuous HTTPS encryption.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity) - Protects Minio communication from eavesdropping by encrypting traffic with HTTPS.
    *   Credential Theft (High Severity) - Prevents interception of Minio credentials transmitted over the network by using HTTPS.

**Description:**
    1.  Enable Object Versioning for Minio buckets requiring data integrity and recovery.
    2.  Enable Object Locking for Minio buckets needing data immutability and deletion protection. Choose Governance or Compliance lock modes in Minio.
    3.  For Governance locking, define IAM policies to control who can bypass Minio locks.
    4.  Understand Compliance locking in Minio is immutable and cannot be bypassed, even by root users, once applied.
    5.  Educate users on using Minio object locking and versioning features effectively.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
