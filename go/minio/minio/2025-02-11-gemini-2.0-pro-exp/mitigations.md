# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for minio/minio

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) for Minio Policies](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege__polp__for_minio_policies.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) for Minio Policies**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Roles:** Define distinct roles for users and applications accessing Minio (e.g., "read-only-user," "data-uploader," "admin").
    2.  **Analyze Needs:** For each role, meticulously analyze the *minimum* required actions on specific buckets and objects.  Avoid broad permissions.
    3.  **Craft Policies:** Create individual Minio policies for each role.  Use specific actions (e.g., `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, `s3:ListBucket`, `s3:DeleteObject`) instead of wildcards (`*`).  Specify resource ARNs (Amazon Resource Names) to limit access to specific buckets or prefixes within buckets.  Example:
        ```json
        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
              ],
              "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/data/reports/*"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
    4.  **Assign Policies:** Assign the appropriate policy to each user, group, or IAM role.
    5.  **Regular Review:** Schedule regular reviews (e.g., quarterly) of all policies to ensure they remain aligned with the principle of least privilege.  Remove or modify policies as roles and needs change.
    6.  **Use Policy Simulator:** Before applying a policy in production, use Minio's built-in policy simulation features (or equivalent tools) to test its effects and ensure it doesn't grant unintended access.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Prevents users/applications from accessing data they shouldn't.
    *   **Data Tampering (High Severity):** Limits the ability of users/applications to modify or delete data they shouldn't.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of a compromised user/application gaining broader access.
    *   **Insider Threats (High Severity):** Mitigates the damage a malicious insider with limited access can cause.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., from high to low).
    *   **Data Tampering:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., from high to low).
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., from high to medium).
    *   **Insider Threats:** Risk reduced, but not eliminated (e.g., from high to medium).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Basic policies are in place, but they are not granular enough and use wildcards in some places.  Policies are defined in the `minio-policies.json` file.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No regular policy review process is in place.
    *   Policy simulation is not consistently used before deployment.
    *   Policies for some newer applications are overly permissive.  Need to review policies for the `data-processing-service` and `reporting-tool`.
    *   Lack of specific policies for different data sensitivity levels within buckets.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Object Locking (WORM)](./mitigation_strategies/object_locking__worm_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Object Locking (WORM)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine Retention Needs:** Identify the required retention period for data based on legal, regulatory, and business requirements.
    2.  **Choose Locking Mode:** Select either *governance* or *compliance* mode within Minio.  *Compliance* mode is stricter and cannot be bypassed, even by the root user.  *Governance* mode allows privileged users to override the lock.
    3.  **Enable Object Locking:** Enable object locking at the bucket level *during bucket creation*.  *Object locking cannot be enabled on existing buckets.*
    4.  **Set Default Retention (Optional):** Configure a default retention period for the bucket within Minio.  This will apply to all objects unless overridden at the object level.
    5.  **Object-Level Retention (Optional):**  When uploading objects, specify a retention period and mode for individual objects using Minio's API or client libraries if they differ from the bucket default.
    6.  **Test and Validate:** Thoroughly test the object locking configuration to ensure it behaves as expected.  Attempt to delete or modify locked objects via the Minio console or API to verify the protection.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Tampering (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized modification or deletion of objects.
    *   **Accidental Deletion (High Severity):** Protects against accidental deletion by users or applications.
    *   **Ransomware Attacks (High Severity):** Makes it much harder for ransomware to encrypt or delete data.
    *   **Compliance Violations (High Severity):** Helps meet regulatory requirements for data retention and immutability (e.g., SEC 17a-4(f)).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Tampering:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., from high to low).
    *   **Accidental Deletion:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., from high to low).
    *   **Ransomware Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., from high to medium).
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., from high to low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Object locking is not enabled on any buckets.  This is a critical missing control.  New buckets with object locking enabled need to be created, and data migrated.  The `compliance-data` bucket should be prioritized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Server-Side Encryption (SSE)](./mitigation_strategies/server-side_encryption__sse_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Server-Side Encryption (SSE)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Encryption Type:** Select an SSE option within Minio:
        *   **SSE-S3:** Minio manages the encryption keys.
        *   **SSE-KMS:** Use a Key Management Service (e.g., AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault) to manage the encryption keys.  This provides stronger security and auditability. Configure Minio to use the KMS key ID.
        *   **SSE-C:** The client provides the encryption key.  This requires careful key management on the client-side and integration with Minio's API.
    2.  **Configure Encryption:** Enable SSE at the bucket level (default encryption) via Minio's configuration or specify it during object upload using Minio's API or client libraries.
    3.  **KMS Integration (if using SSE-KMS):**
        *   Create a KMS key.
        *   Grant Minio the necessary permissions to use the KMS key for encryption and decryption (typically through IAM roles).
        *   Configure Minio to use the KMS key ID.
    4.  **Test Encryption:** Upload and download objects via Minio to verify that encryption and decryption are working correctly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Protects data at rest if the underlying storage is compromised.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Even if an attacker gains access to the storage, they cannot read the data without the encryption keys.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Medium Severity):** Helps meet compliance requirements for data encryption at rest.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., from high to low).
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., from high to low).
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Risk reduced (e.g., from medium to low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. SSE-S3 is enabled on some buckets via Minio's configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   SSE-KMS is not used.  This should be implemented for buckets containing sensitive data.  The `sensitive-data` and `compliance-data` buckets should be prioritized. Minio needs to be configured to integrate with the KMS.
    *   Not all buckets have SSE enabled.  A review is needed to ensure all buckets have appropriate encryption configured within Minio.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minio Quotas](./mitigation_strategies/minio_quotas.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Minio Quotas (if supported)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Check Minio Version:** Verify if the deployed Minio version supports resource quotas.
    2.  **Identify Bottlenecks:** Monitor Minio's performance to identify potential bottlenecks (e.g., storage, bandwidth).
    3. **Configure Quotas:** If supported, use Minio's configuration (e.g., environment variables or configuration files) to set limits on:
        *   Storage usage per user or tenant.
        *   Bandwidth usage per user or tenant.
    4.  **Monitor and Adjust:** Continuously monitor the effectiveness of quotas. Adjust the limits as needed based on observed usage patterns.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Helps prevent attackers from overwhelming Minio by consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Prevents a single user or application from consuming excessive resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced (e.g., from medium to low).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced (e.g., from medium to low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Minio-specific resource quotas are not configured.  This needs to be investigated and implemented if the Minio version supports it.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Audit Logging](./mitigation_strategies/audit_logging.md)

**5. Mitigation Strategy: Audit Logging**

* **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Audit Logging:** Enable Minio's built-in audit logging feature. This records all API calls made to Minio.
    2.  **Configure Log Format:** Choose a suitable log format (e.g., JSON) within Minio's configuration for easy parsing.
    3.  **Log Destination:** Configure Minio to send audit logs to a secure location. This could be a local file (for short-term storage) or, ideally, a remote logging server or SIEM system (configured separately, but Minio needs to be pointed to it).
    4.  **Log Retention:** Define a log retention policy.
    5. **Review and Analysis:** (While log analysis itself isn't *within* Minio, the *generation* of the logs is.)

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Provides evidence of unauthorized access attempts.
    *   **Data Tampering (High Severity):** Helps identify who modified or deleted data.
    *   **Insider Threats (High Severity):** Provides an audit trail of user activity.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Medium Severity):** Helps demonstrate compliance with audit logging requirements.
    *   **Incident Response (High Severity):** Provides crucial information for investigating security incidents.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Detection improved, response time reduced.
    *   **Data Tampering:** Detection improved, attribution possible.
    *   **Insider Threats:** Deterrent effect, improved detection.
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Incident Response:** Significantly improved.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Minio audit logging is enabled, and logs are written to a local file on the Minio server.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Logs are not forwarded to a centralized logging system. Minio needs to be configured to send logs to the ELK stack.
