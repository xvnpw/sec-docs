## BUILD

MinIO's build process is primarily managed through Makefiles and shell scripts, leveraging Go's build system. The process involves compiling the source code, running tests, and creating release artifacts. GitHub Actions are used for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer("Developer") --> GitHub("GitHub Repository")
    GitHub --> GitHubActions("GitHub Actions")
    GitHubActions --> Build("Build & Test (Go)")
    Build --> Tests("Run Tests")
    Tests -- Success --> Artifacts("Create Artifacts (Binaries, Docker Images)")
    Artifacts --> Publish("Publish (GitHub Releases, Docker Hub)")

    classDef element fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    class Developer,GitHub,GitHubActions,Build,Tests,Artifacts,Publish element
```

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Code Review: All code changes are reviewed before being merged into the main branch.
*   security control: Static Analysis: Go's built-in tooling and linters (e.g., go vet, golangci-lint) are used to identify potential code quality and security issues.
*   security control: Dependency Management: Go modules are used to manage dependencies, and dependency scanning tools can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   security control: Automated Testing: Unit tests and integration tests are run as part of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   security control: Signed Releases: Release artifacts are likely signed to ensure their integrity and authenticity (though this needs confirmation from MinIO's documentation).
*   security control: Container Image Scanning: If Docker images are built, they should be scanned for vulnerabilities before being published.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   Data Storage and Retrieval: Ensuring the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of data stored in MinIO.
*   User Authentication and Authorization: Protecting against unauthorized access to data and administrative functions.
*   System Administration: Securely managing and maintaining the MinIO deployment.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   User Data: This includes any data stored by users in MinIO, which can range from personal files to sensitive business data. Sensitivity varies greatly depending on the user and use case.
*   Metadata: Information about objects, buckets, and users. Sensitivity is moderate, as it can reveal information about the structure and content of user data.
*   Credentials and Secrets: Usernames, passwords, access keys, and encryption keys. Sensitivity is very high.
*   Audit Logs: Records of access and operations performed on MinIO. Sensitivity is moderate to high, as it can contain sensitive information about user activity.
*   Configuration Data: Settings and parameters that control the behavior of MinIO. Sensitivity is moderate, as misconfiguration can lead to security vulnerabilities.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) must the MinIO deployment adhere to?
*   What is the expected scale of the deployment (number of users, amount of data, request rate)?
*   What are the specific threat models or attack scenarios that are of greatest concern?
*   What is the existing infrastructure and security tooling available?
*   Are there any specific performance or latency requirements?
*   What level of support and maintenance is required?
*   What is the process for handling security incidents and vulnerabilities?
*   Is there a formal process for signing release artifacts?
*   What are the specific procedures for vulnerability scanning of dependencies and container images?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The organization deploying MinIO has a moderate to high risk appetite, as they are choosing to self-host rather than use a managed cloud service. They prioritize data control and cost savings over the convenience of a managed service.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The organization has a basic understanding of security principles and is willing to invest in security measures. They have some existing security infrastructure, but it may not be fully comprehensive.
*   DESIGN: The deployment will be on Kubernetes. The organization has experience with Kubernetes and containerization. The initial deployment will be relatively small, but with the potential to scale significantly.
