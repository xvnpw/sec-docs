# Threat Model Analysis for minio/minio

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access (Bucket Policy Bypass)](./threats/unauthorized_data_access__bucket_policy_bypass_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts specific requests or exploits misconfigurations in bucket policies or IAM roles to gain unauthorized read access to objects within a MinIO bucket, bypassing intended access controls. They might try different combinations of prefixes, actions, or resource specifications to find loopholes.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach. Sensitive data is exposed to unauthorized parties, potentially leading to data leakage, regulatory violations, and reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** MinIO Policy Engine (specifically, the evaluation logic for bucket policies and IAM policies). This affects the core authorization mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Least Privilege:** Implement the principle of least privilege meticulously. Grant only the absolute minimum necessary permissions. Avoid wildcard permissions (`*`).
    *   **Regular Policy Audits:** Conduct frequent and thorough audits of all bucket policies and IAM roles. Use automated tools.
    *   **Policy Testing:** Thoroughly test all bucket policies and IAM roles using a variety of valid and invalid requests. Use MinIO's policy simulator.
    *   **Explicit Deny Rules:** Use explicit "Deny" rules in policies to override any potentially conflicting "Allow" rules.
    *   **Condition Keys:** Utilize condition keys (e.g., `aws:SourceIp`, `aws:UserAgent`) in policies to restrict access.

## Threat: [Data Tampering (Insufficient Write Protection)](./threats/data_tampering__insufficient_write_protection_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized write access to a MinIO bucket and modifies or deletes existing objects. This could involve uploading malicious files, overwriting legitimate data, or deleting critical information. The attacker might exploit weak credentials or misconfigured policies.
*   **Impact:** Integrity violation. Data is corrupted or lost, leading to operational disruptions, data integrity issues, and potential legal or financial consequences.
*   **Affected Component:** MinIO Policy Engine (authorization for write operations), Object Storage API (PUT, DELETE operations).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Enforce strong authentication (unique, complex keys) and strict authorization (least privilege) for write operations.
    *   **Object Locking (WORM):** For critical data, enable object locking (Write-Once-Read-Many) to prevent modification or deletion.
    *   **Versioning:** Enable versioning to allow recovery from accidental or malicious modifications or deletions. Regularly review and manage versions.
    *   **Regular Backups:** Maintain regular backups of data stored in MinIO to a separate, secure location.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion)](./threats/denial_of_service__resource_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the MinIO server with requests (object uploads, downloads, list operations) or uploads excessively large files, consuming server resources (CPU, memory, network, storage) and making the service unavailable.
*   **Impact:** Availability disruption. The MinIO service becomes unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from accessing data and disrupting application functionality.
*   **Affected Component:** MinIO Server (all components, including the Object Storage API, network handling, and storage backend).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at the API level.
    *   **Resource Quotas:** Configure resource quotas (storage, bandwidth) for users and buckets.
    *   **Distributed Deployment:** Deploy MinIO in a distributed mode with multiple servers and a load balancer.
    *   **Network Security:** Use a firewall and intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS).
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement comprehensive monitoring of server resources and set up alerts.

## Threat: [Credential Compromise (Key Exposure)](./threats/credential_compromise__key_exposure_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains MinIO access keys and secret keys through various means (phishing, code leaks, compromised workstations, insecure storage).
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability compromise. The attacker gains full control over the compromised account.
*   **Affected Component:** MinIO Authentication System (access key and secret key validation).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Credential Storage:** Never hardcode credentials. Use environment variables, a secure secrets management solution, or an IAM role.
    *   **Regular Key Rotation:** Rotate access keys and secret keys regularly.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (Indirectly):** Integrate with an identity provider (IdP) that supports MFA and use federated identity.
    *   **Access Key Monitoring:** Monitor for unusual activity associated with access keys.
    *   **Employee Training:** Train employees on security best practices.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `mc mirror` or Webhooks](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via__mc_mirror__or_webhooks.md)

*   **Description:** If MinIO's `mc mirror` command or webhook functionality is misconfigured or vulnerable, an attacker could use it to make requests to internal or external resources that MinIO shouldn't be accessing.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality and Integrity compromise. The attacker could potentially access internal resources, exfiltrate data, or modify internal systems.
*   **Affected Component:** `mc mirror` command (URL parsing and request handling), MinIO Webhook functionality (if implemented and exposed).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Strictly validate all URLs provided to `mc mirror` or configured for webhooks. Use a whitelist.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the MinIO server within a network segment with limited access to internal resources.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable `mc mirror` or webhooks if they are not required.
    *   **Least Privilege (Network):** Ensure the MinIO server has only the necessary network access.

## Threat: [Exploitation of MinIO Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_minio_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability in the MinIO software itself to gain unauthorized access, modify data, or disrupt service.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability compromise. The impact depends on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Affected Component:** Potentially any component of the MinIO server, depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep MinIO Updated:** Regularly update MinIO to the latest version. Subscribe to MinIO's security announcements.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the MinIO server for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider using a WAF in front of MinIO.
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):** Deploy an IDS/IPS.

## Threat: [Unencrypted Data at Rest](./threats/unencrypted_data_at_rest.md)

*   **Description:** Data stored in MinIO buckets is not encrypted at rest, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access if the underlying storage is compromised.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach. Sensitive data is exposed if the storage infrastructure is compromised.
*   **Affected Component:** MinIO's data storage layer (interaction with the underlying storage backend).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Encryption (SSE):**  Enable server-side encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C).  SSE-KMS provides the strongest protection.
    *   **Disk Encryption:**  Encrypt the underlying storage volumes used by MinIO.
