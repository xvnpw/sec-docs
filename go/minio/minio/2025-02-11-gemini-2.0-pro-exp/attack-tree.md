## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Policy Misconfig [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_policy_misconfig__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a critical node representing the overarching problem of incorrectly configured access policies in MinIO. It's the foundation for several high-risk attack paths.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement the Principle of Least Privilege (POLP).
    *   Use IAM roles and policies instead of broad permissions.
    *   Regularly audit and review bucket policies.
    *   Use policy simulators and validators.
    *   Avoid wildcard permissions (`*`).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Overly Permissive Bucket Policy [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_overly_permissive_bucket_policy__cn___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most common and dangerous vulnerability. The bucket policy grants excessive permissions, often allowing public read or even write access to anonymous users.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker simply needs to discover the bucket URL (which can be done through various means, including misconfigured web applications, exposed logs, or even search engines). They can then directly access the data without needing any credentials.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Complete data exposure or modification.)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Explicitly deny public access unless absolutely necessary.
    *   Use specific `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, `s3:DeleteObject` permissions, tied to specific users or roles.
    *   Regularly audit policies for unintended public access.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Leaked Access Keys [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_leaked_access_keys__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Access keys are accidentally exposed, allowing attackers to authenticate as a legitimate user.
*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers find leaked keys in public code repositories (e.g., GitHub), exposed environment variables, configuration files, logs, or through social engineering. They then use these keys with the MinIO API or client tools.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Full access to the associated account/bucket.)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Never hardcode credentials in code.
    *   Use environment variables or secrets management services.
    *   Regularly rotate access keys.
    *   Implement credential scanning tools for code repositories and logs.
    *   Educate developers on secure credential handling.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Known DoS Exploit (e.g., CVE-XXXX) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_known_dos_exploit__e_g___cve-xxxx___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** A publicly known vulnerability (identified by a CVE) exists in MinIO that allows for a Denial-of-Service attack.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker uses a publicly available exploit or develops their own based on the CVE details to disrupt the MinIO service. This typically involves sending specially crafted requests to the server.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on the vulnerability and patching status.)
*   **Impact:** High (Complete service disruption.)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Keep MinIO updated to the latest version.
    *   Subscribe to MinIO security advisories.
    *   Use vulnerability scanners to identify unpatched systems.
    *   Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.2 DoS via Policy Misconfiguration [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_2_dos_via_policy_misconfiguration__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** A misconfigured policy allows an attacker to trigger actions that consume excessive resources, leading to a DoS.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits a policy that, for example, allows anonymous users to create an unlimited number of buckets or upload extremely large files, overwhelming the server.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Carefully review and test all policies for potential abuse scenarios.
    *   Limit resource creation (buckets, objects) for unauthenticated or low-privilege users.
    *   Implement rate limiting.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1 Overwrite via Policy Misconfiguration [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_overwrite_via_policy_misconfiguration__hr_.md)

* **Description:** An overly permissive policy allows unauthorized users to upload and overwrite existing files.
    * **Attack Vector:** Similar to 1.1.1, but with write permissions. The attacker uploads a malicious file, replacing a legitimate one.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High to Very High
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Novice
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    * **Mitigation:**
        *   Restrict `s3:PutObject` permissions to authorized users and roles.
        *   Implement object versioning to allow recovery from overwrites.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1 Delete via Policy Misconfiguration [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1_delete_via_policy_misconfiguration__hr_.md)

* **Description:** An overly permissive policy allows unauthorized users to delete objects.
    * **Attack Vector:** Similar to 1.1.1, but with delete permissions. The attacker deletes critical data.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High to Very High
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Novice
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    * **Mitigation:**
        *   Restrict `s3:DeleteObject` permissions to authorized users and roles.
        *   Implement object versioning and lifecycle rules to prevent permanent data loss.
        *   Enable MFA Delete for critical buckets.
