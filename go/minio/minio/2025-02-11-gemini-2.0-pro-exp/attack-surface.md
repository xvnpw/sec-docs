# Attack Surface Analysis for minio/minio

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*Description:* Use of easily guessable, default, or weak access and secret keys for MinIO authentication.
*How MinIO Contributes:* MinIO relies on access/secret key pairs for its *primary* authentication mechanism. It *ships* with default credentials (which *must* be changed). This is a core part of MinIO's security model.
*Example:* An attacker uses the default `minioadmin:minioadmin` credentials or brute-forces a weak key pair.
*Impact:* Complete control over the MinIO deployment, including data access (read, write, delete), configuration changes, and potential for launching further attacks.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers/Users:** *Immediately* change default credentials upon installation. Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity). Implement regular key rotation. Integrate with an external identity provider (LDAP, Active Directory, OpenID Connect) for centralized user management and stronger authentication, including MFA.

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive IAM Policies](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_iam_policies.md)

*Description:* Granting users or applications more permissions than they need *within MinIO*.
*How MinIO Contributes:* MinIO uses an *IAM-style policy system*, which is a core feature, to control access to buckets and objects. The granularity and complexity of this system directly contribute to the risk.
*Example:* A policy grants `s3:*` (all S3 actions) to a user who only needs read access to a specific bucket. If that user's credentials are compromised, the attacker gains full control.
*Impact:* Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, potential for privilege escalation within MinIO.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers/Users:** Adhere strictly to the principle of least privilege. Create granular policies that grant *only* the necessary permissions. Use policy conditions (e.g., source IP restrictions) to further limit access. Regularly audit and review policies for over-permissiveness.

## Attack Surface: [Publicly Accessible Buckets](./attack_surfaces/publicly_accessible_buckets.md)

*Description:* Buckets configured with "public" access, making all objects within them accessible to anyone on the internet without authentication.
*How MinIO Contributes:* MinIO *allows* buckets to be configured with different access levels, *including "public"*. This is a direct configuration option within MinIO.
*Example:* A bucket containing sensitive documents is accidentally set to "public," exposing the documents to the world.
*Impact:* Complete and immediate data exposure to the public internet.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers/Users:** *Never* set buckets to "public" unless absolutely necessary and with a full understanding of the risks. Implement a process to review and approve all bucket policy changes. Use MinIO's bucket notification feature to alert on policy changes. Regularly audit bucket configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Data at Rest](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_data_at_rest.md)

*Description:* Data stored in MinIO without server-side encryption (SSE) enabled.
*How MinIO Contributes:* MinIO *supports* SSE but doesn't enable it by default. The *choice* to enable or disable SSE is a direct MinIO configuration.
*Example:* An attacker gains access to the underlying storage disks (physical or through another vulnerability) and can read the unencrypted data.
*Impact:* Data breach if the underlying storage is compromised.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers/Users:** Enable server-side encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C). SSE-KMS (using an external Key Management Service) is recommended for the strongest protection.

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Data in Transit (Misconfigured TLS)](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_data_in_transit__misconfigured_tls_.md)

*Description:* Communication between clients and MinIO without TLS (HTTPS) or with weak TLS configurations.
*How MinIO Contributes:* MinIO *supports* TLS but requires *proper configuration*. The responsibility for configuring TLS correctly lies with the MinIO administrator.
*Example:* An attacker performs a man-in-the-middle attack, intercepting data transmitted between a client and MinIO because TLS is not enforced or uses weak ciphers.
*Impact:* Data interception, credential theft, potential for modification of data in transit.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers/Users:** Always use TLS (HTTPS) for *all* communication with MinIO. Enforce strong TLS ciphers and protocols. Regularly check and renew TLS certificates. Use a reverse proxy with robust TLS termination.

## Attack Surface: [Software Vulnerabilities (MinIO or Dependencies)](./attack_surfaces/software_vulnerabilities__minio_or_dependencies_.md)

*Description:* Exploitable bugs in MinIO's code or its third-party dependencies.
*How MinIO Contributes:* This is *inherent* to MinIO being a software application.  Vulnerabilities can exist directly within the MinIO codebase.
*Example:* A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability is discovered in MinIO, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*Impact:* Highly variable, ranging from data breaches to complete system compromise.
*Risk Severity:* **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** Follow secure coding practices. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
    *   **Users:** Keep MinIO updated to the *latest stable version*. Subscribe to MinIO security advisories. Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify and track vulnerable dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Improper ILM Configuration](./attack_surfaces/improper_ilm_configuration.md)

*Description:* Incorrectly configured lifecycle management (ILM) policies that lead to unintended data deletion or movement.
*How MinIO Contributes:* MinIO *provides* ILM features as a core part of its functionality to automate data management tasks. The configuration of these policies is entirely within MinIO.
*Example:* An ILM policy is configured to delete objects after 30 days, but a misconfiguration causes it to delete objects after only 3 days, resulting in data loss.
*Impact:* Data loss or unavailability.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    * **Developers/Users:** Thoroughly test ILM policies in a non-production environment before deploying them. Regularly review and audit ILM policies to ensure they are functioning as intended. Implement a robust backup and recovery strategy.
