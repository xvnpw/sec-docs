# Attack Surface Analysis for minio/minio

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected MinIO API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_minio_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** MinIO exposes an S3-compatible API over HTTP or HTTPS. If these endpoints are not properly secured, they can be accessed by unauthorized individuals or systems.
    *   **How MinIO Contributes to the Attack Surface:** MinIO's core functionality revolves around providing this API for object storage operations. The availability of this API is inherent to its purpose.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers a publicly accessible MinIO instance without authentication and is able to list buckets, download sensitive files, or upload malicious content.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, malware distribution, resource abuse.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. Do not rely on default settings.
        *   Ensure the MinIO instance is not publicly accessible without proper authentication. Use network firewalls or access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access.
        *   Enforce HTTPS to encrypt communication and prevent eavesdropping.
        *   Regularly review and update bucket policies to ensure they grant the least privilege necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Access Keys and Secret Keys](./attack_surfaces/compromised_access_keys_and_secret_keys.md)

*   **Description:** MinIO uses access keys and secret keys for authentication. If these credentials are leaked or compromised, attackers can impersonate legitimate users and gain unauthorized access.
    *   **How MinIO Contributes to the Attack Surface:** MinIO's authentication model relies on these keys. Their security is paramount to controlling access.
    *   **Example:** A developer accidentally commits access keys to a public code repository. An attacker finds these keys and uses them to access the associated MinIO buckets.
    *   **Impact:** Full access to MinIO resources, leading to data breaches, data deletion, or malicious uploads.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store access keys and secret keys securely. Avoid hardcoding them in application code or configuration files.
        *   Utilize environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
        *   Implement key rotation policies to regularly change access keys.
        *   Monitor for leaked credentials using tools and services designed for this purpose.
        *   Educate developers on secure credential management practices.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Bucket Policies](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_bucket_policies.md)

*   **Description:** Bucket policies define access control rules for specific buckets. Incorrectly configured policies can grant excessive permissions, leading to unauthorized access.
    *   **How MinIO Contributes to the Attack Surface:** MinIO's authorization mechanism relies heavily on these policies. Their complexity and flexibility can lead to misconfigurations.
    *   **Example:** A bucket policy inadvertently grants `s3:GetObject` permission to `*` (all users), making the bucket's contents publicly readable.
    *   **Impact:** Unintended data exposure, potential data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining bucket policies. Grant only the necessary permissions.
        *   Regularly review and audit bucket policies to identify and correct any misconfigurations.
        *   Use specific user or role ARNs instead of wildcards where possible.
        *   Implement policy validation tools or processes to catch errors before deployment.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the MinIO Console](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_minio_console.md)

*   **Description:** The MinIO console provides a web-based interface for managing the MinIO server. Vulnerabilities in this interface could allow attackers to gain control of the MinIO instance.
    *   **How MinIO Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The console is a specific feature provided by MinIO for management purposes, introducing a separate attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the MinIO console to execute malicious JavaScript in the browser of an administrator, potentially stealing credentials or performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the MinIO instance, including data access, configuration changes, and potentially server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the MinIO server updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Restrict access to the MinIO console to authorized personnel only.
        *   Enforce strong authentication for console access.
        *   Consider disabling the console if it's not actively used and management can be done via the API or `mc` tool.

## Attack Surface: [Reliance on Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/reliance_on_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Using default access keys and secret keys for the MinIO root user or other accounts creates an easily exploitable vulnerability.
    *   **How MinIO Contributes to the Attack Surface:** MinIO, like many systems, has default credentials upon initial setup. Failing to change these is a common security oversight.
    *   **Example:** An attacker scans the internet for MinIO instances and attempts to log in using the default `minioadmin`/`minioadmin` credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Full administrative access to the MinIO instance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change the default access key and secret key upon initial MinIO setup.
        *   Enforce strong and unique credentials for all MinIO users.
        *   Regularly review and rotate credentials.
