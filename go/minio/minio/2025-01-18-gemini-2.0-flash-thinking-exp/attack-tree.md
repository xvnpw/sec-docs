# Attack Tree Analysis for minio/minio

Objective: Compromise the application utilizing MinIO by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within MinIO itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```

    *   **CRITICAL NODE:** Exploit Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Application (AND) **HIGH RISK PATH:**
        *   Identify an SSRF vulnerability in the application
        *   Target the internal MinIO endpoint
        *   Perform actions on MinIO as if originating from the application server
            *   List buckets
            *   Read objects
            *   Write/Delete objects (if permissions allow)

    *   **CRITICAL NODE:** Exploit Known MinIO API Vulnerabilities (AND) **HIGH RISK PATH:**
        *   Identify known vulnerabilities in the specific MinIO version used by the application (e.g., via CVE databases)
        *   Craft malicious API requests to exploit the vulnerability
            *   Data exfiltration
            *   Remote code execution on the MinIO server (if applicable)
            *   Denial of Service
*   Exploit MinIO Infrastructure Vulnerabilities (OR)
    *   **CRITICAL NODE:** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Operating System (AND) **HIGH RISK PATH:**
        *   Identify vulnerabilities in the OS running the MinIO server
        *   Gain access to the MinIO server's operating system
            *   Data access
            *   Service disruption
            *   Full system compromise
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit MinIO Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_minio_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses.md)

*   **Brute-force MinIO Access Keys:** An attacker attempts to guess valid MinIO access key and secret key pairs by trying numerous combinations. This is feasible if keys are weak or predictable.
*   **Exploit Default/Weak MinIO Root Credentials:** The application uses the default MinIO root user credentials (often `minioadmin:minioadmin`) or other easily guessable credentials. This grants full administrative access.
*   **Intercept MinIO Access Keys:** MinIO access keys are stored insecurely within the application's codebase, configuration files, or environment variables. An attacker gaining access to these locations can directly obtain the keys.
*   **Exploit Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Application:** An attacker exploits an SSRF vulnerability in the application to make requests to the internal MinIO endpoint. This allows them to perform actions on MinIO as if they were the application server, bypassing MinIO's external authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit MinIO API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_minio_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Exploit Known MinIO API Vulnerabilities:** The application uses a version of MinIO with known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in its API. Attackers can leverage these vulnerabilities by crafting specific API requests to achieve various malicious outcomes.
    *   **Data exfiltration:** Exploiting a vulnerability to retrieve sensitive data stored in MinIO buckets.
    *   **Remote code execution on the MinIO server:** Exploiting a vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting MinIO, potentially leading to full server compromise.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Exploiting a vulnerability to crash or make the MinIO service unavailable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Operating System](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_operating_system.md)

The operating system hosting the MinIO server has known vulnerabilities. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain access to the server's operating system.
*   **Data access:** Once on the OS, the attacker can directly access the data stored by MinIO.
*   **Service disruption:** The attacker can stop or disrupt the MinIO service.
*   **Full system compromise:** The attacker can gain complete control over the server, potentially impacting other services running on it.
