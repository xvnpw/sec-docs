# Threat Model Analysis for minio/minio

## Threat: [Credential Compromise](./threats/credential_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker could obtain valid MinIO access keys and secret keys, potentially through exploiting vulnerabilities in MinIO's authentication mechanisms or related services. With these credentials, they can authenticate to the MinIO API.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to stored data, including the ability to read, modify, or delete objects. This could lead to data breaches, data loss, or data corruption.

**Affected Component:** IAM (Identity and Access Management) module, specifically the authentication and authorization functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong password policies for MinIO users (if applicable).
* Implement multi-factor authentication where possible.
* Regularly rotate access keys.
* Monitor for suspicious login attempts.

## Threat: [Policy Manipulation](./threats/policy_manipulation.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities within MinIO's IAM module could allow an attacker to bypass authorization checks and directly manipulate bucket policies or IAM policies. This could involve crafting malicious policy documents that grant them unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Circumvention of access controls, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. Attackers could grant themselves full access to all data.

**Affected Component:** IAM module, specifically the policy management functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep MinIO updated to patch any policy manipulation vulnerabilities.
* Regularly review and audit existing MinIO policies.
* Implement strict internal controls over policy management.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via MinIO Vulnerabilities](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_minio_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities within the MinIO server itself could be exploited by attackers to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms, gaining direct access to stored objects without proper credentials.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential data theft, and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Core MinIO server components, potentially affecting the object storage engine or API handling.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the MinIO server updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
* Subscribe to MinIO security advisories and promptly apply recommended updates.
* Consider participating in bug bounty programs to encourage vulnerability discovery.

## Threat: [Data Corruption](./threats/data_corruption.md)

**Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities within the MinIO storage engine or related components could lead to data corruption during write or read operations. An attacker might intentionally trigger these vulnerabilities to corrupt data.

**Impact:** Loss of data integrity, potentially rendering data unusable or leading to application errors and failures.

**Affected Component:** Storage engine, data handling modules.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Monitor MinIO release notes for reported data corruption issues and apply necessary updates.
* Utilize MinIO's data redundancy features (e.g., erasure coding) to mitigate the impact of corruption.

## Threat: [Exploitation of MinIO Vulnerabilities for DoS](./threats/exploitation_of_minio_vulnerabilities_for_dos.md)

**Description:** Specific vulnerabilities within the MinIO server could be exploited by attackers to cause crashes, hangs, or significant performance degradation, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** Application downtime, data unavailability.

**Affected Component:** Various core server components depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep MinIO updated with the latest security patches.
* Monitor server performance and resource utilization for anomalies.

## Threat: [Administrative Credential Compromise](./threats/administrative_credential_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker could compromise the credentials of a MinIO administrator user, potentially through exploiting vulnerabilities in MinIO's administrative interface or related services. This could grant them full control over the MinIO instance.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the MinIO instance, including the ability to access, modify, or delete all data, change configurations, and potentially compromise the underlying infrastructure.

**Affected Component:** IAM module, specifically administrative user authentication.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong password policies for administrator accounts.
* Implement multi-factor authentication for administrator logins.
* Restrict access to the MinIO administrative interface to authorized networks.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Admin API Endpoints](./threats/exploitation_of_admin_api_endpoints.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the MinIO administrative API endpoints could allow attackers to perform administrative actions without proper authentication or authorization.

**Impact:** Similar to administrative credential compromise, potentially leading to full control over the MinIO instance.

**Affected Component:** Admin API endpoints and related authentication/authorization logic.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the MinIO administrative API endpoints with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* Keep MinIO updated to patch any vulnerabilities in the admin API.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks](./threats/supply_chain_attacks.md)

**Description:** The MinIO binaries or its dependencies could be compromised before release, potentially introducing malicious code into the application's infrastructure when MinIO is deployed.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the MinIO instance and potentially the application itself, leading to data breaches, malware deployment, or other malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** The MinIO distribution packages and their dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Download MinIO binaries from official and trusted sources.
* Verify the integrity of downloaded binaries using checksums.
* Regularly scan the MinIO installation and its dependencies for vulnerabilities.
* Consider using container images from trusted registries and verifying their signatures.
