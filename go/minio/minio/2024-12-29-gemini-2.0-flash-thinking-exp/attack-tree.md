## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes for Compromising Application via MinIO

**Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to application data, modify application data, or gain control over the MinIO instance to further compromise the application, focusing on high-risk scenarios.

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* Compromise Application via MinIO **CRITICAL NODE**
    * Access Sensitive Application Data Stored in MinIO **CRITICAL NODE**
        * Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws in MinIO **CRITICAL NODE**
            * Brute-force or Dictionary Attack on Access Keys
            * Exploit Default or Weak Credentials **CRITICAL NODE**
        * Exploit Misconfiguration of MinIO **CRITICAL NODE**
            * Publicly Accessible Buckets **CRITICAL NODE**
            * Leaked Access Keys or Secrets **CRITICAL NODE**
    * Modify Application Data Stored in MinIO **CRITICAL NODE**
        * Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws in MinIO **CRITICAL NODE**
        * Exploit Misconfiguration of MinIO **CRITICAL NODE**
    * Gain Control of the MinIO Instance **CRITICAL NODE**
        * Exploit MinIO Software Vulnerabilities **CRITICAL NODE**
            * Remote Code Execution (RCE) **CRITICAL NODE**
            * Container Escape (if MinIO is containerized) **CRITICAL NODE**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Compromise Application via MinIO (CRITICAL NODE):**

* This is the overarching goal and represents any successful exploitation of MinIO to harm the application.

**2. Access Sensitive Application Data Stored in MinIO (CRITICAL NODE):**

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploiting Authentication/Authorization Flaws in MinIO (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Brute-force or Dictionary Attack on Access Keys:** Attackers attempt to guess valid access keys by trying numerous combinations.
        * **Exploit Default or Weak Credentials (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers leverage commonly known default credentials or easily guessable passwords that haven't been changed.
    * **Exploiting Misconfiguration of MinIO (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Publicly Accessible Buckets (CRITICAL NODE):**  MinIO buckets are configured with overly permissive access policies, allowing anyone to list and download objects.
        * **Leaked Access Keys or Secrets (CRITICAL NODE):** Access keys and secret keys are unintentionally exposed in code, configuration files, or other publicly accessible locations.

**3. Modify Application Data Stored in MinIO (CRITICAL NODE):**

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploiting Authentication/Authorization Flaws in MinIO (CRITICAL NODE):**  Successful exploitation allows attackers to perform write operations on MinIO objects, modifying or deleting data.
    * **Exploiting Misconfiguration of MinIO (CRITICAL NODE):**  Misconfigured bucket policies might grant unauthorized write access, allowing attackers to modify or delete data.

**4. Gain Control of the MinIO Instance (CRITICAL NODE):**

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploiting MinIO Software Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the MinIO software to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting MinIO.
        * **Container Escape (if MinIO is containerized) (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities to break out of the container environment and gain access to the underlying host system.
