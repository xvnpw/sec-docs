# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for syncthing/syncthing

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Shared Folders](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_shared_folders.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Necessary Data:** Carefully analyze your application's data synchronization needs and determine the absolute minimum data required to be shared via Syncthing.
    2.  **Create Dedicated Folders:**  Structure your application's data storage so that Syncthing shares are limited to specific, dedicated folders containing *only* the necessary data. Avoid sharing parent directories or entire file systems.
    3.  **Configure Syncthing Shares:** In Syncthing's configuration, explicitly define shared folders to point only to these dedicated folders.
    4.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review the configured shared folders to ensure they still adhere to the principle of least privilege and remove any shares that are no longer necessary or are overly broad.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Unauthorized access to sensitive data if a Syncthing instance is compromised or misconfigured. Sharing too much data increases the potential impact of a breach.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):** If an attacker gains access to a Syncthing instance, limiting shared folders restricts their ability to move laterally within the system's file system and access sensitive areas beyond the intended synchronization scope.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** High risk reduction. Significantly limits the scope of data exposed in case of a security incident.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the attack surface and potential for further compromise after initial access.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Shared folders are defined for application data, but they might be slightly broader than strictly necessary. Configuration is in `deployment/syncthing-config.xml`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated script or process to regularly audit and enforce the principle of least privilege for shared folders.  Need to refine folder definitions to be more granular.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict `.stignore` Usage](./mitigation_strategies/strict___stignore__usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Files:**  Thoroughly analyze each shared folder and identify files and directories that should *never* be synchronized (e.g., temporary files, backups, configuration files with secrets, logs, development artifacts).
    2.  **Create `.stignore` Files:**  Place `.stignore` files within each shared folder.
    3.  **Define Ignore Patterns:**  Within `.stignore` files, define precise ignore patterns to exclude identified sensitive files and directories. Use specific filenames, wildcards, and directory patterns as needed.
    4.  **Regularly Update:**  As the application evolves and new file types are introduced, regularly review and update `.stignore` files to ensure continued exclusion of sensitive data.
    5.  **Testing:** Test `.stignore` rules after updates to confirm they are working as expected and not inadvertently excluding necessary files.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Leakage (High Severity):** Unintentional synchronization of sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords, internal documentation) that should not be shared, potentially leading to exposure to unauthorized parties.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Synchronization of less critical but still sensitive information (e.g., temporary files revealing system paths, debug logs) that could aid attackers in reconnaissance.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Leakage:** High risk reduction. Prevents the synchronization of explicitly excluded sensitive data.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the chance of unintentionally sharing information that could be used for malicious purposes.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented. `.stignore` files are present in all shared folders and exclude common temporary files and build artifacts. `.stignore` files are version controlled in `repository/config/stignore/`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated checks to ensure `.stignore` files are present and valid in all shared folders during deployment.  Need to add more specific rules for application-specific sensitive files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Harden Default Syncthing Settings](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_harden_default_syncthing_settings.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Default Settings:**  Carefully examine Syncthing's default configuration options, particularly those related to discovery (global/local), relaying, NAT traversal, and listening addresses.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable any default features that are not required for your application's specific synchronization needs. For example, if direct connections are always possible within your controlled environment, disable global discovery and relaying.
    3.  **Restrict Discovery:** If possible, restrict discovery methods to local discovery only or use static device introductions to avoid broadcasting device presence unnecessarily.
    4.  **Configure Listening Addresses:**  Bind Syncthing to specific network interfaces and ports if needed to limit its network exposure.
    5.  **Disable GUI Access (If Headless):** If Syncthing is running in a headless environment and the web GUI is not required, disable it to reduce the attack surface.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Medium Severity):**  Default settings might expose Syncthing instances to wider networks than intended, potentially allowing unauthorized devices to attempt connections.
    *   **Network Exposure (Medium Severity):** Unnecessary features like global discovery and relaying can increase the network footprint and visibility of Syncthing instances, potentially attracting unwanted attention.
    *   **Denial of Service (Low to Medium Severity):** In some scenarios, open discovery or relaying could be exploited for resource exhaustion or amplification attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the likelihood of unintended device connections.
    *   **Network Exposure:** Medium risk reduction. Limits the network visibility and attack surface of Syncthing instances.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Low to Medium risk reduction. Mitigates some potential DoS vectors related to discovery and relaying.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Global discovery is disabled, but relaying is still enabled for robustness. Configuration in `deployment/syncthing-config.xml`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Further restrict discovery to local network only. Investigate disabling relaying entirely and ensure robust direct connection setup.  Need to document the rationale behind each configuration setting.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit Device Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/explicit_device_authorization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Automatic Device Acceptance:** Ensure Syncthing is configured to *not* automatically accept new device introductions.
    2.  **Implement Manual Authorization Process:** Establish a manual process for authorizing new devices. This could involve:
        *   Verifying the device's identity and purpose.
        *   Manually adding the device ID to the authorized devices list in Syncthing's configuration.
        *   Using Syncthing's web UI or API to approve device introductions.
    3.  **Secure Device ID Exchange:**  Use secure channels (e.g., encrypted communication, out-of-band methods) to exchange device IDs between authorized devices. Avoid sharing device IDs in insecure ways (e.g., plain text email).
    4.  **Regular Device Review:** Periodically review the list of authorized devices and revoke access for any devices that are no longer needed or are suspected of being compromised.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Device Connection (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized devices from connecting to Syncthing instances and potentially gaining access to synchronized data.
    *   **Rogue Device Introduction (Medium Severity):**  Mitigates the risk of malicious actors introducing rogue devices into the Syncthing network to intercept or manipulate data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Device Connection:** High risk reduction. Effectively prevents unauthorized devices from joining the Syncthing network.
    *   **Rogue Device Introduction:** Medium risk reduction. Makes it significantly harder for attackers to introduce rogue devices.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented. Automatic device acceptance is disabled. Device authorization is currently a manual process performed by operations team. Process documented in `operations/device-authorization.md`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Explore automating the device authorization process while maintaining security.  Consider integrating with an identity management system for device authentication.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Device ID Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_device_id_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Treat Device IDs as Secrets:**  Recognize Syncthing device IDs as sensitive credentials that should be protected.
    2.  **Secure Storage:** Store device IDs securely. Avoid storing them in plain text in configuration files or logs that might be easily accessible. Consider using secrets management solutions or encrypted storage.
    3.  **Controlled Distribution:**  Implement controlled and secure methods for distributing device IDs to authorized devices. Use secure channels for transmission and avoid public exposure.
    4.  **Minimize Exposure:**  Avoid logging or displaying device IDs unnecessarily in logs, error messages, or user interfaces.
    5.  **Regular Rotation (Consideration):** While less common for device IDs, consider the feasibility of device ID rotation in highly sensitive environments, although this can be complex with Syncthing.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Device Spoofing (Medium Severity):** If device IDs are compromised, attackers could potentially spoof authorized devices and gain unauthorized access to the Syncthing network.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low Severity):**  Unintentional exposure of device IDs could provide attackers with information that might be used for social engineering or other attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Device Spoofing:** Medium risk reduction. Makes it harder for attackers to spoof devices if device IDs are properly protected.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Low risk reduction. Reduces the chance of unintentional device ID exposure.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Device IDs are not stored in plain text in publicly accessible files, but storage and distribution could be improved. Device IDs are currently stored in encrypted configuration files in `deployment/secrets/`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement a more robust secrets management solution for device IDs.  Automate secure device ID distribution.  Review logging and error handling to ensure device IDs are not inadvertently exposed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Device Connections](./mitigation_strategies/limit_device_connections.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Connection Needs:** Determine the minimum number of device connections required for each Syncthing instance to fulfill its synchronization purpose.
    2.  **Configure Device Limits (If Possible - Syncthing Implicit):** While Syncthing doesn't have explicit "connection limits" per device in the configuration, implicitly limit connections by only authorizing and introducing the necessary devices to each instance.
    3.  **Network Segmentation (Complementary):** Combine this strategy with network segmentation to further restrict network access and limit potential connections.
    4.  **Regular Review of Connections:** Periodically review the list of connected devices for each Syncthing instance and remove any unnecessary or unauthorized connections.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Increased Attack Surface (Medium Severity):**  Unnecessary device connections expand the attack surface and increase the potential for compromise if any connected device is vulnerable.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Low Severity):**  Excessive connections could potentially contribute to resource exhaustion, although Syncthing is generally efficient.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Increased Attack Surface:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the number of potential entry points by limiting unnecessary connections.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Low risk reduction. Minimally reduces the risk of resource exhaustion related to excessive connections.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Device connections are generally limited to necessary peers, but there's no formal process for enforcing or regularly reviewing connection limits. Current device connections are defined in `deployment/syncthing-config.xml`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement a process for regularly reviewing and documenting the rationale for each device connection.  Consider tools to visualize and monitor device connections.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable File Versioning](./mitigation_strategies/enable_file_versioning.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Versioning in Syncthing:** Configure file versioning within Syncthing's folder settings for all shared folders.
    2.  **Choose Versioning Type:** Select an appropriate versioning type (e.g., "simple file versioning," "staged versioning," "trash can versioning") based on your application's data recovery needs and storage capacity.
    3.  **Configure Versioning Settings:** Adjust versioning settings such as:
        *   Maximum number of versions to keep.
        *   Versioning cleanup intervals.
        *   Versioning location (if applicable).
    4.  **Regularly Test Recovery:** Periodically test the file versioning and recovery process to ensure it functions as expected and that data can be reliably restored from versions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Loss (Medium to High Severity):** Protects against data loss due to accidental deletion, modification, corruption, or ransomware attacks affecting synchronized files.
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Allows rollback to previous versions in case of data corruption introduced through synchronization.
    *   **Ransomware (Medium Severity):** Provides a recovery mechanism in case of ransomware encryption of synchronized files, allowing restoration from pre-infection versions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Loss:** High risk reduction. Provides a crucial safety net against various data loss scenarios.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Medium risk reduction. Enables recovery from data corruption issues.
    *   **Ransomware:** Medium risk reduction. Offers a valuable recovery option in ransomware situations.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented. Simple file versioning is enabled for all shared folders with a retention of 5 versions. Versioning configuration in `deployment/syncthing-config.xml`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement automated testing of the file versioning recovery process.  Evaluate and potentially adjust versioning settings based on storage capacity and recovery requirements.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Consider Read-Only Shares Where Appropriate](./mitigation_strategies/consider_read-only_shares_where_appropriate.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify One-Way Synchronization Needs:** Analyze data flow requirements and identify scenarios where data only needs to be distributed in one direction (from a source to one or more destinations).
    2.  **Configure Read-Only Folders:** For these one-way synchronization scenarios, configure Syncthing folders as "send only" on the source device and "receive only" on the destination devices.
    3.  **Enforce Read-Only Permissions (OS Level):**  Optionally, reinforce read-only behavior at the operating system level by setting file system permissions on the destination devices to prevent write access to the synchronized folders by the Syncthing process or other users.
    4.  **Document Read-Only Shares:** Clearly document which Syncthing folders are configured as read-only and the rationale behind this configuration.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Accidental Data Modification (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental modifications on receiving devices from being synchronized back to the source, potentially corrupting or overwriting source data.
    *   **Malicious Data Modification (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of malicious actors on receiving devices intentionally modifying data and propagating those changes back to the source.
    *   **Synchronization Loops (Low Severity):** In complex synchronization setups, read-only shares can help prevent unintended synchronization loops or conflicts.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accidental Data Modification:** Medium risk reduction. Prevents accidental overwriting of source data from receiving devices.
    *   **Malicious Data Modification:** Medium risk reduction. Limits the impact of malicious actions on receiving devices affecting source data.
    *   **Synchronization Loops:** Low risk reduction. Helps simplify synchronization logic and prevent loops in certain scenarios.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some folders are configured as "send only" for distribution, but "receive only" is not consistently used on receiving ends. Configuration in `deployment/syncthing-config.xml`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Systematically review all Syncthing shares and implement "receive only" configuration on destination devices where one-way synchronization is intended.  Document the read-only folder configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Understand and Manage Metadata Synchronization](./mitigation_strategies/understand_and_manage_metadata_synchronization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand Metadata Synchronization:** Be aware that Syncthing synchronizes file metadata (timestamps, permissions, ownership) in addition to file content.
    2.  **Assess Metadata Sensitivity:** Evaluate if synchronizing metadata poses any security risks in your application context. Consider if metadata might contain sensitive information (e.g., user names in file ownership, timestamps revealing activity patterns).
    3.  **Mitigate Metadata Risks (If Necessary):** If metadata synchronization poses risks, consider mitigation strategies:
        *   **Sanitize Metadata (Pre-Synchronization):**  If possible, sanitize or anonymize metadata before synchronization. This might involve stripping sensitive information or replacing it with generic values. (This is complex and might not be directly supported by Syncthing).
        *   **Restrict Metadata Usage (Application Level):**  Design your application to be less reliant on synchronized metadata if it poses security concerns.
        *   **Accept Metadata Risks (Informed Decision):** If the risks are deemed low and mitigation is complex, make an informed decision to accept the metadata synchronization risks.
    4.  **Document Metadata Handling:** Document your understanding of metadata synchronization and any mitigation strategies implemented.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low to Medium Severity):**  Metadata synchronization could unintentionally reveal sensitive information embedded in file metadata (e.g., usernames, timestamps of sensitive operations).
    *   **Privacy Concerns (Low Severity):**  Metadata might contain information that raises privacy concerns, depending on the nature of the data and applicable regulations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Low to Medium risk reduction. Mitigates potential information leakage through metadata.
    *   **Privacy Concerns:** Low risk reduction. Addresses potential privacy implications related to metadata synchronization.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Awareness of metadata synchronization exists, but no specific mitigation strategies are in place. Understanding documented in `security/metadata-synchronization.md`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Conduct a formal risk assessment of metadata synchronization in the application context.  Evaluate feasibility of metadata sanitization or other mitigation techniques.  Document the chosen approach and rationale.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS for Web UI (If Enabled)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_https_for_web_ui__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable HTTPS:** If you are using Syncthing's web UI for management, ensure that HTTPS is enabled in Syncthing's configuration.
    2.  **Configure TLS Certificates:**  Properly configure TLS certificates for the web UI. Use certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or self-signed certificates if appropriate for your internal environment.
    3.  **Force HTTPS Redirection:**  Ensure that all HTTP requests to the web UI are automatically redirected to HTTPS to prevent accidental unencrypted access.
    4.  **Regular Certificate Renewal:**  Establish a process for regular renewal of TLS certificates to prevent certificate expiration and maintain HTTPS security.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Without HTTPS, web UI traffic (including login credentials and management commands) is transmitted in plain text, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and interception.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):**  Lack of HTTPS allows attackers to perform MITM attacks to intercept and potentially modify web UI traffic, including administrative actions.
    *   **Credential Theft (High Severity):**  Plain text transmission of login credentials makes them easily susceptible to theft through network sniffing.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eavesdropping:** High risk reduction. Encrypts web UI traffic, preventing eavesdropping.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** High risk reduction. Protects against MITM attacks on web UI management traffic.
    *   **Credential Theft:** High risk reduction. Prevents plain text credential transmission, significantly reducing the risk of credential theft.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented. HTTPS is enabled for the web UI with certificates issued by Let's Encrypt. HTTPS configuration in `deployment/syncthing-config.xml` and certificate management automated via scripts in `deployment/scripts/`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Regularly audit certificate configuration and renewal process.  Consider implementing stricter TLS settings (e.g., minimum TLS version, cipher suites).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Syncthing Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_syncthing_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Update Process:**  Define a clear process for regularly updating Syncthing to the latest stable version. This could involve:
        *   Monitoring Syncthing release announcements and security advisories.
        *   Testing updates in a staging environment before deploying to production.
        *   Automating the update process using configuration management tools or package managers.
    2.  **Prioritize Security Updates:**  Prioritize and expedite the deployment of security updates to patch known vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Track Syncthing Version:**  Maintain a record of the Syncthing version running on each instance for inventory and vulnerability management purposes.
    4.  **Subscribe to Security Mailing Lists:** Subscribe to Syncthing's security mailing lists or RSS feeds to receive timely notifications of security vulnerabilities.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Outdated software is vulnerable to known security flaws that attackers can exploit. Regular updates patch these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity - Reduced Window):** While updates don't prevent zero-day vulnerabilities, staying up-to-date reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities before patches are available.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction. Eliminates or significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of patched vulnerabilities.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Medium risk reduction. Minimizes the exposure window to zero-day exploits.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. There is a manual process for updating Syncthing, but it is not fully automated and consistent. Update process documented in `operations/syncthing-updates.md`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automate Syncthing updates using configuration management tools.  Integrate vulnerability scanning into the update process.  Establish a clear SLA for applying security updates.
