# Threat Model Analysis for syncthing/syncthing

## Threat: [Malicious File Introduction via Compromised Peer](./threats/malicious_file_introduction_via_compromised_peer.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of a peer device connected to the Syncthing instance. They then upload malicious files (e.g., malware, ransomware) into a shared folder. Syncthing synchronizes these files to other connected devices.

**Impact:** Malware execution on connected devices could lead to data breaches, system compromise, denial of service, or data corruption. Ransomware could encrypt data, rendering it inaccessible.

**Affected Syncthing Component:** Synchronization module, folder sharing functionality.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust device authorization and authentication mechanisms in Syncthing.
* Regularly review and audit the list of authorized devices within Syncthing.
* Consider using Syncthing's "introducer" functionality to control device connections.
* Implement file versioning within Syncthing to revert to previous versions.

## Threat: [Data Corruption by Malicious Peer](./threats/data_corruption_by_malicious_peer.md)

**Description:** An attacker controlling a peer device intentionally modifies files in a shared folder to corrupt data. Syncthing synchronizes these corrupted files to other devices.

**Impact:** Data integrity is compromised, potentially leading to application errors, incorrect processing, or data loss across synchronized devices.

**Affected Syncthing Component:** Synchronization module, conflict resolution mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong device authorization and authentication in Syncthing.
* Regularly monitor file changes and integrity within shared folders (using external tools or application logic).
* Utilize Syncthing's file versioning to recover from corrupted versions.
* Consider using Syncthing's "file pulling order" settings to prioritize trusted devices.

## Threat: [Unintended Data Exposure due to Misconfiguration](./threats/unintended_data_exposure_due_to_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** The Syncthing instance is misconfigured, allowing unauthorized devices to connect or access shared folders containing sensitive data.

**Impact:** Confidential data is exposed to unauthorized parties, potentially leading to data breaches, privacy violations, or regulatory non-compliance.

**Affected Syncthing Component:** Device discovery, folder sharing configuration.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring folder sharing in Syncthing.
* Thoroughly understand Syncthing's device authorization and sharing mechanisms.
* Regularly review and audit Syncthing's configuration settings.
* Avoid using the default "default folder" without careful consideration.

## Threat: [Rogue Device Connection](./threats/rogue_device_connection.md)

**Description:** An unauthorized device manages to connect to the Syncthing instance due to weak or compromised device IDs or vulnerabilities in the discovery process.

**Impact:** The rogue device could potentially gain access to shared data, inject malicious files, or disrupt synchronization.

**Affected Syncthing Component:** Device discovery, device authorization.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use strong, randomly generated device IDs and keep them secret.
* Securely manage and store device IDs.
* Understand and configure Syncthing's discovery settings to limit exposure to unwanted connections (e.g., using static IPs or discovery servers).
* Regularly review the list of connected devices in Syncthing and revoke access for any unrecognized devices.

## Threat: [Compromise of Syncthing Web UI Credentials (if enabled)](./threats/compromise_of_syncthing_web_ui_credentials__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:** If the Syncthing web UI is enabled for management and the credentials are weak or compromised, an attacker could gain access to the Syncthing configuration.

**Impact:** An attacker could modify Syncthing settings, add malicious devices, change folder sharing configurations, or disrupt synchronization, impacting all connected devices.

**Affected Syncthing Component:** Web UI, authentication module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use strong, unique passwords for the Syncthing web UI.
* Enable HTTPS for the web UI to protect credentials in transit.
* Restrict access to the web UI to trusted networks or IP addresses.
* Consider disabling the web UI if it's not strictly necessary.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Syncthing](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_syncthing.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Syncthing software itself.

**Impact:** This could lead to various outcomes directly within Syncthing, including remote code execution within the Syncthing process, denial of service of the Syncthing service, or unauthorized access to Syncthing's data or configuration. This can indirectly impact the application relying on Syncthing.

**Affected Syncthing Component:** Any component of Syncthing could be affected depending on the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Syncthing updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Subscribe to Syncthing's security mailing lists or monitor their release notes for security advisories.

## Threat: [Improper Handling of Syncthing API (if used directly by external entities)](./threats/improper_handling_of_syncthing_api__if_used_directly_by_external_entities_.md)

**Description:** If external entities interact with Syncthing through its API, vulnerabilities in the API endpoints or authentication mechanisms could be exploited.

**Impact:** An attacker could manipulate Syncthing's behavior, potentially leading to data breaches within the synchronized data, unauthorized device connections, or denial of service of the Syncthing service.

**Affected Syncthing Component:** API endpoints, authentication module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Securely authenticate and authorize all requests to the Syncthing API.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when granting API access.
* Regularly review and audit any custom code interacting with the Syncthing API.
* Ensure the Syncthing API is not publicly exposed without proper authentication.
