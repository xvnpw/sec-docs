# Attack Surface Analysis for syncthing/syncthing

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Synchronization Traffic](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_synchronization_traffic.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts and potentially manipulates communication between Syncthing devices.

**How Syncthing Contributes:** Syncthing's core functionality relies on peer-to-peer network communication. While it implements TLS encryption, vulnerabilities or misconfigurations *within Syncthing's TLS implementation or negotiation process* can be exploited. Syncthing's ability to utilize relay servers, if those relays are insecure, also directly contributes to this attack surface.

**Example:** A flaw in Syncthing's TLS handshake allows an attacker to downgrade the connection to a weaker cipher and decrypt the synchronized data. Or, a vulnerability in Syncthing's handling of relay connections allows a compromised relay server to inject malicious data.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach (exposure of synchronized data), integrity compromise (modification of data in transit).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers/Users:** Ensure Syncthing's TLS certificate verification is enabled and functioning correctly on all devices. Avoid disabling TLS or using insecure configurations within Syncthing. If using custom relay servers, ensure their security is robust and that Syncthing's configuration for those relays is secure.

## Attack Surface: [Web UI Vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, Authentication Bypass)](./attack_surfaces/web_ui_vulnerabilities__xss__csrf__authentication_bypass_.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Syncthing's built-in web interface.

**How Syncthing Contributes:** Syncthing provides a web UI for management and configuration, making it a direct attack vector. Vulnerabilities *within Syncthing's web UI code* (e.g., insufficient input sanitization leading to XSS, lack of CSRF tokens, flaws in the authentication logic) can be exploited.

**Example:** A vulnerability in Syncthing's device name input field allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that executes when an administrator views the device list (XSS). Syncthing's web UI lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to trick an administrator into adding a malicious device. A flaw in Syncthing's password reset mechanism allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Account compromise (control over the Syncthing instance), data manipulation, potential for further system compromise if the Syncthing host is vulnerable.

**Risk Severity:** High (if the Web UI is exposed to a wider network)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers/Users:** Enable HTTPS for Syncthing's Web UI. Use strong, unique passwords for the Web UI. Restrict access to the Web UI to trusted networks or localhost only through Syncthing's configuration. Keep Syncthing updated to patch known Web UI vulnerabilities. Consider disabling the Web UI entirely within Syncthing's settings if it's not needed.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_manipulation.md)

**Description:** Unauthorized access and modification of Syncthing's configuration file (`config.xml`).

**How Syncthing Contributes:** Syncthing stores its configuration, including sensitive information like device IDs and shared folder details, in a local file. *Syncthing's design relies on this file for its core functionality*, making its integrity crucial. If file permissions are lax, it becomes a direct target.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the operating system or another application running on the same machine to gain access to the filesystem and modify Syncthing's `config.xml` file to add a malicious device, change folder configurations, or disable security features within Syncthing.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to shared data managed by Syncthing, data corruption within synchronized folders, denial of service of Syncthing.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers/Users:** Ensure proper file system permissions are set on the Syncthing configuration file to restrict access to the Syncthing process user only. This is a direct responsibility of the user/system administrator configuring Syncthing.

## Attack Surface: [Relay Server Compromise (If Used)](./attack_surfaces/relay_server_compromise__if_used_.md)

**Description:** Attackers compromise or control relay servers used by Syncthing.

**How Syncthing Contributes:** Syncthing's ability to fall back to relay servers for communication when direct connections are unavailable directly introduces this attack vector. *Syncthing's trust in the integrity of these relays* (unless configured otherwise) makes it susceptible to manipulation if a relay is compromised.

**Example:** Attackers compromise a public relay server and eavesdrop on or manipulate synchronization traffic passing through it, potentially injecting malicious files into synchronized folders.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach of data synchronized through the compromised relay, integrity compromise of synchronized data.

**Risk Severity:** High (when relying on untrusted or public relays)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers/Users:** Prefer direct connections in Syncthing's configuration whenever possible. If using relays is necessary, prioritize self-hosted or highly trusted relay providers. Carefully evaluate the trust level of any relay servers used by Syncthing.
