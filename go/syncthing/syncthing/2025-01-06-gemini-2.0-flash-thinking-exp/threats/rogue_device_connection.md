# Placeholder for potential code examples related to Syncthing configuration or API interaction for mitigation.
# In a real-world scenario, this section might include snippets for:
# - Automating review of connected devices via the Syncthing API.
# - Scripting to check and enforce strong device ID formats (though manual configuration is discouraged).
# - Examples of configuring discovery settings programmatically (if the application interacts with Syncthing's configuration).

# Example of how you might interact with the Syncthing API (conceptual - requires API key and Syncthing setup):
"""

import json

SYNCTHING_API_URL = "http://localhost:8384/rest"  # Replace with your Syncthing API URL
API_KEY = "your_api_key"  # Replace with your Syncthing API key
