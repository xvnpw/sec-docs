**3. Gaining Physical Access to a Syncthing Device:**

* **Description:** Attackers physically access a device running Syncthing. This could be a desktop, laptop, server, or even a mobile device.
* **Examples:**
    * **Theft of Device:**  Stealing a device that is running Syncthing.
    * **Unauthorized Access to Premises:**  Gaining entry to a location where Syncthing devices are stored.
    * **Evil Maid Attack:**  Briefly gaining physical access to a device while it's unattended to install malware or modify settings.
    * **Compromising Unsecured Devices:**  Targeting devices with weak physical security (e.g., no BIOS password, easily bypassed login).
* **Likelihood:**  Varies depending on the physical security measures in place.
* **Impact:**  Critical. Physical access provides the attacker with the highest level of control over the device.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Physical Security Measures:**  Implement strong physical security controls, such as locked server rooms, security cameras, and access control systems.
    * **BIOS/UEFI Passwords:**  Set strong passwords for the BIOS/UEFI to prevent unauthorized booting.
