## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Data Corruption/Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_data_corruptionmanipulation.md)

* **Compromise Application via Syncthing:** The attacker aims to compromise the application through Syncthing.
* **Compromise Data Integrity/Availability via Syncthing:** The attacker targets the integrity or availability of data synchronized by Syncthing. This is a critical node because successful compromise here directly impacts the application's data.
* **Inject Malicious Files via Shared Folder:** The attacker introduces malicious files into a folder shared with the application via Syncthing.
* **Exploit Lack of Input Validation on Application Side:** The application fails to properly validate the content of the injected malicious file. This is a critical node because it represents a direct vulnerability in the application's security, allowing the malicious file to be processed.
    * Likelihood: Medium - Depends on the application's security practices regarding input validation.
    * Impact: Critical - Can lead to code execution, data corruption, or complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Configuration Tampering](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_configuration_tampering.md)

* **Compromise Application via Syncthing:** The attacker aims to compromise the application through Syncthing.
* **Compromise Data Integrity/Availability via Syncthing:** The attacker targets the integrity or availability of data synchronized by Syncthing.
* **Modify Existing Files in Shared Folder:** The attacker modifies existing files within a shared folder.
* **Tamper with Configuration Files Used by Application:** The attacker specifically targets configuration files used by the application. This is a critical node because altering configuration can drastically change the application's behavior and security posture.
    * Likelihood: Medium - Assumes the attacker has gained access to the shared folder.
    * Impact: High - Can lead to altered application behavior, security bypasses, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Syncthing Instance Compromise for Data Access](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_syncthing_instance_compromise_for_data_access.md)

* **Compromise Application via Syncthing:** The attacker aims to compromise the application through Syncthing.
* **Compromise the Syncthing Instance Itself:** The attacker directly targets the Syncthing instance. This is a critical node as compromising Syncthing can provide broad access and control over synchronized data.
* **Exploit Weaknesses in Syncthing Configuration:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities or weaknesses in how Syncthing is configured.
* **Gain Access to Syncthing Configuration Files:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to Syncthing's configuration files. This is a critical node because it allows for direct manipulation of Syncthing's settings.
    * Likelihood: Low - Requires system access and knowledge of configuration file locations.
    * Impact: Critical - Enables modification of Syncthing behavior, potentially granting unauthorized access or control.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Syncthing Instance Compromise via API Abuse](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_syncthing_instance_compromise_via_api_abuse.md)

* **Compromise Application via Syncthing:** The attacker aims to compromise the application through Syncthing.
* **Compromise the Syncthing Instance Itself:** The attacker directly targets the Syncthing instance.
* **Exploit Weaknesses in Syncthing Configuration:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities or weaknesses in how Syncthing is configured.
* **Abuse API Keys or Authentication Tokens:** The attacker gains access to and abuses Syncthing's API keys or authentication tokens. This is a critical node because it allows the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the legitimate Syncthing instance.
    * Likelihood: Low - Depends on how well API keys are secured and if they are exposed.
    * Impact: Critical - Allows for remote control of Syncthing, potentially leading to data manipulation or unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 5: Unauthorized Data Access via Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_5_unauthorized_data_access_via_permissions.md)

* **Compromise Application via Syncthing:** The attacker aims to compromise the application through Syncthing.
* **Abuse Syncthing's Features for Malicious Purposes:** The attacker misuses intended features of Syncthing for malicious gain.
* **Abuse Folder Sharing Permissions:** The attacker exploits misconfigured folder sharing permissions to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. This is a critical node because it directly leads to unauthorized data access.
    * Likelihood: Medium - Depends on the diligence in configuring and reviewing sharing permissions.
    * Impact: High - Results in a data breach and unauthorized access to potentially sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise the Syncthing Instance Itself](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_the_syncthing_instance_itself.md)

This is a critical node because, if successful, it opens up multiple avenues for attack, including configuration manipulation, API abuse, and potentially exploiting vulnerabilities. It acts as a central point of control.
