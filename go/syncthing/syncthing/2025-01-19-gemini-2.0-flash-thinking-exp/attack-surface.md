# Attack Surface Analysis for syncthing/syncthing

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Peer Introduction / Peer Spoofing](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_peer_introduction__peer_spoofing.md)

**Description:** A malicious actor introduces themselves as a legitimate peer to a Syncthing node without proper authorization.

**Syncthing's Contribution:** Syncthing relies on device IDs and optional introduction servers for peer discovery. If not configured securely or if vulnerabilities exist in the introduction mechanism, malicious peers can be added.

**Example:** An attacker obtains a valid device ID (through social engineering or a compromised device) and configures their Syncthing instance to connect to a target node, potentially gaining access to shared folders.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to shared data, potential injection of malicious files, denial of service by overwhelming the node with requests.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Use strong and unique device IDs.
- Utilize the "Introducer" feature carefully.
- Enable and enforce encryption.
- Regularly review and audit connected devices.
- Consider using static addresses or private discovery mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious File Introduction via Synchronization](./attack_surfaces/malicious_file_introduction_via_synchronization.md)

**Description:** A compromised or malicious peer introduces harmful files into the synchronized folders.

**Syncthing's Contribution:** Syncthing's core function is to synchronize files between connected devices. If one peer is compromised, it can propagate malicious files to other trusted nodes.

**Example:** An attacker compromises a laptop that shares a folder with a development server. They introduce ransomware into the shared folder, which then gets synchronized to the server, potentially encrypting critical data.

**Impact:** Data corruption, ransomware infection, execution of arbitrary code on receiving nodes, compromise of other systems.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement robust endpoint security on all participating devices.
- Regularly back up synchronized data.
- Use file versioning (if available in your setup).
- Limit write access to shared folders.
- Consider using receive-only folders for critical data.

## Attack Surface: [Web GUI Vulnerabilities (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/web_gui_vulnerabilities__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Syncthing's web-based user interface.

**Syncthing's Contribution:** Syncthing provides a web GUI for configuration and management. If this interface is exposed and contains vulnerabilities, it can be a point of entry for attackers.

**Example:** An attacker finds a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the web GUI. They craft a malicious link that, when clicked by an authenticated user, executes arbitrary JavaScript in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.

**Impact:** Account compromise, unauthorized configuration changes, information disclosure, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Keep Syncthing updated to the latest version.
- Restrict access to the web GUI.
- Implement strong authentication for the web GUI.
- Regularly review the web GUI's security configuration.

## Attack Surface: [API Vulnerabilities (if enabled and used)](./attack_surfaces/api_vulnerabilities__if_enabled_and_used_.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Syncthing's REST API.

**Syncthing's Contribution:** Syncthing offers a REST API for programmatic interaction. If this API is exposed and contains vulnerabilities, it can be used to bypass security measures or perform unauthorized actions.

**Example:** An attacker discovers an authentication bypass vulnerability in the API. They can then send API requests to add new devices, modify folder configurations, or even shut down the Syncthing instance without proper authorization.

**Impact:** Full control over the Syncthing instance, data manipulation, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Secure API access with strong authentication and authorization.
- Restrict API access to authorized clients and networks.
- Carefully validate all input to the API.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- Keep Syncthing updated to the latest version.
