# Threat Model Analysis for syncthing/syncthing

## Threat: [Weak Device IDs or Keys Leading to Impersonation](./threats/weak_device_ids_or_keys_leading_to_impersonation.md)

*   **Description:** If Syncthing's device ID generation or the cryptographic keys used for device authentication are weak or predictable, an attacker could potentially generate or guess valid IDs and impersonate a legitimate device. This could be done by exploiting weaknesses in the key derivation function or through insufficient entropy in the random number generation process used for key creation within Syncthing.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can join the cluster as a trusted device, gaining unauthorized access to synchronized data, potentially manipulating or deleting files, and disrupting synchronization for legitimate devices.
    *   **Affected Component:** Device Identification, Cryptographic Key Generation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Syncthing utilizes strong cryptographic algorithms and secure random number generation for device ID and key creation.
        *   Monitor for unexpected devices joining the cluster and implement mechanisms for manual verification of new devices.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Device Joining the Cluster](./threats/unauthorized_device_joining_the_cluster.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manages to add an unauthorized device to the Syncthing cluster by exploiting vulnerabilities in Syncthing's device discovery or introduction mechanisms. This could involve intercepting and manipulating device introduction requests, exploiting flaws in the relay server communication, or bypassing security checks in the device authorization process within Syncthing.
    *   **Impact:** The unauthorized device gains access to all shared data, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or deletion. The attacker could also use the compromised device to further attack other devices in the cluster.
    *   **Affected Component:** Device Discovery, Device Introduction/Authorization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure and out-of-band methods for device introductions, verifying device IDs through alternative channels.
        *   Carefully review and approve all new device requests.
        *   Monitor the list of connected devices regularly and revoke access for any unrecognized devices.
        *   Utilize the "introducer" feature carefully and only with trusted devices.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Synchronization Traffic](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_synchronization_traffic.md)

*   **Description:** Although Syncthing uses TLS for communication, vulnerabilities in Syncthing's TLS implementation or configuration could allow an attacker positioned on the network to intercept and potentially decrypt synchronization traffic. This could involve exploiting weaknesses in the supported cipher suites, improper certificate validation, or vulnerabilities in the underlying TLS libraries used by Syncthing.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data being synchronized, potentially allowing the attacker to read, modify, or inject data into the communication stream, compromising data integrity and confidentiality.
    *   **Affected Component:** Network Communication, TLS Implementation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Syncthing is using the latest stable version with up-to-date TLS libraries and security patches.
        *   Configure Syncthing to use strong and secure TLS cipher suites.
        *   Verify the integrity of Syncthing binaries to ensure they haven't been tampered with.
        *   Educate users about the risks of connecting to untrusted networks.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to the Syncthing Web UI or API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_the_syncthing_web_ui_or_api.md)

*   **Description:** If the Syncthing web UI or API is exposed without proper authentication or with weak default credentials, an attacker can directly interact with the Syncthing instance. This could be due to misconfiguration, failure to change default credentials, or vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanisms of the web UI or API components within Syncthing.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Syncthing instance, allowing the attacker to modify configurations, add malicious devices, access and exfiltrate synchronized data, and potentially disrupt the entire synchronization process.
    *   **Affected Component:** Web UI, REST API, Authentication Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and enforce strong authentication for the web UI and API.
        *   Change default administrative credentials immediately upon installation.
        *   Restrict access to the web UI and API to trusted networks or specific IP addresses.
        *   Consider disabling the web UI or API if it's not required for management.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities in Syncthing](./threats/remote_code_execution_vulnerabilities_in_syncthing.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Syncthing software itself could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a device running Syncthing. This could be triggered by specially crafted synchronization messages, through vulnerabilities in the file processing logic, or via exploits targeting the web UI or API components of Syncthing.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the affected device, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the system, install malware, steal sensitive information, or use the compromised device as a foothold for further attacks on the network.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various components depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., Synchronization Engine, File Handling, Web UI, API).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Syncthing updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Subscribe to Syncthing security advisories and apply updates promptly.
        *   Implement network segmentation to limit the potential impact of a compromised instance.
        *   Consider using application sandboxing or containerization to isolate the Syncthing process.
