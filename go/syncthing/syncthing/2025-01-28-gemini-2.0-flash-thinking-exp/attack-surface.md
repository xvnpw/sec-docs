# Attack Surface Analysis for syncthing/syncthing

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Listening Ports](./attack_surfaces/exposed_listening_ports.md)

*   **Description:** Syncthing's core functionality relies on open network ports for device-to-device communication and discovery.  Exposing these ports to untrusted networks allows direct network access to Syncthing services.
*   **Syncthing Contribution:** Syncthing *requires* listening on TCP port `22000` (default) for device connections and UDP port `21027` (default) for discovery. This is fundamental to its operation.
*   **Example:**  A Syncthing instance running on a publicly accessible server with default port `22000` open is discovered by an attacker. The attacker exploits a hypothetical vulnerability in Syncthing's protocol handling on port `22000` to gain remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if exposed to the internet or highly untrusted networks).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Firewall Restriction:**  Strictly limit access to Syncthing ports (`22000`, `21027`) using firewalls. Allow connections only from trusted IP addresses or networks.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Syncthing instances within a secure network segment, minimizing exposure to broader networks.
    *   **Disable Global Discovery (if possible):** For manually configured setups, disable global discovery to reduce unsolicited network exposure.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Web UI Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_web_ui_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Syncthing includes a Web UI for management. If exposed to untrusted networks without proper security measures, it becomes a highly vulnerable entry point for web-based attacks.
*   **Syncthing Contribution:** Syncthing *provides* a built-in Web UI, enabled by default, accessible on port `8384` (default).  This UI manages critical Syncthing functions.
*   **Example:** A Syncthing Web UI is exposed to the internet without HTTPS or strong authentication. An attacker exploits a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Web UI to take over an administrator's session and gain full control of the Syncthing instance.
*   **Impact:** Full control over Syncthing configuration, data manipulation, potential data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if exposed to the internet or highly untrusted networks without HTTPS and strong authentication).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Bind Web UI to Loopback:** Configure Syncthing to bind the Web UI only to `127.0.0.1`. Access it securely via SSH tunneling or a VPN for remote management.
    *   **Enforce HTTPS:** Always access the Web UI over HTTPS. Configure Syncthing to use HTTPS or use a reverse proxy for HTTPS termination.
    *   **Strong Authentication:**  Set a strong, unique password for Web UI access.
    *   **Restrict Access by IP (if possible):** Limit Web UI access to specific trusted IP addresses or networks in Syncthing's configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured API Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_api_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Syncthing's REST API allows programmatic control.  Exposing this API without robust authentication and authorization mechanisms creates a significant risk of unauthorized access and manipulation.
*   **Syncthing Contribution:** Syncthing *offers* a REST API for automation and integration, enabled by default and accessible on the same port as the Web UI. This API provides powerful control over Syncthing.
*   **Example:** A Syncthing API is exposed without proper API key protection. An attacker gains access to a weak or leaked API key and uses it to programmatically download synchronized files or disrupt synchronization processes.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, denial of service, potential system compromise depending on API capabilities and vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (if API is exposed without strong API key protection and authorization).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong API Key Generation and Management:** Generate strong, unique API keys. Store and manage API keys securely, avoiding insecure transmission or storage.
    *   **API Access Control and Authorization:** Implement proper authorization checks on API endpoints to ensure API keys are only granted the necessary permissions.
    *   **Restrict API Access by IP (if possible):** Limit API access to specific trusted IP addresses or networks in Syncthing's configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Disabled Encryption for Synchronized Folders](./attack_surfaces/disabled_encryption_for_synchronized_folders.md)

*   **Description:** Syncthing offers the option to disable encryption for synchronized folders. Disabling encryption, especially over untrusted networks, exposes data in transit to eavesdropping and interception.
*   **Syncthing Contribution:** Syncthing *allows* users to disable encryption per folder for performance reasons. This is a configuration choice within Syncthing itself.
*   **Example:** A user disables encryption for a synchronized folder containing sensitive data. An attacker intercepts network traffic between Syncthing devices and captures the plaintext data being transmitted.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, compromise of confidentiality.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (if encryption is disabled for sensitive data synchronized over untrusted networks).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always Enable Encryption:**  Unless there is a very specific and well-justified reason, always enable encryption for synchronized folders, especially when dealing with sensitive data or untrusted networks.
    *   **Regular Configuration Review:** Periodically review Syncthing folder configurations to ensure encryption is enabled where required and that no folders are inadvertently configured without encryption.
