## Attack Tree Path: [1. [HIGH RISK PATH] Abuse Syncthing Functionality (Misconfiguration/Misuse) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1___high_risk_path__abuse_syncthing_functionality__misconfigurationmisuse___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Category:** Exploiting intended Syncthing features through misconfiguration or misuse, rather than software vulnerabilities.
*   **Why High Risk:**  Often easier to exploit than software vulnerabilities. Relies on human error and configuration weaknesses. Can lead to direct application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HIGH RISK PATH] Malicious File Injection/Modification via Syncthing [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2___high_risk_path__malicious_file_injectionmodification_via_syncthing__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Category:** Injecting or modifying malicious files within Syncthing shared folders to compromise the application processing those files.
*   **Why High Risk:** Direct path to application compromise if the application processes synced files without proper security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [HIGH RISK PATH] Gain Unauthorized Access to Syncthing Shared Folder [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3___high_risk_path__gain_unauthorized_access_to_syncthing_shared_folder__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Category:**  Gaining unauthorized access to Syncthing shared folders, which is a prerequisite for file injection/modification attacks.
*   **Why High Risk:**  Essential first step for many high-impact attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [HIGH RISK PATH] Social Engineering/Phishing to Obtain Device/Folder Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4___high_risk_path__social_engineeringphishing_to_obtain_devicefolder_credentials__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Tricking legitimate users into revealing Syncthing device IDs, keys, or folder credentials through social engineering or phishing tactics.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Access to shared folders)
    *   **Effort:** Low-Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Why High Risk:**  Human factor is often the weakest link. Social engineering can bypass technical security controls. Detection is challenging at a technical level.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [HIGH RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Files into Syncthing Shared Folder [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/5___high_risk_path__inject_malicious_files_into_syncthing_shared_folder__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Uploading malicious files disguised as legitimate data into a Syncthing shared folder, after gaining unauthorized access.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If unauthorized access is gained)
    *   **Impact:** Medium-High (Depends on application's processing, potential code execution)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (Once access is gained)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Why High Risk:**  Directly exploits the file synchronization mechanism to introduce malicious content into the application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. [HIGH RISK PATH] Modify Existing Application Files in Syncthing Shared Folder [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/6___high_risk_path__modify_existing_application_files_in_syncthing_shared_folder__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Overwriting or altering existing application data or configuration files within a Syncthing shared folder, after gaining unauthorized access.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If unauthorized access is gained)
    *   **Impact:** High (Application malfunction, data corruption, privilege escalation)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (Once access is gained)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Why High Risk:** Can directly disrupt application functionality, corrupt data, or lead to privilege escalation if configuration files are targeted.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. [HIGH RISK PATH] Trigger Application to Process Malicious Files [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/7___high_risk_path__trigger_application_to_process_malicious_files__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Relying on the application's design to automatically process files from the Syncthing folder, thus triggering the execution of injected malicious files.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (If application is designed to automatically process files)
    *   **Impact:** High (Application compromise if malicious files are processed)
    *   **Effort:** N/A (Application design vulnerability)
    *   **Skill Level:** N/A
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** N/A
*   **Why High Risk:**  Highlights a critical application design flaw. If the application automatically processes synced files without security checks, it's highly vulnerable to file injection attacks.
