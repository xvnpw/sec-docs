# Threat Model Analysis for syncthing/syncthing

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Synchronized Data](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_synchronized_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to synchronized data due to misconfiguration, compromised device security, or vulnerabilities in Syncthing's authentication or authorization mechanisms. An attacker might steal sensitive files, intellectual property, or confidential user data.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, confidentiality violation, financial loss, reputational damage, legal repercussions.
*   **Affected Syncthing Component:** Device Authentication, Device Authorization, Encryption Module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the data).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strong device passwords and security practices on all devices participating in synchronization.
    *   Regularly review and revoke access for devices that are no longer authorized.
    *   Utilize Syncthing's built-in encryption and ensure it is enabled and functioning correctly.
    *   Minimize the number of authorized devices and only authorize necessary devices.
    *   Implement device monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Data Corruption or Modification by Malicious Peer](./threats/data_corruption_or_modification_by_malicious_peer.md)

*   **Description:** A compromised or malicious device within the sync group intentionally corrupts or modifies data. This device, having valid authorization, can propagate malicious changes to other devices in the sync group. An attacker might inject malware, ransomware, or simply corrupt critical data through Syncthing's synchronization mechanism.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, data loss, system instability, malware propagation, operational disruption.
*   **Affected Syncthing Component:** Synchronization Protocol, File Versioning, Conflict Resolution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the criticality of the data and the number of devices in the sync group).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong endpoint security on all devices participating in synchronization (antivirus, intrusion detection, regular patching).
    *   Regularly monitor file integrity and version history within Syncthing.
    *   Implement file versioning and backups to recover from data corruption.
    *   Restrict write access to synchronized folders to only necessary devices.
    *   Consider using read-only folders for sensitive data on less trusted devices.

## Threat: [Compromise of Syncthing Configuration and Keys](./threats/compromise_of_syncthing_configuration_and_keys.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to Syncthing configuration files or private keys. This could be achieved through system compromise or insider threat. With access to configuration and keys, an attacker can impersonate devices, modify synchronization settings, or potentially decrypt data (if keys are not properly protected even at rest), gaining full control over the Syncthing instance and synchronized data.
*   **Impact:** Full control over Syncthing instance, unauthorized access to data, data manipulation, synchronization disruption, complete compromise of Syncthing security.
*   **Affected Syncthing Component:** Configuration Management, Key Storage, Security Context.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely store Syncthing configuration files and private keys with strong access controls (file system permissions, encryption at rest).
    *   Limit access to systems where Syncthing is configured to authorized personnel only.
    *   Implement regular security audits and vulnerability assessments of systems running Syncthing.
    *   Use configuration management tools to enforce secure Syncthing configurations.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Syncthing Software](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_syncthing_software.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Syncthing software (e.g., in protocol parsing, data handling) are exploited by attackers. This could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, or other security breaches directly within the Syncthing application.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, data breach, denial of service, application instability, potential for lateral movement within the network.
*   **Affected Syncthing Component:** All Syncthing components are potentially affected depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the vulnerability and exploitability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Syncthing updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Subscribe to Syncthing security mailing lists or vulnerability databases to stay informed about security updates.
    *   Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems to detect and block exploit attempts targeting Syncthing.
    *   Perform regular vulnerability scanning of systems running Syncthing.

## Threat: [Failure to Apply Security Updates to Syncthing](./threats/failure_to_apply_security_updates_to_syncthing.md)

*   **Description:** Not applying security updates to Syncthing in a timely manner leaves the application vulnerable to known exploits. Attackers can target known vulnerabilities in outdated Syncthing versions to compromise systems running Syncthing.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, data breach, denial of service, exploitation of known vulnerabilities, increased attack surface specifically related to Syncthing.
*   **Affected Syncthing Component:** All Syncthing components are potentially affected by vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the unpatched vulnerabilities).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Establish a process for regularly checking for and applying Syncthing security updates.
    *   Automate Syncthing updates where possible (while ensuring proper testing and rollback procedures).
    *   Prioritize patching Syncthing vulnerabilities based on severity and exploitability.
    *   Implement vulnerability management and patching workflows for all systems running Syncthing.
