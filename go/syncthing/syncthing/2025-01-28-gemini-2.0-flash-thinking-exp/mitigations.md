# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for syncthing/syncthing

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Network Exposure - Firewall Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_network_exposure_-_firewall_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify the necessary ports for Syncthing communication (default TCP 22000, UDP 22000, UDP 21027 for discovery).
    2.  Configure host-based firewalls (e.g., `iptables`, `firewalld`, Windows Firewall) on each machine running Syncthing.
    3.  For *inbound* traffic, allow connections *only* from trusted IP addresses or networks on the identified Syncthing ports. If synchronization is only within a local network, restrict inbound connections to the local network range.
    4.  For *outbound* traffic, if possible, restrict connections to known peer IP addresses or networks. If global discovery is disabled and devices are pre-configured, outbound restrictions can be tighter.
    5.  Block all other inbound and outbound traffic on Syncthing ports that are not explicitly allowed.
    6.  Regularly review and update firewall rules as network configurations change or new devices are added.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Network Access (High): Prevents unauthorized devices or attackers from connecting to Syncthing instances over the network.
    *   Network-based Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium): Reduces the attack surface for network-level DoS attacks targeting Syncthing ports from the public internet.
    *   Information Disclosure via Network Probing (Low): Limits the ability of external attackers to probe and identify running Syncthing services.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Network Access: High risk reduction.
    *   Network-based DoS: Medium risk reduction.
    *   Information Disclosure via Network Probing: Low risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined. Ideally, host-based firewalls should be enabled and configured on all systems running Syncthing. Network firewalls at the perimeter should also restrict access to Syncthing ports from untrusted networks.
*   **Missing Implementation:** To be determined. May be missing on developer machines, test environments, or newly deployed production instances. Consistent firewall rule enforcement across all Syncthing deployments might be lacking.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Network Exposure - Private Network Deployment](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_network_exposure_-_private_network_deployment.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Deploy Syncthing instances within a private network (e.g., behind a NAT firewall, in a VPN, or on a physically isolated network).
    2.  Ensure that the private network is properly secured with access controls and network segmentation.
    3.  If external access is required, use a VPN or other secure tunneling mechanism to connect to the private network rather than exposing Syncthing directly to the public internet.
