# BUSINESS POSTURE

Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. It synchronizes files between two or more computers in real time, safely protected from prying eyes. Data is encrypted and authentication is done via TLS.

- Business priorities and goals:
  - Provide users with a reliable and secure way to synchronize files across multiple devices.
  - Ensure data privacy and confidentiality during synchronization.
  - Offer a decentralized and open-source alternative to cloud-based synchronization services.
  - Support various operating systems and platforms.
  - Maintain ease of use and configuration for end-users.

- Business risks:
  - Data loss or corruption during synchronization.
  - Unauthorized access to synchronized data.
  - Vulnerabilities in the software leading to security breaches.
  - Reputational damage due to security incidents or data breaches.
  - Lack of user trust if security is compromised.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
  - security control: TLS encryption for communication between devices. Implemented in the core synchronization protocol.
  - security control: Data-at-rest encryption (optional, depends on OS and user configuration). Implemented by underlying operating system or third-party tools.
  - security control: Authentication between devices using device IDs and keys. Implemented in the core synchronization protocol.
  - security control: Code review process (community-driven, open source). Described in project contribution guidelines.
  - security control: Vulnerability reporting and patching process (community-driven). Described in project documentation and communication channels.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on user configuration for data-at-rest encryption.
  - accepted risk: Security of underlying operating system and hardware.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
  - security control: Dependency vulnerability scanning to identify and address vulnerable dependencies.
  - security control: Regular penetration testing by security professionals.
  - security control: Implement and enforce secure coding practices guidelines for developers.
  - security control: Security awareness training for developers and contributors.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Devices must authenticate each other before establishing a synchronization connection.
    - Authentication should be mutual and based on cryptographic keys.
    - Device IDs should be unique and securely generated.
  - Authorization:
    - Access control mechanisms to manage shared folders and devices.
    - Users should be able to define which devices can access specific folders.
    - Granular permissions for read/write access to shared folders.
  - Input validation:
    - Validate all inputs from users and remote devices to prevent injection attacks.
    - Sanitize file paths and names to prevent directory traversal vulnerabilities.
    - Validate configuration parameters to prevent unexpected behavior.
  - Cryptography:
    - Use strong cryptographic algorithms for encryption and authentication (e.g., TLS 1.3, AES-256, ChaCha20-Poly1305).
    - Securely manage cryptographic keys and certificates.
    - Implement proper key exchange and key derivation mechanisms.
    - Ensure data integrity using cryptographic hashing.
