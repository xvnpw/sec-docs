# Threat Model Analysis for syncthing/syncthing

## Threat: [Rogue Device Introduction](./threats/rogue_device_introduction.md)

*   **Threat:** Rogue Device Introduction

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains a valid Device ID (through phishing, social engineering, or exploiting a vulnerability in the ID sharing process) and uses it to connect a malicious Syncthing instance to the cluster. The attacker's node appears legitimate.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breaches: The attacker can access and exfiltrate synchronized files.
        *   Data corruption: The attacker can inject malicious files or modify existing files, which are then synchronized to other devices.
        *   Malware distribution: The attacker can use the rogue device to distribute malware to other devices in the cluster.
    *   **Affected Syncthing Component:** Device ID management, connection establishment process (specifically, the `Accept()` function in the protocol implementation and related device authentication logic), Global/Local Discovery.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Manual Device Approval:** Require explicit, manual approval of *all* new device connections by a trusted administrator or user.  Do *not* rely on automatic acceptance.
        *   **Out-of-Band Verification:** Use a separate, secure communication channel (e.g., phone call, encrypted messaging app) to verify the Device ID and the identity of the user adding the device *before* approval.
        *   **Introducer Restrictions:** Limit which devices can act as "introducers."  Only allow trusted, well-secured devices to introduce new nodes.
        *   **User Education:** Train users to be suspicious of unexpected device connection requests and to verify Device IDs carefully.
        *   **"Receive Encrypted" Folders:** For highly sensitive data, use Syncthing's "Receive Encrypted" folder type. This prevents the rogue device from reading the plaintext data even if it joins the cluster.

## Threat: [Discovery Server Spoofing/Compromise](./threats/discovery_server_spoofingcompromise.md)

*   **Threat:** Discovery Server Spoofing/Compromise

    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a public Syncthing Global Discovery Server or sets up a malicious one.  The attacker then redirects legitimate Syncthing clients to their rogue instance.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Connection Hijacking: Clients connect to the attacker's malicious node instead of legitimate peers.
        *   Data Breach/Corruption:  As with rogue device introduction, this allows the attacker to access or modify data.
    *   **Affected Syncthing Component:** Global Discovery client logic (specifically, the code that queries and processes responses from discovery servers), DNS resolution (if hostnames are used).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Private Discovery Server:** Use a private, trusted discovery server instead of the public ones. This significantly reduces the attack surface.
        *   **Hardcoded Discovery Server Addresses:** Configure Syncthing to use *only* specific, known-good discovery server addresses (IP addresses or hostnames with strict certificate validation).  Avoid relying on automatic discovery server selection.
        *   **Discovery Server Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the health and integrity of the discovery servers being used.  Implement alerts for any suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Syncthing Traffic](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_syncthing_traffic.md)

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Syncthing Traffic

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the TLS-encrypted communication between Syncthing nodes. This typically requires compromising a Certificate Authority (CA) or tricking users into accepting a fake certificate.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data Breach: The attacker can decrypt and read the synchronized data.
        *   Data Tampering: The attacker can modify the data in transit.
    *   **Affected Syncthing Component:** TLS communication layer (lib/tls), certificate validation logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Certificate Validation:** Ensure that Syncthing's certificate verification is *never* disabled.  The application should enforce strict validation of server certificates.
        *   **Certificate Pinning:** Implement certificate pinning to bind Syncthing to specific, known-good server certificates. This makes it much harder for an attacker to inject a fake certificate.
        *   **User Education:** Train users to recognize and report any certificate warnings.  Emphasize the importance of *not* bypassing certificate errors.
        *   **Network Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic for signs of MITM attacks (e.g., unexpected certificate changes).

## Threat: [Unauthorized API Access](./threats/unauthorized_api_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized API Access

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to Syncthing's REST API without proper authentication. This could be due to a misconfigured API key, a weak password, or a vulnerability in the API itself.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Configuration Tampering: The attacker can modify Syncthing's configuration, potentially disrupting synchronization or exfiltrating data.
        *   Information Disclosure: The attacker can access sensitive information, such as device IDs, folder paths, and connection status.
        *   Denial of Service: The attacker can potentially disrupt or disable Syncthing through the API.
    *   **Affected Syncthing Component:** REST API (lib/api), authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong API Key:** Always configure a strong, randomly generated API key for Syncthing.
        *   **Network Access Control:** Restrict access to the API to authorized IP addresses or networks using firewalls and ACLs.
        *   **Disable Unnecessary Access:** If the GUI or API is not needed, disable it entirely.
        *   **Reverse Proxy:** If the API needs to be exposed externally, use a reverse proxy with additional security features (e.g., Web Application Firewall, authentication).
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly audit the API configuration and access logs.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Syncthing Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_syncthing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Syncthing Vulnerabilities

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a security vulnerability in the Syncthing software itself (e.g., a buffer overflow, code injection flaw) to gain unauthorized access or control.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Varies greatly depending on the vulnerability: Could range from information disclosure to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Syncthing Component:** Potentially any part of the Syncthing codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (but depends on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Syncthing Updated:** Regularly update Syncthing to the latest stable version to ensure that security patches are applied.
        *   **Run with Least Privilege:** Do *not* run Syncthing as root or administrator. Use a dedicated user account with limited privileges.
        *   **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Consider running Syncthing within a sandbox or container (e.g., Docker) to isolate it from the rest of the system.
        *   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Syncthing deployment and the surrounding infrastructure.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners to identify potential weaknesses in the system.
