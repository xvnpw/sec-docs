# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for syncthing/syncthing

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Device and Folder ID Management (via Syncthing API)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_device_and_folder_id_management__via_syncthing_api_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Generation:** The application's backend generates cryptographically secure random Device IDs and Folder IDs.
2.  **Storage:** IDs are stored securely (encrypted) in the application's database.
3.  **Exchange (via Syncthing API):** Instead of manual configuration, the application uses the Syncthing REST API (`/rest/system/config`) to *programmatically* add devices and folders.  This involves:
    *   Authenticating to the Syncthing API using a securely stored API key.
    *   Constructing JSON payloads representing the desired Syncthing configuration (including the new Device IDs and Folder IDs).
    *   Sending `POST` requests to the `/rest/system/config` endpoint to update the Syncthing configuration.
    *   Handling API responses and errors appropriately.
4.  **Approval (via Syncthing API):** The application uses the Syncthing API to monitor for incoming connection requests (`/rest/events`). When a new device attempts to connect, the application:
    *   Verifies the Device ID against its internal database.
    *   If approved, uses the API (`/rest/system/config`) to update the Syncthing configuration to accept the connection.
    *   If not approved, uses the API to reject the connection.
5.  **Rotation (via Syncthing API):**  A scheduled task uses the Syncthing API to:
    *   Generate new Device IDs and Folder IDs.
    *   Update the Syncthing configuration (`/rest/system/config`) to use the new IDs.
    *   Remove the old Device IDs and Folder IDs from the configuration.
    *   Restart Syncthing (using the `/rest/system/restart` endpoint) to apply the changes.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from manually configuring Syncthing with compromised IDs.
    *   **Device ID/Folder ID Leakage (High Severity):** Reduces impact, as IDs are rotated and managed programmatically.
    *   **Configuration Errors (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of human error in configuring Syncthing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low).
    *   **Device ID/Folder ID Leakage:** Risk reduced (from High to Medium).
    *   **Configuration Errors:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Device ID generation and storage are implemented.
    *   Basic interaction with the Syncthing API for adding devices is implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Full approval process via the API is not yet implemented.
    *   Automatic Device ID and Folder ID rotation via the API is not yet implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Syncthing GUI and API (Direct Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_syncthing_gui_and_api__direct_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **GUI Disablement:** The application's deployment process ensures that the Syncthing configuration file (`config.xml`) has the `<gui>` element's `enabled` attribute set to `false`.  This is done *before* Syncthing starts.
2.  **API Key (in config.xml):**  A strong, randomly generated API key is set in the `<gui>` element's `apiKey` attribute within the `config.xml`. This key is managed securely by the application.
3.  **API Address and TLS:** The `<gui>` element's `address` attribute is set to `127.0.0.1:8384` (or another loopback address) to restrict API access to the local machine.  TLS is enabled by setting the appropriate attributes in the `<gui>` element. The application manages the TLS certificates.
4. **Readonly API (Optional):** If the application only needs to *read* from the Syncthing API, set the `readOnly` attribute to `true` in the `<gui>` element.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized GUI Access (High Severity):** GUI is disabled, eliminating this attack vector.
    *   **Unauthorized API Access (High Severity):** Requires a strong API key and restricts access to localhost.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity):** TLS protects API communication.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized GUI Access:** Risk eliminated (from High to None).
    *   **Unauthorized API Access:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low).
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   GUI is disabled in the configuration file.
    *   API key is set in the configuration file.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   API address is not explicitly restricted to localhost.
    *   TLS is not yet enabled for the API.
    * Readonly API is not used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Versioning and Rollback (Direct Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_versioning_and_rollback__direct_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Enable Versioning (config.xml):**  The application's deployment process ensures that the Syncthing configuration file (`config.xml`) has the `<folder>` element for each shared folder configured with a `<versioning>` element.  This element specifies:
    *   `type`:  The versioning type (e.g., `simple`, `staggered`, `external`).  "Staggered" is generally recommended.
    *   `params`:  Parameters specific to the versioning type (e.g., `cleanInterval`, `versionsPath` for "staggered").
2.  **Versioning Parameters:** The application chooses appropriate versioning parameters based on the data's sensitivity and storage constraints.
3. **Access via API (Optional):** While *configuring* versioning is done in `config.xml`, *accessing* versions can be done via the Syncthing API (e.g., `/rest/db/file` with the `version` parameter). This allows the application to provide version management features to users.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Tampering (High Severity):** Allows recovery from file modifications.
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Provides a way to restore corrupted files.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Tampering:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low/Medium).
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Versioning is enabled in the Syncthing configuration file with the "staggered" type.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The application doesn't yet use the Syncthing API to provide version access to users.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Connection Limits (Syncthing Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/connection_limits__syncthing_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1. **`maxConnections` (config.xml):** The application sets the `maxConnections` option within the `<options>` element in Syncthing's `config.xml`. This limits the maximum number of simultaneous connections to the Syncthing instance. A reasonable value is chosen based on the expected number of connected devices and the available resources.

* **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Limits the number of connections an attacker can establish, mitigating some DoS attacks.

* **Impact:**
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low/Medium).

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * `maxConnections` is set to a default value in the configuration file.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * The value of `maxConnections` is not dynamically adjusted based on resource usage or observed connection patterns.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Stay Up-to-Date (Manage Syncthing Binary)](./mitigation_strategies/stay_up-to-date__manage_syncthing_binary_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Version Pinning:** The application's deployment process uses a *specific, tested version* of the Syncthing binary (e.g., v1.23.0).  It does *not* use "latest" or automatically update.
2.  **Vulnerability Monitoring:** The development team monitors Syncthing's security advisories and release notes for new vulnerabilities.
3.  **Controlled Updates:** When a new version of Syncthing is released with security fixes, the development team:
    *   Tests the new version thoroughly in a staging environment.
    *   Updates the application's deployment process to use the new version.
    *   Deploys the updated application (and Syncthing binary) in a controlled manner.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Ensures that the application is running a version of Syncthing with known security fixes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The application uses a specific version of Syncthing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   There is no formal process for monitoring Syncthing security advisories.
    *   Updates are not always performed immediately after a security release.
