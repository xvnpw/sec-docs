# Attack Surface Analysis for syncthing/syncthing

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Device Addition](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_device_addition.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to add their own malicious device to a Syncthing cluster.
*   **Syncthing Contribution:** Syncthing's core functionality is based on connecting devices. The device addition process, while requiring approval, is a direct attack vector.  Exploitation can occur through social engineering, compromised Device IDs, or misconfigured Introducers.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a seemingly legitimate device connection request, tricking a user into accepting it.  Alternatively, an attacker compromises a device already in the cluster and uses it as an Introducer to add their own device.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of data within shared folders on the victim's devices. The attacker can read, modify, delete, and potentially exfiltrate all shared data. They could also use the compromised device as a pivot.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **User Education:** Train users to *never* accept device connection requests from unknown sources. Emphasize verifying Device IDs.
    *   **Strict Introducer Control:** Limit Introducers to only highly trusted and well-secured devices. Configure Introducers for specific folders only.
    *   **Regular Device Audits:** Users should regularly review connected devices in the Syncthing GUI and remove unknown or unneeded devices.
    *   **Strong GUI Passwords:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for the Syncthing GUI.
    *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) (If Available/Future Feature):** If 2FA becomes available for device additions, require its use.

## Attack Surface: [Network Exposure of GUI/API](./attack_surfaces/network_exposure_of_guiapi.md)

*   **Description:** The Syncthing web GUI or API is exposed to untrusted networks, allowing attackers to potentially gain control.
*   **Syncthing Contribution:** Syncthing provides a web-based GUI and API. Incorrect configuration of the *listen address* directly exposes these interfaces. This is a *direct* consequence of how Syncthing is configured and used.
*   **Example:** A user configures Syncthing to listen on `0.0.0.0` without a firewall, making the GUI publicly accessible. An attacker scans for open Syncthing ports and gains access with a weak password.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the Syncthing instance. The attacker can add/remove devices, modify the configuration, access shared data, and potentially use the instance to attack other systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Listen Address:** *Always* bind the Syncthing GUI/API to a specific, internal IP address (e.g., `127.0.0.1` for local access) or a trusted internal network. *Never* bind to `0.0.0.0` without a firewall.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Implement strict firewall rules to allow access to the Syncthing GUI/API port (default 8384) only from trusted IPs or networks.
    *   **Reverse Proxy with Authentication:** Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) with strong authentication (e.g., HTTP Basic Auth, OAuth) to protect the GUI/API.
    *   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for the Syncthing GUI.
    *   **Disable GUI if Unnecessary:** If the GUI is not needed, disable it.

## Attack Surface: [BEP Protocol Vulnerabilities (Potentially High Impact)](./attack_surfaces/bep_protocol_vulnerabilities__potentially_high_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** Undiscovered vulnerabilities in the implementation of Syncthing's Block Exchange Protocol (BEP) could be exploited.
*   **Syncthing Contribution:** BEP is the *core protocol* used by Syncthing for data synchronization. Vulnerabilities in its implementation are *directly* exploitable within Syncthing itself. This is inherent to the application.
*   **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in BEP could allow an attacker to send crafted packets, causing a denial-of-service, data corruption, or potentially remote code execution (though less likely due to encryption).
*   **Impact:** Varies. Could range from denial-of-service to data corruption or, in a worst-case scenario, remote code execution.  The potential for RCE elevates this to a potential High/Critical risk.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (due to the potential for high-impact vulnerabilities)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Syncthing Updated:** The *most important* mitigation is to keep Syncthing updated. Security patches are regularly released.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about any security advisories related to Syncthing.
    *   **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS):** Consider a NIDS to monitor for unusual Syncthing traffic.
    *   **Code Review (For Developers):** Contribute to the project by reviewing the BEP implementation.
