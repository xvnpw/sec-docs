## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Syncthing Instance](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_syncthing_instance.md)

*   **1. Compromise Syncthing Instance:** This is the primary entry point for many attacks, focusing on gaining direct control over the Syncthing process.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Weak Credentials (GUI/API)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_weak_credentials__guiapi_.md)

*   **1.1 Weak Credentials (GUI/API):** Exploiting weak or default credentials to gain access to the Syncthing management interface.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Default Credentials `[HIGH RISK]` `{CRITICAL}`](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_default_credentials___high_risk____{critical}_.md)

*   **1.1.1 Default Credentials `[HIGH RISK]` `{CRITICAL}`:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to log in to the Syncthing GUI or API using commonly known default usernames and passwords (e.g., "admin/admin", "user/password").  While Syncthing *doesn't* ship with defaults, users might set them.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Full control of the Syncthing instance)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Very Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies.
        *   Provide clear warnings during setup about not using default credentials.
        *   Implement account lockout after failed attempts.
        *   *Never* ship with default credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Brute-Force `[HIGH RISK]` `{CRITICAL}`](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_brute-force___high_risk____{critical}_.md)

*   **1.1.2 Brute-Force `[HIGH RISK]` `{CRITICAL}`:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker uses automated tools to try a large number of username and password combinations until a successful login is achieved.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Full control of the Syncthing instance)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on login attempts.
        *   Implement account lockout after failed attempts.
        *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Configuration Errors](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_configuration_errors.md)

*   **1.2 Configuration Errors:** Mistakes in configuring Syncthing that create vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Exposed GUI/API `[HIGH RISK]` `{CRITICAL}`](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_exposed_guiapi___high_risk____{critical}_.md)

*   **1.2.1 Exposed GUI/API `[HIGH RISK]` `{CRITICAL}`:**
    *   **Description:** The Syncthing GUI or API is unintentionally made accessible on a public network interface, allowing anyone on the internet to attempt to access it.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Full control of the Syncthing instance)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Very Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Bind the GUI/API to localhost (127.0.0.1) by default.
        *   Clearly document the risks of exposing the GUI/API.
        *   Provide instructions for secure remote access (SSH tunneling, VPN, reverse proxy).
        *   Add a warning to the GUI if it's accessible from a non-localhost address.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Syncthing Protocol Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_syncthing_protocol_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **2. Exploit Syncthing Protocol Vulnerabilities:**

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **2.2 Denial of Service (DoS):** Attacks that aim to make the Syncthing service unavailable.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Resource Exhaustion `[HIGH RISK]`](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_resource_exhaustion___high_risk__.md)

*   **2.2.1 Resource Exhaustion `[HIGH RISK]`:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker sends a large volume of legitimate or semi-legitimate requests to the Syncthing instance, consuming its resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) and preventing it from serving legitimate users.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Temporary disruption of service)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on various Syncthing operations.
        *   Monitor resource usage and set alerts.
        *   Use a firewall or load balancer to mitigate DDoS attacks.
