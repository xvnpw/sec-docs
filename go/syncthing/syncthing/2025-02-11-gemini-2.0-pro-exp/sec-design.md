Okay, let's create a design document for the Syncthing project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Syncthing is an open-source, decentralized file synchronization application.  Its primary goal is to provide a secure, private, and reliable way for users to synchronize files across multiple devices without relying on a central server.  The project prioritizes user privacy and data sovereignty.  It's used by individuals and organizations who want control over their data and prefer not to use cloud-based synchronization services.

Business Priorities:

*   Data Privacy:  Ensure user data remains private and is not exposed to unauthorized parties.
*   Data Integrity:  Maintain the integrity of synchronized files, preventing corruption or tampering.
*   Data Availability:  Ensure files are accessible to authorized devices whenever they are online.
*   Decentralization:  Avoid reliance on central servers, enhancing resilience and user control.
*   Ease of Use:  Provide a user-friendly experience that simplifies file synchronization.
*   Open Source: Maintain transparency and community involvement through an open-source model.
*   Cross-Platform: Support a wide range of operating systems and devices.

Business Risks:

*   Data Breach: Unauthorized access to synchronized files due to vulnerabilities in the software or misconfiguration.
*   Data Loss: Loss of data due to software bugs, hardware failures, or user error.
*   Data Tampering:  Malicious modification of synchronized files.
*   Denial of Service:  Disruption of the synchronization service, preventing users from accessing their files.
*   Reputation Damage:  Negative publicity due to security incidents or privacy violations.
*   Compromised Build: Malicious code injection during build process.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Cryptography: Syncthing uses TLS 1.3 with strong ciphers for all communication between devices.  This protects data in transit. (Implemented in the protocol and transport layers).
*   security control: Authentication: Devices authenticate each other using cryptographic certificates, preventing unauthorized devices from joining the synchronization network. (Implemented in the protocol layer).
*   security control: Data Integrity:  Syncthing uses block-level hashing to detect and prevent data corruption. (Implemented in the protocol and storage layers).
*   security control: Decentralized Architecture:  The lack of a central server reduces the risk of a single point of failure or compromise. (Architectural design).
*   security control: Open Source:  The open-source nature of the project allows for community scrutiny and auditing of the codebase. (Project philosophy).
*   security control: Automatic Updates: Syncthing can automatically update itself, ensuring that users have the latest security patches. (Implemented in the main application logic).
*   security control: Rate Limiting: Syncthing implements rate limiting to mitigate denial-of-service attacks. (Implemented in the protocol layer).
*   security control: Sandboxing (partial): While not fully sandboxed, Syncthing attempts to limit its access to the filesystem to only the configured synchronization folders. (Implemented in the application logic).
*   security control: Relaying: If direct connections are not possible, encrypted relaying is used. Relays cannot see the content of the data. (Implemented in the protocol and relay server software).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: User Error:  Users may misconfigure Syncthing, potentially exposing their data (e.g., sharing with the wrong device ID).
*   accepted risk: Relay Compromise: While relays cannot decrypt data, a compromised relay could potentially disrupt service or perform traffic analysis.
*   accepted risk: Local Attack: If a user's device is compromised, the attacker could potentially access the synchronized files.
*   accepted risk: Metadata Leakage: While file contents are encrypted, metadata such as filenames and sizes might be visible to relays.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Enhanced Sandboxing: Explore more robust sandboxing techniques (e.g., using containers or virtualization) to further isolate Syncthing from the rest of the system.
*   security control: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Consider adding 2FA for device authorization, adding an extra layer of security.
*   security control: Formal Security Audits: Conduct regular, independent security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Bug Bounty Program: Implement a bug bounty program to incentivize security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Supply Chain Security: Implement robust measures to secure the build and distribution process, preventing the introduction of malicious code.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All devices must be mutually authenticated using strong cryptographic methods.
    *   Device IDs must be unique and cryptographically secure.
    *   Consider implementing 2FA for device authorization.

*   Authorization:
    *   Access control must be enforced at the device level, ensuring that only authorized devices can access shared folders.
    *   Users should be able to define granular permissions for shared folders (e.g., read-only, read-write).

*   Input Validation:
    *   All input from the network and user interface must be validated to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    *   Filename and path validation should be performed to prevent path traversal attacks.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use only strong, well-vetted cryptographic algorithms and libraries.
    *   All communication between devices must be encrypted using TLS 1.3 or higher.
    *   Data at rest encryption should be considered as an optional feature.
    *   Key management must be secure and follow best practices.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   File Synchronization: The core process of synchronizing files between devices.
*   Device Discovery: The process of finding and connecting to other Syncthing devices.
*   Data Management: Handling file changes, versioning, and conflict resolution.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Synchronized Files: The sensitivity of the synchronized files depends on the user's data.  It can range from non-sensitive (e.g., public documents) to highly sensitive (e.g., personal documents, confidential business data).
*   Configuration Data:  The Syncthing configuration contains device IDs and shared folder paths, which could be considered sensitive.
*   Metadata: Filenames, sizes, and modification times are not encrypted in transit to relays, and could reveal information about the synchronized data.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What is the expected threat model? (e.g., casual users, targeted attacks, nation-state actors)
*   What are the specific compliance requirements, if any? (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)
*   What level of resources are available for security improvements?
*   Are there any specific performance requirements that might impact security choices?
*   What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by external researchers?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: Users prioritize data privacy and control over convenience.
*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The project aims to provide a reasonable level of security against common threats, but may not be suitable for extremely high-security environments without additional measures.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: Users are responsible for securing their own devices and networks.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The default configuration of Syncthing provides a reasonable level of security for most users.
*   DESIGN: The official Syncthing discovery and relay servers are operated with reasonable security measures, but are not inherently trusted.
*   DESIGN: Users have basic technical knowledge to configure and use Syncthing.
