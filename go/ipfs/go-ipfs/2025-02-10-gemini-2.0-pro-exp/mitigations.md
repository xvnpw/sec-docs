# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ipfs/go-ipfs

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Preference for Pinned Content and Mutable Pointers (IPNS/DNSLink) with Signature Verification](./mitigation_strategies/strong_preference_for_pinned_content_and_mutable_pointers__ipnsdnslink__with_signature_verification.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Critical Data:** Determine which data your application *absolutely* relies on.
2.  **Pin Critical Data:** Use the `go-ipfs pin add <CID>` command (or the equivalent API call) to pin this data on your `go-ipfs` node(s).
3.  **Create Mutable Pointers (IPNS):** For data that needs updates, use IPNS.  Use `go-ipfs name publish <CID>` to create an IPNS record.  This generates a key pair; the public key is the IPNS identifier.
4.  **Update Content (IPNS):** When updating, publish the new CID using `go-ipfs name publish --key=<key-name> <new-CID>`. Use the private key associated with the IPNS record.
5.  **Signature Verification (IPNS):** *Crucially*, before resolving an IPNS name, verify its signature using `go-ipfs`'s API. This involves:
    *   Retrieving the IPNS record.
    *   Extracting the public key.
    *   Verifying the signature using the public key.
    *   Only if valid, resolve the IPNS name to the CID.
6.  **Regular Key Rotation (IPNS):** Periodically rotate IPNS keys using `go-ipfs key` commands to mitigate key compromise risk.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Data Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from tricking the application into using a malicious CID by hijacking an IPNS name.
    *   **Data Corruption (High Severity):** Ensures retrieval of intended data.
    *   **Data Unavailability (Medium Severity):** Pinning ensures local data availability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Data Injection:** Risk significantly reduced due to signature verification.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Data Unavailability:** Risk reduced (local garbage collection protection).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "IPNS is used for the application's configuration file, with signature verification in `config.go`. Pinning is used for the core binary, managed by `deploy.sh`."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "IPNS is not used for user-generated content. Key rotation for IPNS is not automated."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Redundant Pinning](./mitigation_strategies/redundant_pinning.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Multiple Pinning Nodes:** Set up multiple `go-ipfs` nodes.
2.  **Pin to All Nodes:** Pin critical data to *all* of these nodes using `go-ipfs pin add <CID>` on each node.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Unavailability (Medium Severity):** Increases the likelihood of data availability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Unavailability:** Risk significantly reduced due to redundancy.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "Data is pinned to two geographically diverse nodes."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "Automated health checks for pinning nodes are not implemented."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Peer Selection and Bootstrapping](./mitigation_strategies/careful_peer_selection_and_bootstrapping.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Curated Bootstrap List:** Create a custom list of trusted bootstrap nodes instead of using the default `go-ipfs` list.  Update this list regularly.  This is done by modifying the `Bootstrap` list in the `go-ipfs` configuration file.
2.  **Peer Filtering:** Use `go-ipfs`'s API to filter peers based on:
    *   **Latency:** Prefer low-latency peers.
    *   **Protocols:** Connect only to peers supporting necessary protocols.
    *   **Blacklist/Whitelist:** Maintain lists of known-bad/good peers (using `go-ipfs swarm peers` and related commands for management).
3.  **Limit Connections:** Configure `go-ipfs` (via the configuration file, specifically the `Swarm.ConnMgr` section) to limit the number of concurrent connections.  Adjust `Swarm.ConnMgr.HighWater` and `Swarm.ConnMgr.LowWater`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Connecting to Malicious Nodes (Medium Severity):** Reduces the chance of connecting to malicious nodes.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) (Low Severity):** Limiting connections helps prevent resource exhaustion.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Connecting to Malicious Nodes:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Risk slightly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "A curated bootstrap list is used. Connection limits are set in the `go-ipfs` config. Latency-based filtering is in `peer_manager.go`."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "A peer reputation system is not implemented."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Resource Quotas (within `go-ipfs`)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_resource_quotas__within__go-ipfs__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **`go-ipfs` Configuration:** Configure `go-ipfs` (via the configuration file) to limit:
    *   **Connections:** Maximum concurrent connections (`Swarm.ConnMgr`).
    *   **Requests:** Number of requests per peer per time unit (This is less directly configurable in `go-ipfs` itself and often requires external tools, but connection limits indirectly affect this).
    *   **Bandwidth:** Inbound and outbound bandwidth per peer (`Swarm.ResourceMgr` - though fine-grained per-peer control is limited; system-level tools are often better for this).
    * **Resource usage:** Configure circuit relay v2 with reservations and limits.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents resource exhaustion.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Risk reduced (within the capabilities of `go-ipfs`'s internal limits).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "`go-ipfs` is configured with connection and bandwidth limits in the configuration file."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "Fine-grained per-peer request rate limiting is not directly implemented within `go-ipfs`."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Stay Updated](./mitigation_strategies/stay_updated.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Regular Updates:** Update `go-ipfs` to the latest stable version using the appropriate package manager or by downloading and installing the new version.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of `go-ipfs` Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of `go-ipfs` Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "A process is in place to update `go-ipfs` weekly."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "No specific examples, as this is a fundamental practice."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Gateway Configuration (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_gateway_configuration__if_applicable_.md)

**Description:**
1. **Disable Unnecessary Features:** If running a gateway, disable unneeded features via command-line flags or the configuration file. For example, use `--disable-writeable-gateway` if you only need to serve content.
2. **Authentication and Authorization:** If the gateway requires administrative access, configure authentication and authorization within the `go-ipfs` configuration (though this is often better handled by a reverse proxy in front of `go-ipfs`).

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized modification of the gateway.
    * **Exploitation of Gateway Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Reduces the attack surface.

* **Impact:**
    * **All Threats:** Risk reduced by limiting functionality and securing access.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Example: "The gateway runs with `--disable-writeable-gateway`."

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Example: "More robust authentication (beyond basic auth) within `go-ipfs` is not configured."
