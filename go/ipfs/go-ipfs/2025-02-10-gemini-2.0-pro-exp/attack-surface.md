# Attack Surface Analysis for ipfs/go-ipfs

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) / DDoS via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos___ddos_via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers overwhelm the `go-ipfs` node with requests, consuming resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth, storage) and making it unavailable.
*   **How go-ipfs Contributes:** `go-ipfs`'s P2P architecture and protocols (Bitswap, DHT, connection management) are inherently vulnerable to resource exhaustion.  The open nature of the network means any node can attempt to interact with the `go-ipfs` instance.
*   **Example:** An attacker floods the node with Bitswap requests for random, non-existent CIDs, causing high CPU and bandwidth usage.
*   **Impact:** Application downtime, service unavailability, potential financial losses, node becomes unusable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Use `go-ipfs`'s built-in rate limiting and implement additional application-level rate limiting on all incoming requests (Bitswap, DHT, connections).
    *   **Connection Limits:** Configure strict connection limits using `go-ipfs`'s connection manager.
    *   **Resource Quotas:** Set limits on storage (especially pinning) and bandwidth.
    *   **Firewall:** Restrict network access to only necessary ports/IPs.
    *   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor resource usage and alert on anomalies.

## Attack Surface: [Serving Malicious Content](./attack_surfaces/serving_malicious_content.md)

*   **Description:** The application retrieves and uses content from IPFS *without sufficient validation*, leading to the execution or display of malicious data.
*   **How go-ipfs Contributes:** While `go-ipfs` guarantees content *integrity* (it matches the CID), it does *not* guarantee content *safety*.  `go-ipfs` provides the mechanism to retrieve the data, but the application is responsible for validating it.
*   **Example:** An application retrieves a JavaScript file from IPFS based on a user-provided CID and executes it without sanitization, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of user accounts, data breaches, malware infections, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Content Validation:** *Never* trust content from IPFS directly. Implement rigorous validation *before* use:
        *   **Allowlisting:** Only allow content from trusted CIDs/sources.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Execute/render content in a sandboxed environment.
        *   **Virus Scanning:** Scan for malware.
        *   **Content Type Verification:** Verify and enforce expected content types.
    *   **CID Verification:** If possible, verify the CID against a trusted source *before* retrieval.

## Attack Surface: [Data Tampering (Mutable Content)](./attack_surfaces/data_tampering__mutable_content_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers compromise keys used for mutable pointers (IPNS, DNSLink), redirecting users to malicious content.
*   **How go-ipfs Contributes:** IPNS and DNSLink, *features of go-ipfs*, provide mutability, but their security depends entirely on the associated keys. `go-ipfs` manages the resolution and update mechanisms for these pointers.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises the private key for an IPNS record and updates it to point to a phishing site.
*   **Impact:** Users are redirected to malicious content, leading to malware, phishing, etc.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Key Management:** Protect private keys with extreme care (strong passwords, MFA, HSMs).
    *   **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate keys used for IPNS and DNSLink.
    *   **DNSSEC (for DNSLink):** Use DNSSEC to prevent DNS hijacking.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor IPNS/DNSLink entries for unauthorized changes.
    *   **Multi-Signature:** Consider multi-signature schemes for updating IPNS.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/exposed_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** The `go-ipfs` HTTP API is exposed without proper authentication/authorization, allowing attackers to control the node.
*   **How go-ipfs Contributes:** `go-ipfs` *provides* the HTTP API, which is a powerful interface for controlling the node.  Its security is entirely dependent on proper configuration.
*   **Example:** An attacker finds the exposed API and uses it to add malicious files, delete data, or reconfigure the node.
*   **Impact:** Complete node compromise, data exfiltration, potential RCE, use of the node for malicious activities.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authentication:** Implement strong authentication (API keys, JWTs). *Never* use default credentials.
    *   **Authorization:** Implement fine-grained authorization to restrict API access.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Do *not* expose the API publicly unless strictly necessary. Use a reverse proxy with TLS and access controls.
    *   **Firewall:** Restrict access to the API port to authorized IPs.
    *   **Auditing:** Regularly audit API configuration and access logs.

## Attack Surface: [Data Confidentiality Breach](./attack_surfaces/data_confidentiality_breach.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is stored on IPFS without encryption, making it publicly accessible via its CID.
*   **How go-ipfs Contributes:** IPFS, *by its design*, does not provide confidentiality.  It's a public, content-addressed network. `go-ipfs` implements this design.
*   **Example:** An application stores unencrypted user data on IPFS, and an attacker who obtains the CIDs can access the data.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, privacy violations, legal/regulatory consequences.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Encryption:** *Always* encrypt sensitive data *before* storing it on IPFS.
    *   **Client-Side Encryption:** Encrypt data on the client-side to ensure it's never stored unencrypted.
    *   **Access Control (Application-Level):** Control access to decryption keys and encrypted data.
    *   **Metadata Minimization:** Minimize stored metadata to reduce leakage.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in `go-ipfs`'s dependencies (libp2p, other Go libraries) are exploited.
*   **How go-ipfs Contributes:** `go-ipfs` *includes and relies on* these dependencies. A vulnerability in a dependency becomes a vulnerability in `go-ipfs`.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in a libp2p component allows RCE; an attacker exploits this to control the `go-ipfs` node.
*   **Impact:** Varies (DoS to RCE, node compromise).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `go-ipfs` and dependencies updated. Use `go mod`.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to track dependencies and vulnerabilities.
    *   **Supply Chain Security:** Be aware of supply chain risks; consider code signing and SBOMs.
