# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ipfs/go-ipfs

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Private Networks (Libp2p Private Networks)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_private_networks__libp2p_private_networks_.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Generate a private key for your private network using `go-ipfs` tools or manual key generation. This key will be shared among authorized nodes.
*   Step 2: Configure each `go-ipfs` node to join the private network by setting the `PrivateKey` configuration option in `config.toml` or using command-line flags.
*   Step 3:  Modify the `Bootstrap` and `Swarm.RelayService` configurations in `go-ipfs` to ensure nodes only connect to peers within the private network. This involves removing public bootstrap nodes and potentially disabling public relay services.
*   Step 4: Distribute the private network key securely to authorized `go-ipfs` nodes only.
*   Step 5:  Restart `go-ipfs` daemons on all nodes for the configuration changes to take effect and to join the private network.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Unauthorized Access to Data - Severity: High (Public IPFS network is open. Private networks restrict access to nodes with the private key, mitigating unauthorized access from the public network.)
*   Exposure to Public DHT Attacks - Severity: Medium (Public DHT is a potential attack surface. Private networks isolate nodes from public DHT risks, reducing exposure to DHT-related attacks.)
*   Unwanted Content Injection from Public Network - Severity: Medium (In public networks, malicious actors can inject content. Private networks limit content sources to trusted nodes within the network.)

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized Access to Data: High Reduction (Effectively isolates your IPFS network and data from the public IPFS network.)
*   Exposure to Public DHT Attacks: High Reduction (Nodes are isolated from the public DHT, significantly reducing exposure to DHT-based attacks.)
*   Unwanted Content Injection from Public Network: Medium Reduction (Limits content sources to the private network, but internal threats within the private network are still possible.)

**Currently Implemented:**  `go-ipfs` has built-in support for private networks through libp2p private networks. Configuration options are available in `config.toml` and via command-line flags.

**Missing Implementation:**  Simplified tools within `go-ipfs` for private key generation and distribution.  More user-friendly configuration interfaces for setting up private networks.  Potentially, automated network discovery within private networks could be improved while maintaining security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Resource Limits in `go-ipfs`](./mitigation_strategies/configure_resource_limits_in__go-ipfs_.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Edit the `go-ipfs` configuration file (`config.toml`) or use command-line flags when starting the daemon.
*   Step 2: Set resource limits using configuration options such as:
    *   `Swarm.ResourceMgr.MaxMemory`: Limits memory usage by the swarm subsystem.
    *   `Swarm.ResourceMgr.MaxFDs`: Limits the number of file descriptors used by the swarm subsystem.
    *   `Swarm.ConnMgr.HighWater` and `Swarm.ConnMgr.LowWater`: Control the number of connections the node maintains.
    *   `--routing-options`:  Options related to DHT resource usage (though less direct resource limits).
*   Step 3:  Restart the `go-ipfs` daemon for the resource limit configurations to be applied.
*   Step 4:  Monitor `go-ipfs` node resource usage using `go-ipfs stats bw`, system monitoring tools, or metrics endpoints to ensure limits are effective and appropriately set.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion - Severity: High (Uncontrolled resource usage can lead to node unresponsiveness. Resource limits in `go-ipfs` prevent excessive consumption.)
*   Resource Starvation - Severity: Medium (`go-ipfs` consuming excessive resources can starve other processes. Limits ensure fair resource sharing on the system.)
*   Cryptojacking (Resource Abuse) - Severity: Medium (If compromised, resource limits restrict the resources an attacker can abuse for cryptomining or other activities.)

**Impact:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion: High Reduction (Limits prevent resource exhaustion, improving node stability and availability under load or attack.)
*   Resource Starvation: High Reduction (Ensures `go-ipfs` operates within defined resource boundaries, preventing starvation of other processes.)
*   Cryptojacking (Resource Abuse): Medium Reduction (Limits the resources available for abuse if a node is compromised, though doesn't prevent compromise itself.)

**Currently Implemented:**  `go-ipfs` provides configuration options for resource limits within its `config.toml` and via command-line flags.

**Missing Implementation:**  More granular resource control options within `go-ipfs`.  Dynamic resource limit adjustment based on node load or detected threats.  Default configurations with sensible resource limits for different deployment scenarios.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary `go-ipfs` Services and Features](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary__go-ipfs__services_and_features.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Review the `go-ipfs` configuration file (`config.toml`) to identify enabled services and features.
*   Step 2: Disable services that are not required for your application's functionality by setting their corresponding configuration options to `false` or removing their listening addresses. Examples include:
    *   Web UI: Remove listening address for `API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and ensure no UI port is configured.
    *   Pubsub: Set `Pubsub.Enabled = false`.
    *   MDNS discovery: Set `Discovery.MDNS.Enabled = false`.
    *   Relay service: Set `Swarm.RelayService.Enabled = false` (if not needed).
    *   Gateway: Remove listening address for `Gateway.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and ensure no Gateway port is configured.
*   Step 3: Restart the `go-ipfs` daemon for the changes to take effect.
*   Step 4:  Verify that disabled services are no longer active by checking `go-ipfs` logs and network port usage.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Reduced Attack Surface - Severity: Medium (Disabling services reduces potential entry points for attackers and vulnerabilities associated with those services.)
*   Vulnerability Exploitation - Severity: Medium (Unused services might contain vulnerabilities. Disabling them eliminates the risk of exploiting those vulnerabilities.)
*   Resource Consumption - Severity: Low (Disabling services can slightly reduce resource consumption by the `go-ipfs` node.)

**Impact:**
*   Reduced Attack Surface: Medium Reduction (Decreases the number of potential attack vectors by removing unused services.)
*   Vulnerability Exploitation: Medium Reduction (Eliminates the risk of vulnerabilities in disabled services being exploited.)
*   Resource Consumption: Low Reduction (Minor improvement in resource efficiency.)

**Currently Implemented:**  `go-ipfs` allows disabling services through configuration options in `config.toml`.

**Missing Implementation:**  More intuitive configuration interface for service management.  Profiles or presets for common use cases that automatically disable unnecessary services.  Warnings or recommendations in documentation about disabling services for security hardening.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update `go-ipfs` and Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update__go-ipfs__and_dependencies.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Monitor `go-ipfs` releases and security advisories through official channels (GitHub releases, mailing lists, security announcements).
*   Step 2: When a new version of `go-ipfs` is released, especially security updates, plan for an update.
*   Step 3: Download the latest `go-ipfs` release binaries or update using package managers if applicable.
*   Step 4:  Replace the existing `go-ipfs` binaries with the updated versions.
*   Step 5: Restart the `go-ipfs` daemon to run the updated version.
*   Step 6: Verify the update was successful by checking the `go-ipfs version` command output.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities - Severity: High (Outdated `go-ipfs` versions are vulnerable to known exploits. Updates patch these vulnerabilities.)
*   Zero-Day Exploits (Reduced Risk) - Severity: Medium (While updates don't prevent zero-day exploits, they ensure known vulnerabilities are addressed, reducing the overall attack surface.)
*   Software Bugs and Instability - Severity: Low (Updates often include bug fixes and stability improvements, indirectly contributing to security and reliability.)

**Impact:**
*   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: High Reduction (Patches eliminate known vulnerabilities, significantly reducing the risk of exploitation.)
*   Zero-Day Exploits (Reduced Risk): Medium Reduction (Proactive updates minimize the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit known weaknesses.)
*   Software Bugs and Instability: Low Reduction (Indirectly improves security by enhancing overall software quality.)

**Currently Implemented:**  Software update process is generally external to `go-ipfs`, but `go-ipfs` provides version information via command-line.

**Missing Implementation:**  Automated update mechanisms within `go-ipfs` itself.  Built-in notifications or alerts for new releases and security advisories.  Easier integration with package management systems for updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor `go-ipfs` Node Activity and Logs](./mitigation_strategies/monitor__go-ipfs__node_activity_and_logs.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Configure `go-ipfs` logging level in `config.toml` to capture relevant events (e.g., `log.level = "info"` or `"debug"` for more detailed logs).
*   Step 2: Review `go-ipfs` log output (typically to `~/.ipfs/logs/daemon.log` or configurable via `--log-output`).
*   Step 3: Utilize `go-ipfs stats bw` to monitor bandwidth usage.
*   Step 4: Utilize `go-ipfs stats repo` to monitor repository size and storage usage.
*   Step 5: Utilize `go-ipfs swarm peers` and `go-ipfs swarm addrs listen` to monitor peer connections and listening addresses.
*   Step 6: Integrate `go-ipfs` metrics endpoints (if enabled and configured) with external monitoring systems like Prometheus to collect and visualize metrics over time.
*   Step 7: Set up alerts based on log patterns or metric thresholds that indicate suspicious activity or errors.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Security Incident Detection - Severity: High (Logs and monitoring help detect security breaches, attacks, and anomalies in `go-ipfs` node behavior.)
*   Anomaly Detection - Severity: Medium (Monitoring can identify unusual patterns that might indicate attacks or misconfigurations within `go-ipfs`.)
*   Performance Monitoring and Troubleshooting - Severity: Medium (Logs and metrics are essential for diagnosing performance issues and ensuring node stability.)
*   Forensics and Incident Investigation - Severity: Medium (Logs provide data for post-incident analysis and forensic investigations related to `go-ipfs` activity.)

**Impact:**
*   Security Incident Detection: High Reduction (Significantly improves the ability to detect and respond to security incidents affecting `go-ipfs` nodes.)
*   Anomaly Detection: Medium Reduction (Enables proactive identification of potential problems and security threats related to `go-ipfs`.)
*   Performance Monitoring and Troubleshooting: Medium Reduction (Facilitates performance optimization and issue resolution for `go-ipfs` nodes.)
*   Forensics and Incident Investigation: Medium Reduction (Provides data for effective incident analysis and response related to `go-ipfs`.)

**Currently Implemented:**  `go-ipfs` has built-in logging and basic `stats` commands. Metrics endpoints can be enabled and configured.

**Missing Implementation:**  More comprehensive built-in metrics and logging capabilities.  Easier integration with common monitoring and logging tools.  Pre-defined alerts or dashboards for common security and performance indicators within `go-ipfs`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Be Aware of DHT Security Considerations](./mitigation_strategies/be_aware_of_dht_security_considerations.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Understand the different DHT routing types available in `go-ipfs` (`dht`, `dhtclient`, `dhtserver`) and their security implications.
*   Step 2: Configure the `Routing.Type` in `config.toml` based on your node's role and security requirements. Consider using `dhtclient` for nodes that primarily query the DHT and don't actively participate in routing to reduce DHT attack surface.
*   Step 3: Review and adjust other DHT-related configuration options in `config.toml` (under `Routing` and `Swarm`) to fine-tune DHT behavior and security.
*   Step 4: Monitor DHT-related metrics and logs for unusual activity that might indicate DHT attacks or routing issues.
*   Step 5: If DHT security is a major concern, consider alternative content routing mechanisms or rely more heavily on direct peer connections and private networks, minimizing DHT usage.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   DHT Routing Attacks (Sybil, Poisoning, Eclipse) - Severity: Medium (Public DHTs are susceptible to attacks. Awareness and configuration can mitigate some risks, especially by using `dhtclient` mode.)
*   Information Disclosure via DHT - Severity: Low (DHT interactions could potentially leak metadata. Awareness of DHT traffic is important.)
*   DoS via DHT Overload - Severity: Low (DHT can be targeted for DoS. Understanding DHT resource usage and configuration helps mitigate overload risks.)

**Impact:**
*   DHT Routing Attacks (Sybil, Poisoning, Eclipse): Medium Reduction (Configuration and awareness can reduce some DHT attack risks, but public DHT inherently has security challenges.)
*   Information Disclosure via DHT: Low Reduction (Limited impact as DHT primarily stores routing info, but awareness is still important.)
*   DoS via DHT Overload: Low Reduction (DHT is designed to be resilient, but awareness of DoS risks is still relevant.)

**Currently Implemented:**  `go-ipfs` provides different DHT routing types and configuration options related to DHT behavior.

**Missing Implementation:**  More robust DHT security mechanisms within `go-ipfs` core.  Clearer, more accessible documentation and guidance on DHT security best practices and configuration choices for different security needs.  Potentially, alternative, more secure DHT implementations or routing protocols could be explored within `go-ipfs`.
