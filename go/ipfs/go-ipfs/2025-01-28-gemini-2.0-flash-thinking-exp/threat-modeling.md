# Threat Model Analysis for ipfs/go-ipfs

## Threat: [Content Poisoning / CID Spoofing](./threats/content_poisoning__cid_spoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious content into the IPFS network and associates it with a legitimate CID or spoofs a CID to point to malicious content. When an application requests content by CID, it may retrieve and use the malicious data.
*   **Impact:** Application processes malicious content, leading to data corruption, malfunction, or security breaches for users.
*   **Affected go-ipfs component:** Content Routing (DHT, Bitswap), Content Addressing (CID resolution)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Content Verification (application-level checksums, signatures).
    *   Trusted Sources (limit content retrieval to known peers/services).
    *   Content Signing (implement digital signatures for content).
    *   Content Auditing (regularly check content integrity).

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Public IPFS Network](./threats/data_leakage_through_public_ipfs_network.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is stored unencrypted on the public IPFS network. Anyone with the CID can access this data.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, privacy violations, regulatory non-compliance.
*   **Affected go-ipfs component:**  Public IPFS Network (default configuration), Data Publishing
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Encryption before IPFS (encrypt data before adding to IPFS).
    *   Private IPFS Networks (use private networks for sensitive data).
    *   Access Control Lists (explore IPNS with access control or application-level ACLs).
    *   Metadata Privacy (minimize sensitive metadata).

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on IPFS Node](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_on_ipfs_node.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker floods the go-ipfs node with requests, overwhelming resources and making it unresponsive.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, disruption of services relying on IPFS data.
*   **Affected go-ipfs component:**  Networking stack (libp2p), Request Handling
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rate Limiting (limit requests from single IPs/peers).
    *   Resource Limits (configure max connections, memory usage).
    *   Firewall and Network Security (filter malicious traffic).
    *   IPFS Cluster (redundancy with multiple nodes).
    *   Peer Reputation and Blocking (block malicious peers).

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in go-ipfs Core Codebase](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_go-ipfs_core_codebase.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist in the go-ipfs core code, which attackers can exploit to compromise the node or application.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts: remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, etc.
*   **Affected go-ipfs component:**  go-ipfs Core (various modules and functions)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regular go-ipfs Updates (apply security patches promptly).
    *   Security Monitoring and Alerts (monitor for security advisories).
    *   Security Audits (conduct periodic security reviews).
    *   Use Stable Versions (use well-tested go-ipfs versions).

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in go-ipfs Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_go-ipfs_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by go-ipfs indirectly affect the security of the node and application.
*   **Impact:** Similar to core vulnerabilities: data breaches, denial of service, etc.
*   **Affected go-ipfs component:**  Dependencies (indirectly affects go-ipfs)
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Dependency Scanning and Management (use tools to find vulnerabilities).
    *   Keep Dependencies Updated (update go-ipfs dependencies).
    *   Software Composition Analysis (SCA) (continuous dependency monitoring).
    *   Vendor Security Advisories (monitor dependency vendor advisories).
