*   **Threat:** Malicious Command Injection via HTTP API
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious input that, when processed by the application and passed to the `go-ipfs` HTTP API (e.g., through `ipfs.files.cp`, `ipfs.repo.gc`), results in the execution of unintended commands on the server hosting the `go-ipfs` node. This could involve arbitrary file system access, data manipulation, or even remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server hosting the `go-ipfs` node, including data breaches, service disruption, and potential lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Component:** `go-ipfs` HTTP API (specifically endpoints that take path or command arguments).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs before incorporating them into `go-ipfs` API calls.
        *   Avoid constructing API calls by directly concatenating user input. Use parameterized API calls or libraries that handle escaping.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege when interacting with the `go-ipfs` API, only using necessary commands.
        *   Consider running the `go-ipfs` node in a sandboxed environment or container.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Node Information via API
    *   **Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information about the `go-ipfs` node through the HTTP API if it's not properly secured. This could include the node's private key, peer ID, configuration details, or even access tokens if enabled. This information can be used to impersonate the node, disrupt its operation, or gain access to its data.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the `go-ipfs` node identity, potential data breaches, and disruption of services relying on the node.
    *   **Affected Component:** `go-ipfs` HTTP API (specifically endpoints like `/id`, `/config`, `/key/list`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the `go-ipfs` HTTP API.
        *   Restrict access to the API to trusted sources only (e.g., using firewall rules or access control lists).
        *   Avoid exposing the API publicly if possible.
        *   Regularly review and secure the `go-ipfs` configuration.

*   **Threat:** Retrieval of Malicious Content from the IPFS Network
    *   **Description:** An attacker could publish malicious content (e.g., malware, phishing pages, exploit code) on the IPFS network. If the application retrieves and processes this content without proper validation, it could lead to the compromise of the application or the user's system.
    *   **Impact:** Malware infection, data breaches, phishing attacks targeting application users.
    *   **Affected Component:** Bitswap (data exchange protocol), IPFS content addressing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust content validation and sanitization mechanisms before processing data retrieved from IPFS.
        *   Verify content integrity using cryptographic hashes and signatures where available.
        *   Consider using trusted content sources or pinning services.
        *   Isolate the processing of IPFS content to prevent potential harm to the host system (e.g., using sandboxing).
