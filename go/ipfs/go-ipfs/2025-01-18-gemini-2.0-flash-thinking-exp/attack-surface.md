# Attack Surface Analysis for ipfs/go-ipfs

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Poorly Authenticated API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_poorly_authenticated_api_endpoints.md)

**Description:** The `go-ipfs` HTTP API allows interaction with the node. If not properly secured, anyone can access and control the node.

**How go-ipfs Contributes:** `go-ipfs` exposes an HTTP API by default, and if authentication is not explicitly configured and enforced, it's vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker uses `curl` to send a request to an open `go-ipfs` API endpoint to pin malicious content or retrieve sensitive data.

**Impact:** Data manipulation, resource exhaustion (pinning abuse), potential command execution if the API allows it, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if command execution is possible).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable and configure API authentication (e.g., using API keys or JWT).
* Restrict API access to trusted networks or users using firewall rules.
* Regularly review and update API access controls.

## Attack Surface: [API Input Validation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_input_validation_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The `go-ipfs` API accepts various inputs. Insufficient validation can lead to exploits.

**How go-ipfs Contributes:** `go-ipfs` provides API endpoints that process user-supplied data, making it susceptible to injection attacks if input is not sanitized.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious file path in an API request (e.g., using `../`) to access files outside the intended `go-ipfs` data directory (path traversal).

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the `go-ipfs` node, data breaches, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all API endpoints.
* Use parameterized queries or prepared statements where applicable to prevent injection attacks.
* Enforce strict data type and format validation.

## Attack Surface: [Libp2p Networking Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/libp2p_networking_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** `go-ipfs` uses the libp2p networking library, which may have its own vulnerabilities.

**How go-ipfs Contributes:** `go-ipfs` directly integrates and relies on libp2p for peer-to-peer communication, inheriting any vulnerabilities present in libp2p.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a libp2p protocol to perform a denial-of-service attack on the `go-ipfs` node or intercept communication.

**Impact:** Service disruption, potential data interception or manipulation, node compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep `go-ipfs` and its dependencies (including libp2p) updated to the latest versions with security patches.
* Monitor for security advisories related to libp2p and apply necessary updates promptly.
* Configure libp2p settings to minimize exposure to known attack vectors if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Data Corruption or Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/data_corruption_or_poisoning.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject malicious or corrupted data into the IPFS network.

**How go-ipfs Contributes:** `go-ipfs` allows adding and retrieving data to the network. If not properly validated on retrieval, applications can be affected by malicious data.

**Example:** An attacker adds a file with the same CID as a legitimate file but containing malicious content. When an application retrieves this CID, it receives the malicious data.

**Impact:** Serving malicious content to users, application malfunction, potential security breaches if the data is executed or interpreted.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement content verification mechanisms on the application side after retrieving data from IPFS.
* Utilize content provenance and trust models if available.
* Consider using private IPFS networks for sensitive data.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** If `go-ipfs` configuration files are accessible, sensitive information can be exposed.

**How go-ipfs Contributes:** `go-ipfs` stores configuration details, including API keys or private keys, in configuration files.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the `go-ipfs` configuration file and retrieves the API key, allowing them to control the node remotely.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the `go-ipfs` node, potential compromise of the underlying system.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure `go-ipfs` configuration files have appropriate file system permissions, restricting access to authorized users only.
* Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in configuration files if possible; consider using environment variables or secure secrets management.
