## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via go-ipfs](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_go-ipfs.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Any successful exploitation of the go-ipfs dependency that leads to compromising the application falls under this node.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Integrity Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_integrity_issues.md)

**Pin Malicious Content and Force Retrieval:**
    * **Flood Network with Requests for Malicious CID:** An attacker uploads malicious content to IPFS and then attempts to force the application to retrieve it by flooding the network with requests for the malicious CID. The hope is that the application's go-ipfs node will resolve and fetch this malicious content, potentially leading to the application processing or displaying it.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: Medium (Application might process malicious data, resource exhaustion)
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Low
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium

**Content Poisoning via DHT Manipulation:**
    * **Publish False Provider Records:** The Distributed Hash Table (DHT) maps Content Identifiers (CIDs) to the nodes that provide that content. An attacker can publish false records in the DHT, associating a legitimate CID with a node they control that serves malicious data. When the application requests the legitimate content, it might be directed to the attacker's node and receive the malicious data.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High (Serving malicious data to users)
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Medium
        * Detection Difficulty: High

## Attack Tree Path: [Publish Malicious Messages on Relevant Topics](./attack_tree_paths/publish_malicious_messages_on_relevant_topics.md)

If the application subscribes to specific PubSub topics for real-time updates or communication, an attacker can publish malicious messages on those topics. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate the content of these messages, it could lead to various issues, including:
    * **Inject Code or Data into Application Logic Processing PubSub Messages:**  Malicious messages could contain code or data that, when processed by the application, leads to unintended behavior, code execution, or data manipulation within the application's context.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High (Code execution, data manipulation within the application)
        * Effort: Low to Medium
        * Skill Level: Medium
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Local go-ipfs Node](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_local_go-ipfs_node.md)

This node represents attacks targeting the specific go-ipfs node running alongside the application. Successful exploitation here can grant significant control over the node and potentially the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized API Access](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_api_access.md)

If the go-ipfs API is exposed (e.g., on a network interface) without proper authentication or authorization, an attacker can directly interact with the node using API calls. This allows them to perform actions such as:
    * **Exploit Weak or Default API Authentication/Authorization:** Attackers might try default credentials or exploit known vulnerabilities in the API's authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High (Full control over the local go-ipfs node)
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Low to Medium
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Known Vulnerabilities in go-ipfs Core](./attack_tree_paths/known_vulnerabilities_in_go-ipfs_core.md)

Like any software, go-ipfs might have undiscovered or publicly known security vulnerabilities.
    * **Exploit Publicly Disclosed Security Flaws (Requires Keeping go-ipfs Version Outdated):** If the application is using an outdated version of go-ipfs, attackers can exploit publicly disclosed security flaws for which exploits might be readily available. These vulnerabilities could range from denial of service to remote code execution.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High (Depends on the specific vulnerability, could be RCE, DoS, etc.)
        * Effort: Low to Medium
        * Skill Level: Low to Medium
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Flood Application's go-ipfs Node with Connection Requests](./attack_tree_paths/flood_application's_go-ipfs_node_with_connection_requests.md)

An attacker can overwhelm the application's go-ipfs node by sending a large number of connection requests. This can exhaust the node's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), leading to a denial of service where the node becomes unresponsive or crashes.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: Medium (Denial of service for the application's IPFS node)
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Low
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium
