# Threat Model Analysis for ipfs/go-ipfs

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to go-ipfs API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_go-ipfs_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the go-ipfs HTTP API (or other APIs like the CLI or Go API if exposed). This could be achieved through exposed ports, weak authentication, or compromised credentials. The attacker could then use API calls to manipulate the local go-ipfs node. For example, they might add malicious content, pin unwanted data, unpin critical data, or retrieve sensitive information stored locally.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, injection of malicious content into the IPFS network through the node, denial of service by overloading the node, exposure of locally stored sensitive data.
*   **Affected Component:** HTTP API, CLI API, Go API
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable and enforce authentication for the go-ipfs API (e.g., using API tokens).
    *   Restrict access to the API to only authorized processes or users on the local machine or trusted network.
    *   Use firewall rules to block external access to the go-ipfs API port.
    *   Regularly rotate API tokens.
    *   Avoid exposing the API publicly without strong authentication.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Local go-ipfs Configuration](./threats/manipulation_of_local_go-ipfs_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the go-ipfs configuration files (typically located in the `.ipfs` directory). They could modify settings to compromise the node's security or functionality. This might involve changing listening addresses, disabling security features, altering peer discovery settings, or modifying resource limits.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data (e.g., private keys), denial of service, network disruption, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks if peer discovery is manipulated, resource exhaustion.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration Subsystem
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the file system permissions of the go-ipfs configuration directory to restrict access to authorized users only.
    *   Run the go-ipfs process under a dedicated user with minimal privileges.
    *   Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized changes to the configuration files.
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the configuration if possible; use secure secrets management.

## Threat: [Retrieval of Malicious Content from the IPFS Network](./threats/retrieval_of_malicious_content_from_the_ipfs_network.md)

*   **Description:** The application retrieves content from the IPFS network based on a CID (Content Identifier). An attacker could publish malicious content to IPFS and, if the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize this content, it could lead to vulnerabilities. This could involve retrieving files containing malware, scripts for cross-site scripting (XSS), or data designed to exploit application logic flaws.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, remote code execution (if the content is executed by the application), data corruption within the application, exposure of user data if malicious scripts are executed in the user's browser.
*   **Affected Component:** Bitswap (data retrieval), Content Addressing (CID resolution)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict content validation and sanitization on all data retrieved from IPFS before processing or displaying it.
    *   Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of scripts from untrusted sources.
    *   Consider using a trusted gateway or pinning service for critical content to reduce the risk of retrieving malicious content.
    *   Implement checksum verification of retrieved content against known good values if available.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data Through Public IPFS](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_through_public_ipfs.md)

*   **Description:** The application might inadvertently publish sensitive data to the public IPFS network. Once data is added to IPFS, it is generally publicly accessible to anyone who knows the CID. This could happen due to incorrect application logic, misconfiguration, or a misunderstanding of IPFS's public nature.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, privacy violations, potential legal repercussions depending on the nature of the exposed data.
*   **Affected Component:**  `ipfs add` command/functionality, Bitswap (data distribution)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully consider what data is being added to IPFS. Avoid adding sensitive or private information directly.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data before adding it to IPFS.
    *   Utilize private IPFS networks or encryption mechanisms for confidential information.
    *   Implement thorough code reviews to ensure sensitive data is not inadvertently added to IPFS.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in go-ipfs Dependencies](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_go-ipfs_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** go-ipfs relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the go-ipfs node or the application.
*   **Impact:**  Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*   **Affected Component:**  Various (depending on the vulnerable dependency)
*   **Risk Severity:**  Varies (can be Critical to Low depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the go-ipfs installation up-to-date with the latest versions, which often include patched dependencies.
    *   Regularly audit the go-ipfs dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for go-ipfs and its dependencies.
