## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Known go-ipfs Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_known_go-ipfs_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in `go-ipfs` or its underlying `libp2p` library.
*   **Sequence:**
    *   The attacker first identifies the specific version of `go-ipfs` being used by the target application. This can be done through various reconnaissance techniques, such as examining HTTP headers, API responses, or by inducing error messages that reveal version information.
    *   Once the version is known, the attacker searches for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities affecting that version. Databases like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) or GitHub security advisories are common resources.
    *   If a relevant vulnerability is found, the attacker attempts to exploit it. This might involve using existing exploit code, adapting publicly available exploits, or developing a custom exploit.
    *   Successful exploitation can lead to various outcomes, including remote code execution on the server running the `go-ipfs` node, denial of service, or the ability to manipulate the node's state.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit go-ipfs API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_go-ipfs_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting vulnerabilities in the `go-ipfs` HTTP API.
*   **Sequence:**
    *   The attacker identifies that the application exposes the `go-ipfs` API.
    *   **Unauthorized API Access:**
        *   The attacker attempts to bypass or exploit weaknesses in the authentication or authorization mechanisms protecting the API. This could involve exploiting default credentials, brute-forcing credentials, exploiting flaws in custom authentication implementations, or leveraging missing authentication on certain endpoints.
        *   Upon successful bypass, the attacker can execute privileged API calls, potentially gaining full control over the `go-ipfs` node.
    *   **API Parameter Tampering:**
        *   The attacker analyzes the API endpoints and parameters used by the application.
        *   They then attempt to manipulate these parameters in malicious ways, such as providing unexpected data types, exceeding size limits, injecting malicious code, or accessing resources they should not have access to.
        *   Successful parameter tampering can trigger vulnerable code paths within `go-ipfs`, leading to various outcomes like information disclosure, denial of service, or even remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Malicious Content Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_malicious_content_injection.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious content into the IPFS network that the application subsequently retrieves and processes.
*   **Sequence:**
    *   The attacker publishes malicious content to the IPFS network. This is a relatively straightforward process as IPFS is permissionless for publishing content. The attacker can choose a known or predictable CID or rely on other methods for the application to discover the malicious content.
    *   The application, due to its design or logic, retrieves this malicious content from IPFS. This could be triggered by user actions, automated processes, or other events.
    *   The application's logic then processes the retrieved content. If the application lacks proper validation, sanitization, or security measures, the malicious content can be interpreted and executed, leading to compromise. This could involve executing malicious scripts, displaying harmful content to users, or manipulating the application's internal state.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Data Poisoning via IPFS](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_data_poisoning_via_ipfs.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting or manipulating data within IPFS that the application relies on for its functionality or decision-making.
*   **Sequence:**
    *   The attacker identifies data within IPFS that the target application uses. This could be configuration files, user data, application logic, or any other data stored on IPFS.
    *   The attacker injects malicious data or manipulates existing data within IPFS. This could involve publishing new malicious content, modifying existing content (if the attacker has the necessary keys or if the content is mutable), or leveraging vulnerabilities in IPFS or the application's data handling.
    *   The application subsequently retrieves and consumes this poisoned data. If the application lacks robust data validation and integrity checks, it will act upon the malicious data. This can lead to various consequences, such as incorrect application behavior, data corruption, unauthorized actions, or even security breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit go-ipfs Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_go-ipfs_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Why Critical:** This node represents the direct exploitation of weaknesses within the core `go-ipfs` software. Successful exploitation at this point can grant the attacker significant control over the `go-ipfs` node and the application it supports.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Includes both exploiting known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and discovering and exploiting logic flaws within the `go-ipfs` implementation itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Application Logic Through IPFS Interaction](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_application_logic_through_ipfs_interaction.md)

*   **Why Critical:** This node highlights the inherent risks in relying on externally sourced data (from IPFS) without proper security considerations. Successful attacks targeting this node indicate fundamental flaws in how the application integrates with IPFS.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Encompasses various methods of manipulating IPFS data to influence the application's behavior, including malicious content injection, data poisoning, and potentially manipulating control flow if the application relies on IPFS for code or configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Known go-ipfs Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_known_go-ipfs_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Why Critical:**  The existence of known, exploitable vulnerabilities provides a readily available attack vector for malicious actors.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Focuses on leveraging publicly documented weaknesses in `go-ipfs` or its dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit go-ipfs API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_go-ipfs_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Why Critical:** The `go-ipfs` API provides a direct interface for controlling the IPFS node. Compromising this API grants significant power to the attacker.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Includes unauthorized access due to weak authentication and exploiting vulnerabilities in how the API handles requests and parameters.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Data Poisoning via IPFS](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_data_poisoning_via_ipfs.md)

*   **Why Critical:**  Data integrity is fundamental to application security. Successfully poisoning data within IPFS can have cascading effects throughout the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Involves injecting or manipulating data within IPFS that the application trusts and acts upon.
