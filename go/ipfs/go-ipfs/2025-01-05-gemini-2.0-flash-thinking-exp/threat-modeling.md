# Threat Model Analysis for ipfs/go-ipfs

## Threat: [Content Poisoning](./threats/content_poisoning.md)

**Description:** An attacker publishes malicious or incorrect content to the IPFS network. They then share the Content Identifier (CID) of this malicious content, potentially tricking users or the application into retrieving and using it. The attacker leverages the immutability of content once published to ensure the malicious content remains accessible via its CID.

**Impact:** Users may access and interact with harmful data, leading to malware infection, misinformation spread, data corruption within the application, or reputational damage if the application serves this poisoned content.

**Affected Component:** Bitswap (for content retrieval), Core API (for publishing).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement content verification mechanisms beyond just the CID, such as cryptographic signatures from trusted sources.
*   Utilize IPNS or DNSLink with trusted signers for mutable content pointers, allowing for updates and revocation.
*   Implement reputation systems or trust networks to evaluate the trustworthiness of content publishers.
*   For sensitive applications, consider using private IPFS networks or end-to-end encryption on content.

## Threat: [API Vulnerabilities in `go-ipfs`](./threats/api_vulnerabilities_in__go-ipfs_.md)

**Description:** The `go-ipfs` library itself may contain security vulnerabilities in its API or core functionality. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the node, execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial-of-service.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the `go-ipfs` node and potentially the system it's running on. Data breaches, service disruption, and malicious code execution are possible.

**Affected Component:** Various API endpoints and core modules of `go-ipfs`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep the `go-ipfs` library updated to the latest stable version.** Regularly check for security updates and apply them promptly.
*   Follow security best practices when interacting with the `go-ipfs` API, such as validating inputs and avoiding insecure configurations.
*   Monitor the `go-ipfs` project's security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Mutable Data Manipulation (If Using IPNS/DNSLink)](./threats/mutable_data_manipulation__if_using_ipnsdnslink_.md)

**Description:** If the application uses IPNS or DNSLink for mutable content pointers, an attacker who compromises the private key associated with the IPNS name or DNSLink domain can redirect the pointer to malicious content.

**Impact:** Users accessing the mutable pointer will be directed to the attacker's content, potentially leading to content poisoning, phishing attacks, or malware distribution.

**Affected Component:** IPNS, DNSLink resolution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Securely manage and protect the private keys associated with IPNS names.** Use strong password protection or hardware security modules.
*   Implement multi-signature schemes for IPNS updates to require authorization from multiple parties.
*   Regularly audit and rotate IPNS keys if feasible.
*   For DNSLink, follow standard DNS security best practices, including DNSSEC.

## Threat: [Privacy Leakage (Public Network Exposure)](./threats/privacy_leakage__public_network_exposure_.md)

**Description:** The application stores sensitive or private data directly on the public IPFS network without proper encryption. Anyone with the CID of this data can access it.

**Impact:** Confidential information is exposed to unauthorized individuals, potentially leading to data breaches, identity theft, or other privacy violations.

**Affected Component:** Blockstore (if unencrypted data is stored).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always encrypt sensitive data before storing it on IPFS.** Use strong encryption algorithms.
*   Avoid storing highly sensitive data on the public IPFS network altogether. Consider private IPFS networks or alternative storage solutions for such data.
*   Be mindful of metadata associated with IPFS content, as it might reveal information even if the content itself is encrypted.
