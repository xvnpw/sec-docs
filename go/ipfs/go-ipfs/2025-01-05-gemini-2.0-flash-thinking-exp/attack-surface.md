# Attack Surface Analysis for ipfs/go-ipfs

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Remote API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_remote_api_access.md)

**Description:** The `go-ipfs` API, by default, can be accessed remotely if the listening address is not restricted. Without proper authentication, anyone who can reach the API endpoint can control the IPFS node.

**How go-ipfs Contributes:** `go-ipfs` provides an HTTP API for managing the node. If this API is exposed without authentication, it becomes a direct entry point for attackers.

**Example:** An attacker uses `curl` or a similar tool to send API requests to add, pin, or remove content, or even shut down the IPFS node.

**Impact:** Full control over the IPFS node, including data manipulation, resource exhaustion, and denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure the `go-ipfs` API to listen only on `localhost` or specific trusted IP addresses using the `--api` flag during node initialization or in the configuration file.
*   Enable and configure API authentication using API tokens or other authentication mechanisms provided by `go-ipfs`.
*   Use a firewall to restrict access to the API port (default 5001) to only trusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Open Gateway Serving Malicious Content](./attack_surfaces/open_gateway_serving_malicious_content.md)

**Description:** The `go-ipfs` Gateway allows accessing content stored on the IPFS network through HTTP. If the Gateway is publicly accessible, attackers can use it to serve malicious content.

**How go-ipfs Contributes:** `go-ipfs` provides a built-in Gateway functionality. If not properly configured, it can be accessed by anyone.

**Example:** An attacker uploads malware to IPFS and then uses the publicly accessible Gateway to distribute it by sharing the Gateway URL.

**Impact:** Distribution of malware, phishing attacks, serving illegal content, and reputational damage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict access to the `go-ipfs` Gateway using firewall rules to only allow access from trusted sources or disable it entirely if not needed.
*   Implement content filtering or scanning mechanisms on your application layer before serving content retrieved from IPFS via the Gateway.
*   Inform users that content accessed via the public Gateway is not necessarily vetted or trustworthy.

## Attack Surface: [Local File System Access via API](./attack_surfaces/local_file_system_access_via_api.md)

**Description:** Certain `go-ipfs` API endpoints allow interacting with the local file system where the IPFS repository is stored. If these endpoints are accessible without proper authorization, attackers could potentially access or modify sensitive files.

**How go-ipfs Contributes:** `go-ipfs` needs to manage its local storage, and some API endpoints expose functionality related to this.

**Example:** An attacker uses the API to list files in the repository or potentially import malicious files into the IPFS data store.

**Impact:**  Access to sensitive data within the IPFS repository, potential for data corruption or injection.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the API is properly authenticated and only accessible to authorized users or processes.
*   Run the `go-ipfs` process with minimal necessary privileges.
*   Regularly audit the security of the server hosting the `go-ipfs` node.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

**Description:** `go-ipfs` relies on various third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can introduce security risks.

**How go-ipfs Contributes:** `go-ipfs` integrates these libraries for various functionalities.

**Example:** A known vulnerability exists in a specific version of a networking library used by `go-ipfs`. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or cause a denial of service.

**Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, ranging from denial of service to remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be critical)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update `go-ipfs` to benefit from updates to its dependencies.
*   Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in the libraries used by `go-ipfs`.
*   Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
