## Combined Vulnerability List for fsnotify project

- **Vulnerability Name:** Symlink TOCTOU Race Vulnerability in Watcher Registration

- **Description:**
  The fsnotify library’s default behavior in its Add/AddWith methods automatically resolves (or “follows”) symbolic links. When a watch is added for a given path, the code uses functions such as os.Stat (in backends like fen) or calls the OS’s inotify API without the “don’t follow” flag (in the inotify backend). An attacker with write permissions in the watched directory may prepare a benign–looking symlink (e.g. “link.txt”) that initially points to a safe file. When the application (running with fsnotify) registers a watch on that symlink, the library resolves it and registers a watch on its target (say, “benign.txt”). However, immediately afterward the attacker can atomically replace or repoint the symlink so that it now points to a sensitive (or attacker‑controlled) file. Subsequent modifications to that sensitive file will then trigger events on the watcher, potentially causing the application to process data from a file it did not expect to watch.

  *Step‑by‑step trigger demonstration:*
  1. An application (or service) calls Add("link.txt") on a directory that an attacker can write to.
  2. Initially, “link.txt” is a symlink pointing to “benign.txt”. The backend (for example, in the Linux/inotify or Solaris/FEN code) calls os.Stat to resolve “link.txt” and then registers a watch on “benign.txt”.
  3. After the watch is registered—but before or during normal event processing—the attacker quickly replaces “link.txt” so that it points to “sensitive.txt” (or some other file that should not be watched).
  4. Later, when “sensitive.txt” is modified, the underlying OS delivers an event that is attributed to the watch registered for “benign.txt” (now effectively “sensitive.txt” from the standpoint of the symlink). The application then receives an event whose Name field corresponds to the sensitive file even though the watch was originally added on the symlink.

- **Impact:**
  Depending on how the application uses the event information, an attacker may be able to:
  • Cause the application to monitor files outside the intended scope (information disclosure).
  • Influence application logic that trusts the file path received in events (for example, by reading or acting on unintended file content).
  If the application blindly acts on events (for example, by auto‑processing a file it “sees”), the TOCTOU race can indirectly lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information or even further compromise if downstream components assume the file is safe.

- **Vulnerability Rank:**
  High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • Some backends (for example, the FEN backend) include logic that distinguishes between explicitly watched directories and files and resolve symlinks only when explicitly requested.
  • A previous patch (v1.5.1) removed an “AddRaw” method intended to avoid following symlinks.
  • Documentation (in the README and FAQ) advises against watching individual files and warns about limitations with symlinks.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  • **No default “don’t follow” option:** By default the Add/AddWith methods do not set an option (such as WithNoFollow) so that symlinks are preserved in user‑provided form. Instead, they use the OS’s default behavior (which follows links).
  • **Lack of atomicity:** There is no protection against a TOCTOU race after the file’s symlink has been resolved. Even if the function correctly calls os.Stat or adds a watch, there is a window between (a) resolving the symlink and (b) processing incoming events when the symlink target may change.
  • **Insufficient caller guidance:** Although documentation mentions that watching individual files can be problematic, there is no prominent security note to encourage users to use WithNoFollow (which inserts the IN_DONT_FOLLOW flag on Linux) or other OS-specific measures to explicitly guard against symlink races.

- **Preconditions:**
  • The directory where the watch is added must be writable by an attacker.
  • The application (or service) must add a watch on a path that is a symbolic link without explicitly disabling symlink following (i.e. not using a WithNoFollow option).
  • The attacker must be able to atomically change the symlink’s target after the watch is registered.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  • In the Linux/inotify backend (see `backend_inotify.go`), the function `AddWith` calls a helper `w.add(path, with, false)`.
  • In `w.add(…)`, if the WithNoFollow option is not provided (the default), no flag is added to prevent symlink resolution (e.g. the `unix.IN_DONT_FOLLOW` flag is omitted). Consequently, when `unix.InotifyAddWatch` is executed, the OS follows the symlink and registers a watch on the target file.
  • In the Solaris/FEN backend (`backend_fen.go`), the code calls `os.Stat(name)` without using `os.Lstat`. Since os.Stat follows symlinks, a similar race exists here.
  • The window between the check (symlink resolution) and the actual event processing leaves an opportunity for the symlink target to be swapped—making it a classic TOCTOU vulnerability.
  *Visualization of the race:*
  1. Application invokes `Add("link.txt")`.
  2. `os.Stat("link.txt")` returns file information for “benign.txt”.
  3. The watch is registered on “benign.txt”.
  4. The attacker quickly replaces “link.txt” to point to “sensitive.txt”.
  5. Changes on “sensitive.txt” now trigger notifications though the watch was intended for “benign.txt”.

- **Security Test Case:**
  *Test Objective:* Demonstrate that a watch added on a symlink can be “tricked” into monitoring an unintended file when the symlink’s target is changed after registration.
  1. **Test Setup:**
     - Create a temporary directory (e.g. `/tmp/testwatch`).
     - Create a benign file (e.g. `/tmp/testwatch/benign.txt`) with innocuous content.
     - Create a sensitive file (e.g. `/tmp/testwatch/sensitive.txt`) containing secret data.
     - Create a symlink (`/tmp/testwatch/link.txt`) pointing to `benign.txt`.
     - Using fsnotify (without specifying WithNoFollow), add a watch on the symlink `"link.txt"` (for example, via:
       `w, _ := fsnotify.NewWatcher()`
       `w.Add("link.txt")`).
  2. **Attack Simulation:**
     - After the watch is in place, have an external process (or a goroutine running with write permissions) change the symlink so that `/tmp/testwatch/link.txt` now points to `sensitive.txt`.
     - Make a change (for example, overwrite or append data) to `sensitive.txt`.
  3. **Observation:**
     - The test harness reads from the fsnotify.Events channel and checks the event’s Name field.
     - If the event is reported with a path corresponding to `sensitive.txt` (or the resolved canonical path of `sensitive.txt`), then the test has succeeded in demonstrating the TOCTOU exploitation.
  4. **Expected Result:**
     - The test should capture an event (typically “Write” or “Create”) whose Name is the sensitive file rather than the originally intended benign file, confirming that the TOCTOU window was exploitable.

- **Vulnerability Name:** File Descriptor Leak in kqueue Backend

- **Description:**
  A file descriptor leak exists in the kqueue backend.

  *Step‑by‑step trigger demonstration:*
  1. Start watching files using kqueue backend.
  2. Trigger events that cause file descriptor usage to increase.
  3. Observe file descriptors are not properly released after events are processed.
  4. Repeated triggering of events leads to exhaustion of file descriptors.

- **Impact:**
  Denial of Service. Exhaustion of file descriptors can lead to application crashing or becoming unresponsive.

- **Vulnerability Rank:**
  High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  This vulnerability is mitigated in version 1.8.0. The fix likely involves ensuring proper closing of file descriptors in the kqueue backend after event processing.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  Users of versions prior to 1.8.0 are vulnerable and should upgrade.

- **Preconditions:**
  Application must be running on a system using the kqueue backend (e.g., macOS, FreeBSD). The application must be processing file system events using fsnotify.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  (Source code analysis details are not provided in the original text, but would typically involve examining the kqueue backend code in `backend_kqueue.go` to identify where file descriptors are opened and if they are correctly closed in all code paths, especially error paths and event handling loops.)

- **Security Test Case:**
  *Test Objective:* Demonstrate file descriptor leak in kqueue backend in vulnerable versions.
  1. **Test Setup:**
     - Run an application using fsnotify on macOS or FreeBSD, specifically targeting a version before 1.8.0.
     - Configure the application to watch a directory with many files or a directory where file events are frequently generated.
     - Monitor the number of open file descriptors used by the application. Tools like `lsof` or `procfs` can be used.
  2. **Attack Simulation:**
     - Generate file system events in the watched directory (e.g., create, modify, delete files rapidly).
     - Observe the file descriptor count over time.
  3. **Observation:**
     - In vulnerable versions, the file descriptor count will steadily increase with event generation and will not decrease, indicating a leak.
  4. **Expected Result:**
     - The file descriptor count should show a continuous increase, eventually leading to a point where the application may fail to open new files or system resources, demonstrating the file descriptor leak and potential for denial of service.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Race Condition in Watcher.Remove on Windows

- **Description:**
  A potential race condition exists in the `Watcher.Remove` function on Windows.

  *Step‑by‑step trigger demonstration:*
  1. Start watching files on Windows.
  2. Rapidly add and remove watches on the same path or overlapping paths.
  3. Concurrent operations in `Watcher.Remove` may lead to inconsistent state.

- **Impact:**
  Unpredictable behavior, potential for missed events, or watcher malfunction.  Likely to be low to medium severity.

- **Vulnerability Rank:**
  Medium

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  No specific mitigations mentioned in the original text. It is unclear if there are any mitigations in place.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  Synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes or channels) within the `Watcher.Remove` function in the Windows backend (`backend_windows.go`) may be needed to prevent race conditions when modifying internal watcher state concurrently.

- **Preconditions:**
  Application must be running on Windows.  The application must be frequently adding and removing watches, especially on the same or related paths.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  (Source code analysis details are not provided in the original text, but would involve reviewing the `Watcher.Remove` function in `backend_windows.go`. Look for sections where internal data structures related to watches are modified without proper synchronization, especially when concurrent calls to `Remove` might occur alongside other watcher operations.)

- **Security Test Case:**
  *Test Objective:* Demonstrate a race condition in `Watcher.Remove` on Windows under concurrent operations.
  1. **Test Setup:**
     - Run an application using fsnotify on Windows.
     - Design a test scenario where watches are added and removed rapidly in multiple goroutines or threads, targeting the same or overlapping file paths.
  2. **Attack Simulation:**
     - Execute the concurrent add and remove operations.
     - Monitor the application's behavior and event handling to detect any inconsistencies or errors.
  3. **Observation:**
     - Look for scenarios where events are missed, or the watcher stops functioning correctly after rapid add/remove operations, which might indicate a race condition leading to corrupted internal state.
  4. **Expected Result:**
     - Under heavy concurrent add and remove operations, the test might reveal scenarios where the watcher behaves erratically or fails to deliver events as expected, suggesting a race condition in `Watcher.Remove`.

- **Vulnerability Name:** No high-rank vulnerabilities found exploitable by external attackers in publicly available instance

- **Description:**
  After a detailed review of the provided files, no vulnerabilities of high rank or above were identified that could be triggered by an external attacker against a publicly available instance of an application using the `fsnotify` library. The analysis specifically considered scenarios where an external attacker could interact with a deployed application that utilizes `fsnotify`. The focus was on identifying attack vectors accessible through public interfaces and excluding vulnerabilities that are: due to insecure usage by developers, related to missing documentation, or are denial-of-service in nature. The command-line utilities within the `cmd/fsnotify` directory are intended for demonstration and development purposes, and are not designed to be exposed as public services. The core library functionality is focused on providing file system event notifications to Go applications, and its security relies on the secure implementation of the applications that consume it.

- **Impact:**
  No high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers in publicly available instances were found. Therefore, there is no immediate high-severity security impact related to publicly accessible applications utilizing the `fsnotify` library based on the analyzed code.

- **Vulnerability Rank:**
  Low

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  N/A - No high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers in publicly available instances were identified in the analyzed code. The project's nature as a library, rather than a standalone publicly facing application, inherently limits the direct attack surface. Standard secure coding practices within the library contribute to overall security.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  N/A - Given that no high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers in publicly available instances were identified, there are no specific missing mitigations in this context. However, continuous security reviews and code analysis are always recommended, especially as the library evolves and is integrated into various applications.  If applications using `fsnotify` are exposed publicly, the security of those applications should be independently assessed, focusing on how they handle file paths and events received from `fsnotify`.

- **Preconditions:**
  N/A - No high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers in publicly available instances were identified that require specific preconditions from the perspective of an external attacker targeting a publicly accessible application.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  The source code review specifically targeted areas that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers in publicly available applications. This included:
    - **API Surface (`fsnotify.go`):** Analyzed the public API of the `fsnotify` library to identify any functions that could be misused by an application in a way that creates a vulnerability when exposed publicly. No such misuse leading to high-rank vulnerabilities was identified within the library itself.
    - **Command-line Utilities (`cmd/fsnotify/*`):** Examined the command-line utilities for potential vulnerabilities like command injection or path traversal if they were to be inadvertently exposed publicly. It was determined that these tools are intended for development and debugging, and are not designed for public exposure. Their functionality is limited and does not inherently create high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers against a deployed application using the `fsnotify` library.
    - **Operating System Backends (`backend_*_test.go`, `internal/*`):** Reviewed OS-specific backend implementations and internal helper functions for any unsafe system calls or operations that could be triggered remotely. No exploitable paths leading to high-rank vulnerabilities accessible to external attackers in publicly available applications were found. The focus was on ensuring that file paths and event data are handled securely within the library's core logic and OS interactions.

  The analysis concluded that while there might be potential for vulnerabilities if applications *misuse* the `fsnotify` library in their own code, the library itself, based on the reviewed files and considering the context of external attackers and publicly available instances, does not introduce high-rank vulnerabilities. The command-line tools are not intended for public deployment, and the library's core functionality is to provide file system notifications, which in itself does not present a direct high-rank vulnerability when correctly used in a secure application context.

- **Security Test Case:**
  N/A - As no high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers in publicly available instances were identified, there are no specific security test cases to demonstrate such vulnerabilities in the context of the `fsnotify` project itself.  Security testing for applications using `fsnotify` should focus on the application's specific logic and how it handles file system events, ensuring that it does not introduce vulnerabilities through its own implementation when using the library. For the `fsnotify` project itself, testing primarily focuses on functional correctness and ensuring that file system events are accurately and reliably reported across different operating systems, rather than on directly exploitable high-rank security vulnerabilities from external attackers targeting public instances of the `fsnotify` project (which is not deployed as a public instance itself).
