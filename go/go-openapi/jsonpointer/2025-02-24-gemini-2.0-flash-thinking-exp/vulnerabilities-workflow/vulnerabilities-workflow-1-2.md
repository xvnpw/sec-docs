Based on the provided instructions, here is the updated list of vulnerabilities, filtered and formatted as requested:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Information Disclosure via Detailed Error Messages  
  **Description:**  
  • When processing a JSON pointer string (for example in the functions used by `Get` and helper function `getSingleImpl`), the library returns error messages that include internal details such as actual field names (e.g., “object has no field %q”) and exact array bounds (e.g., “index out of bounds array[0,%d] index '%d'”).  
  • An attacker who is able to supply malicious or non‐existent pointer strings (for instance, `/nonexistentField` or `/foo/999`) will trigger these error messages.  
  • The attacker can then repeatedly probe with different pointer strings to enumerate the internal structure of the JSON document (including field names and valid index ranges).  

  **Impact:**  
  • Reveals internal schema details and data structure information that can help an attacker craft further targeted attacks.  
  • May expose sensitive field names or boundaries that, if known, could be exploited in a subsequent attack (e.g. tailoring pointer strings to access or modify critical data).  

  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  • The library consistently returns error messages (for missing fields or out-of-bounds index errors) without any additional processing. These messages are generated “as is” inside functions like `getSingleImpl` and in slice handling logic.  

  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • A generic error response should be provided instead of detailed internal messages.  
  • The library (or its caller in an integration context) should sanitize errors so that precise internal information (such as field names or exact index ranges) is not leaked in responses to external clients.  

  **Preconditions:**  
  • An attacker must be able to supply JSON pointer strings (for example via a publicly accessible API endpoint) that reach the library’s pointer-processing functions.  
  • The application must reflect error messages directly back to the requester without proper sanitization.  

  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  • In `getSingleImpl`, when a field or key is not found, an error is returned with a message such as “object has no field %q” or “object has no key %q”, thus exposing the original token that was supplied.  
  • The slice handling branch returns an error stating “index out of bounds array[0,%d] index '%d'” when the supplied index is not valid.  
  • There is no post‐processing of these error messages to remove or mask internal implementation details.  

  **Security Test Case:**  
  • **Step 1:** Deploy an API endpoint that uses the JSON pointer library (for example, an endpoint that retrieves parts of a JSON document based on a user‑supplied pointer string).  
  • **Step 2:** Send HTTP requests with crafted JSON pointers—for instance, `/nonexistentField` or `/foo/999`—where the pointer does not match any valid field or element.  
  • **Step 3:** Observe the error responses returned by the endpoint.  
  • **Step 4:** Verify that these responses contain detailed internal data (such as specific field names or exact bounds) rather than a generic error message.  
  • **Expected Outcome:** If the responses include internal schema details, the vulnerability is confirmed.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary JSON Document Modification via Unauthenticated JSON Pointer Set Operation  
  **Description:**  
  • The library provides a `Set` function that accepts a JSON pointer (parsed into tokens) together with a new value and then—using reflection—updates the target area in the given JSON document (be it a struct, map, or slice).  
  • When an attacker can control the JSON pointer string and the value (for example, through an externally exposed endpoint), they may supply a pointer that targets sensitive fields (for example, `/admin/password`).  
  • Because the library does not perform any authorization or additional validation on what fields may be modified, this pointer string is used directly to locate and update a portion of the document.  

  **Impact:**  
  • An attacker could modify critical parts of an application’s data store if the library is used in an API that does not adequately enforce access control.  
  • This may lead to unauthorized changes (for example, overwriting sensitive configuration values or user credentials), resulting in privilege escalation, data integrity loss, or further compromise of the system.  

  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  • The library itself makes no effort to restrict modifications—it assumes that any necessary authentication, authorization, or input validation is handled by the consuming application.  

  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • The calling application (or an enhancement in the library) must enforce strict access controls and validate pointer paths before performing any modification operations.  
  • Input validation routines (or white‐listing of modifiable fields) should be implemented so that JSON pointer updates cannot target unauthorized fields.  

  **Preconditions:**  
  • The application must expose an API endpoint that accepts a JSON pointer and a new value and then calls the library’s `Set` function.  
  • No upstream authorization or input validation is performed on the JSON pointer strings and associated data provided by external users.  

  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  • In the `Set` method (and its helper function `set`), the JSON pointer string is parsed into tokens which are then used to iteratively walk the JSON structure.  
  • The helper function `setSingleImpl` employs reflection (for example, via `fld.Set(reflect.ValueOf(data))`) to update the field corresponding to each token. There are no checks to ensure that the field being modified is authorized for update.  
  • The library relies entirely on the integration (or the caller) to enforce any restrictions on what may be updated.  

  **Security Test Case:**  
  • **Step 1:** Set up an API endpoint that accepts a complete JSON document, a JSON pointer string, and a new value; this endpoint uses the library’s `Set` function to update the JSON document.  
  • **Step 2:** As an attacker, send a request with a JSON pointer such as `/admin/password` along with a value that you control.  
  • **Step 3:** After the update, query the document (via another endpoint) to confirm that the sensitive field (in this case, the admin password) has been altered.  
  • **Step 4:** Confirm that no authorization or input validation prevented the modification.  
  • **Expected Outcome:** If the sensitive field is modified without proper authorization, the vulnerability is confirmed.
