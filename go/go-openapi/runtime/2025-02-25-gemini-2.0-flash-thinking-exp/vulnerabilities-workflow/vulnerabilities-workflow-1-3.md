Okay, I understand the instructions. You've provided an empty vulnerability list and stated that no high-rank vulnerabilities were found that meet the specified criteria.

Based on your description, it seems you've already applied the filtering rules and concluded that no high-rank vulnerabilities meeting the inclusion criteria exist within the "PROJECT FILES" and are triggerable by an external attacker on a public instance, while excluding DoS, developer-introduced insecure code patterns and documentation issues.

Therefore, based on the information you provided, the updated vulnerability list remains empty and the explanation you provided is accurate.

```markdown
## Vulnerability List

This is a list of potential vulnerabilities identified in the PROJECT FILES.

There are no high-rank vulnerabilities found in the provided PROJECT FILES that are introduced by the project itself and are triggerable by an external attacker in a publicly available instance, while excluding DoS, insecure code usage by developers, and missing documentation issues.

It's possible that vulnerabilities exist but require deeper code analysis and potentially dynamic testing, which is beyond the scope of static analysis on this limited set of files.

**Empty vulnerability list as no high-rank vulnerabilities were identified based on the provided files and constraints.**
