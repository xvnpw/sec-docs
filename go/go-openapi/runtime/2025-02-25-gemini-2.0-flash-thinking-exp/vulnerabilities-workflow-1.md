## Combined Vulnerability List

This is a combined list of vulnerabilities identified from the provided lists, with duplicates removed.

### Vulnerability 1: Path Traversal or Routing Bypass due to Composite Path Parameter Parsing

* Description:
    The `middleware/router.go` file contains a function `decodeCompositParams` that attempts to handle non-standard composite path parameters. This function recursively parses path segments after a standard path parameter (defined using curly braces `{}`). The parsing logic in `decodeCompositParams` is complex and potentially vulnerable to path traversal or routing bypass. By crafting a URL with specific composite path parameter patterns, an attacker might be able to manipulate the routing mechanism to access unintended endpoints or bypass security checks. This is because the custom parsing logic might not correctly sanitize or validate the path, potentially leading to interpretation issues in the routing decision.

    **Step-by-step trigger:**
    1. Identify an API endpoint that uses path parameters and is routed using `go-openapi/runtime/middleware/router`.
    2. Craft a URL that includes a standard path parameter followed by a composite parameter pattern that can be misinterpreted by the `decodeCompositParams` function. For example, if a path pattern is `/user/{username}/profile{/fragment}` and the code uses `decodeCompositParams` to parse `/fragment`, try to inject path traversal characters like `../` or manipulate the fragment part in a way that it alters the effective path used for routing after the composite parameter parsing.
    3. Send the crafted request to the application.
    4. Observe if the application routes the request to an unexpected handler or bypasses intended routing constraints, indicating a potential path traversal or routing bypass.

* Impact:
    - **High**: Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to API endpoints, potentially bypassing security controls and exposing sensitive data or functionalities. In certain scenarios, it might even be possible to achieve path traversal if the parsed path is used to access file system resources, although this is less likely in this routing context. The primary impact is likely related to incorrect routing and authorization bypass.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The code implements a custom parameter parsing logic, but does not include explicit sanitization or validation to prevent path traversal or routing bypass attacks in the `decodeCompositParams` function.

* Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization within the `decodeCompositParams` function to prevent path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\\`) and other potentially malicious path manipulations.
    - More robust and standard path parameter parsing mechanism should be used instead of custom, potentially flawed logic. Consider using well-vetted path routing libraries that handle parameter parsing securely and consistently.

* Preconditions:
    - The application must be using `go-openapi/runtime/middleware/router` for routing requests.
    - API endpoints must be defined with path parameters followed by composite parameter patterns that trigger the vulnerable `decodeCompositParams` function.

* Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/middleware/router.go`
    - Function: `decodeCompositParams(name string, value string, pattern string, names []string, values []string)`

    ```go
    func decodeCompositParams(name string, value string, pattern string, names []string, values []string) ([]string, []string) {
    	pleft := strings.Index(pattern, "{") // Find the index of '{' in the pattern
    	names = append(names, name)          // Append the current parameter name
    	if pleft < 0 {                       // If no '{' is found in the pattern (base case)
    		if strings.HasSuffix(value, pattern) { // Check if the value ends with the pattern
    			values = append(values, value[:len(value)-len(pattern)]) // If it does, append the part of the value before the suffix
    		} else {
    			values = append(values, "") // Otherwise, append an empty string
    		}
    	} else { // Recursive case if '{' is found in the pattern
    		toskip := pattern[:pleft]             // Part of the pattern before '{'
    		pright := strings.Index(pattern, "}")    // Find the index of '}' in the pattern
    		vright := strings.Index(value, toskip)  // Find the index of 'toskip' in the value
    		if vright >= 0 {                        // If 'toskip' is found in the value
    			values = append(values, value[:vright]) // Append the part of the value before 'toskip'
    		} else {
    			values = append(values, "") // Otherwise, append an empty string
    			value = ""                  // and set value to empty string
    		}
    		return decodeCompositParams(pattern[pleft+1:pright], value[vright+len(toskip):], pattern[pright+1:], names, values) // Recursive call
    	}
    	return names, values // Return the accumulated names and values
    }
    ```
    - Visualization:

    ```
    Path Pattern: /user/{username}/profile{/fragment}
    Incoming Path: /user/john/profile/settings

    1. decodeCompositParams("username", "john", "/profile{/fragment}", [], [])
       pleft = -1 (no '{' in "/profile{/fragment}")
       strings.HasSuffix("john", "/profile{/fragment}") is false
       values = [""]
       names = ["username"]
       return names, values  -> ["username"], [""] - Incorrect parsing

    Correct parsing should extract "john" as username and "/settings" as fragment if the path was intended to be /user/{username}/profile/{fragment}. However, the `decodeCompositParams` function is used to handle fragment/composing parameters *within* a path segment, which is non-standard and error-prone.

    The issue arises because this custom parsing logic attempts to handle path structures that are not standard URL path parameters, leading to potential misinterpretations of the path and routing decisions.

* Security test case:
    1. Deploy an application built using `go-openapi/runtime` that utilizes the `middleware/router` and has an endpoint with a path pattern similar to `/resource/{id}/action{/extra}`. Assume this endpoint should only be accessible to authenticated users with specific roles.
    2. Identify the base URL of the deployed application (e.g., `https://example.com`).
    3. Craft a malicious URL by injecting path traversal characters into the composite parameter part. For example, if the intended path is `/resource/123/action/view`, try a URL like `https://example.com/resource/123/action../unintended/admin/panel`. The part `../unintended/admin/panel` is injected into the composite parameter section `{/extra}`.
    4. Send an unauthenticated GET request to the crafted URL.
    5. Observe the application's response.
    6. **Expected behavior (without vulnerability):** The application should return a 404 Not Found or 401 Unauthorized error, as the crafted path should not match any valid route, or authentication/authorization should fail for the unintended path.
    7. **Vulnerable behavior (potential vulnerability):** If the application responds with a 200 OK or a different response indicating access to an unintended resource (e.g., admin panel content), it indicates a routing bypass vulnerability. The `decodeCompositParams` function might have incorrectly parsed the path, leading the router to match the request to a different, potentially sensitive endpoint.


### Vulnerability 2: Header Injection in Content-Disposition during Multipart File Upload

* Vulnerability Name: Header Injection in Content-Disposition during Multipart File Upload

* Description:
    The `escapeQuotes` function in `client/request.go` escapes backslashes and double quotes in filenames used in `Content-Disposition` headers for multipart file uploads. However, it fails to escape newline characters (`\n` or `\r`). This omission allows an attacker to inject arbitrary headers by crafting a malicious filename containing newline characters followed by the headers they wish to inject.

    **Steps to trigger the vulnerability:**
    1. Prepare a file with a malicious filename. This filename should contain a newline character (`\n` or `\r`) followed by header fields that the attacker wants to inject. For example, a filename could be: `test.txt\nInjected-Header: malicious-value`.
    2. Use an API endpoint that accepts multipart form data and includes a file upload parameter.
    3. Craft a multipart form request where the filename for the file upload parameter is set to the malicious filename prepared in step 1.
    4. Send the crafted multipart form request to the server.
    5. Observe the HTTP request sent by the client. The `Content-Disposition` header for the file part will contain the injected headers due to the unescaped newline characters in the filename.

* Impact:
    - **High**: Successful header injection can have various impacts depending on the server-side application and its handling of HTTP headers. Potential impacts include:
        - HTTP Response Splitting: In some scenarios, if the injected headers are reflected in the server's response headers without proper sanitization, it could lead to HTTP response splitting vulnerabilities. This allows an attacker to control the response sent back to the client, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or cache poisoning.
        - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): If the backend server uses the injected headers in subsequent requests, it might be possible to perform SSRF attacks.
        - Information Disclosure: Injected headers might reveal sensitive information about the server's internal configuration or processing logic.
        - Bypassing Security Controls: Injected headers could potentially bypass certain security controls or filters implemented by the server or intermediate proxies.

    The severity of the impact depends heavily on the specific application and how it processes headers. However, the potential for header injection is generally considered a high-risk vulnerability.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The `escapeQuotes` function in `client/request.go` attempts to mitigate header injection by escaping backslashes and double quotes.
    ```go
    func escapeQuotes(s string) string {
    	return strings.NewReplacer("\\", "\\\\", `"`, "\\\"").Replace(s)
    }
    ```
    However, this mitigation is incomplete as it does not escape newline characters, which are crucial for header injection in this context.

* Missing mitigations:
    - The primary missing mitigation is proper sanitization of filenames to prevent header injection. Specifically, newline characters (`\n` and `\r`) and potentially other control characters should be removed or escaped from filenames before they are used in the `Content-Disposition` header.
    - A robust mitigation would involve:
        -  Escaping or removing newline characters (`\n`, `\r`), carriage return, line feed and potentially other control characters from the filename.
        -  Consider using a more comprehensive header sanitization or encoding mechanism if available from standard libraries.

* Preconditions:
    1.  The application must use the `github.com/go-openapi/runtime` library to handle client-side HTTP requests.
    2.  An API endpoint in the application must accept multipart form data, including file upload parameters.
    3.  The attacker needs to be able to control the filename of the uploaded file.

* Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/client/request.go`
    - Function: `BuildHTTP(mediaType, basePath string, producers map[string]runtime.Producer, registry strfmt.Registry, auth runtime.ClientAuthInfoWriter) (*http.Request, error)`

    ```go
    // /code/client/request.go
    func (r *request) buildHTTP(mediaType, basePath string, producers map[string]runtime.Producer, registry strfmt.Registry, auth runtime.ClientAuthInfoWriter) (*http.Request, error) {
        // ...
        if len(r.formFields) > 0 || len(r.fileFields) > 0 {
            // ...
            go func() {
                // ...
                for fn, f := range r.fileFields {
                    for _, fi := range f {
                        // ...

                        // Create the MIME headers for the new part
                        h := make(textproto.MIMEHeader)
                        h.Set("Content-Disposition",
                            fmt.Sprintf(`form-data; name="%s"; filename="%s"`,
                                escapeQuotes(fn), escapeQuotes(filepath.Base(fi.Name())))) // Vulnerable code: escapeQuotes does not escape newline characters
                        h.Set("Content-Type", fileContentType)

                        wrtr, err := mp.CreatePart(h)
                        // ...
                    }
                }
            }()
            // ...
        }
        // ...
    }

    func escapeQuotes(s string) string {
    	return strings.NewReplacer("\\", "\\\\", `"`, "\\\"").Replace(s)
    }
    ```

    - **Vulnerability**: The `escapeQuotes` function only escapes backslashes and double quotes but not newline characters. This allows an attacker to inject newline characters into the filename, which can be interpreted as header separators, leading to header injection.

    - Visualization:

    ```
    Multipart Form Data Construction:

    -----------------------------boundary  <-- Boundary
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="malicious\nInjected-Header: value"  <-- Injected header here due to newline
    Content-Type: application/octet-stream

    <file content>
    -----------------------------boundary--
    ```

* Security test case:
    1.  **Set up a test server (optional but recommended for full verification):** You can use a simple HTTP server to receive the multipart request and inspect the headers. Alternatively, use a network interception tool like Wireshark.
    2.  **Prepare a malicious filename:** Create a string that includes a filename, a newline character (`\n` or `\r`), and an injected header. For example: `"test.txt\nInjected-Header: malicious-value"`.
    3.  **Create a test file:** Create a dummy file (e.g., an empty text file) to be uploaded.
    4.  **Construct a multipart form request using the vulnerable client:** (Go code example provided in original list)
    5.  **Run the test case:** Execute the Go test code. The test should assert that the "Injected-Header: malicious-value" is present within the `Content-Disposition` header.

    **Expected Result:** The test case should pass, indicating that the injected header is present in the `Content-Disposition` header, thus confirming the header injection vulnerability.
