Okay, based on your input, the vulnerability list is currently empty because no high-rank vulnerabilities meeting the specified criteria were identified in the project.

Therefore, after applying the filtering criteria (excluding developer-induced insecure code, missing documentation, DoS, and including only valid, unmitigated vulnerabilities with rank at least 'high'), the list remains empty.
