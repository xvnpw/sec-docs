### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and Potential Arbitrary File Read via Spec Expansion

* Description:
When loading and expanding an OpenAPI specification, the `go-openapi/loads` library fetches remote resources based on `$ref` URLs within the specification file. If a malicious OpenAPI specification is loaded, it can contain external URLs in `$ref` fields that point to internal services or sensitive local files. When the `Expanded()` function is called, the library will attempt to load these resources.

Step-by-step trigger:
1. An attacker crafts a malicious OpenAPI specification (e.g., in YAML or JSON format).
2. In this malicious specification, the attacker includes a `$ref` field that points to a resource they want to access. This could be:
    - An internal service within the server's network (e.g., `http://internal-service:8080/admin`).
    - A sensitive local file on the server (e.g., `file:///etc/passwd`).
3. The attacker provides this malicious specification to an application that uses the `go-openapi/loads` library to load and process OpenAPI specifications. This could be done by:
    - Hosting the malicious spec file on a public URL and providing that URL to the application.
    - Submitting the malicious spec file directly to the application if it accepts spec files as input.
4. The application uses the `loads.Spec()` or `loads.JSONSpec()` function to load the specification.
5. Subsequently, the application calls the `doc.Expanded()` function on the loaded specification document to resolve and expand `$ref`s.
6. During the expansion process, the `go-openapi/loads` library, using its configured path loader, attempts to fetch the resource specified in the malicious `$ref` URL.
7. If the `$ref` URL points to an internal service, the server-side application will make a request to that internal service (SSRF).
8. If the `$ref` URL points to a local file (and if the underlying loader supports and doesn't block file scheme URLs), the server-side application may attempt to read that local file (Arbitrary File Read).

* Impact:
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): An attacker can potentially probe and interact with internal services that are not intended to be publicly accessible. This can lead to information disclosure, access to administrative interfaces, or further exploitation of internal systems.
- Arbitrary File Read: If the loader is configured to handle file URLs and doesn't have proper sanitization, an attacker could potentially read sensitive files from the server's file system, such as configuration files, application code, or data files.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
None. Based on the provided code, there are no explicit mitigations implemented in the `go-openapi/loads` library to prevent SSRF or arbitrary file read during spec expansion. The code focuses on loading and parsing specifications but does not include checks to restrict the targets of `$ref` resolutions.

* Missing Mitigations:
- Input validation and sanitization for `$ref` URLs: The library should validate and sanitize URLs used in `$ref` fields to prevent loading of potentially dangerous resources. This could include:
    - Restricting URL schemes: Allow only `http` and `https` schemes for remote URLs and explicitly disallow `file` or other schemes that could lead to local file access.
    - Domain/IP address filtering: Implement a whitelist or blacklist for allowed domains or IP address ranges to prevent requests to internal networks or specific sensitive hosts.
    - Path sanitization: For file paths (if file scheme is to be supported at all, which is generally discouraged for security reasons), ensure proper sanitization to prevent directory traversal attacks.
- Restricting or disabling remote references: Provide an option to disable the resolution of remote `$ref`s altogether if the application does not require this functionality and wants to minimize the risk of SSRF.
- Sandboxing or isolation: If possible, the spec loading and expansion process should be sandboxed or isolated to limit the potential impact of SSRF or file read vulnerabilities. This could involve running the process in a restricted environment with limited network and file system access.

* Preconditions:
- The application uses the `go-openapi/loads` library to load and expand OpenAPI specifications.
- The application loads OpenAPI specifications from untrusted sources or allows users to provide specifications that are then processed.
- The application calls the `Expanded()` function on the loaded specification document, triggering the resolution of `$ref`s.
- The application is deployed in an environment where SSRF can lead to access to sensitive internal resources or where arbitrary file read can expose sensitive local files.

* Source Code Analysis:
1. **`spec.go:Spec(path string, options ...LoaderOption)` and `spec.go:JSONSpec(path string, options ...LoaderOption)`**: These functions are the entry points for loading OpenAPI specifications from a given path (URL or file path). They use a `loader` to fetch the raw specification content.

2. **`spec.go:Document.Expanded(options ...*spec.ExpandOptions)`**: This function is responsible for expanding `$ref`s within the loaded specification.
   ```go
   func (d *Document) Expanded(options ...*spec.ExpandOptions) (*Document, error) {
       // ...
       expandOptions := &spec.ExpandOptions{
           RelativeBase: d.specFilePath,
       }
       if expandOptions.PathLoader == nil {
           if d.pathLoader != nil {
               expandOptions.PathLoader = d.pathLoader.Load // PathLoader is set to the document's loader
           } else {
               expandOptions.PathLoader = loaders.Load // or package level loader if document loader is not set
           }
       }
       // ...
       if err := spec.ExpandSpec(swspec, expandOptions); err != nil { // spec.ExpandSpec is called with the configured PathLoader
           return nil, err
       }
       // ...
   }
   ```
   - The `Expanded()` function sets up `expandOptions.PathLoader` to use the loader associated with the `Document` (`d.pathLoader.Load`) or the default package-level loader (`loaders.Load`). This `PathLoader` is then passed to `spec.ExpandSpec()`.

3. **`loaders.go:loader.Load(path string)`**: This function iterates through a chain of `DocLoaderWithMatch` loaders to find one that can load the resource at the given `path`.
   ```go
   func (l *loader) Load(path string) (json.RawMessage, error) {
       _, erp := url.Parse(path) // URL is parsed, but no validation is done to restrict schemes or hosts
       if erp != nil {
           return nil, erp
       }

       lastErr := errors.New("no loader matched") // default error if no match was found
       for ldr := l; ldr != nil; ldr = ldr.Next {
           if ldr.Match != nil && !ldr.Match(path) {
               continue
           }

           // try then move to next one if there is an error
           b, err := ldr.Fn(path) // ldr.Fn is called to load the resource
           if err == nil {
               return b, nil // Resource content is returned if loaded successfully
           }

           lastErr = err
       }

       return nil, lastErr
   }
   ```
   - `loader.Load()` parses the URL using `url.Parse(path)`, but it does not perform any validation or sanitization to restrict the URL scheme, host, or path.
   - It iterates through the configured loaders (`ldr.Fn`) and calls the first matching loader's function to load the resource.

4. **`loaders.go:JSONDoc(path string)`**: This is one of the default loaders that is used in the chain. It uses `swag.LoadFromFileOrHTTP(path)` to load the document.
   ```go
   func JSONDoc(path string) (json.RawMessage, error) {
       data, err := swag.LoadFromFileOrHTTP(path) // swag.LoadFromFileOrHTTP is used to load content
       if err != nil {
           return nil, err
       }
       return json.RawMessage(data), nil
   }
   ```
   - `JSONDoc()` uses `swag.LoadFromFileOrHTTP(path)` to actually fetch the content from the given path. The implementation of `swag.LoadFromFileOrHTTP` is not fully available in the provided files, but based on its name and context, it is assumed to handle both file paths and HTTP URLs, and it is unlikely to have specific SSRF/Arbitrary File Read mitigations built-in within the `go-openapi/loads` project itself. (Note: further investigation into `go-openapi/swag` would be needed to confirm the exact behavior of `LoadFromFileOrHTTP`).

```

**Conclusion from Source Code Analysis:**

The `go-openapi/loads` library, in its current form based on the provided code, does not implement sufficient input validation or sanitization for `$ref` URLs during OpenAPI specification expansion. It relies on `swag.LoadFromFileOrHTTP` to fetch resources, which is assumed to perform basic HTTP/file loading without specific security checks against SSRF or arbitrary file read. The lack of URL scheme restrictions, host filtering, or path sanitization in `loader.Load()` and related functions makes the library potentially vulnerable to SSRF and arbitrary file read vulnerabilities when processing untrusted OpenAPI specifications.

* Security Test Case:

1. **Create a malicious OpenAPI specification file `malicious_spec.yaml`:**
   ```yaml
   swagger: "2.0"
   info:
     version: "1.0.0"
     title: SSRF Test Spec
   paths:
     /test:
       get:
         responses:
           '200':
             description: Success
             schema:
               $ref: 'http://localhost:8080/internal-api/status'
   ```
   (Ensure you have a service running on `http://localhost:8080` that you can monitor for requests, or replace with a safe external URL for testing network access attempts if needed).

2. **Create a Go test program `ssrf_test.go`:**
   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "fmt"
       "github.com/go-openapi/loads"
       "log"
       "net/http"
       "net/http/httptest"
   )

   func main() {
       // Optional: Setup a mock internal service to listen for SSRF
       ts := httptest.NewServer(http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
           log.Printf("SSRF Test Server Received Request: %s %s", r.Method, r.URL.Path)
           w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
           _, _ = w.Write([]byte(`{"status": "ok"}`))
       }))
       defer ts.Close()

       maliciousSpecContent := fmt.Sprintf(`
       swagger: "2.0"
       info:
         version: "1.0.0"
         title: SSRF Test Spec
       paths:
         /test:
           get:
             responses:
               '200':
                 description: Success
                 schema:
                   $ref: '%s/internal-api/status'
       `, ts.URL)

       doc, err := loads.Analyzed([]byte(maliciousSpecContent), "")
       if err != nil {
           fmt.Println("Error loading spec:", err)
           return
       }

       _, err = doc.Expanded()
       if err != nil {
           fmt.Println("Error expanding spec:", err)
           return
       }

       fmt.Println("Spec expanded successfully (check server logs for SSRF attempt).")
   }
   ```

3. **Run the test program:** `go run ssrf_test.go`

4. **Observe the output and server logs:**
   - Check the output of the Go program. If it prints "Spec expanded successfully", proceed to check server logs.
   - Examine the logs of the test HTTP server (`ts`). If the SSRF vulnerability exists, you should see a log entry indicating that the test server received a request to `/internal-api/status` when `doc.Expanded()` was called. This confirms that the `go-openapi/loads` library attempted to access the URL provided in the `$ref` within the malicious specification, demonstrating SSRF.

This test case demonstrates how a malicious OpenAPI specification with an external `$ref` can trigger an SSRF vulnerability when loaded and expanded using `go-openapi/loads`.
