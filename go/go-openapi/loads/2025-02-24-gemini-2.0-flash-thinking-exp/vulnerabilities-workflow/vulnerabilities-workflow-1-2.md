- **Vulnerability Name:** SSRF in Specification Loader
  - **Description:**  
    The loader functions in this project (used when calling, for example, `loads.Spec()` or `loads.JSONSpec()`) do not enforce a strict whitelist of allowed URL schemes or source restrictions. In particular, the function in `loaders.go` first calls `url.Parse(path)` without checking that the scheme is, for example, only “http” or “https.” After parsing, the loader chain calls a generic function (via `JSONDoc` and then `swag.LoadFromFileOrHTTP`) to retrieve the specification content. An attacker able to supply a user‑controlled URL (for instance via an endpoint that lets a caller load an external spec) could pass a URL such as `file:///etc/passwd` or an internal URL like `http://localhost:80/secret` to force the application to read local or internal resources.
    - **Step by Step How to Trigger:**
      1. An external attacker identifies an endpoint (or configuration input) that eventually calls a loader function from the library with a URL or file‑path parameter.
      2. The attacker submits a request with a malicious URL (e.g. `file:///etc/passwd` or `http://internal-service/admin`) as the specification source.
      3. The `Load()` method in the loader (in *loaders.go*) performs only a basic `url.Parse()` check, accepting the input because no scheme is disallowed.
      4. The loader then calls `swag.LoadFromFileOrHTTP`, which attempts to fetch the content from the attacker‑controlled location.
      5. If successful, this may disclose sensitive internal data to the attacker.
  - **Impact:**  
    An attacker could use this vulnerability to perform server‑side request forgery (SSRF), potentially reading sensitive files on the file system or accessing internal services not normally reachable from the outside. This may lead to sensitive data disclosure and further lateral movement within the target environment.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:**  
    **High**
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    The code performs a basic URL parsing using `url.Parse()` before passing the URL to the loader function. However, no further validation (such as enforcing a whitelist of allowed schemes) is performed.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - A whitelist check to allow only safe schemes (for example, only “http” and “https” should be accepted).  
    - Additional validations such as checking that the URL does not point to local files (e.g. using “file://”) or internal IP ranges.  
    - Implementing safeguards to ensure that only trusted sources may be used to load specifications.
  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The application must expose functionality (either via an API endpoint or configuration) that passes a user‑controlled URL/path to the spec loader (e.g. via `loads.Spec()` or `loads.JSONSpec()`).  
    - The attacker needs to be able to control that input, so that they can submit a URL with a disallowed scheme or one that causes internal resource access.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In *loaders.go*, the `Load()` method begins with:
      ```go
      _, erp := url.Parse(path)
      if erp != nil {
          return nil, erp
      }
      ```
      This check only confirms correct URL syntax but does not validate the scheme.
    - The loader chain then calls the function assigned in `JSONDoc`, which calls:
      ```go
      data, err := swag.LoadFromFileOrHTTP(path)
      ```
      Here, no filtering or scheme enforcement is performed.
    - Consequently, if an attacker supplies a URL such as `"file:///etc/passwd"`, the loader will try to read that file (or any other resource), leading to an SSRF vulnerability.
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Deploy the application (or a service using the go‑openapi/loads library) in a publicly accessible environment.  
    2. Identify the endpoint or configuration option where a specification URL can be provided.  
    3. Submit a request with a crafted URL—for example, `file:///etc/passwd` or an internal URL such as `http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin`—as the spec location.  
    4. Observe the response from the loader function.  
       - If the application returns file contents or internal responses (or even an error that discloses too much detail), then the vulnerability is present.  
       - Confirm that normally only remote HTTP/HTTPS URLs (from trusted sources) should be loaded.
    5. Document and analyze any sensitive information leakage or other unexpected behavior resulting from the malicious URL.

By implementing proper URL scheme whitelisting and source validation, this SSRF vulnerability can be effectively mitigated.
