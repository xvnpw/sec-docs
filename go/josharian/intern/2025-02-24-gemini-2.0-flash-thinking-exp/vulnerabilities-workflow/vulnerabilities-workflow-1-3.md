### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Unbounded Memory Consumption due to Uncontrolled String Interning
* Description:
    The `intern` package utilizes a `sync.Pool` to manage maps that store interned strings. The functions `String` and `Bytes` add new strings to these maps if they are not already present. However, the package lacks any mechanism to limit the number of strings that can be interned. An external attacker can exploit this by repeatedly calling the `String` or `Bytes` functions with unique, attacker-controlled strings. This action leads to the continuous growth of the maps within the `sync.Pool`, resulting in excessive memory consumption on the server hosting the application.

* Impact:
    High memory consumption can severely degrade the performance of the application and potentially impact other applications running on the same server. In critical scenarios, this can lead to application crashes due to out-of-memory errors, and in extreme cases, system instability if the server exhausts its memory resources. While resembling a denial-of-service, the core impact is resource exhaustion, significantly affecting application availability and performance. This is classified as a high severity vulnerability due to its potential to cause significant resource depletion and service disruption.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The provided code does not include any measures to limit the number of interned strings or the memory utilized by the intern pool.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement a limit on the maximum number of interned strings to prevent unbounded growth.
    - Introduce an eviction mechanism for less frequently used interned strings, possibly by replacing the simple map in `sync.Pool` with an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache.
    - Evaluate alternative string interning strategies that offer better memory efficiency or built-in limits to manage resource usage.

* Preconditions:
    - The target application must be actively using the `intern` package's `String` or `Bytes` functions for string interning.
    - An attacker needs to have the ability to influence or control the strings that are being interned. This could be achieved through user-provided input, external data sources, or any other means that allows the attacker to inject unique strings into the application's data flow, which are then processed by `intern.String` or `intern.Bytes`.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. The file `/code/intern.go` defines a `sync.Pool` named `pool`. Each element within this pool is initialized as a `map[string]string`.
    2. The function `String(s string)` retrieves a map `m` from the `pool` using `pool.Get()`.
    3. It checks if the input string `s` already exists as a key in the map `m`.
    4. If `s` is not found in `m`, it proceeds to add `s` to the map: `m[s] = s`. This operation interns the string by storing it in the map.
    5. Finally, the function returns the map `m` back to the `pool` using `pool.Put(m)`, making it available for reuse.
    6. The function `Bytes(b []byte)` operates similarly, first converting the input byte slice `b` into a string and then interning this string using the same mechanism.
    7. Critically, there is no code present within the `intern` package that imposes any restrictions on the size of the map `m` or the total number of maps managed by the `sync.Pool`. Consequently, each unique string processed by `String` or `Bytes` will be added to these maps, leading to unbounded memory consumption as the application processes more distinct strings. The `sync.Pool` itself will dynamically create more maps as needed to handle concurrent requests, further contributing to the potential for excessive memory usage.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Deploy a test application that incorporates the `intern` package to intern strings. A suitable example would be a web application that accepts user input and interns it before further processing.
    2. **Attack Execution:** Develop and execute a script designed to send a high volume of HTTP requests to the deployed application. Each request should be crafted to include a unique string in its payload. For instance, the script can generate a series of strings such as "unique_attack_string_1", "unique_attack_string_2", "unique_attack_string_3", and so on. The script should rapidly send thousands or even millions of these requests to simulate an attack.
    3. **Resource Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the memory usage of the application server throughout the attack. Tools and commands available in the operating system can be used to track the memory consumption of the application's process.
    4. **Verification of Vulnerability:** Observe and analyze the memory usage patterns of the application process. If the memory footprint of the application steadily increases over time as the attack progresses, and if this increase appears unbounded, it confirms the presence of the unbounded string interning vulnerability. Additionally, monitor for any performance degradation of the application, or if the application eventually crashes due to exhausting available memory resources. This behavior would further validate the vulnerability and its potential impact.
