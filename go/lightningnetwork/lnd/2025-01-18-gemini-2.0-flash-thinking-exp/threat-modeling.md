# Threat Model Analysis for lightningnetwork/lnd

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to LND gRPC API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_lnd_grpc_api.md)

**Description:** An attacker obtains the necessary TLS certificate and macaroon credentials to directly interact with the LND gRPC API. Once authenticated, they can execute any available gRPC command.

**Impact:** The attacker can control the LND node, including sending unauthorized payments, opening or closing channels, viewing private information like channel balances and peer lists, potentially leading to significant financial loss and disruption of service.

**Affected LND Component:** `gRPC API` (specifically the authentication layer and command execution framework).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Securely store TLS certificate and macaroon files with appropriate file system permissions (e.g., restrict access to the LND user).
*   Implement robust access control mechanisms at the operating system and network level to limit access to the LND host and port.
*   Consider using separate, restricted macaroons for different application functionalities to limit the scope of potential compromise.
*   Regularly rotate macaroon credentials.
*   Monitor API access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [LND Wallet Seed Compromise](./threats/lnd_wallet_seed_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the LND wallet's seed phrase. This could happen through various means, including compromising the server where LND is running, exploiting vulnerabilities in backup mechanisms, or through social engineering targeting the LND operator.

**Impact:** Complete loss of all funds controlled by the LND node. The attacker can sweep all funds to their own wallet.

**Affected LND Component:** `Wallet Manager` (specifically the seed storage and key derivation functions).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Securely generate and store the seed phrase offline, preferably using hardware wallets or secure key management solutions.
*   Encrypt wallet backups with strong passwords.
*   Implement strict access controls on systems where LND is running.
*   Consider using multi-signature setups for increased security.

## Threat: [Channel Jamming Attack](./threats/channel_jamming_attack.md)

**Description:** A malicious peer on the Lightning Network floods the application's LND node with numerous low-value, unresolved HTLCs (Hashed TimeLocked Contracts). This ties up channel capacity and can prevent legitimate payments from being routed through the node.

**Impact:**  Inability to send or receive payments through the affected channels, potentially disrupting application functionality and user experience.

**Affected LND Component:** `Peer-to-peer networking layer`, `Channel Manager`, `Router`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement channel monitoring and management strategies to identify and potentially disconnect from malicious peers.
*   Set reasonable limits on the number of pending HTLCs per channel.
*   Consider using reputation systems or whitelisting for peer connections.
*   Explore features like "feerate bumping" to prioritize legitimate payments.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in LND Software](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_lnd_software.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities are discovered in the LND codebase itself. These could be bugs in the core logic, cryptographic implementations, or handling of network protocols.

**Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, the impact could range from denial of service to complete compromise of the LND node and its funds.

**Affected LND Component:**  Potentially any component of LND, depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stay updated with the latest LND releases and security patches.
*   Subscribe to LND security advisories and mailing lists.
*   Monitor for announcements of new vulnerabilities.
*   Consider participating in bug bounty programs to help identify vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on LND Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_lnd_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Malicious code is injected into dependencies used by LND. This could happen through compromised package repositories or malicious contributions to open-source libraries.

**Impact:** Similar to vulnerabilities in LND software, potentially leading to compromise of the LND node.

**Affected LND Component:**  Potentially any component of LND that relies on the compromised dependency.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully vet LND dependencies and their maintainers.
*   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   Implement software composition analysis (SCA) practices.
*   Consider using reproducible builds to ensure the integrity of the build process.

## Threat: [Configuration Errors Leading to Exposure](./threats/configuration_errors_leading_to_exposure.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configuring LND, such as exposing the gRPC API to the public internet without proper authentication or using insecure default settings.

**Impact:**  Increased attack surface, potentially allowing unauthorized access or other malicious activities.

**Affected LND Component:**  Various components depending on the misconfiguration (e.g., `gRPC API`, `Networking`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow LND best practices for configuration and security.
*   Regularly review and audit LND configuration files.
*   Use the principle of least privilege when configuring access controls.
*   Avoid exposing sensitive ports or services to the public internet unnecessarily.
