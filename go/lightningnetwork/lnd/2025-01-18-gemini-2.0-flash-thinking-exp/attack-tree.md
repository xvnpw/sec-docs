## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using LND [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_lnd__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. It represents the successful exploitation of one or more vulnerabilities in LND to negatively impact the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit LND API Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lnd_api_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This attack vector targets the interfaces through which the application interacts with LND (gRPC and potentially REST). Exploiting vulnerabilities here can grant the attacker control over LND's functions and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit gRPC API [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_grpc_api__critical_node_.md)

The gRPC API is the primary interface for most applications interacting with LND. Vulnerabilities here are a direct route to controlling LND.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Identify Unprotected/Misconfigured gRPC Endpoint](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__identify_unprotectedmisconfigured_grpc_endpoint.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker attempts to find gRPC endpoints that are not properly secured with authentication or authorization mechanisms.
**How it works:** This could involve port scanning, analyzing application code or documentation, or attempting to connect to default gRPC ports without providing credentials.
**Impact:** If successful, the attacker gains direct, unauthorized access to LND's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Access gRPC Endpoint without Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__access_grpc_endpoint_without_authenticationauthorization.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Once an unprotected endpoint is identified, the attacker directly connects and sends commands without needing to authenticate or prove authorization.
**How it works:** Using gRPC client tools, the attacker can invoke LND methods, potentially controlling funds, channels, and other aspects of the node.
**Impact:** Full control over the LND node, leading to potential financial loss, data manipulation, and service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts malicious input payloads designed to exploit weaknesses in how the gRPC API handles data.
**How it works:** This could involve sending overly long strings, special characters, or unexpected data types to gRPC methods, potentially leading to buffer overflows, command injection, or other vulnerabilities.
**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to denial of service, data corruption, or even remote code execution on the server running LND.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Send Malicious Payloads to gRPC Methods](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__send_malicious_payloads_to_grpc_methods.md)

**Attack Vector:**  The attacker specifically targets gRPC methods known or suspected to have input validation flaws.
**How it works:** By carefully crafting the parameters sent to specific gRPC calls, the attacker aims to trigger the underlying vulnerability.
**Impact:**  Can range from causing errors and unexpected behavior to more severe consequences like data breaches or system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromise LND Wallet/Seed [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__compromise_lnd_walletseed__critical_node_.md)

This attack vector focuses on gaining access to the LND wallet's seed or private keys, which grants complete control over the funds managed by that node.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Extract Wallet Seed/Private Keys](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__extract_wallet_seedprivate_keys.md)

This represents various methods an attacker might use to obtain the sensitive information needed to control the LND wallet.
    * **Decrypt Wallet Files (if encryption is weak or key is compromised):**
        * **Attack Vector:** If the wallet file encryption is weak (e.g., using default passwords or outdated algorithms) or if the encryption key is compromised, the attacker can decrypt the wallet and extract the seed.
    * **Extract Seed from Memory (if LND process is compromised):**
        * **Attack Vector:** If the attacker has already gained some level of access to the server running LND, they might attempt to dump the memory of the LND process to find the unencrypted seed or private keys.
    * **Social Engineering/Phishing to Obtain Seed Phrase:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates or deceives individuals with access to the seed phrase into revealing it. This could involve phishing emails, fake support requests, or other social engineering tactics.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Send Unauthorized Transactions](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__send_unauthorized_transactions.md)

**Attack Vector:** Once the attacker has control of the LND wallet (through seed or key compromise), they can send unauthorized transactions, effectively stealing the funds.
**How it works:** Using LND client tools or directly interacting with the LND API (if they have the macaroon or other authentication), the attacker can create and broadcast transactions to the Lightning Network.
**Impact:** Direct financial loss for the application owner.
