## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit LND's gRPC API Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_lnd's_grpc_api_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The gRPC API is the primary interface for interacting with LND. Vulnerabilities here allow attackers to control LND's functionalities.
* **Impact:**  Full control over LND, potentially leading to fund theft, disruption of payments, and manipulation of application logic.
* **Mitigation:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. Enforce the principle of least privilege for API access. Regularly audit and test the API for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Bypass Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__bypass_authenticationauthorization__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Circumventing the security measures designed to verify the identity of the application or user interacting with the LND API.
* **Impact:** Allows unauthorized access to sensitive LND functionalities, enabling further attacks.
* **Mitigation:** Enforce strong, unique credentials for LND. Utilize TLS for secure communication. Thoroughly review and test the application's authorization logic when interacting with the LND API.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Weak Credentials or Default Settings (AND) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_weak_credentials_or_default_settings__and___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Utilizing easily guessable or unchanged default credentials to gain unauthorized access to LND.
* **Impact:**  Full control over LND, potentially leading to fund theft, disruption of payments, and manipulation of application logic.
* **Mitigation:** The application MUST enforce strong, unique credentials for LND and require users to change default settings upon initial setup. Implement credential rotation policies.

    * **Application uses default LND credentials:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The application is configured to use the default username and password for LND's gRPC interface, which are often publicly known or easily guessable.
        * **Impact:** Direct and immediate access to LND's functionalities.
        * **Mitigation:**  Never use default credentials in production environments. Force the generation and secure storage of unique credentials during setup.

    * **Application doesn't properly manage/rotate LND credentials:**
        * **Attack Vector:** While not using default credentials, the application might use weak or static credentials that are not regularly changed, making them susceptible to compromise over time.
        * **Impact:**  Prolonged unauthorized access to LND if credentials are compromised.
        * **Mitigation:** Implement a robust credential management system that includes regular rotation of LND credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit LND Configuration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_lnd_configuration_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Leveraging insecure configurations of LND to gain unauthorized access or control.
* **Impact:**  Can lead to various security breaches, including unauthorized access, information disclosure, and denial of service.
* **Mitigation:**  Enforce secure LND configurations during deployment. Regularly review and audit the configuration for potential weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Insecure Default Configurations (AND) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__insecure_default_configurations__and___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** LND is running with default settings that are not secure for production environments, such as exposed RPC interfaces or weak default passwords.
* **Impact:** Direct access to LND and its functionalities, leading to potential fund theft and application compromise.
* **Mitigation:** The application deployment process MUST enforce secure LND configurations, including strong passwords, restricted network access, and disabling unnecessary features.

    * **LND running with insecure default settings exposed to the network:**
        * **Attack Vector:** LND's RPC interface is accessible from the network with default or weak settings, allowing remote attackers to connect and interact with it.
        * **Impact:**  Remote compromise of LND.
        * **Mitigation:**  Restrict network access to LND's RPC interface using firewalls or access control lists. Ensure strong authentication is required for remote access.

    * **Application doesn't enforce secure LND configuration:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The application deployment process does not actively configure LND with secure settings, leaving it vulnerable to default configuration weaknesses.
        * **Impact:** LND remains in an insecure state, susceptible to exploitation.
        * **Mitigation:** Integrate secure LND configuration into the application's deployment process. Use configuration management tools to enforce secure settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Compromise LND's Wallet and Keys [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/6__compromise_lnd's_wallet_and_keys__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Gaining unauthorized access to the sensitive data that controls the LND node's funds and identity.
* **Impact:** Complete loss of funds managed by the LND node.
* **Mitigation:** Implement robust security measures to protect the wallet and keys, including encryption, access controls, and secure backups.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Direct Access to Wallet Files (OR) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/7__direct_access_to_wallet_files__or___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Obtaining direct access to the `wallet.db` file, which contains the private keys for the LND node.
* **Impact:** Complete loss of funds managed by the LND node.
* **Mitigation:** Encrypt the `wallet.db` file at rest. Implement strong filesystem permissions and access controls to restrict access to the wallet file.

    * **Application stores wallet.db insecurely:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The `wallet.db` file is stored without proper encryption or with insufficient access controls, making it accessible to unauthorized parties.
        * **Impact:**  Direct theft of the wallet and its associated funds.
        * **Mitigation:**  Encrypt the `wallet.db` file at rest. Implement strict file system permissions to limit access to the LND user and necessary system processes.

    * **Attacker gains filesystem access to the server hosting LND:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises the server hosting LND through other vulnerabilities (e.g., in the operating system, other applications) and gains access to the filesystem, including the `wallet.db` file.
        * **Impact:**  The attacker can copy or directly access the wallet file.
        * **Mitigation:** Implement robust server security measures, including regular patching, strong access controls, and intrusion detection systems. Follow the principle of least privilege for all server accounts and processes.
