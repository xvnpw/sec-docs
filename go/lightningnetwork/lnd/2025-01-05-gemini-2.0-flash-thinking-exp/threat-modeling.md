# Threat Model Analysis for lightningnetwork/lnd

## Threat: [Private Key Exposure](./threats/private_key_exposure.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the LND node's private keys. This could happen through exploiting vulnerabilities in the LND software itself, gaining access to the `wallet.db` file due to insecure storage practices, or through vulnerabilities in LND's key management processes. The attacker can then use these keys to spend funds from the on-chain wallet and force close Lightning channels, potentially stealing the channel balance.

**Impact:** Complete loss of funds held in the LND wallet (both on-chain and in Lightning channels).

**Affected Component:** `wallet.db` (stores encrypted private keys), LND process memory if keys are unencrypted there during runtime, key management modules.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Encrypt the `wallet.db` with a strong password.
*   Consider using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for key management.
*   Regularly update LND to patch potential vulnerabilities.
*   Minimize the attack surface of the LND server.

## Threat: [Seed Phrase Compromise](./threats/seed_phrase_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker obtains the seed phrase used to generate the LND wallet. This could occur through exploiting vulnerabilities in LND's seed generation or backup mechanisms, or by compromising the storage location of the seed phrase backup if LND is involved in the backup process. With the seed phrase, the attacker can restore the wallet on another device and gain full control of the funds.

**Impact:** Complete loss of funds associated with the seed phrase.

**Affected Component:** Wallet generation and restoration process within LND.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure secure generation of the seed phrase by LND.
*   Recommend using offline methods for storing the seed phrase (e.g., paper backups, metal backups) if LND provides backup functionality.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to LND API (gRPC)](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_lnd_api__grpc_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the LND gRPC API. This could happen by exploiting vulnerabilities in the LND gRPC interface itself, stealing macaroon authentication files managed by LND, or by compromising a system that has legitimate access to the API. The attacker can then control the LND node, send payments, open/close channels, and potentially drain funds.

**Impact:** Significant financial loss, disruption of service, potential manipulation of Lightning channels.

**Affected Component:** gRPC interface, macaroon authentication mechanism within LND.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use TLS encryption for all gRPC communication.
*   Securely store and manage macaroon files generated by LND.
*   Regularly rotate macaroon credentials.
*   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for enhanced authentication with LND.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on gRPC](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_grpc.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between the application and the LND gRPC interface. If LND's gRPC interface is not configured to enforce TLS, the attacker can eavesdrop on sensitive data, including payment details and potentially modify requests.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential manipulation of transactions, loss of funds.

**Affected Component:** gRPC communication layer within LND.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce TLS for all gRPC connections to LND.
*   Verify server certificates to prevent impersonation of the LND node.

## Threat: [Channel State Corruption](./threats/channel_state_corruption.md)

**Description:** An attacker manages to corrupt the channel state data stored by LND. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in LND's data handling logic or by gaining unauthorized access to the `channel.db` file. Corrupted channel state can lead to incorrect balance information, inability to settle payments, or forced channel closures with unfavorable outcomes.

**Impact:** Loss of funds due to incorrect channel settlements, inability to use Lightning channels, potential forced closures.

**Affected Component:** `channel.db` (stores channel state information), channel management logic within LND.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure data integrity of the storage medium used by LND.
*   Implement regular backups of the LND data directory.
*   Monitor for signs of data corruption within LND.
*   Stay updated with LND releases that may contain fixes for data integrity issues.
