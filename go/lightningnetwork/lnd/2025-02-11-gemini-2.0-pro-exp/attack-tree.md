## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit lnd Bugs -> Protocol-Level Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_lnd_bugs_-_protocol-level_vulnerabilities__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves exploiting vulnerabilities within `lnd`'s implementation of the Lightning Network protocol itself. These are often complex and require deep understanding of the protocol.

*   **Sub-Vectors:**

    *   **HTLC Interception:**
        *   **Goal:**  Manipulate or steal funds associated with Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) in transit.
        *   **Methods:**  Exploiting timing issues, race conditions, or flaws in `lnd`'s HTLC handling logic.  Could involve injecting malicious data or delaying/dropping packets.
        *   **Example:**  An attacker might try to intercept an HTLC and modify its parameters to redirect the funds to their own address.

    *   **Channel Force Closure:**
        *   **Goal:**  Force the closure of a Lightning Channel under conditions that are advantageous to the attacker and disadvantageous to the victim.
        *   **Methods:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the channel state management or commitment transaction handling within `lnd`.  Could involve triggering a force-closure when the victim has pending HTLCs that would resolve in the attacker's favor.
        *   **Example:**  An attacker might repeatedly send invalid updates to a channel, forcing the victim's node to publish an outdated commitment transaction, allowing the attacker to claim funds based on a previous state.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise lnd Node -> RPC API -> Unauthorized Access [HIGH-RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_lnd_node_-_rpc_api_-_unauthorized_access__high-risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most direct and often the easiest path to compromise.  It involves gaining unauthorized access to the `lnd` RPC interface.

*   **Goal:**  To execute arbitrary commands on the `lnd` node, allowing the attacker to control its behavior, steal funds, or disrupt service.

*   **Methods:**
    *   **Weak or Default Credentials:**  Exploiting weak, default, or easily guessable passwords used for RPC authentication.
    *   **Misconfigured Authentication:**  Taking advantage of misconfigurations in the RPC authentication settings (e.g., no authentication required, allowing access from untrusted IPs).
    *   **Vulnerabilities in RPC Implementation:**  Exploiting bugs in the RPC server code itself (e.g., buffer overflows, injection vulnerabilities) to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Systematically trying different passwords until the correct one is found.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Using credentials obtained from other data breaches to try and gain access.

*   **Example:**  An attacker might use a default or easily guessable password to access the RPC interface and then use the `lncli` command to unlock the wallet, open channels, send payments, or close channels.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Compromise lnd Node -> Wallet Mgmt -> (Seed Leak OR Weak Password) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__compromise_lnd_node_-_wallet_mgmt_-__seed_leak_or_weak_password___high-risk_.md)

* **Description:** This path focuses on compromising the `lnd` wallet, either by stealing the seed phrase or by cracking the wallet password.

* **Sub-Vectors:**

    *   **Seed Leak [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Goal:**  Obtain the seed phrase (mnemonic) for the `lnd` wallet.
        *   **Methods:**
            *   **Direct Access to Seed File:**  Gaining unauthorized access to the file system where the seed phrase is stored (if stored insecurely).
            *   **Social Engineering:**  Tricking the user or administrator into revealing the seed phrase.
            *   **Malware:**  Using malware to steal the seed phrase from the system.
            *   **Compromised Backup:**  Accessing an insecurely stored backup of the seed phrase.
            *   **Physical Access:**  Gaining physical access to the device where the seed phrase is stored (e.g., a hardware wallet).
        *   **Example:**  An attacker might find the seed phrase written down on a piece of paper or stored in a plain text file on the server.

    *   **Weak Password [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Goal:**  Guess or brute-force the password used to encrypt the `lnd` wallet.
        *   **Methods:**
            *   **Dictionary Attacks:**  Trying a list of common passwords.
            *   **Brute-Force Attacks:**  Systematically trying all possible password combinations.
            *   **Credential Stuffing:**  Using passwords obtained from other data breaches.
        *   **Example:**  An attacker might use a password cracking tool to try a list of common passwords against the encrypted wallet file.

    * **Outdated Version [CRITICAL]:**
        * **Goal:** Exploit known vulnerabilities present in older, unpatched versions of `lnd`.
        * **Methods:**
            * Leveraging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities with readily available exploit code.
            * Targeting specific weaknesses in older versions that have since been patched.
        * **Example:** An attacker might use a known exploit for a specific `lnd` version to gain remote code execution or access sensitive data.
