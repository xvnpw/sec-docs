## High and Critical Go Application Threats Directly Involving golang/go

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve components within the `golang/go` repository (the Go language and standard library).

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & How) | Impact | Affected Go Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Unsafe Pointer Dereference** | An attacker could exploit code that uses the `unsafe` package to directly manipulate memory addresses. They might craft input or trigger specific conditions that cause the program to dereference an invalid or unintended memory location. This could lead to reading sensitive data, corrupting data structures, or even achieving arbitrary code execution. | **Critical:** Arbitrary code execution, data corruption, information disclosure. | `unsafe` package | Critical | - **Strictly limit the use of the `unsafe` package.**  Only use it when absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. - **Thoroughly review and audit any code using `unsafe`.**  Ensure proper bounds checking and validation. - **Consider alternative, safer approaches** that avoid direct memory manipulation. - **Utilize memory sanitizers** during development and testing to detect unsafe memory access. |
| **Integer Overflow Leading to Buffer Overflow** | An attacker could provide large integer values as input to calculations, especially when determining buffer sizes or array indices. This could cause an integer overflow, resulting in a smaller-than-expected buffer allocation. Subsequent writes to this undersized buffer could then overwrite adjacent memory regions, leading to data corruption or potentially code execution. | **High:** Data corruption, potential for arbitrary code execution. | Integer types (`int`, `uint`, etc.), arithmetic operators | High | - **Be mindful of integer limits and potential for overflow/underflow.** - **Use appropriate data types** for calculations involving sizes and indices. - **Implement checks for potential overflow/underflow conditions** before memory allocation or array access. - **Consider using libraries or functions that provide overflow protection.** |
| **`net/http` Header Injection** | An attacker could inject malicious HTTP headers by providing crafted input that is not properly sanitized before being used to construct HTTP responses. This could allow them to manipulate the client's behavior, such as setting arbitrary cookies, redirecting the user to a malicious site, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the client's HTTP processing. | **High:** Session hijacking, cross-site scripting (if reflected), redirection to malicious sites. | `net/http` package (specifically response header manipulation) | High | - **Strictly sanitize and validate any user-provided input** that is used to set HTTP headers. - **Avoid directly setting headers based on user input.** If necessary, use a whitelist of allowed values or encoding techniques. - **Utilize secure coding practices for HTTP header manipulation.** |
| **`encoding/json` or `encoding/gob` Deserialization Vulnerabilities** | An attacker could provide maliciously crafted JSON or Gob data to be deserialized by the application. If the application doesn't properly validate the structure and types of the deserialized data, it could lead to unexpected behavior, resource exhaustion, or even arbitrary code execution if the deserialization process triggers the execution of attacker-controlled code (though less common in Go compared to other languages). | **High:** Resource exhaustion, potential for arbitrary code execution (less common but possible). | `encoding/json`, `encoding/gob` packages | High | - **Avoid deserializing untrusted data if possible.** - **If deserialization is necessary, carefully validate the structure and types of the deserialized data.** - **Consider using safer serialization formats or libraries** if security is a major concern. - **Be aware of known vulnerabilities in specific serialization libraries and keep them updated.** |
| **Path Traversal via `os` Package Functions** | An attacker could provide manipulated file paths as input to functions in the `os` package (e.g., `os.Open`, `os.ReadFile`, `os.Create`). By using sequences like `../`, they could potentially access or manipulate files outside of the intended directory, leading to information disclosure, data modification, or even code execution if they can overwrite executable files. | **High:** Information disclosure, data modification, potential for code execution. | `os` package (functions like `os.Open`, `os.ReadFile`, `os.Create`, etc.) | High | - **Always sanitize and validate user-provided file paths.** - **Use functions like `filepath.Clean` and `filepath.Join` to construct safe paths.** - **Implement proper access controls and permissions** to restrict file system access. - **Consider using chroot environments or containerization** to further isolate the application's file system. |
| **Race Conditions in Concurrent Code** | An attacker could exploit race conditions in the application's concurrent code (using goroutines and shared resources). By carefully timing requests or interactions, they could manipulate the order of execution and cause unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior, such as data corruption, inconsistent state, or denial of service. | **High:** Data corruption, inconsistent state, potential for privilege escalation or denial of service. | Goroutines, channels, mutexes, and other concurrency primitives in the `sync` package | High | - **Utilize proper synchronization primitives** like mutexes, channels, and atomic operations to protect shared resources. - **Employ race detectors during development and testing (`go run -race`).** - **Design concurrent code carefully to minimize shared state** and the need for complex synchronization. |
| **Binary Exploitation (Less Common)** | While Go's memory safety features mitigate many traditional memory corruption vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities in the Go runtime itself or in C libraries used via `cgo` could potentially be exploited. An attacker might craft specific inputs or exploit runtime bugs to gain control of the application's execution flow. | **High:** Arbitrary code execution, full application compromise. | Go runtime, `cgo` package | Low (but potentially critical if it occurs) | - **Keep the Go version updated** to benefit from security patches in the runtime. - **Carefully review and audit any `cgo` code** for potential vulnerabilities. - **Utilize security hardening techniques for the deployment environment.** - **Employ static and dynamic analysis tools** to identify potential vulnerabilities in the compiled binary. |
| **Security-Sensitive Information in Error Handling** | Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials, internal paths) in error messages that are logged or displayed. An attacker who can trigger these errors could gain access to this sensitive information. | **High:** Information disclosure of sensitive credentials or internal details. | General error handling mechanisms, logging libraries | High | - **Avoid including sensitive information in error messages.** - **Implement secure logging practices and redact sensitive data before logging.** - **Use generic error messages for user-facing outputs.** |
