## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise VTGate [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_vtgate__critical_.md)

*   *Description:* VTGate acts as the proxy and router for client requests to the Vitess cluster.  Compromising it provides a significant level of control.
    *   *High-Risk Path:*
        *   **1.2 Bypass Authentication [HIGH RISK]**
            *   *Description:*  Circumventing the authentication mechanisms of VTGate allows an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user or gain unauthorized access.
            *   *Specific Attack Vector:*
                *   **1.2.1 Use Default or Weak Credentials [HIGH RISK]**
                    *   *Description:*  Exploiting default or easily guessable credentials for VTGate access.  This is a very common and easily preventable vulnerability.
                    *   *Likelihood:* High
                    *   *Impact:* Very High
                    *   *Effort:* Very Low

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise VTTablet [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_vttablet__critical_.md)

* *Description:* VTTablet manages a single MySQL shard. Compromising a VTTablet gives direct access to the data within that shard.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Vitess Configuration/Management [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_vitess_configurationmanagement__critical_.md)

*   *Description:*  This involves exploiting weaknesses in how Vitess is configured or managed, often through its control plane and topology service.
    *   *High-Risk Paths:*
        *   **3.1 Weak Credentials [HIGH RISK]**
            *   *Description:*  Using weak or compromised credentials to gain access to Vitess management interfaces (e.g., VTAdmin, vtctl) or the topology service.
            *   *Specific Attack Vectors:*
                *   **3.1.1 Hardcoded Credentials in Code/Configuration [HIGH RISK]**
                    *   *Description:*  Credentials stored directly within source code or configuration files, making them easily discoverable.
                    *   *Likelihood:* Medium
                    *   *Impact:* Very High
                    *   *Effort:* Very Low
                    *   *Skill Level:* Novice
                    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy (with tools)
                *   **3.1.2 Leaked Credentials on Public Repos/Forums [HIGH RISK]**
                    *   *Description:*  Credentials accidentally published to public repositories (e.g., GitHub) or online forums.
                    *   *Likelihood:* Low
                    *   *Impact:* Very High
                    *   *Effort:* Very Low
                    *   *Skill Level:* Novice
                    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy
        *   **3.2 Misconfigured Topology Service [HIGH RISK]**
            *   *Description:*  Exploiting misconfigurations in the topology service (e.g., etcd, ZooKeeper, Consul) that Vitess relies on for service discovery and configuration management.
            *   *Specific Attack Vectors:*
                *   **3.2.1 Insecure gRPC/HTTP Security (No TLS) [HIGH RISK]**
                    *   *Description:*  Communication with the topology service without TLS encryption, allowing for eavesdropping and potential manipulation of data.
                    *   *Likelihood:* Medium
                    *   *Impact:* High
                    *   *Effort:* Low
                    *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
                    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
                *   **3.2.2 Lack of Proper Access Controls (e.g., RBAC) on Topology Service [HIGH RISK]**
                    *   *Description:*  Insufficient access controls on the topology service, allowing unauthorized modification of the Vitess configuration.
                    *   *Likelihood:* Medium
                    *   *Impact:* Very High
                    *   *Effort:* Medium
                    *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
                    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/5__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

* *Description:* Attacks aimed at making the Vitess cluster unavailable to legitimate users.
    * *High-Risk Path:*
        *   **5.1 Overload VTGate/VTTablet with Requests**
            *   *Description:*  Flooding VTGate or VTTablet with a large volume of requests, overwhelming their capacity to process them.
            *   *Specific Attack Vector:*
                *   **5.1.1 Send High Volume of Queries (e.g., Slow Queries) [HIGH RISK]**
                    *   *Description:*  Sending a large number of queries, potentially complex or slow ones, to exhaust resources and cause service disruption.
                    *   *Likelihood:* High
                    *   *Impact:* Medium
