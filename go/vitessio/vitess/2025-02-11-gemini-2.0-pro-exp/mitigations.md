# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for vitessio/vitess

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Authentication and Authorization for VTGate](./mitigation_strategies/strong_authentication_and_authorization_for_vtgate.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement robust authentication and authorization for all VTGate clients using Vitess features.

**Description:**
1.  **Implement mTLS:** Use mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service communication. This requires clients to present a valid TLS certificate to VTGate, proving their identity.  Configure VTGate to validate client certificates using Vitess's TLS options.
2.  **Configure Vitess ACLs:** Define granular access control lists (ACLs) within Vitess. These ACLs specify which clients (identified by their TLS certificate common name or other attributes) can access which keyspaces, shards, and tables. Use the principle of least privilege.  Utilize Vitess's ACL table feature.
3.  **Regular ACL Review:** Schedule regular reviews (e.g., quarterly) of the Vitess ACLs to ensure they remain appropriate.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Database Access (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from directly accessing the database through VTGate without proper credentials.
*   **Data Modification (Severity: Critical):** Prevents unauthorized users from modifying data.
*   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: Critical):** Prevents unauthorized users from extracting sensitive data.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Limits the impact of a compromised client.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Risk reduced significantly (90-95%).
*   **Data Modification:** Risk reduced significantly (90-95%).
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced significantly (90-95%).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%).

**Currently Implemented:**  [Example: Basic ACLs in place for keyspaces, but mTLS is not yet implemented.]

**Missing Implementation:**  [Example: mTLS between application servers and VTGate, granular ACLs at the table level, regular ACL review process.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [VTGate Rate Limiting and Connection Pooling](./mitigation_strategies/vtgate_rate_limiting_and_connection_pooling.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure rate limiting and connection pooling on VTGate using Vitess flags.

**Description:**
1.  **Connection Pooling:** Use VTGate's built-in connection pooling. Set limits using VTGate flags:
    *   `--queryserver-config-max-connections`
    *   `--queryserver-config-pool-size`
    *   `--queryserver-config-idle-timeout`
2.  **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting using VTGate flags:
    *   `--enable_queries_rate_limit`
    *   `--queries_rate_limit_dry_run`
    *   `--queries_rate_limit` (and related flags for custom logic)
3.  **Monitoring:** Monitor connection pool usage and rate limiting metrics using Vitess's exposed metrics.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Prevents overwhelming VTGate or MySQL.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Prevents connection exhaustion.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%).
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).

**Currently Implemented:**  [Example: Basic connection pooling configured, but no rate limiting.]

**Missing Implementation:**  [Example: Rate limiting configuration, monitoring of rate limiting metrics.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict VSchema Management and Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_vschema_management_and_validation.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Treat the VSchema as code and implement rigorous validation and deployment procedures using Vitess tools.

**Description:**
1.  **Version Control:** Store the VSchema (JSON file) in a version control system.
2.  **CI/CD Pipeline:** Use a CI/CD pipeline with Vitess tools:
    *   **Validate:** Use `vtctl ValidateVSchema` to check for errors.
    *   **Test:** Simulate query routing using a test environment and `vtctl` commands.
    *   **Deploy:** Apply changes using `vtctl ApplySchema` (with appropriate flags for controlled rollout).
3.  **Canary Deployments:** Use `vtctl` and VTGate flags to route a small percentage of traffic to a new VSchema.
4.  **Monitoring:** Monitor for VSchema-related errors using Vitess's exposed metrics.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Leakage (Severity: High):** Incorrect routing.
*   **Incorrect Query Execution (Severity: High):** Wrong shard routing.
*   **Data Inconsistency (Severity: High):** Mismatched schemas.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).
*   **Incorrect Query Execution:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).
*   **Data Inconsistency:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%).

**Currently Implemented:**  [Example: VSchema in Git, no CI/CD or automated testing.]

**Missing Implementation:**  [Example: CI/CD with `vtctl` commands, canary deployments, VSchema-specific monitoring.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure VReplication](./mitigation_strategies/secure_vreplication.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Use TLS for VReplication and verify checksums using Vitess configuration.

**Description:**
1.  **Enable TLS:** Configure VReplication to use TLS using VTTablet flags:
    *   `--vreplication_tablet_type`
    *   `--vreplication_ssl_ca`
    *   `--vreplication_ssl_cert`
    *   `--vreplication_ssl_key`
2.  **Checksum Verification:** Enable checksum verification using `vtctl` or VTTablet flags.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Interception (Severity: High):** Prevents eavesdropping on VReplication.
*   **Data Modification (Severity: High):** Prevents data tampering during replication.
*   **Data Corruption (Severity: High):** Detects accidental corruption.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Interception:** Risk reduced significantly (90-95%).
*   **Data Modification:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).
*   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%).

**Currently Implemented:**  [Example: VReplication used, but TLS is not enabled.]

**Missing Implementation:**  [Example: TLS configuration for VReplication, checksum verification.]
