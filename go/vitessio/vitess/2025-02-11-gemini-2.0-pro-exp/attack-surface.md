# Attack Surface Analysis for vitessio/vitess

## Attack Surface: [VTGate Compromise/DoS](./attack_surfaces/vtgate_compromisedos.md)

*   *Description:* Attackers target the VTGate proxy to disrupt service or gain unauthorized access.
*   *How Vitess Contributes:* VTGate is the central point of entry for *all* client connections, making it a prime target.  Its query routing and rewriting logic, while beneficial, adds complexity that could be exploited.  Vitess *directly* introduces this component and its associated attack surface.
*   *Example:* An attacker floods VTGate with thousands of simultaneous connections, exceeding configured limits and preventing legitimate users from accessing the database.  Alternatively, an attacker exploits a vulnerability in VTGate's parsing logic (a Vitess-specific vulnerability) to bypass authentication.
*   *Impact:* Denial of service for all database clients; potential unauthorized data access or modification.
*   *Risk Severity:* Critical
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement strict rate limiting per client IP address or user (configured within Vitess).
    *   **Connection Limits:** Configure maximum concurrent connections per client and globally (within Vitess).
    *   **Query Timeouts:** Set reasonable timeouts for all queries (within Vitess).
    *   **Resource Quotas:** Enforce resource limits (CPU, memory) on VTGate processes (Vitess-specific configuration).
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Use strong authentication and fine-grained authorization *within Vitess* to control access to VTGate.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate VTGate using firewalls or security groups.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular penetration testing and code reviews of *VTGate configurations*.
    *   **WAF (Web Application Firewall):** Deploy a WAF in front of VTGate.
    *   **Input Validation:** Although Vitess handles much of the SQL injection risk, ensure the *application* uses parameterized queries.

## Attack Surface: [Topology Service Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/topology_service_poisoning.md)

*   *Description:* Attackers compromise the topology service (etcd, ZooKeeper, Consul) to manipulate Vitess cluster configuration.
*   *How Vitess Contributes:* Vitess *fundamentally relies* on the topology service for cluster discovery and configuration.  The *interaction* between Vitess and the topology service is the core of this attack surface.  A compromised topology service can control the *entire Vitess cluster*.
*   *Example:* An attacker gains write access to etcd and modifies the shard routing rules (stored *within* the topology service for Vitess) to redirect traffic to a malicious MySQL instance they control.
*   *Impact:* Complete cluster compromise; data theft, modification, or destruction; denial of service.
*   *Risk Severity:* Critical
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Secure the Topology Service:** Follow security best practices for the chosen topology service.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant Vitess components (VTGate, VTTablet) only the *minimum* necessary permissions within the topology service. This is a *direct interaction* between Vitess and the topology service.
    *   **Network Isolation:** Isolate the topology service.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the topology service.
    *   **Redundancy and Monitoring:** Deploy the topology service in a highly available configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Direct VTTablet Access](./attack_surfaces/direct_vttablet_access.md)

*   *Description:* Attackers bypass VTGate and directly access VTTablet instances, circumventing Vitess's security controls.
*   *How Vitess Contributes:* VTTablets are *core Vitess components* that manage individual MySQL instances.  Vitess *introduces* VTTablet and the *expectation* that access should be mediated through VTGate.  The vulnerability arises from bypassing this intended architecture.
*   *Example:* An attacker scans the network and discovers an exposed VTTablet port (a Vitess component). They connect directly to the VTTablet and issue SQL commands.
*   *Impact:* Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; potential for privilege escalation within the MySQL instance.
*   *Risk Severity:* High
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strict Network Segmentation:** Use firewalls to *completely* isolate VTTablets. Only VTGate instances (and potentially VTOrc) should communicate with VTTablets. This directly addresses the Vitess-introduced risk.
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Configure VTTablets (a Vitess component) to require strong authentication for *all* connections.
    *   **MySQL Security Hardening:** Harden the underlying MySQL instances.
    *   **Intrusion Detection:** Monitor network traffic to and from VTTablets.

## Attack Surface: [VTOrc Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/vtorc_manipulation.md)

*   *Description:* Attackers compromise VTOrc to disrupt replication, promote malicious replicas, or perform other unauthorized actions.
*   *How Vitess Contributes:* VTOrc is a *Vitess-provided component* for automating failover and other administrative tasks.  It is *entirely* within the Vitess ecosystem.
*   *Example:* An attacker gains access to VTOrc's API (a Vitess API) and issues a command to promote a compromised replica.
*   *Impact:* Data corruption, data loss, denial of service, potential for complete cluster compromise.
*   *Risk Severity:* High
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Secure API Access:** Protect VTOrc's API (a Vitess API) with strong authentication and authorization.
    *   **Network Isolation:** Restrict network access to VTOrc.
    *   **Audit Logging:** Enable detailed audit logging for all VTOrc operations (Vitess-specific logging).
    *   **Regular Security Reviews:** Regularly review VTOrc's configuration.
    *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Implement 2FA for access to VTOrc.
