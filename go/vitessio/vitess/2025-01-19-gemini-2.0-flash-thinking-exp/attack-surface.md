# Attack Surface Analysis for vitessio/vitess

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Bypasses in vtgate](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_bypasses_in_vtgate.md)

* **Description:** Attackers craft malicious SQL queries that bypass vtgate's query rewriting and analysis, reaching the underlying MySQL databases.
    * **How Vitess Contributes:** While vtgate aims to prevent SQL injection, the complexity of SQL and potential edge cases in vtgate's parsing logic can create opportunities for bypasses.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts a complex SQL query with unusual syntax or encoding that vtgate doesn't sanitize correctly, allowing malicious code execution on the MySQL server.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, denial of service on the underlying MySQL instances.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Vitess to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in query parsing.
        * Consider using stricter SQL modes in MySQL to limit potentially dangerous operations.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to vtctld (Control Plane)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to_vtctld__control_plane_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to vtctld, allowing them to control the Vitess cluster.
    * **How Vitess Contributes:** vtctld exposes a control plane interface that, if not properly secured, can be a target for malicious actors.
    * **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in vtctld's authentication mechanism or uses default credentials to gain access and then modifies the cluster topology, causing service disruption.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Vitess cluster, data loss, service disruption, ability to execute arbitrary commands on vttablets.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication for vtctld, such as mutual TLS or secure token-based authentication.
        * Utilize Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in vtctld to restrict access to sensitive operations.
        * Secure the network where vtctld is running, limiting access to authorized personnel only.
        * Regularly audit vtctld access logs.
        * Keep vtctld updated with the latest security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Internal RPC Vulnerabilities between Vitess Components](./attack_surfaces/internal_rpc_vulnerabilities_between_vitess_components.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the internal Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) used for communication between Vitess components (e.g., vtgate to vttablet).
    * **How Vitess Contributes:** Vitess relies on gRPC for internal communication, and vulnerabilities in gRPC itself or its implementation within Vitess could be exploited.
    * **Example:** An attacker intercepts or manipulates gRPC messages between vtgate and a vttablet to bypass authorization checks or inject malicious commands.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized data access, service disruption, potential for remote code execution on affected components.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enable TLS encryption for all internal Vitess communication using secure certificates.
        * Ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place for internal RPC calls.
        * Keep Vitess and its gRPC dependencies updated with the latest security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of the Topology Service (e.g., etcd, Consul)](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_the_topology_service__e_g___etcd__consul_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers gain control over the topology service, which stores critical metadata about the Vitess cluster.
    * **How Vitess Contributes:** Vitess relies heavily on the topology service for cluster coordination and routing. Compromising it can have widespread impact.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the etcd cluster and modifies the shard mapping, causing queries to be routed to incorrect databases or leading to data inconsistencies.
    * **Impact:** Complete disruption of the Vitess cluster, data corruption, incorrect query routing, potential for data loss.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure the topology service with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        * Encrypt communication between Vitess components and the topology service (e.g., using TLS for etcd).
        * Implement access controls to restrict who can read and write to the topology service.
        * Regularly back up the topology service data.
        * Monitor the topology service for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to vtworker for Administrative Tasks](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to_vtworker_for_administrative_tasks.md)

* **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to vtworker, allowing them to execute administrative tasks like schema changes or data migrations.
    * **How Vitess Contributes:** vtworker provides powerful administrative capabilities that, if misused, can severely impact the database.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to vtworker and initiates a malicious schema change that corrupts data or makes the database unavailable.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, service disruption, potential for privilege escalation if vtworker's security is weak.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization for vtworker access, similar to vtctld.
        * Restrict access to vtworker to only authorized personnel.
        * Log all vtworker operations for auditing purposes.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Defaults or Misconfigurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_defaults_or_misconfigurations.md)

* **Description:** Using default configurations or making insecure configuration choices during Vitess deployment.
    * **How Vitess Contributes:**  Like any complex system, Vitess has numerous configuration options, and incorrect settings can introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** Leaving default passwords enabled for Vitess components or exposing management interfaces without proper authentication.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the misconfiguration, but can range from information disclosure to full system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Follow Vitess security best practices and hardening guides during deployment.
        * Change all default passwords and secrets.
        * Review and understand the security implications of all configuration options.
        * Regularly audit Vitess configurations for potential security weaknesses.
        * Implement the principle of least privilege when configuring access controls.
