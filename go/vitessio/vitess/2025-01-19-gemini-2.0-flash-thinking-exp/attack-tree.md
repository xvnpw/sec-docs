## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Vitess [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_vitess__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved unauthorized access to application data or disrupted its availability by exploiting weaknesses within the Vitess infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit VTGate Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vtgate_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   VTGate is the primary entry point for client queries, making it a high-value target.
    *   **Query Injection via VTGate [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   Attackers craft malicious SQL queries that bypass VTGate's sanitization or rewriting logic, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying MySQL databases.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass on VTGate [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   Attackers bypass VTGate's authentication mechanisms to execute unauthorized queries.
            *   **Exploit Weak or Default Credentials [HIGH-RISK NODE]:** Attackers leverage easily guessable or default credentials to gain unauthorized access to VTGate.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit VTTablet Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vttablet_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   VTTablet manages individual MySQL instances, providing direct access to data.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass on VTTablet [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   Attackers bypass VTTablet's authentication mechanisms to manage the underlying MySQL instance.
            *   **Exploit Weak or Default Credentials [HIGH-RISK NODE]:** Attackers leverage easily guessable or default credentials to gain unauthorized access to VTTablet.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit VTAdmin Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vtadmin_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   VTAdmin provides administrative control over the entire Vitess cluster.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass on VTAdmin [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   Attackers bypass VTAdmin's authentication mechanisms to gain administrative access.
            *   **Exploit Weak or Default Credentials [HIGH-RISK NODE]:** Attackers leverage easily guessable or default credentials to gain unauthorized access to VTAdmin.
    *   **Configuration Manipulation via VTAdmin [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   Attackers with unauthorized access to VTAdmin modify critical configurations, such as routing rules or schema information, to redirect traffic, cause errors, or compromise data integrity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Topology Service (etcd/Consul) Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_topology_service__etcdconsul__vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   The topology service stores critical metadata about the Vitess cluster. Compromising it can have widespread consequences.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Topology Service [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   Attackers gain unauthorized access to the topology service, allowing them to view sensitive information and potentially manipulate the cluster's state.
            *   **Exploit Weak or Default Credentials [HIGH-RISK NODE]:** Attackers leverage easily guessable or default credentials to gain unauthorized access to the topology service.
    *   **Data Manipulation in Topology Service [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   Attackers with unauthorized access modify critical metadata, such as sharding information or routing rules, leading to data corruption, misdirection of traffic, or cluster instability.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) on Topology Service [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   Attackers disrupt the availability of the topology service, rendering the entire Vitess cluster inoperable. This can be achieved by sending excessive requests or exploiting resource exhaustion vulnerabilities.
