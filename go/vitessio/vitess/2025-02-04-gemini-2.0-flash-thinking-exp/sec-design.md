Build Process Description:

1. Developer commits code changes to the Git Repository (GitHub).
2. GitHub Actions CI pipeline is triggered upon code changes (e.g., push, pull request).
3. CI pipeline stages:
    - Code Checkout: Source code is checked out from the Git repository.
    - Unit Tests: Unit tests are executed to verify code functionality.
    - Integration Tests: Integration tests are executed to test interactions between components.
    - SAST Scanners: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scanners are run to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
    - Dependency Scanning: Dependency scanning tools are used to check for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
    - Build & Package: Code is compiled, and build artifacts (e.g., Docker images, binaries) are created.
    - Image Push: Docker images are pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry).
4. Build Artifacts (Docker images, binaries) are stored in the Container Registry.

Build Process Security Controls:

- security control: Automated Build Pipeline: Using a CI system like GitHub Actions ensures a consistent and repeatable build process, reducing manual errors and potential security gaps.
- security control: Source Code Management: Using Git for version control and code review helps track changes and ensures code integrity.
- security control: Unit and Integration Tests: Automated tests help ensure code quality and reduce the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): SAST scanners identify potential security vulnerabilities in the source code early in the development cycle.
- security control: Dependency Scanning: Scanning dependencies for known vulnerabilities helps prevent supply chain attacks.
- security control: Container Image Scanning: Container images in the registry should be scanned for vulnerabilities before deployment. (Recommended additional control).
- security control: Secure Build Environment: The CI build environment should be secured and hardened to prevent tampering and unauthorized access.
- security control: Access Control to CI/CD Pipeline: Access to modify and manage the CI/CD pipeline should be restricted to authorized personnel.
- security control: Code Signing: Signing build artifacts (e.g., binaries, container images) can ensure their integrity and authenticity. (Consider for future implementation).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Application Data Storage and Retrieval: Ensuring reliable and scalable storage and retrieval of application data is critical for the application's functionality.
- Application Availability: Maintaining high availability of the database service is crucial for business continuity and user experience.
- Data Consistency: Ensuring data consistency across the distributed database shards is important for data integrity and application correctness.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Application Data: The primary data stored in Vitess is application data. Sensitivity depends on the application, but it can range from low to high sensitivity, potentially including personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or other confidential information.
- Database Credentials: Credentials for accessing MySQL instances and Vitess components are highly sensitive and must be protected to prevent unauthorized access.
- Configuration Data: Vitess configuration data, including cluster topology and access control settings, is sensitive and needs to be protected to maintain system security and integrity.
- Logs and Audit Data: Logs and audit data may contain sensitive information and should be protected to ensure confidentiality and integrity.

Data Sensitivity Level: High (assuming application data is sensitive and requires protection).
