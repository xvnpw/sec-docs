## Attack Tree Path: [Weak/Default Credentials (Vtgate, Vtctld, Vttablet - if directly accessible)](./attack_tree_paths/weakdefault_credentials__vtgate__vtctld__vttablet_-_if_directly_accessible_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in to Vitess components using default or commonly used credentials.
*   **Impact:** If successful, attackers gain unauthorized access, potentially with administrative privileges (especially for Vtctld).
*   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies, change default passwords immediately, consider multi-factor authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured RBAC/ACLs (Vtgate, Vtctld, Vttablet - if directly accessible, Kubernetes)](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_rbacacls__vtgate__vtctld__vttablet_-_if_directly_accessible__kubernetes_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit overly permissive or incorrectly configured RBAC/ACLs to gain unauthorized access to Vitess resources or Kubernetes resources.
*   **Impact:** Authorization bypass, allowing attackers to perform actions they should not be permitted to, potentially leading to data breaches or cluster compromise.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement least privilege principle, regularly audit and review RBAC/ACL configurations, use automated tools to detect misconfigurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insufficient Input Sanitization in Application Queries (SQL Injection via Vtgate, Vttablet - if directly accessible)](./attack_tree_paths/insufficient_input_sanitization_in_application_queries__sql_injection_via_vtgate__vttablet_-_if_dire_545a498e.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into application queries that are passed through Vtgate or directly to Vttablet (if accessible).
*   **Impact:** SQL injection vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and potentially denial of service.
*   **Mitigation:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements, implement robust input sanitization and validation in the application, use a Web Application Firewall (WAF).

## Attack Tree Path: [Maliciously Crafted Queries (DoS against Vtgate, Vttablet - if directly accessible or Vtgate bypass, Vtctld API)](./attack_tree_paths/maliciously_crafted_queries__dos_against_vtgate__vttablet_-_if_directly_accessible_or_vtgate_bypass__c6caf11d.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers send a large volume of resource-intensive or malformed queries to Vitess components, overwhelming their resources (CPU, memory, network).
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, leading to application downtime and disruption of Vitess management functions.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting, request filtering, resource monitoring, and set up alerts for anomalies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigurations in Operator Deployment (Kubernetes)](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigurations_in_operator_deployment__kubernetes_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations in the Vitess Operator deployment, such as overly permissive service accounts, exposed operator API endpoints, or insecure container configurations.
*   **Impact:** Operator compromise, leading to Vitess cluster compromise and potentially Kubernetes cluster compromise.
*   **Mitigation:** Follow security best practices for Kubernetes operator deployments, implement least privilege for operator service accounts, secure operator API endpoints, regularly audit operator configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Authentication & Authorization Configuration (Category)](./attack_tree_paths/weak_authentication_&_authorization_configuration__category_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is a broad category encompassing various weaknesses in authentication and authorization setup, including default credentials, missing authentication, and overly permissive policies.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Vitess components and data, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and cluster compromise.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., mutual TLS), enforce strong password policies, implement least privilege authorization, regularly audit and review authentication and authorization configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Network Configuration (Category)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_network_configuration__category_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This category includes insecure network setups like exposed ports, lack of network segmentation, and unencrypted communication.
*   **Impact:** Increased attack surface, easier lateral movement, Man-in-the-Middle attacks, data interception.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement network segmentation, restrict access to Vitess components to internal networks, use firewalls, enforce TLS encryption for all gRPC communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Outdated Vitess Version](./attack_tree_paths/outdated_vitess_version.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities present in outdated versions of Vitess.
*   **Impact:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities can lead to various consequences, including RCE, data breaches, and DoS.
*   **Mitigation:** Establish a regular patching and update schedule for Vitess, subscribe to security advisories, and promptly apply security patches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Underlying MySQL Server Vulnerabilities (Outdated MySQL Version, Misconfigured MySQL)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_underlying_mysql_server_vulnerabilities__outdated_mysql_version__misconfigured_mysql_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in the underlying MySQL servers used by Vitess, or exploit misconfigurations in MySQL security settings.
*   **Impact:** MySQL compromise, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and potential disruption of Vitess operations.
*   **Mitigation:** Keep MySQL servers updated with security patches, harden MySQL security configurations according to best practices, restrict access to MySQL servers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vitess Inter-Component Communication Channels (Category)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vitess_inter-component_communication_channels__category_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers intercept or manipulate communication between Vitess components, often by exploiting unencrypted gRPC channels.
*   **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle attacks, data interception, potential data manipulation, and disruption of Vitess operations.
*   **Mitigation:** Enforce TLS encryption for all gRPC communication between Vitess components, use strong TLS configurations and valid certificates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of TLS Encryption for gRPC Communication](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_tls_encryption_for_grpc_communication.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks on unencrypted gRPC channels between Vitess components to intercept or manipulate traffic.
*   **Impact:** Data interception, potential data manipulation, and disruption of Vitess operations.
*   **Mitigation:** Enforce TLS encryption for all gRPC communication, configure TLS properly with strong ciphers and valid certificates.
