# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for vitessio/vitess

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Authentication for vtgate](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_authentication_for_vtgate.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Robust vtgate Authentication
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Vitess-Supported Authentication Method:** Select an authentication method compatible with `vtgate`, such as OAuth 2.0, JWT, or mTLS. Refer to Vitess documentation for supported methods and configuration details.
    2.  **Configure vtgate Authentication:**  Modify `vtgate` configuration files (e.g., command-line flags or configuration files) to enable and configure the chosen authentication method. This involves specifying parameters like OIDC provider details for OAuth 2.0, JWT verification keys, or TLS certificate paths for mTLS.
    3.  **Client-Side Integration with vtgate Authentication:** Update application clients to obtain and present authentication credentials as required by the configured `vtgate` authentication method when connecting to `vtgate`. This might involve obtaining OAuth 2.0 access tokens, including JWTs in headers, or configuring client certificates for mTLS.
    4.  **Testing vtgate Authentication:** Thoroughly test the authentication setup by attempting to connect to `vtgate` with both valid and invalid credentials to ensure proper enforcement. Use Vitess tools or client libraries to verify authentication.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Data (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from accessing sensitive data managed by Vitess without proper credentials enforced by `vtgate`.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches by ensuring only authenticated users and applications can interact with the database through `vtgate`.
    *   **Account Takeover (Medium Severity):** Makes it harder for attackers to impersonate legitimate users accessing Vitess data via `vtgate` if strong authentication methods are used.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Data:** High reduction in risk.
    *   **Data Breaches:** High reduction in risk.
    *   **Account Takeover:** Medium reduction in risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic password-based authentication might be enabled for internal testing environments, leveraging Vitess's built-in mechanisms if available.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Integration of OAuth 2.0 or JWT for production `vtgate` authentication is missing. mTLS for service-to-service communication involving `vtgate` within the Vitess cluster is not yet implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in vtgate](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_role-based_access_control__rbac__in_vtgate.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** vtgate Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Roles within Vitess RBAC:** Identify different user roles and application roles that interact with the Vitess database. Define the specific permissions required for each role in terms of Vitess operations and data access.
    2.  **Configure Vitess RBAC in vtgate:** Utilize Vitess's RBAC configuration features within `vtgate` to define roles and associate permissions with each role. This is typically done through configuration files or command-line flags specific to `vtgate`'s RBAC implementation.
    3.  **Assign Roles to Authenticated Identities in vtgate:** Map authenticated users or applications (identified through the authentication mechanism) to specific roles within the Vitess RBAC system. This mapping is configured within `vtgate` or integrated with an external identity management system if supported by Vitess.
    4.  **Testing Vitess RBAC:** Test the RBAC configuration by attempting to access data through `vtgate` with different roles and verifying that Vitess enforces permissions correctly based on the defined RBAC policies. Use Vitess client tools to test different access scenarios.
    5.  **Regular Review of Vitess RBAC Policies:** Periodically review and update RBAC policies within `vtgate` to ensure they remain aligned with application requirements and security best practices specific to Vitess data access control.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Vitess (High Severity):** Prevents users or applications from gaining access to Vitess data or operations beyond their authorized roles as defined by Vitess RBAC.
    *   **Data Modification by Unauthorized Roles (High Severity):** Limits the ability of users with insufficient Vitess roles to modify or delete critical data managed by Vitess.
    *   **Lateral Movement within Vitess Data Access (Medium Severity):** Restricts the impact of compromised accounts by limiting their access to only necessary resources within the Vitess data layer, as controlled by RBAC.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Vitess:** High reduction in risk.
    *   **Data Modification by Unauthorized Roles:** High reduction in risk.
    *   **Lateral Movement within Vitess Data Access:** Medium reduction in risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic RBAC might be configured within `vtgate` for different application tiers, using Vitess's built-in RBAC features to define roles.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Granular RBAC at the table or column level within Vitess RBAC might not be fully implemented. Dynamic role assignment based on user attributes within Vitess RBAC is likely not yet in place.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Vitess Query Rewriting and Sanitization
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Explore Vitess Query Rewriting Features:** Investigate Vitess's query rewriting capabilities, which might allow for automatic modification of queries passing through `vtgate` to enforce security policies or sanitize potentially dangerous constructs. Consult Vitess documentation for available rewriting rules and configuration options.
    2.  **Implement Sanitization Rules in Vitess:** Configure Vitess query rewriting rules to sanitize queries, for example, by escaping special characters, limiting the use of certain SQL functions, or restricting access to specific database objects based on query patterns.
    3.  **Test Query Rewriting and Sanitization:** Thoroughly test the configured query rewriting and sanitization rules to ensure they effectively mitigate SQL injection risks without breaking legitimate application functionality. Use Vitess's testing tools or client libraries to send various query types and verify the rewritten/sanitized output.
    4.  **Regularly Review and Update Rewriting Rules:** Periodically review and update Vitess query rewriting and sanitization rules to adapt to evolving attack patterns and application requirements.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Critical Severity):**  Vitess query rewriting and sanitization can provide an additional layer of defense against SQL injection attacks by modifying or blocking potentially malicious queries before they reach the underlying database.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Medium reduction in risk (as a supplementary defense layer, not a primary solution).
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Likely not implemented. Vitess query rewriting and sanitization features might not be actively used or configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Exploration and configuration of Vitess query rewriting and sanitization rules are missing. Testing and deployment of these rules in the Vitess environment are needed.
