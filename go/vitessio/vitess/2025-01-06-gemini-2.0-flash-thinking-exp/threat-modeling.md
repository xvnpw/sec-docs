# Threat Model Analysis for vitessio/vitess

## Threat: [Topo Server Compromise](./threats/topo_server_compromise.md)

**Description:**

*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the topology server (e.g., etcd, Consul) and manipulates the stored topology information, such as shard assignments, serving cells, or schema information. This directly impacts Vitess's ability to function correctly.

**Impact:**

*   **Impact:**  Severe disruption of the Vitess cluster. Attackers could redirect traffic to malicious servers (via manipulating serving cells), cause data inconsistencies by altering shard assignments, or trigger denial of service by corrupting the topology data that Vitess relies on for routing and management. This could lead to data loss, application downtime, and loss of trust.

**Affected Component:**

*   **Component:** Topology Service (etcd, Consul, etc.) - specifically the data structures and API used by Vitess.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the topology server's API.
*   Encrypt communication between Vitess components and the topology server using TLS.
*   Harden the topology server infrastructure by following security best practices for the specific technology (e.g., etcd, Consul).
*   Regularly audit access to the topology server's API.
*   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for enhanced security of Vitess's connection to the topo server.

## Threat: [vtgate Authentication Bypass](./threats/vtgate_authentication_bypass.md)

**Description:**

*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker bypasses the authentication mechanisms implemented *within vtgate* to gain unauthorized access to the Vitess cluster.

**Impact:**

*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized users can execute queries against the database through vtgate, potentially reading, modifying, or deleting sensitive data. This can lead to data breaches, data corruption, and compliance violations.

**Affected Component:**

*   **Component:** vtgate - specifically the authentication module or function responsible for verifying user credentials within vtgate's codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Enforce strong authentication mechanisms for vtgate, such as using secure tokens or certificates.
*   Avoid using default or weak credentials within vtgate's configuration.
*   Regularly review and update vtgate's authentication configuration.
*   Implement robust authorization policies within vtgate to control access to specific data and operations.

## Threat: [Malicious Query Injection via Query Rewriting](./threats/malicious_query_injection_via_query_rewriting.md)

**Description:**

*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries that, when processed by *Vitess's* query rewriting engine, are transformed into unintended and potentially harmful queries on the underlying MySQL databases.

**Impact:**

*   **Impact:**  Attackers can bypass intended security restrictions implemented by the application and execute unauthorized database operations via Vitess's query rewriting, potentially leading to data breaches, data corruption, or denial of service on the MySQL instances.

**Affected Component:**

*   **Component:** vtgate - specifically the query rewriting module or function within vtgate's codebase.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly test all query rewriting rules and logic implemented within Vitess.
*   Sanitize or parameterize inputs where possible before they reach the query rewriting engine in vtgate.
*   Implement strict input validation on the application side to prevent malicious queries from being sent to Vitess.
*   Regularly review and audit custom query rewriting rules configured within Vitess.

## Threat: [vttablet Direct Access Exploitation](./threats/vttablet_direct_access_exploitation.md)

**Description:**

*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains direct network access to a vttablet instance and exploits vulnerabilities *within the vttablet process itself*.

**Impact:**

*   **Impact:**  Attackers can interact directly with the underlying MySQL database managed by vttablet, bypassing vtgate's access controls due to a flaw in vttablet. This allows them to bypass authentication and authorization policies enforced by vtgate, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service on the specific shard.

**Affected Component:**

*   **Component:** vttablet - the process managing the individual MySQL instance, focusing on vulnerabilities in the vttablet codebase.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Restrict network access to vttablet instances, allowing connections only from authorized Vitess components (primarily vtgate).
*   Ensure strong authentication is configured for the underlying MySQL instances managed by vttablet.
*   Keep vttablet and the underlying MySQL version updated with the latest security patches.

## Threat: [vtctld Compromise](./threats/vtctld_compromise.md)

**Description:**

*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the vtctld process, which provides administrative control over the Vitess cluster, by exploiting vulnerabilities *within vtctld*.

**Impact:**

*   **Impact:**  Attackers gain full control over the Vitess cluster through vtctld. They can modify shard assignments, schema information, force failovers, and potentially disrupt the entire system. This can lead to significant data loss, prolonged downtime, and complete system compromise.

**Affected Component:**

*   **Component:** vtctld - the administrative control plane component, focusing on vulnerabilities in its codebase and API.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Restrict access to vtctld to authorized administrators only.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for vtctld access.
*   Secure the network where vtctld is running.
*   Audit all vtctld operations.

## Threat: [Inter-Component Communication Eavesdropping/MITM](./threats/inter-component_communication_eavesdroppingmitm.md)

**Description:**

*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker intercepts or manipulates communication *between Vitess components* (e.g., vtgate to vttablet, vtctld to tablets) by exploiting a lack of encryption or authentication in Vitess's internal communication protocols.

**Impact:**

*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data transmitted between components, such as query data, credentials used for internal communication, or configuration information. Attackers could also manipulate communication to disrupt operations or impersonate Vitess components.

**Affected Component:**

*   **Component:**  Various Vitess components involved in communication (vtgate, vttablet, vtctld, etc.) and the communication protocols they use.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Enforce TLS encryption for all inter-component communication within the Vitess cluster.
*   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication between Vitess components.
*   Secure the network infrastructure to prevent unauthorized access and eavesdropping.

## Threat: [Backup Data Exposure](./threats/backup_data_exposure.md)

**Description:**

*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Vitess backup data due to insecure configuration or vulnerabilities in Vitess's backup mechanisms.

**Impact:**

*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data contained within the backups, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations.

**Affected Component:**

*   **Component:** Vitess's backup process and the storage location it utilizes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Encrypt backups at rest and in transit.
*   Implement strong access controls for backup storage locations.
*   Regularly test the backup and restore process in a secure environment.
