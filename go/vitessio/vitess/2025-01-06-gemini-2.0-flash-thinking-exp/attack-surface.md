# Attack Surface Analysis for vitessio/vitess

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via Vitess Query Syntax/Routing](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_vitess_query_syntaxrouting.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how vtgate parses, rewrites, or routes queries to inject malicious SQL that gets executed on the underlying MySQL databases.
*   **How Vitess Contributes:** Vtgate acts as a proxy and query router. If its query parsing or rewriting logic has flaws, it can inadvertently introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities even if the application's direct queries are safe.
*   **Example:** A crafted query with malicious SQL syntax that bypasses vtgate's sanitization and is then executed on a vttablet.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential for remote code execution on the database server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass in vtgate](./attack_surfaces/authenticationauthorization_bypass_in_vtgate.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass vtgate's authentication or authorization mechanisms to execute unauthorized queries or access data without proper credentials.
*   **How Vitess Contributes:** Vtgate is responsible for enforcing access control for database access. Flaws in its authentication or authorization implementation directly lead to this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** Exploiting a bug in vtgate's gRPC authentication handling to gain access without valid credentials.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, potential for privilege escalation within the database.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) on vtgate](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__on_vtgate.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers overwhelm vtgate with a large volume of requests, exhausting its resources and preventing legitimate traffic from being processed.
*   **How Vitess Contributes:** Vtgate is the central point of entry for queries. Its architecture and resource management capabilities determine its resilience to DoS attacks.
*   **Example:** Sending a flood of complex or computationally expensive queries to vtgate.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, financial losses due to downtime.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Direct Access to vttablet bypassing vtgate](./attack_surfaces/direct_access_to_vttablet_bypassing_vtgate.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass vtgate and directly connect to vttablet's gRPC or HTTP ports, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the underlying MySQL instance.
*   **How Vitess Contributes:** vttablet exposes ports for management and internal communication. If these ports are not properly secured, they can be exploited, bypassing Vitess's intended access control layer.
*   **Example:** Connecting to a vttablet's gRPC port using default credentials or exploiting a known vulnerability in the vttablet service.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the underlying MySQL instance, data breaches, data manipulation, potential for remote code execution on the database server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass in vtctld](./attack_surfaces/authenticationauthorization_bypass_in_vtctld.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass vtctld's authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain control over the Vitess control plane.
*   **How Vitess Contributes:** vtctld manages the entire Vitess cluster. Compromising it grants broad control over the system's configuration and operation.
*   **Example:** Exploiting a vulnerability in vtctld's web UI authentication or using default credentials to access administrative functions.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the Vitess cluster, including the ability to reconfigure the system, manipulate data, and cause widespread disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to the Topology Service](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to_the_topology_service.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized read or write access to the topology service (e.g., etcd, Consul), where Vitess stores its metadata.
*   **How Vitess Contributes:** Vitess relies on the topology service for its core functionality, including routing and shard management. Compromising it can disrupt the entire cluster's operation.
*   **Example:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the topology service itself or gaining access through misconfigured access controls, allowing manipulation of Vitess's understanding of the database topology.
*   **Impact:** Manipulation of Vitess cluster configuration, leading to routing errors, data loss, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) on Inter-Component Communication](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__on_inter-component_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers intercept and potentially manipulate communication between different Vitess components (e.g., vtgate and vttablet).
*   **How Vitess Contributes:** Vitess components communicate over a network. If this communication is not encrypted, it's vulnerable to MITM attacks, potentially compromising data in transit or allowing for malicious manipulation of internal commands.
*   **Example:** Intercepting gRPC calls between vtgate and vttablet to eavesdrop on query data or manipulate responses, leading to data corruption or unauthorized actions.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, disruption of Vitess functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
