# Threat Model Analysis for go-chi/chi

## Threat: [Route Overlap Exploitation](./threats/route_overlap_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker identifies overlapping route patterns in the application's `chi` router configuration. They craft requests that, due to the overlap, are routed to unintended handlers, potentially bypassing authorization or accessing administrative endpoints.
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, privilege escalation.
**Affected Chi Component:** `chi` Router, Route Matching Logic
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully design and review route patterns for clarity and non-overlap.
* Prioritize specific routes over more general routes in route definition order.
* Use route testing tools to verify route matching behavior.
* Implement thorough authorization checks in handlers as defense-in-depth.

## Threat: [Route Parameter Path Traversal](./threats/route_parameter_path_traversal.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates route parameters in requests to perform path traversal attacks. They exploit insufficient validation of path parameters used in file system operations within handlers to access files outside intended directories.
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files or resources on the server, potential information disclosure.
**Affected Chi Component:** `chi` Router, Route Parameter Extraction
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Strictly validate and sanitize all route parameters before use.
* Use allow-lists for allowed characters in route parameters.
* Avoid directly constructing file paths using route parameters.
* Implement proper access control for file system access.

## Threat: [Middleware Bypass due to Ordering](./threats/middleware_bypass_due_to_ordering.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits misconfigured middleware ordering in the `chi` application. By sending requests that bypass security-critical middleware (like authentication or authorization) due to incorrect placement in the middleware chain, they can gain unauthorized access.
**Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data breaches, security policy violations.
**Affected Chi Component:** `chi` Middleware Chain, `Mux.Use()` function
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully plan and document the intended middleware execution order.
* Place security-critical middleware at the beginning of the middleware chain.
* Regularly review and audit middleware ordering.
* Use automated testing to verify middleware application order.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Middleware Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_middleware_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in third-party or custom middleware used within the `chi` application. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could lead to various attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS) or remote code execution.
**Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including data breaches, website defacement, system compromise.
**Affected Chi Component:** `chi` Middleware Integration, `Mux.Use()` function
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly vet and audit all middleware dependencies.
* Keep middleware dependencies up-to-date to patch vulnerabilities.
* Follow secure coding practices when developing custom middleware.
* Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify middleware vulnerabilities.
