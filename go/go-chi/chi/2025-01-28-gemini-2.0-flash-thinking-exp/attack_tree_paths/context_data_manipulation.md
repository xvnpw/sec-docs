### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Context Data Manipulation

**Attack Vector Breakdown:**

The core of this attack path lies in the attacker's ability to influence the data stored within the request context. In `go-chi/chi` applications, the `context.Context` is a standard Go mechanism for carrying request-scoped values across middleware and handlers. Middleware often enriches this context with information derived from the incoming request, such as user authentication details, request IDs, or other relevant data.

Attackers can manipulate request elements to inject or modify data that middleware or application logic subsequently reads from the context. The key request elements that can be targeted include:

*   **Headers:** HTTP headers are easily manipulated by attackers. Middleware might extract information from headers (e.g., `Authorization`, `X-Forwarded-For`, custom headers) and store it in the context.
*   **Query Parameters:**  Parameters appended to the URL are also directly controllable by the attacker. Middleware or handlers might parse query parameters and place them in the context for later use.
*   **Path Parameters (Route Variables):** While defined in the route, attackers can still influence path parameters by requesting different URLs that match defined routes. Middleware or handlers might extract these parameters from the route context provided by `chi`.
*   **Request Body (Less Direct):** While less directly related to context *manipulation* in the same way as headers and parameters, the request body can influence application logic that *then* populates the context. For example, middleware might parse JSON from the body and store parts of it in the context.

**Technical Details in `go-chi/chi` Context:**

*   **`context.Context` in `chi`:** `chi` handlers and middleware receive a `http.ResponseWriter` and a `*http.Request` as arguments. The `*http.Request` already contains a `context.Context` accessible via `r.Context()`.
*   **Middleware and Context Modification:** Middleware in `chi` can easily modify the request context using `context.WithValue(r.Context(), key, value)`. This allows middleware to add or modify values within the context that are then accessible to subsequent middleware and handlers.
*   **Accessing Context Data:** Handlers and middleware can retrieve values from the context using `r.Context().Value(key)`.
*   **`chi` Specific Context Values:** `chi` itself adds some values to the context, particularly related to route parameters. These are accessible using functions like `chi.URLParam(r, "paramName")` which internally retrieves values from the context.

**Potential Vulnerabilities and Risks:**

If application logic relies on context data derived from request elements *without proper validation and sanitization*, several vulnerabilities can arise:

*   **Access Control Bypass:**
    *   **Scenario:** Middleware might extract a user role from a header (e.g., `X-User-Role`) and store it in the context. Application logic then uses this role from the context to make authorization decisions.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the `X-User-Role` header to inject a privileged role (e.g., "admin") and bypass access controls, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive resources or functionalities.
*   **Data Manipulation and Logic Flaws:**
    *   **Scenario:** Middleware might extract a filter parameter from a query parameter (e.g., `filter`) and store it in the context. Handlers then use this filter from the context to query a database.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the `filter` query parameter to inject malicious filter conditions, potentially bypassing intended data filtering, accessing unintended data, or causing unexpected application behavior.
*   **Injection Attacks (Indirect):**
    *   **Scenario:** Middleware might extract a language code from a header (e.g., `Accept-Language`) and store it in the context. Handlers then use this language code from the context to construct dynamic SQL queries or commands.
    *   **Exploitation:** While not direct injection into the context itself, if the application logic uses context data to build commands without proper sanitization, it can become vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) if the attacker can manipulate the relevant request element.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Scenario:** Middleware might extract a value from a header or parameter and use it in resource-intensive operations based on the context data.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker could manipulate the header or parameter to inject values that trigger excessive resource consumption, leading to a denial of service.

**Example Scenarios:**

1.  **Admin Role Injection via Header:**

    *   **Middleware:**
        ```go
        func RoleMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
            return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
                role := r.Header.Get("X-User-Role")
                if role == "" {
                    role = "guest" // Default role
                }
                ctx := context.WithValue(r.Context(), "userRole", role)
                next.ServeHTTP(w, r.WithContext(ctx))
            })
        }
        ```
    *   **Handler (Vulnerable):**
        ```go
        func AdminHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            role := r.Context().Value("userRole").(string)
            if role == "admin" {
                w.Write([]byte("Admin Panel Access Granted"))
            } else {
                http.Error(w, "Unauthorized", http.StatusForbidden)
            }
        }
        ```
    *   **Attack:** An attacker sends a request with the header `X-User-Role: admin`. The middleware sets "admin" as the `userRole` in the context. The `AdminHandler` checks the context and grants access, bypassing intended authorization.

2.  **Data Filtering Bypass via Query Parameter:**

    *   **Middleware:**
        ```go
        func FilterMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
            return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
                filter := r.URL.Query().Get("filter")
                ctx := context.WithValue(r.Context(), "dataFilter", filter)
                next.ServeHTTP(w, r.WithContext(ctx))
            })
        }
        ```
    *   **Handler (Vulnerable):**
        ```go
        func DataHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            filter := r.Context().Value("dataFilter").(string)
            // Vulnerable database query - assuming filter is directly used in SQL
            data, err := db.Query("SELECT * FROM sensitive_data WHERE column LIKE '%" + filter + "%'")
            if err != nil { /* ... */ }
            // ... process data ...
        }
        ```
    *   **Attack:** An attacker sends a request with `?filter=%`. This could bypass intended filtering or even lead to SQL injection depending on how the `filter` is used in the database query.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risks associated with context data manipulation, the following strategies should be implemented:

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Strictly validate all data extracted from request elements (headers, parameters) before storing it in the context or using it in application logic.** This includes checking data types, formats, allowed values, and lengths.
    *   **Sanitize input data to prevent injection attacks.**  If context data is used to construct queries or commands, ensure proper escaping and parameterization are used.

2.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Context Data:**
    *   **Avoid storing sensitive or security-critical information directly in the context if possible.** Consider alternative secure storage mechanisms or passing data through safer channels.
    *   **If context data is necessary, minimize the scope and lifetime of sensitive data within the context.**

3.  **Secure Context Management in Middleware:**
    *   **Carefully review and audit all middleware that modifies the request context.** Ensure that middleware logic is secure and does not introduce vulnerabilities by improperly handling request elements.
    *   **Document clearly how middleware modifies the context and what assumptions are made about the data.**

4.  **Defense in Depth:**
    *   **Do not rely solely on context data for security decisions, especially authorization.** Implement multiple layers of security checks and validation at different stages of the request processing.
    *   **Implement robust authorization mechanisms that are independent of potentially manipulated context data.** Use established authorization frameworks and patterns.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    *   **Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities related to context data manipulation.**
    *   **Focus on reviewing middleware and handlers that interact with the request context and derive data from request elements.**

6.  **Use Type-Safe Context Values:**
    *   When storing values in the context, use specific keys and ensure type assertions are handled safely when retrieving values. This can help prevent unexpected type-related errors and improve code clarity.

**Conclusion:**

The "Context Data Manipulation" attack path highlights a critical security consideration for `go-chi/chi` applications. By manipulating request elements, attackers can influence the data stored in the request context, potentially leading to various vulnerabilities if application logic relies on this context data without proper validation. Implementing robust input validation, secure context management, and defense-in-depth strategies are crucial to mitigate these risks and build secure `go-chi/chi` applications. Developers must be aware of this attack vector and proactively implement the recommended mitigation techniques to protect their applications from potential exploitation.
