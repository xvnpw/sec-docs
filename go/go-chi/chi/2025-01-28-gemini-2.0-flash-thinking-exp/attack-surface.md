# Attack Surface Analysis for go-chi/chi

## Attack Surface: [Route Definition Complexity and Overlap](./attack_surfaces/route_definition_complexity_and_overlap.md)

*   **Description:**  Complex or overlapping route definitions in `chi` can lead to unintended route matching, allowing access to resources or functionalities that should be protected by different routing rules.
*   **How chi contributes:** `chi`'s flexible routing patterns (path parameters, wildcards) enable complex route definitions, increasing the chance of accidental overlaps if not carefully managed.
*   **Example:**
    *   Route `/users/{id}` is intended for user-specific actions.
    *   Route `/users/admin` is intended for admin actions.
    *   If `/users/admin` is defined *after* `/users/{id}`, a request to `/users/admin` might be incorrectly matched by `/users/{id}` with `{id}` being "admin", bypassing intended admin-specific routing and potentially access controls.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, bypass of access controls, potential data breaches or privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully design routes with clarity and specificity. Avoid overly broad wildcard routes when more specific patterns are possible.
    *   Define more specific routes before more general routes to ensure correct matching precedence.
    *   Thoroughly test routing logic with various URL inputs to identify and resolve any unintended overlaps or matching issues.
    *   Clearly document route definitions and intended access controls to facilitate review and prevent misconfigurations.

## Attack Surface: [Path Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/path_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Path parameters extracted by `chi` from URLs can be injection points if not properly validated and sanitized before use in backend operations (database queries, file system access, etc.).
*   **How chi contributes:** `chi`'s core functionality is to parse and provide access to path parameters, making it a direct conduit for user-supplied input into the application.
*   **Example:**
    *   Route `/files/{filename}` is intended to serve files based on the `filename` parameter.
    *   If the application directly uses the `filename` parameter to construct a file path without validation, an attacker could use a path traversal payload like `../etc/passwd` in the `filename` to access sensitive files outside the intended directory.
*   **Impact:**  SQL injection, command injection, path traversal, local file inclusion, remote code execution (depending on the context of parameter usage).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly validate path parameters against expected formats and character sets.
    *   Sanitize or encode path parameters to neutralize potentially harmful characters or sequences.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
    *   Limit the privileges of the application user to only the necessary resources and operations (Principle of Least Privilege).
    *   For file operations, use secure file handling practices, such as whitelisting allowed file paths or using secure file access APIs.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Bypass due to Routing Errors](./attack_surfaces/middleware_bypass_due_to_routing_errors.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect route configuration or misunderstandings about middleware application in `chi` can lead to middleware being unintentionally bypassed for certain routes, leaving them unprotected.
*   **How chi contributes:**  `chi`'s middleware chaining mechanism relies on correct route association. Errors in defining routes or applying middleware to route groups can result in gaps in middleware coverage.
*   **Example:**
    *   Authentication middleware is intended to protect all routes under `/api/`.
    *   Due to a typo or misconfiguration in route definition, a specific route like `/api/sensitive-data` is not correctly included in the middleware group, allowing unauthenticated access.
*   **Impact:**  Bypass of authentication, authorization, rate limiting, or other security measures implemented in middleware, leading to unauthorized access or exploitation of vulnerabilities in unprotected endpoints.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Double-check middleware application to ensure it covers all intended routes and route groups.
    *   Utilize `chi`'s route grouping and prefixing features to organize routes and apply middleware consistently to entire groups.
    *   Implement tests to verify that middleware is correctly applied to all intended routes and that requests to protected routes are indeed processed by the middleware.
    *   Conduct code reviews of route definitions and middleware application logic to identify potential misconfigurations.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Ordering Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/middleware_ordering_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrect ordering of middleware in `chi`'s middleware chain can create security vulnerabilities by executing security checks in the wrong sequence (e.g., authorization before authentication).
*   **How chi contributes:** `chi` allows developers to define the order of middleware execution. Misunderstanding or incorrectly configuring this order can lead to security flaws.
*   **Example:**
    *   Middleware chain is configured as: `[AuthorizationMiddleware, AuthenticationMiddleware]`.
    *   Authorization middleware checks permissions based on user roles, but AuthenticationMiddleware, which verifies user identity, runs *after* authorization.
    *   An unauthenticated user could potentially trigger authorization checks and, if there are flaws in the authorization logic that don't strictly require authentication, might gain unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:**  Bypass of security checks, unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully plan and implement middleware order based on security logic. Typically, authentication should precede authorization, input validation, and other security checks.
    *   Document the intended middleware execution order for clarity and maintainability.
    *   Review the middleware chain configuration to ensure logical and secure ordering.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_middleware.md)

*   **Description:**  Security vulnerabilities in custom middleware code developed for `chi` applications directly increase the application's attack surface.
*   **How chi contributes:** `chi` encourages the use of middleware for modular request handling, including security logic.  If custom middleware is not developed securely, it becomes a vulnerability point within a `chi`-based application.
*   **Example:**
    *   Custom authentication middleware has a logic flaw that allows bypassing authentication under certain conditions (e.g., incorrect token validation, race conditions).
    *   Custom authorization middleware is vulnerable to injection attacks if it constructs authorization queries based on unsanitized user input.
*   **Impact:**  Bypass of security controls, authentication bypass, authorization bypass, injection vulnerabilities, data breaches, privilege escalation, denial of service (depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow secure coding principles when developing custom middleware.
    *   Conduct thorough security code reviews of custom middleware code.
    *   Use static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in custom middleware.
    *   Include custom middleware in penetration testing efforts to assess its security effectiveness.
    *   Leverage established and well-vetted security libraries and patterns when implementing security-related logic in custom middleware (e.g., for authentication, authorization, input validation).
