## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Ambiguous Route Definitions [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ambiguous_route_definitions__cr_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers define multiple routes that can match the same incoming request path. `go-chi/chi` resolves this ambiguity based on the order of route definition. An attacker can craft a request that matches an unintended route, potentially leading to the execution of a handler that lacks proper security checks or performs actions the attacker desires.
* **Why High-Risk:** This is a common developer mistake and can lead to significant security vulnerabilities, including authentication and authorization bypass. The effort required is low, and the impact can be high.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Request Matching Ambiguous Route to Trigger Unintended Handler [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/send_request_matching_ambiguous_route_to_trigger_unintended_handler__hr_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Following the exploitation of ambiguous route definitions, the attacker sends a specific HTTP request whose path matches the ambiguous routes. This triggers the execution of the less secure or unintended handler.
* **Why High-Risk:** This is the direct execution of the vulnerability, leading to the intended malicious outcome. The likelihood is medium as it depends on the presence of ambiguous routes, and the impact is high due to potential unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Route Parameters to Bypass Authorization Checks [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_route_parameters_to_bypass_authorization_checks__cr_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Applications often use route parameters to identify resources or users. If authorization checks rely solely on the presence or format of these parameters without proper validation against a trusted source, an attacker can manipulate the parameter values in the URL to access resources they are not authorized to access.
* **Why High-Risk:** This is a common vulnerability in web applications. Attackers can easily manipulate URLs, and successful exploitation can lead to significant data breaches or unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft URL with Specific Parameter Values to Access Protected Resources [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/craft_url_with_specific_parameter_values_to_access_protected_resources__hr_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a URL with specific parameter values that bypass the flawed authorization logic. This allows them to access resources that should be protected.
* **Why High-Risk:** This is the direct exploitation of the parameter manipulation vulnerability, leading to unauthorized access. The likelihood is medium if the application has flawed parameter-based authorization, and the impact is high due to the unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Route Ordering to Skip Middleware [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_route_ordering_to_skip_middleware__cr_.md)

**Attack Vector:** `go-chi/chi` executes middleware in the order they are added to the router. If a developer defines routes *before* essential security middleware (like authentication or authorization), an attacker can access those routes without the security checks being applied.
* **Why High-Risk:** This directly bypasses security measures intended to protect the application. The likelihood depends on developer awareness of middleware ordering, and the impact is high due to the lack of security enforcement.

## Attack Tree Path: [Define Routes Intentionally Placed Before Security Middleware [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/define_routes_intentionally_placed_before_security_middleware__hr_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker identifies routes defined before security middleware and crafts requests to target these unprotected endpoints.
* **Why High-Risk:** This is the direct exploitation of the route ordering vulnerability. The likelihood is medium if such routes exist, and the impact is high due to the bypassed security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Request Path to Avoid Middleware Matching [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_request_path_to_avoid_middleware_matching__cr_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Middleware often applies to specific URL patterns or prefixes. An attacker can manipulate the request path (e.g., adding or removing trailing slashes, changing case if the matching is case-sensitive) to make the request not match the middleware's defined path, effectively bypassing it.
* **Why High-Risk:** This is a relatively simple technique to bypass security middleware. The likelihood depends on the specificity of middleware path matching, and the impact is high due to the bypassed security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft URL that Doesn't Match Middleware's Path Predicate [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/craft_url_that_doesn't_match_middleware's_path_predicate__hr_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a URL specifically designed to not match the path patterns configured for the security middleware, thus avoiding its execution.
* **Why High-Risk:** This is the direct exploitation of the path manipulation vulnerability. The likelihood is medium if the middleware path matching is not robust, and the impact is high due to the bypassed security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Incorrect Middleware Order [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_incorrect_middleware_order__cr_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  The order in which middleware is chained matters. If middleware performing crucial security checks is placed after middleware that modifies the request in a way that invalidates those checks, the security can be bypassed. For example, a sanitization middleware placed after an authentication middleware might allow malicious input to bypass authentication.
* **Why High-Risk:** Incorrect middleware ordering can lead to subtle but significant security vulnerabilities. The likelihood depends on the complexity of the middleware chain, and the impact can be high depending on the bypassed security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Request Relying on Incorrect Order of Operations Between Middleware [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/send_request_relying_on_incorrect_order_of_operations_between_middleware__hr_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a request that specifically exploits the incorrect order of middleware execution to bypass security checks or achieve an unintended outcome.
* **Why High-Risk:** This is the direct exploitation of the middleware ordering vulnerability. The likelihood is medium if the middleware order is flawed, and the impact can be high depending on the bypassed security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Specific Input or Request That Causes Unrecoverable Panic [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/send_specific_input_or_request_that_causes_unrecoverable_panic__cr_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker sends carefully crafted input or requests that trigger a panic within the application's code in a way that the configured panic recovery middleware fails to handle. This can lead to application crashes and potential denial of service.
* **Why High-Risk:** While the likelihood might be lower, the impact of an unhandled panic can be severe, leading to service disruption and potentially data corruption if the application is in the middle of a transaction.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Proper Context Scoping or Access Control [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_proper_context_scoping_or_access_control__cr_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If sensitive data is stored in the request context and there are no proper mechanisms to control access to this data within different parts of the application's code, an attacker who gains access to the context (potentially through other vulnerabilities) might be able to retrieve this sensitive information.
* **Why High-Risk:** This can lead to direct information disclosure. The likelihood depends on how context is used and secured within the application, and the impact is high if sensitive data is exposed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication in Sub-router Due to Incorrect Mounting [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authentication_in_sub-router_due_to_incorrect_mounting__cr_.md)

**Attack Vector:** When mounting sub-routers, developers might incorrectly configure the mount points or fail to apply authentication middleware to the sub-router. This allows attackers to directly access endpoints within the sub-router without proper authentication.
* **Why High-Risk:** This directly bypasses authentication for a portion of the application. The likelihood depends on the complexity of the routing setup, and the impact is high due to the unauthorized access to sub-router resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sub-router Endpoints Without Proper Authentication [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/access_sub-router_endpoints_without_proper_authentication__hr_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker directly accesses endpoints within the misconfigured sub-router, bypassing the intended authentication mechanisms.
* **Why High-Risk:** This is the direct exploitation of the sub-router mounting vulnerability, leading to unauthorized access. The likelihood is medium if the sub-router is incorrectly mounted, and the impact is high due to the unauthorized access to sub-router resources.
