# Attack Surface Analysis for go-chi/chi

## Attack Surface: [Route Overlap and Shadowing](./attack_surfaces/route_overlap_and_shadowing.md)

*   **Description:**  Improperly defined or overlapping routes can lead to requests being handled by unintended handlers. This can expose functionality or data that should be protected.
    *   **How Chi Contributes:** Chi's routing mechanism, which relies on the order of route definition, can lead to unintended handlers being matched if routes overlap. The first matching route wins.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Route 1: `r.Get("/users/{id}", userHandler)`
        *   Route 2: `r.Get("/users/admin", adminHandler)`
        *   A request to `/users/admin` might be incorrectly routed to `userHandler` with `id` set to "admin" if Route 1 is defined before Route 2.
    *   **Impact:**  Authorization bypass, access to sensitive information, unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully design and test route definitions to avoid overlaps.
        *   Use more specific routes where necessary (e.g., `/users/admin` before `/users/{id}`).
        *   Leverage Chi's route testing features to verify expected routing behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Broad Route Definitions](./attack_surfaces/broad_route_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** Using overly broad route patterns can expose unintended endpoints or allow access to resources that should be restricted.
    *   **How Chi Contributes:** Chi allows flexible route patterns using path parameters and wildcards. If not used carefully, these can match more requests than intended.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Route: `r.Get("/files/{path:*}", fileHandler)`
        *   This route could potentially allow access to any file on the server if `fileHandler` doesn't properly sanitize and validate the `path` parameter.
    *   **Impact:**  Access to sensitive files, information disclosure, potential for path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define routes with the minimum necessary scope.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for route parameters, especially those used for file system operations.
        *   Avoid using overly broad wildcards unless absolutely necessary and with strict validation.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/middleware_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities within custom or third-party middleware used with Chi can introduce security flaws.
    *   **How Chi Contributes:** Chi's middleware chaining mechanism allows developers to integrate custom logic into the request processing pipeline. Vulnerabilities in this middleware directly impact the application's security.
    *   **Example:**
        *   A custom authentication middleware might have a flaw allowing bypass under certain conditions.
    *   **Impact:**  Authentication bypass, authorization errors, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and audit all middleware used.
        *   Keep middleware dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom middleware.
        *   Implement thorough testing for all middleware components.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Ordering and Bypass](./attack_surfaces/middleware_ordering_and_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect ordering of middleware can lead to security checks being bypassed.
    *   **How Chi Contributes:** Chi executes middleware in the order they are added to the router. Incorrect ordering can lead to critical security middleware not being executed for certain requests.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Authentication middleware is added *after* a logging middleware that logs request bodies. This could lead to sensitive data being logged for unauthenticated requests.
    *   **Impact:**  Authentication bypass, authorization errors, exposure of sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully plan and test the order of middleware execution.
        *   Ensure that security-critical middleware (authentication, authorization, input validation) is executed before any potentially vulnerable or logging middleware.
        *   Document the intended middleware execution order.

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Injection via Route Parameters](./attack_surfaces/parameter_injection_via_route_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** If route parameters are directly used in database queries or system commands without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious code.
    *   **How Chi Contributes:** Chi makes it easy to extract parameters from the URL path. If these parameters are not treated as potentially malicious input, they can be exploited.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Route: `r.Get("/users/{id}", getUser)`
        *   `getUser` function directly uses the `id` parameter in a SQL query without sanitization: `db.Query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + chi.URLParam(r, "id"))`
        *   An attacker could send a request like `/users/1 OR 1=1` to potentially bypass the intended query.
    *   **Impact:**  SQL injection, command injection, data breaches, remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize and validate route parameters before using them in database queries or system commands.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Avoid directly constructing system commands from route parameters. If necessary, use secure command execution methods.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Mounted Handlers/Routers](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_mounted_handlersrouters.md)

*   **Description:** Mounting external handlers or routers can introduce vulnerabilities if the mounted components are not secure.
    *   **How Chi Contributes:** Chi's `r.Mount()` function allows integrating other HTTP handlers or routers. If these mounted components have vulnerabilities, they become part of the application's attack surface.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Mounting a legacy API endpoint that has known security flaws.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the vulnerabilities present in the mounted component; can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet any external handlers or routers before mounting them.
        *   Ensure mounted components follow secure coding practices and are regularly updated.
        *   Consider the security implications of integrating external components.
