### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Manipulate Route Parameters to Bypass Authorization Checks [CR]

**Introduction:**

The "Manipulate Route Parameters to Bypass Authorization Checks" attack path highlights a critical vulnerability that arises when applications rely solely on the presence or format of route parameters for authorization decisions without proper validation against a trusted source. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious URLs with modified parameter values to gain unauthorized access to resources or functionalities.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

In applications built with `go-chi/chi`, routes are defined with placeholders for parameters. For example:

```go
r.Get("/users/{userID}", getUserHandler)
```

Here, `{userID}` is a route parameter. The `chi` router extracts the value of this parameter and makes it available to the handler function. A common, but insecure, approach is to directly use this extracted parameter for authorization without further validation.

**Vulnerable Scenario:**

Consider an application where user profiles are accessed via `/users/{userID}`. The `getUserHandler` might retrieve the user's profile based on the `userID` parameter. A vulnerable implementation might check if a user is "authorized" to view a profile simply by comparing the `userID` in the route with the currently logged-in user's ID.

**Example Vulnerable Code:**

```go
func getUserHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    userIDStr := chi.URLParam(r, "userID")
    loggedInUserID := getLoggedInUserID(r) // Assume this function retrieves the current user's ID

    if userIDStr == loggedInUserID {
        // User is authorized to view their own profile
        // ... retrieve and display profile ...
    } else {
        http.Error(w, "Unauthorized", http.StatusForbidden)
    }
}
```

**Exploitation:**

An attacker with `loggedInUserID = "123"` could potentially access the profile of another user by simply changing the `userID` in the URL to `/users/456`. The vulnerable code directly compares the string values without verifying if the requested `userID` actually belongs to the logged-in user or if the logged-in user has the necessary permissions to access other users' profiles.

**Why `chi` Makes This Easy (and Potentially Dangerous):**

`chi` provides convenient functions like `chi.URLParam()` to easily extract route parameters. While this simplifies development, it also makes it easy for developers to fall into the trap of directly using these parameters for authorization without proper validation.

**Real-World Examples:**

* **E-commerce:** Accessing other users' order details by manipulating the `orderID` in the URL.
* **Social Media:** Viewing private profiles by changing the `userID` in the profile URL.
* **SaaS Applications:** Modifying settings or accessing data belonging to other tenants by manipulating tenant IDs in the URL.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively mitigate this vulnerability, the development team should implement the following strategies:

* **Never Rely Solely on Route Parameters for Authorization:** Route parameters should primarily be used for resource identification, not authorization.
* **Implement Robust Authorization Checks:**  Authorization logic should verify if the currently authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource, regardless of the route parameter value. This often involves checking against a trusted source of user roles and permissions.
* **Use Indirect Object References (IDOR) Prevention:** Instead of directly using the route parameter to fetch the resource, use it as an index into a data structure that is already filtered based on the user's permissions.
* **Validate and Sanitize Route Parameters:** While not a primary defense against authorization bypass, validating the format and type of route parameters can prevent other types of attacks and improve application robustness.
* **Implement Authorization Middleware:** Utilize `chi`'s middleware capabilities to enforce authorization checks before the request reaches the handler. This centralizes authorization logic and reduces the chance of overlooking checks in individual handlers.

**Example Secure Implementation using Middleware:**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/go-chi/chi/v5"
	"github.com/go-chi/chi/v5/middleware"
)

// Mock function to get logged-in user ID (replace with actual authentication logic)
func getLoggedInUserID(r *http.Request) string {
	// In a real application, this would involve checking session cookies, JWTs, etc.
	return "123"
}

// Mock function to check if a user has permission to view another user's profile
func canViewUserProfile(loggedInUserID, targetUserID string) bool {
	// In a real application, this would involve checking roles and permissions
	return loggedInUserID == targetUserID || loggedInUserID == "admin" // Example: Admin can view all profiles
}

func authMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
	return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		loggedInUserID := getLoggedInUserID(r)
		targetUserID := chi.URLParam(r, "userID")

		if canViewUserProfile(loggedInUserID, targetUserID) {
			next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
		} else {
			http.Error(w, "Unauthorized", http.StatusForbidden)
		}
	})
}

func getUserHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	userID := chi.URLParam(r, "userID")
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Viewing profile for user: %s\n", userID)
	// In a real application, fetch and display the user's profile
}

func main() {
	r := chi.NewRouter()
	r.Use(middleware.Logger)

	r.Route("/users", func(r chi.Router) {
		r.With(authMiddleware).Get("/{userID}", getUserHandler)
	})

	http.ListenAndServe(":3000", r)
}
```

In this secure example:

* An `authMiddleware` is introduced.
* This middleware extracts the `userID` from the route parameter.
* It then calls `canViewUserProfile` (a placeholder for actual permission checking logic) to determine if the logged-in user is authorized to view the requested profile.
* Only if authorized, the request is passed to the `getUserHandler`.

**Prevention Best Practices:**

* **Secure Design Principles:** Design applications with security in mind from the outset. Avoid relying on client-provided data for critical authorization decisions.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
* **Code Reviews:**  Have developers review each other's code to catch potential security flaws.
* **Security Training:**  Educate developers about common web application vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Manipulate Route Parameters to Bypass Authorization Checks" attack path represents a significant risk to applications using `go-chi/chi` if authorization logic is not implemented correctly. By understanding the mechanics of this attack and implementing robust mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly enhance the security of their applications. The key takeaway is to treat route parameters as identifiers, not authorization tokens, and to always validate user permissions against a trusted source before granting access to resources. Implementing authorization middleware and adhering to secure design principles are crucial steps in preventing this type of vulnerability.
