# Threat Model Analysis for go-chi/chi

## Threat: [Route Overlap Exploitation](./threats/route_overlap_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request URL that, due to overlapping or poorly defined route patterns *within Chi's configuration*, is unexpectedly matched to a different, potentially more privileged or vulnerable handler than intended. This exploits ambiguities in how Chi resolves route matching order.
    *   **Impact:** Access to unauthorized resources, bypassing authentication or authorization checks, execution of unintended application logic.
    *   **Affected Chi Component:** `Mux`'s route matching logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define routes in order of specificity, with more specific routes declared before more general ones.
        *   Thoroughly review and test route patterns to ensure no unintended overlaps exist.
        *   Utilize Chi's route testing capabilities to verify expected route matching behavior for various inputs.

## Threat: [Middleware Bypass through Routing Manipulation](./threats/middleware_bypass_through_routing_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request URL that, due to specific routing configurations or edge cases *within Chi*, bypasses intended middleware. This could happen if a more general route without necessary middleware is defined before a more specific route with the middleware, and the attacker targets the general route.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing authentication, authorization, logging, or other security measures implemented in middleware.
    *   **Affected Chi Component:** `Mux`'s middleware application logic and route matching.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully order middleware to ensure security checks are performed before resource access. Apply global middleware where appropriate.
        *   Thoroughly test the middleware chain and routing configuration to confirm the expected execution order for various request paths.
        *   Avoid overly complex or ambiguous routing patterns that could lead to unexpected middleware application.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Route Groups and Sub-routers](./threats/misconfiguration_of_route_groups_and_sub-routers.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits misconfigurations in route groups or sub-routers *within Chi*, such as forgetting to apply necessary middleware (e.g., authentication) to a sub-router containing sensitive endpoints. This allows them to access these endpoints without proper authorization.
    *   **Impact:** Access to unauthorized resources, bypassing security checks.
    *   **Affected Chi Component:** `Mux`'s route grouping and sub-router functionality (`Route` method on sub-routers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully plan and document the structure of route groups and sub-routers.
        *   Ensure that necessary middleware is applied at the appropriate level (e.g., to the main router or specific route groups).
        *   Regularly review the routing configuration for potential misconfigurations.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Chi Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_chi_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities present in the `go-chi/chi` library itself or its dependencies. This requires the developers to be using an outdated or vulnerable version of the library.
    *   **Impact:** Various security vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the flaw in the dependency, potentially including remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Chi Component:** The entire `go-chi/chi` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update `go-chi/chi` to the latest stable version.
        *   Monitor security advisories and release notes for any reported vulnerabilities in `go-chi/chi` and its dependencies.
        *   Use dependency management tools to track and update dependencies.
