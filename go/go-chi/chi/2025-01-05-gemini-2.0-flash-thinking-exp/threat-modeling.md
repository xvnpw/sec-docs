# Threat Model Analysis for go-chi/chi

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Route Patterns](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_route_patterns.md)

**Description:** An attacker can craft a URL that causes the regex engine within `chi`'s route matching to backtrack excessively, leading to high CPU consumption and potentially a denial of service. The attacker exploits complex regular expressions used in route definitions.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or performs very slowly, potentially leading to a complete denial of service.

**Affected Chi Component:** `Router` (specifically the regular expression matching functionality).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid overly complex regular expressions in route definitions.
*   Test regular expressions thoroughly with various inputs, including potentially malicious ones.
*   Consider using simpler, non-regex-based routing where possible.
*   Implement timeouts for request processing to limit the impact of long-running operations.

## Threat: [Middleware Bypass due to Route Ordering or Configuration](./threats/middleware_bypass_due_to_route_ordering_or_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker might be able to access certain routes without going through intended security middleware (e.g., authentication, authorization) if the middleware is not correctly applied to those routes or if the route ordering allows bypassing it. This occurs due to how `chi` handles middleware application using `Use` and `Group`.

**Impact:** Security controls are bypassed, potentially allowing unauthorized access to resources or execution of actions.

**Affected Chi Component:** `Middleware` handling within the `Mux`, specifically the `Use` and `Group` functions.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the bypassed middleware).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully define the order of middleware application using `Use`.
*   Ensure that security-critical middleware is applied to all relevant routes, potentially at the top level of the router.
*   Utilize `Group` functionality to apply middleware to logical groups of routes.
*   Thoroughly review middleware application logic to prevent bypasses.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Misconfigured Route Parameters](./threats/path_traversal_via_misconfigured_route_parameters.md)

**Description:** If route parameters extracted by `chi` are used to construct file paths or access resources without proper validation in the application logic, an attacker could manipulate these parameters to access files or resources outside the intended directory. This directly involves how the application interacts with parameters extracted by `chi`.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to files or resources on the server.

**Affected Chi Component:** The parameter extraction mechanism within `chi`'s routing (e.g., using `chi.URLParam`).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize any route parameters used to construct file paths or access resources.
*   Avoid directly using user-provided input in file paths.
*   Utilize secure file access methods and restrict access to necessary directories.
