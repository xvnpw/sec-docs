## Attack Tree Path: [Force Matching of Unintended Route](./attack_tree_paths/force_matching_of_unintended_route.md)

Attackers craft requests to match a route different from the one the developer intended.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Data/Functionality (via unintended route)](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_datafunctionality__via_unintended_route_.md)

By forcing the matching of a less protected route, attackers gain access to sensitive data or functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization (via unintended route)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization__via_unintended_route_.md)

A less restrictive route might be matched, allowing attackers to bypass intended authentication or authorization checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection (if parameter used in system call)](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection__if_parameter_used_in_system_call_.md)

If a route parameter is used in a system call without proper sanitization, attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal (if parameter used for file access)](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal__if_parameter_used_for_file_access_.md)

If a route parameter is used to access files, attackers can use `../` sequences to access files outside the intended directory.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection (if parameter used in database query)](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection__if_parameter_used_in_database_query_.md)

If a route parameter is directly used in a database query without proper sanitization, attackers can manipulate the query to access or modify database data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization (if relying on case-sensitive matching)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization__if_relying_on_case-sensitive_matching_.md)

If authentication or authorization logic relies on exact case matching of URLs, attackers can bypass it by altering the case of the request.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Protected Resources without Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/access_protected_resources_without_authorization.md)

By bypassing authentication or authorization middleware, attackers gain unauthorized access to protected resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via Error Messages](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_error_messages.md)

Poorly configured or default error handling can reveal sensitive information to attackers.
