# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for go-chi/chi

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Route Definition and Validation (chi-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_route_definition_and_validation__chi-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Leverage `chi`'s Route Grouping:** Utilize `chi`'s `r.Route("/", func(r chi.Router) { ... })` for logical grouping of related routes. This improves organization and readability, making route review and validation easier.
    2.  **Prefer Specific Route Matchers:**  Use `chi`'s specific route matchers like `r.Get()`, `r.Post()`, `r.Put()`, `r.Delete()`, `r.Patch()` instead of the more generic `r.HandleFunc()` whenever possible to explicitly define allowed HTTP methods for each route.
    3.  **Order Routes for Specificity in `chi`:** Understand that `chi` matches routes in the order they are defined. Register more specific routes (e.g., `/users/{userID}/profile`) *before* more general routes (e.g., `/users/{userID}`). This prevents unintended matching of general routes over specific ones.
    4.  **Test `chi` Route Matching Logic:** Write unit tests that specifically exercise `chi`'s route matching. Use `httptest.NewRequest` and `chi.Mux.ServeHTTP` to simulate requests and verify that requests are routed to the correct handlers based on your `chi` route definitions.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access (High):**  Poorly defined or overly broad routes in `chi` can unintentionally expose sensitive endpoints.
        *   **Route Confusion/Misrouting (Medium):** Ambiguous route patterns in `chi` can lead to requests being handled by the wrong handler.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Significantly Reduces - By using `chi`'s features for precise route definition, accidental exposure is minimized.
        *   **Route Confusion/Misrouting:** Moderately Reduces -  `chi`'s route ordering and grouping features help in creating clearer and less ambiguous route structures.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Route grouping is used in `internal/api/v1/routes.go`, and specific method handlers are generally preferred. Route ordering is implicitly followed but not explicitly documented or tested.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to add explicit unit tests for `chi` route matching in test suites. Document route ordering conventions within the team. Review and refactor any remaining `r.HandleFunc()` usages to use specific method handlers where applicable.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous Route Parameter Validation and Sanitization (chi Context)](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous_route_parameter_validation_and_sanitization__chi_context_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize `chi.URLParam` Correctly:** Always use `chi.URLParam(r, "paramName")` to extract route parameters within `chi` handlers. Understand that this function returns a string, and further processing is required.
    2.  **Validate After `chi.URLParam` Extraction:** Immediately after extracting parameters using `chi.URLParam`, perform validation within the handler function. Do not assume parameters are in the correct format or range.
    3.  **Handle `chi.URLParam` Absence:** Be aware that `chi.URLParam` returns an empty string if the parameter is not found in the route. Handle this case appropriately, especially for required parameters, by returning an error response.
    4.  **Test Parameter Handling in `chi` Handlers:** Write unit tests for handlers that use `chi.URLParam`. Test with valid and invalid parameter values to ensure validation logic within handlers works correctly and error responses are appropriate.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Injection Attacks (SQL, Command, etc.) (Medium):** If route parameters extracted via `chi.URLParam` are used in sensitive operations without validation.
        *   **Application Logic Errors (Medium):** Invalid parameters from `chi.URLParam` can cause unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Injection Attacks:** Minimally Reduces - Validation after `chi.URLParam` extraction adds a necessary layer of defense.
        *   **Application Logic Errors:** Significantly Reduces - Validation ensures handlers receive and process data from `chi.URLParam` in the expected format.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some handlers in `internal/api/v1/handlers` validate parameters extracted using `chi.URLParam`, but consistency is lacking. Error handling for missing parameters from `chi.URLParam` is not consistently implemented.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Implement consistent parameter validation in all handlers using `chi.URLParam`. Create reusable validation helper functions. Add unit tests specifically for parameter validation within handlers using `chi.URLParam`. Standardize error handling for missing or invalid parameters from `chi.URLParam`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Selection and Auditing of `chi` Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/careful_selection_and_auditing_of__chi__middleware.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `chi` Middleware Usage:**  List all middleware used in your `chi` router setup (typically in `main.go` or route configuration files).
    2.  **Justify Each `chi` Middleware:** For each middleware, document its purpose and why it's necessary within the `chi` application context. Remove any middleware that is not essential.
    3.  **Prioritize `chi` Ecosystem Middleware:** When possible, prefer middleware from the `go-chi/chi` ecosystem or well-established Go middleware libraries known for security and reliability.
    4.  **Understand `chi` Middleware Order:**  Carefully consider the order in which middleware is added to the `chi` router using `r.Use()`. Understand how middleware order affects request processing and security controls. Document the intended middleware order.
    5.  **Audit `chi` Middleware Dependencies:** Regularly audit the dependencies of any third-party middleware used with `chi`. Keep dependencies updated to patch vulnerabilities.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Middleware (High to Critical):** Third-party `chi` middleware can contain vulnerabilities.
        *   **Unexpected Middleware Behavior (Medium):** Misconfigured or poorly understood `chi` middleware can introduce issues.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Middleware:** Significantly Reduces - Careful selection and auditing of `chi` middleware minimizes risk.
        *   **Unexpected Middleware Behavior:** Moderately Reduces - Understanding `chi` middleware and its order reduces unexpected behavior.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We use `chi`'s built-in middleware. Third-party middleware usage is limited, but a formal review of all middleware in the `chi` context is needed. Middleware order in `main.go` is present but not explicitly documented.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Conduct a formal audit of all middleware used with `chi`. Document the purpose and justification for each. Document the intended middleware order in `chi` setup. Implement a process for regular auditing of `chi` middleware dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Middleware Configuration within `chi`](./mitigation_strategies/secure_middleware_configuration_within__chi_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `chi` Middleware Configuration:** Examine the configuration of each middleware used with `chi`. This includes parameters passed to middleware functions when using `r.Use()`.
    2.  **Apply Least Privilege to `chi` Middleware:** Configure middleware with the principle of least privilege. For example, configure CORS middleware within `chi` to only allow necessary origins, methods, and headers.
    3.  **Test `chi` Middleware Integration:** Test how different middleware interact within the `chi` middleware stack. Ensure they function correctly together and don't create security gaps or bypass each other.
    4.  **Control Middleware Scope in `chi` Groups:** Utilize `chi`'s route grouping to apply middleware to specific groups of routes instead of globally. This allows for more granular control over middleware application and reduces the attack surface.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Misconfigured Security Controls (Medium to High):** Incorrectly configured `chi` middleware can weaken security.
        *   **Middleware Interaction Issues (Medium):**  Incorrect `chi` middleware ordering or configuration can lead to problems.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Misconfigured Security Controls:** Significantly Reduces - Proper configuration of `chi` middleware ensures effective security.
        *   **Middleware Interaction Issues:** Moderately Reduces - Testing and careful configuration within `chi` minimize interaction problems.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. CORS middleware configuration in `chi` exists but needs review for restrictiveness. Middleware scoping using `chi` groups is used in API versioning but could be further leveraged for security policies.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Thoroughly review and harden CORS middleware configuration within `chi`. Document and enforce least privilege configuration for all `chi` middleware.  Explore and implement more granular middleware scoping using `chi` route groups for security policies. Add integration tests for middleware interactions within the `chi` stack.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Route Complexity in `chi` and Monitor Performance](./mitigation_strategies/limit_route_complexity_in__chi__and_monitor_performance.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Simplify `chi` Route Trees:** Design route structures within `chi` to be as simple and flat as possible. Avoid excessively nested or branching route groups that can complicate routing logic and potentially impact performance.
    2.  **Monitor `chi` Routing Performance:** Implement monitoring specifically for `chi` routing performance. Track metrics like request latency within `chi` handlers, route matching times (if possible to measure), and resource usage related to `chi` routing.
    3.  **Load Test `chi` Routes:** Conduct load testing specifically targeting different `chi` routes and route groups. Assess performance under load to identify potential bottlenecks or performance degradation related to `chi`'s routing complexity.
    4.  **Optimize `chi` Routes (If Needed):** If performance issues are identified in `chi` routing, analyze route definitions and consider simplification or restructuring to improve efficiency.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion (Medium):** Complex `chi` routes can contribute to resource exhaustion under heavy load.
        *   **Performance Degradation (Low to Medium):** Complex `chi` routing can lead to slower response times.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion:** Minimally Reduces - Limiting `chi` route complexity is a preventative measure against DoS.
        *   **Performance Degradation:** Moderately Reduces - Simpler `chi` routes and performance monitoring help maintain responsiveness.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic performance monitoring exists, but `chi`-specific routing metrics are not tracked. Route complexity is generally managed, but no formal review focused on `chi` routing complexity has been done.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Implement specific monitoring for `chi` routing performance metrics. Conduct a review of `chi` route tree complexity and simplify where possible. Implement load testing scenarios that specifically stress `chi` routing.
