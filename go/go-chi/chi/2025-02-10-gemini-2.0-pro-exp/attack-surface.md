# Attack Surface Analysis for go-chi/chi

## Attack Surface: [Unexpected Route Matching](./attack_surfaces/unexpected_route_matching.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL that unexpectedly matches a route intended for a different purpose, potentially bypassing security controls.  This is a *direct* consequence of how `chi` handles routing.
*   **How Chi Contributes:** `chi`'s routing mechanism, while efficient, can be vulnerable if complex patterns (wildcards, regex) are used without careful consideration.  The vulnerability arises from *how* `chi` matches routes.
*   **Example:**
    *   Route: `/admin/{resource}` (intended for admin users only)
    *   Attacker URL: `/admin/../users` (might bypass authentication if `/users` is a public route and the application logic doesn't handle the `..` correctly â€“ `chi` matches the route, and the application is responsible for handling the `..`).
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Precise Routes:** Use the most specific route patterns possible. Avoid overly broad wildcards.
    *   **Route Testing:** Thoroughly test all routing patterns, including edge cases and boundary conditions.
    *   **Route Visualization:** Use `chi`'s debugging features (e.g., `middleware.RouteLog`) to verify routing logic.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all path segments, *even if they appear to be handled by the router*. Specifically, handle `..` (parent directory) sequences appropriately. This is crucial because `chi` delivers the potentially malicious path to the handler.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly review and audit routing configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted input string that triggers excessive CPU consumption in a vulnerable regular expression used in a `chi` *route definition*, leading to a denial of service. This is a *direct* vulnerability because the regex is part of the `chi` routing configuration.
*   **How Chi Contributes:** `chi` allows the use of regular expressions *directly* in route definitions, making it directly responsible for handling (and potentially mis-handling) the regex.
*   **Example:**
    *   Route: `chi.Route("/articles/{slug:[a-zA-Z0-9-]+}", ...)` (a seemingly simple regex, but could be vulnerable depending on the input).
    *   Attacker Input: A very long string with repeating characters designed to exploit backtracking in the regex engine.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service; the application becomes unresponsive.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Complex Regex:** Prefer simpler, more deterministic routing patterns. Avoid nested quantifiers and alternations.
    *   **Regex Review:** Carefully review any regular expressions used *in routes* for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regex Testing Tools:** Use tools specifically designed to detect ReDoS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Timeouts:** Set timeouts on regular expression matching operations (using the Go standard library's `regexp` package). This is important because `chi` uses the standard library's regex engine.
    *   **Alternative Regex Engine:** Consider a safer regular expression engine if performance is critical and ReDoS is a significant concern.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Ordering Issues](./attack_surfaces/middleware_ordering_issues.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect ordering of middleware in the `chi` chain leads to security vulnerabilities, such as bypassing authentication or authorization checks. This is a *direct* consequence of how `chi`'s middleware system works.
*   **How Chi Contributes:** `chi`'s middleware system relies on the correct ordering of middleware components, and `chi` executes them in the order they are defined.
*   **Example:**
    *   Authentication middleware placed *after* a middleware that accesses sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful Planning:** Carefully plan and document the middleware chain. Understand the dependencies between middleware.
    *   **Auth First:** Ensure authentication and authorization middleware are applied *before* any middleware that accesses protected resources.
    *   **Middleware Testing:** Thoroughly test the middleware chain with various request scenarios, including unauthorized requests.
    *   **Code Review:** Review middleware configurations to ensure correct ordering.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Chi Version](./attack_surfaces/outdated_chi_version.md)

*   **Description:** Using an outdated version of `chi` that contains known vulnerabilities *within the chi library itself*.
*   **How Chi Contributes:** This is a direct vulnerability if the issue exists within `chi`'s code.
*   **Example:** Using a version of `chi` with a known vulnerability that allows for route hijacking *due to a bug in chi's routing logic*.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability; could range from minor information disclosure to complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Variable (depends on the vulnerability), potentially Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `chi` updated to the latest stable version.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (like Go modules) to track and update dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reported issues related to `chi` and its dependencies.
