# Threat Model Analysis for go-chi/chi

## Threat: [Threat: Route Hijacking via Misconfiguration](./threats/threat_route_hijacking_via_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts requests that exploit incorrectly defined routes. This is a *direct* consequence of how Chi handles routing.  Exploitation could involve:
    *   Providing unexpected input that matches a broader-than-intended regular expression *within a Chi route definition*.
    *   Exploiting overlapping routes where a less secure handler unintentionally handles a request *due to Chi's routing logic*.
    *   Using incorrect HTTP methods (e.g., sending a POST to a GET-only route) that has unintended side effects *because Chi doesn't enforce method restrictions by default unless explicitly configured*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access to protected resources or functionality.
    *   Execution of unintended code paths.
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   Information disclosure.
*   **Affected Component:** `chi.Router` interface, specifically the route definition methods (e.g., `Get`, `Post`, `Handle`, `HandleFunc`, `Route`, `Mount`, `With`). The core routing logic of Chi is the direct source of this threat.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the exposed functionality).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Precise Route Definitions:** Use the most specific route patterns possible. Avoid overly broad regular expressions *within Chi's route definitions*.
    *   **Method Restriction:** Explicitly define allowed HTTP methods for each route *using Chi's methods*.
    *   **Route Testing:** Extensive unit and integration tests covering all expected and unexpected inputs, specifically targeting *Chi's routing behavior*.
    *   **Route Visualization/Listing:** Generate a list or visualization of all defined routes *to help identify Chi-specific conflicts*.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory code reviews focusing on *Chi route definitions*.

## Threat: [Threat: Middleware Bypass](./threats/threat_middleware_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts requests that bypass intended security middleware *due to misconfiguration or vulnerabilities within Chi's middleware handling*. This is a direct threat to Chi's middleware system.  Examples:
    *   Incorrect middleware ordering (e.g., authentication *after* authorization) *within Chi's `Use` calls*.
    *   Middleware failing to handle certain error conditions *specific to how Chi processes requests*.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities within a third-party middleware component *that integrates with Chi*.  (While the vulnerability is in the third-party code, the *bypass* is a Chi-related threat).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Bypassing authentication and authorization checks.
    *   Circumventing security controls.
    *   Accessing resources without proper logging.
*   **Affected Component:** `chi.Router`'s middleware handling (`Use` method), and the interaction between Chi and any custom or third-party middleware.  The *way* Chi applies and chains middleware is the core issue.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the bypassed middleware).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Middleware Ordering:** Enforce a clear and documented order for middleware execution *within Chi's configuration*.
    *   **Middleware Testing:** Write dedicated tests to verify that middleware is applied correctly by Chi and handles all expected scenarios.
    *   **Third-Party Middleware Auditing:** Thoroughly vet and regularly update any third-party middleware *used with Chi*.
    *   **Centralized Middleware Application:** Consider applying common middleware at the top level of the *Chi router* to ensure consistent application.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Focus on *Chi's middleware application* during code reviews.

## Threat: [Threat: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./threats/threat_regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted input string that triggers excessive backtracking in a vulnerable regular expression *used within a Chi route pattern*. This directly exploits how Chi uses regular expressions for routing.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Affected Component:** `chi.Router` methods that accept regular expressions (e.g., `Route`, `Handle`, `HandleFunc`, `With` when used with regular expression patterns).  The *use of regular expressions within Chi's routing mechanism* is the direct threat.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Complex Regex:** Prefer simple regular expressions *within Chi route definitions*.
    *   **Regex Testing:** Use ReDoS detection tools to test regular expressions *used in Chi routes*.
    *   **Regex Timeouts:** Use `context.WithTimeout` to set a maximum execution time for regular expression matching *within Chi's request handling*.
    *   **Alternative Matching:** Consider if Chi's simpler string matching (prefix/suffix) can be used instead of regex.

## Threat: [Threat: Unhandled Panics](./threats/threat_unhandled_panics.md)

*   **Description:** A handler or middleware function *called by Chi* panics, and the panic is not recovered.  While panics can happen anywhere, the threat here is specifically about *Chi's handling (or lack thereof) of panics within its request processing pipeline*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   Information disclosure (stack traces).
*   **Affected Component:** All Chi handlers and middleware. Chi's `middleware.Recoverer` is *directly* relevant. The threat is the potential *absence or misconfiguration of Chi's panic recovery*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use `middleware.Recoverer`:** Always include `middleware.Recoverer` (or a robust custom implementation that integrates correctly with Chi) high in the *Chi middleware chain*.
    *   **Log Panics:** Log panic information, ensuring sensitive data is not exposed.
    *   **Generic Error Responses:** Return generic errors to the client.
    *   **Panic Testing:** Write tests that intentionally trigger panics *within Chi handlers* to verify recovery.
