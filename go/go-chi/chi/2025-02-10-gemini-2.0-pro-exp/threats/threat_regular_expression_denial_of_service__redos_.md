# Deep Analysis: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in go-chi/chi

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the ReDoS vulnerability within the context of a `go-chi/chi` based application, identify specific attack vectors, evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigations, and provide actionable recommendations for developers.  We aim to go beyond the general threat description and provide concrete examples and code-level analysis.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on ReDoS vulnerabilities arising from the use of regular expressions *within the routing mechanisms* of the `go-chi/chi` library.  It does *not* cover ReDoS vulnerabilities that might exist in other parts of the application (e.g., user input validation outside of routing) unless those parts directly interact with Chi's routing.  The scope includes:

*   `chi.Router` methods: `Route`, `Handle`, `HandleFunc`, `With` (and any other methods that accept route patterns).
*   Regular expressions used directly within route patterns (e.g., `r.Get("/articles/{id:[0-9]+}", handler)`).
*   The interaction between Chi's routing and Go's `regexp` package.
*   The effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies *in the context of Chi*.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:** Examine the `go-chi/chi` source code (specifically, the routing logic) to understand how regular expressions are handled and compiled.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** Identify potentially vulnerable regular expression patterns commonly used in routing.  Construct malicious inputs that could trigger ReDoS.
3.  **Mitigation Testing:**  Implement the proposed mitigation strategies and test their effectiveness against the identified vulnerable patterns and malicious inputs.  This will involve writing Go code and using profiling tools.
4.  **Best Practices Research:**  Review established best practices for preventing ReDoS in Go and adapt them to the `go-chi/chi` context.
5.  **Tool Evaluation:** Evaluate the effectiveness of ReDoS detection tools in identifying vulnerable patterns within Chi route definitions.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the ReDoS Threat

### 2.1 Attack Vectors and Vulnerable Patterns

The core of the ReDoS vulnerability lies in the backtracking behavior of regular expression engines.  Certain patterns, when combined with specific inputs, can cause the engine to explore an exponentially large number of possible matches, leading to excessive CPU consumption and, ultimately, denial of service.

In the context of `go-chi/chi`, the primary attack vector is the user-controlled input that forms part of the URL path.  Chi uses regular expressions to match these paths against defined routes.  Here are some examples of vulnerable patterns that could be used in Chi routes, along with explanations:

*   **Example 1:  Evil Regex - Grouping with repetition**

    ```go
    r.Get("/user/{name:a(b|c+)+d}", handler)
    ```

    *   **Vulnerability:** The `(b|c+)+` part is problematic.  The `c+` can match one or more 'c' characters, and the `(b|c+)+` can repeat this entire group one or more times.  An input like "abcccccccccccccccccccccccccccc!" can cause significant backtracking.  The engine tries `b`, then many variations of `c+`, then tries `b` again, and so on.
    *   **Malicious Input:**  `"/user/a" + strings.Repeat("c", 30) + "!"` (The number of 'c' characters needed to trigger a noticeable delay will depend on the system).

*   **Example 2: Evil Regex - Nested quantifiers**

    ```go
    r.Get("/articles/{slug:[a-z]+.*}", handler)
    ```

    *   **Vulnerability:** The `[a-z]+.*` pattern is dangerous.  `[a-z]+` matches one or more lowercase letters, and `.*` matches *any* character (including none) zero or more times.  The combination of these, especially with a long input string, can lead to excessive backtracking. The `.*` is particularly greedy and will try to consume as much as possible, then backtrack character by character.
    *   **Malicious Input:** `"/articles/" + strings.Repeat("a", 5000)` (A long string of 'a's will force the engine to try many combinations).

*   **Example 3: Evil Regex - Alternation with overlapping patterns**

    ```go
    r.Get("/search/{query:(abc|ab|a)+}", handler)
    ```
    *    **Vulnerability:** The alternatives `abc`, `ab`, and `a` overlap.  An input like "abcabcabcabcabc!" will cause the engine to try many different combinations of these alternatives.
    *   **Malicious Input:** `"/search/" + strings.Repeat("abc", 20) + "!"`

*   **Example 4:  Seemingly Benign, but Problematic**

    ```go
    r.Get("/products/{id:[0-9a-zA-Z_-]+}", handler)
    ```

    *   **Vulnerability:** While this looks simple, a very long ID with a specific pattern of characters *could* still cause performance issues, although it's less likely to be a *catastrophic* ReDoS.  The `+` quantifier is still a potential source of backtracking, especially if the input contains many alternating characters.
    *   **Malicious Input:**  A very long string (thousands of characters) alternating between numbers, letters, underscores, and hyphens.  The exact input that triggers a problem will depend on the `regexp` engine's implementation and optimizations.

### 2.2 Chi's Interaction with Go's `regexp` Package

`go-chi/chi` uses Go's built-in `regexp` package for regular expression matching.  Go's `regexp` package uses a backtracking engine (although it has some optimizations to mitigate common ReDoS issues).  Crucially, Chi compiles the regular expression *once* when the route is defined and reuses the compiled expression for each incoming request.  This is good for performance in normal cases, but it means that a vulnerable regular expression will be repeatedly exploited for every matching request.

The key files in `chi` to examine are:

*   `mux.go`:  This file contains the core routing logic, including the `route` method and the handling of regular expressions.
*   `tree.go`: This file implements the radix tree used for efficient route matching.  It interacts with the compiled regular expressions.

### 2.3 Mitigation Strategy Evaluation

Let's evaluate the proposed mitigation strategies in detail:

*   **Avoid Complex Regex:** This is the *most effective* mitigation.  Whenever possible, use Chi's built-in string matching capabilities (prefix, suffix, exact match) instead of regular expressions.  For example, instead of `r.Get("/articles/{id:[0-9]+}", handler)`, use `r.Get("/articles/{id}", handler)` and validate the `id` within the handler (e.g., using `strconv.Atoi`).  This completely avoids the ReDoS risk.

*   **Regex Testing:**  Using ReDoS detection tools is crucial for identifying vulnerable patterns *before* deployment.  Tools like:

    *   **`r2c-go` (Semgrep):**  A static analysis tool that can detect potentially vulnerable regular expressions in Go code.  You can integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline.
        ```bash
        semgrep --config r2c-go --lang go .
        ```
    *   **`regex-analyzer` (Node.js):**  A JavaScript library that can analyze regular expressions for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.  While not Go-specific, it can still be useful for analyzing the patterns themselves.
    *   **Manual Testing with Malicious Inputs:**  As demonstrated in the "Attack Vectors" section, crafting specific inputs that target potential backtracking issues is essential.

*   **Regex Timeouts:**  Using `context.WithTimeout` is a good *defense-in-depth* measure, but it's not a perfect solution.  It can prevent a single request from completely hanging the server, but it doesn't address the underlying vulnerability.  An attacker could still send many requests with slightly shorter timeouts, causing significant resource consumption.

    ```go
    func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(r.Context(), 100*time.Millisecond) // 100ms timeout
        defer cancel()

        // ... rest of the handler logic ...

        // Chi's internal routing already uses the request context,
        // so this timeout will apply to the regular expression matching.
        // If the regex takes longer than 100ms, the context will be cancelled.
    }
    ```

    *Important Note:*  The timeout applies to the *entire request context*, not just the regular expression matching.  If you have other long-running operations in your handler, you might need to use a separate context for the regex matching specifically.  However, since Chi uses the request context internally for routing, this timeout *will* affect the route matching process.

*   **Alternative Matching:** As mentioned in "Avoid Complex Regex," this is the preferred approach.  If you can achieve the desired routing behavior without regular expressions, do so.

### 2.4 Actionable Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Simple Matching:**  Use Chi's built-in string matching (prefix, suffix, exact match) whenever possible.  Avoid regular expressions in route patterns unless absolutely necessary.
2.  **Strict Input Validation:** If you *must* use regular expressions in route parameters, validate the extracted parameter *within the handler* using a *separate*, simpler, and safer regular expression or other validation logic (e.g., `strconv.Atoi` for numeric IDs).  This provides a second layer of defense.
3.  **Mandatory Regex Testing:** Integrate ReDoS detection tools (like `r2c-go`) into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for vulnerable regular expressions.  Make this a blocking check â€“ code with potential ReDoS vulnerabilities should not be deployed.
4.  **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Include ReDoS testing as part of your regular penetration testing or security audits.  Craft malicious inputs specifically designed to trigger backtracking in your route patterns.
5.  **Context Timeouts:**  Use `context.WithTimeout` to set a reasonable timeout for all requests.  This is a defense-in-depth measure that can limit the impact of a ReDoS attack, but it's not a substitute for avoiding vulnerable patterns.
6.  **Monitor and Alert:**  Monitor your application's CPU usage and response times.  Set up alerts for unusual spikes that might indicate a ReDoS attack.
7.  **Regular Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews, paying close attention to the use of regular expressions in Chi route definitions.
8. **Consider using safe regex engine**: Investigate possibility of using safe regex engine, like re2, instead of default one.

### 2.5 Example: Refactoring a Vulnerable Route

Let's say you have this vulnerable route:

```go
r.Get("/articles/{slug:[a-z]+.*}", handler)
```

Here's how you could refactor it to be safer:

```go
r.Get("/articles/{slug}", handler)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    slug := chi.URLParam(r, "slug")

    // Validate the slug using a simpler, safer regex (or other validation logic).
    if !isValidSlug(slug) {
        http.Error(w, "Invalid slug", http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }

    // ... rest of the handler logic ...
}

func isValidSlug(slug string) bool {
    // Example: Allow only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, with a maximum length.
    matched, err := regexp.MatchString(`^[a-z0-9\-]{1,64}$`, slug)
    return err == nil && matched
}
```

This approach avoids using a complex regular expression in the route definition itself.  Instead, it extracts the `slug` parameter and validates it using a separate, much safer regular expression (or other validation logic) within the handler. This significantly reduces the risk of ReDoS.

## 3. Conclusion

ReDoS is a serious threat to applications using regular expressions, and `go-chi/chi` applications are no exception.  By understanding the attack vectors, carefully evaluating mitigation strategies, and adopting a proactive approach to security, developers can significantly reduce the risk of ReDoS vulnerabilities in their Chi-based applications. The key is to avoid complex regular expressions in route patterns whenever possible, use robust validation techniques, and integrate automated testing into the development lifecycle.
