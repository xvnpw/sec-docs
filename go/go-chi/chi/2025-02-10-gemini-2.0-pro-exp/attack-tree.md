# Attack Tree Analysis for go-chi/chi

Objective: To achieve unauthorized access to application resources or functionality, or to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, specifically by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations related to the `chi` router.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Chi-Specific Middleware Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_chi-specific_middleware_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching critical node representing vulnerabilities within middleware used with `chi`. Middleware intercepts HTTP requests and can perform actions like authentication, authorization, logging, and request modification. Flaws in middleware can have a significant impact because they affect all requests passing through them.
*   **Likelihood:** High (Especially with custom middleware)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Middleware](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request that circumvents intended middleware checks. This could involve manipulating the URL path, headers, or other request parameters to avoid triggering the middleware or to cause it to behave unexpectedly.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Error Handling in Middleware](./attack_tree_paths/improper_error_handling_in_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** Middleware fails to handle errors correctly, potentially leaking sensitive information in error responses or allowing requests to proceed when they should be blocked.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Low to High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Custom Middleware](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_custom_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** Custom-written middleware contains vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, or other flaws that an attacker can exploit. This is the *most likely* source of serious vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** Low to Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to High
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Wildcard Matching Issues](./attack_tree_paths/wildcard_matching_issues.md)

*   **Description:** Overly broad wildcard patterns in routes (e.g., `/{param:.+}`) can be abused by sending requests with very long or complex parameter values, leading to high CPU or memory usage.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Regex DoS (ReDoS)](./attack_tree_paths/regex_dos__redos_.md)

*   **Description:** If regular expressions used in routing (or in middleware handling route parameters) are vulnerable to ReDoS, an attacker can craft a request that causes the regex engine to consume excessive CPU time, leading to a denial-of-service.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Parameter Injection](./attack_tree_paths/parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  A handler uses a route parameter directly in a security-sensitive operation (e.g., SQL query, shell command) *without proper sanitization or validation*. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code, leading to SQL injection, command injection, or other injection attacks.  This is a vulnerability in the *handler*, but it's enabled by `chi` providing the parameter.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
