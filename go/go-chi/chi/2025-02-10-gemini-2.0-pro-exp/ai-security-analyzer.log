This is the core `chi`-specific mitigation.  Instead of:\n            ```go\n            r.Get("/users/{id}", getUser) // Vulnerable!\n            ```\n            Use:\n            ```go\n            r.Get("/users/{id:[0-9]+}", getUser) // Only allows numeric IDs\n            ```\n            Or, for a UUID:\n            ```go\n            r.Get("/users/{id:[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}}", getUser)\n            ```\n            Avoid overly permissive patterns like `/{id:.*}` or `/{id}` (without a regex). The more precise the regex, the better the protection.\n        2.  **`chi.URLParam` for Retrieval:**  Within the handler, use `chi.URLParam(r, \"id\")` to safely retrieve the parameter value from the request context (`r`). This is a `chi`-provided function designed for this purpose.\n\n    *   **Threats Mitigated:**\n        *   **Path Traversal:** (Severity: High) - The strict regex prevents the use of `../` or other path manipulation characters *before* the handler is even called. This is a first line of defense.\n        *   **NoSQL Injection/Command Injection:** (Severity: High) - By limiting the allowed characters at the routing level, you significantly reduce the risk of injection attacks, although further validation within the handler is still recommended.\n        *   **Unexpected Application Behavior:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents unexpected input from reaching the handler, improving robustness.\n\n    *   **Impact:**\n        *   **Path Traversal:** Risk significantly reduced (almost eliminated at the routing level; further file handling security is still needed).\n        *   **NoSQL Injection/Command Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (but not eliminated; proper database/command handling is still essential).\n        *   **Unexpected Application Behavior:** Risk significantly reduced.\n\n    *   **Currently Implemented:**  *Example: Implemented for all routes using numeric IDs (`[0-9]+`).  Implemented for UUIDs using the full UUID regex.* (Replace with your project's details)\n\n    *   **Missing Implementation:** *Example: Missing for `/articles/{slug}` route.

This ensures that the middleware is executed in the correct order for that group.\n        4.  **Global Middleware (Optional):**  For middleware that should apply to *all* routes (e.g., basic request logging), use `r.Use(...)` on the main router *before* any group definitions.\n\n    *   **Threats Mitigated:**\n        *   **Authentication Bypass:** (Severity: High) - Ensures that authentication middleware is executed *before* handlers that require authentication.\n        *   **Authorization Bypass:** (Severity: High) - Ensures that authorization middleware is executed *before* handlers that require specific permissions.\n        *   **Inconsistent Security:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents situations where some routes are accidentally left unprotected due to incorrect middleware configuration.\n\n    *   **Impact:**\n        *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass:** Risk significantly reduced (almost eliminated if middleware is correctly implemented and comprehensive).\n        *   **Inconsistent Security:** Risk significantly reduced by providing a clear and organized way to manage middleware.\n\n    *   **Currently Implemented:** *Example: We are using `chi.Group` to apply authentication middleware to all routes under `/api/v1/private`.
