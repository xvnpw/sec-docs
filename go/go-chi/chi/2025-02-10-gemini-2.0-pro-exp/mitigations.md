# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for go-chi/chi

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit Route Ordering and Testing (Chi-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/explicit_route_ordering_and_testing__chi-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Chi Route Analysis:** Analyze all routes defined using `chi.Router`. Identify potential overlaps or ambiguities *specifically considering chi's routing mechanisms*.  Pay close attention to how `chi` handles wildcards (`{param}`), regular expressions, and nested routers.
    2.  **Chi-Aware Prioritization:** Reorder route definitions, leveraging `chi`'s behavior of processing routes in the order they are registered.  More specific `chi` routes (e.g., those with more static segments) should *always* precede more general ones (e.g., those with multiple wildcards).
    3.  **Chi-Specific Test Cases:** Create test cases that target `chi`'s routing logic.  This includes:
        *   **Wildcard Variations:** Test different values for wildcard parameters, including empty strings, special characters, and long strings.
        *   **Regular Expression Matching:** If using regular expressions in routes, thoroughly test the regex patterns to ensure they match only the intended inputs.
        *   **Nested Router Interactions:** If using nested routers (`chi.Mux`), test how routes defined in different routers interact.
        *   **Chi Context Values:** Verify that `chi.RouteContext` is populated correctly with the expected URL parameters in each handler.
    4.  **`httptest` with Chi:** Use Go's `net/http/httptest` package to create HTTP requests and send them *directly* to your `chi` router instance.  This ensures you are testing `chi`'s routing logic in isolation.
    5.  **Automated Chi-Focused Tests:** Integrate these `chi`-specific tests into your CI pipeline.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Chi-Specific Route Hijacking (High Severity):** An attacker crafts a request that exploits `chi`'s routing logic to bypass intended access controls.
    *   **Unexpected Chi Handler Execution (Medium Severity):** Ambiguous routes, *as interpreted by chi*, lead to the wrong handler being executed.
    *   **Chi Context Parameter Injection (Medium Severity):** An attacker manipulates URL parameters to inject unexpected values into `chi.RouteContext`, potentially leading to vulnerabilities in handlers that rely on those parameters.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Chi-Specific Route Hijacking:** Risk significantly reduced. Explicit ordering and `chi`-focused testing make it much harder to exploit `chi`'s routing nuances.
    *   **Unexpected Chi Handler Execution:** Risk significantly reduced. Testing ensures the correct `chi` handler is invoked.
    *   **Chi Context Parameter Injection:** Risk reduced. Testing verifies that `chi.RouteContext` is populated correctly and that handlers properly validate and sanitize these parameters.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Basic route ordering is implemented, but tests don't specifically target `chi`'s wildcard handling or nested router interactions.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Comprehensive testing for `chi`'s regular expression routing is missing. Tests don't verify the contents of `chi.RouteContext` in all handlers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Chi Middleware Configuration and Ordering](./mitigation_strategies/secure_chi_middleware_configuration_and_ordering.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Chi Middleware Audit:** List all middleware used *with your chi router*.  Document the purpose of each middleware and how it interacts with `chi`'s request lifecycle.
    2.  **Chi-Specific Ordering:**  Ensure middleware is ordered correctly *within the chi router's context*.  Understand how `chi` executes middleware relative to routing and sub-routers.  Authentication middleware should *always* be registered before authorization middleware within the `chi` router.
    3.  **Chi Context Awareness:**  If middleware interacts with `chi.RouteContext` (e.g., to access URL parameters), ensure it does so securely.  Validate and sanitize any data retrieved from the context.
    4.  **"Fail Closed" with Chi:**  Design authorization middleware that is specifically integrated with `chi` to "fail closed."  If the middleware, using `chi`'s context and routing information, cannot definitively determine authorization, it should deny access.
    5.  **Chi-Specific Middleware Testing:** Create tests that specifically verify the behavior of middleware *within the context of a chi router*.  Use `httptest` to send requests through your `chi` router and assert the expected behavior of the middleware chain.
    6.  **Chi Sub-Router Middleware:** If using `chi`'s sub-routers, carefully consider the placement of middleware.  Middleware registered on a parent router will apply to all sub-routers unless overridden.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Chi-Related Authentication Bypass (Critical Severity):** Incorrectly configured or ordered authentication middleware *within chi* allows bypass.
    *   **Chi-Related Authorization Bypass (Critical Severity):** Flaws in authorization middleware, specifically in how it interacts with `chi`'s routing and context, allow unauthorized access.
    *   **Chi Context Manipulation (High Severity):** Middleware improperly modifies `chi.RouteContext`, potentially leading to vulnerabilities in downstream handlers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Chi-Related Authentication/Authorization Bypass:** Risk significantly reduced by correct ordering, "fail closed" design, and `chi`-specific testing.
    *   **Chi Context Manipulation:** Risk reduced by validating and sanitizing data retrieved from and written to `chi.RouteContext` within middleware.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Authentication middleware is registered with the `chi` router, but authorization middleware is not "fail closed" and doesn't fully utilize `chi.RouteContext`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Comprehensive testing of middleware interactions *specifically within the chi router* is missing.  The "fail closed" principle is not consistently applied to authorization middleware integrated with `chi`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Chi Context Value Handling](./mitigation_strategies/secure_chi_context_value_handling.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Chi Context Audit:** Review all code that interacts with `chi.RouteContext` and the underlying `context.Context`.
    2.  **Avoid Sensitive Data in Chi Context:**  Never store sensitive data directly in `chi.RouteContext` or the underlying `context.Context`.
    3.  **Typed Keys for Chi Context:** Use typed keys (not strings) when storing and retrieving values from the `context.Context` *that is passed through chi*. This is a general Go best practice, but it's crucial within `chi`'s middleware and handler chain.
    4.  **Chi Context Scope Awareness:** Understand that data added to the context in one `chi` middleware will be available to subsequent `chi` middleware and the handler.  Limit the scope and lifetime of data in the context.
    5.  **Secure Storage with Chi:** If you need to associate sensitive data with a request handled by `chi`, use a secure storage mechanism (e.g., encrypted sessions) and store only a *reference* (e.g., session ID) in the `chi.RouteContext` or the underlying context.
    6. **Chi Context Validation:** Validate and sanitize any data retrieved from `chi.RouteContext` within your handlers. Do not assume that the data is safe, even if it was added by a trusted middleware.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Chi Context Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Leaking sensitive data stored in `chi.RouteContext` or the underlying context.
    *   **Chi Context-Based Session Hijacking (Critical Severity):** If session tokens are insecurely stored in the `chi` context, an attacker could hijack a session.
    *   **Chi Context Data Tampering (Medium Severity):** Mutable data in the `chi` context could be tampered with, affecting downstream handlers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Chi Context Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced by avoiding direct storage of sensitive data.
    *   **Chi Context-Based Session Hijacking:** Risk significantly reduced by using secure session management and storing only references in the `chi` context.
    *   **Chi Context Data Tampering:** Risk reduced by using typed keys, limiting scope, and validating data retrieved from the `chi` context.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Typed keys are used for some `chi.RouteContext` values, but not consistently.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: A comprehensive review of all `chi.RouteContext` usage is needed to ensure no sensitive data is stored directly and that typed keys are used consistently. Handlers do not always validate data retrieved from the context.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Chi Panic Handling (using `chi.Recoverer`)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_chi_panic_handling__using__chi_recoverer__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`chi.Recoverer` Integration:** Ensure the `chi.Recoverer` middleware is included in your *main chi router's* middleware stack. This is crucial for handling panics that occur within `chi`'s routing and handler execution.
    2.  **`chi.Recoverer` Configuration:** Verify that `chi.Recoverer` is correctly configured to log panics (including stack traces) to a secure location.  The client should *never* receive the stack trace.
    3.  **Custom Error Responses (with Chi):** While `chi.Recoverer` provides a default 500 response, you can customize this, but ensure no sensitive information is leaked in the custom response.
    4.  **Chi-Specific Panic Testing:** Write tests that intentionally trigger panics *within chi handlers* to verify that `chi.Recoverer` catches them and handles them gracefully.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Chi-Related Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Unhandled panics within `chi` handlers or middleware can crash the application.
    *   **Chi-Related Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Unhandled panics can leak sensitive information (stack traces) in responses generated by `chi`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Chi-Related DoS:** Risk significantly reduced. `chi.Recoverer` prevents `chi`-related panics from crashing the application.
    *   **Chi-Related Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced. `chi.Recoverer` prevents stack traces from being exposed to clients in responses from `chi`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `chi.Recoverer` is included in the main `chi` router's middleware stack.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Testing for panic handling specifically within `chi` handlers is incomplete.
