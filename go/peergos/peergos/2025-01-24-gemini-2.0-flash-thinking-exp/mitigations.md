# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for peergos/peergos

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Peergos Access Control Mechanisms Effectively](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_peergos_access_control_mechanisms_effectively.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Thoroughly review and understand Peergos's specific access control system as documented in Peergos documentation.
    2.  For every piece of data stored within Peergos using your application, explicitly define access control policies using Peergos's permissioning features. Do not rely on default or implicit Peergos permissions.
    3.  Apply the principle of least privilege within the Peergos context. Grant only the necessary Peergos permissions to users, applications, or services that need to access specific data stored in Peergos. Avoid overly broad Peergos permissions.
    4.  Categorize data stored in Peergos based on sensitivity and access requirements. Implement different Peergos access control policies for different categories of data within Peergos.
    5.  Regularly audit and review access control configurations within Peergos. As application requirements evolve or user roles change, ensure that Peergos access control policies are updated accordingly. Implement automated tools or scripts to periodically check and report on Peergos access control settings.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access within Peergos Network (Medium Severity): Prevents users or applications with insufficient Peergos permissions from accessing sensitive data stored in Peergos.
    *   Data Modification or Deletion by Unauthorized Parties within Peergos (Medium Severity): Restricts the ability to modify or delete data within Peergos to authorized users or applications only, leveraging Peergos's access control.
    *   Privilege Escalation within Peergos Context (Low to Medium Severity): Limits the potential damage from compromised accounts or applications by ensuring they only have access to the Peergos resources they absolutely need, as defined by Peergos permissions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access within Peergos Network: Moderate Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of internal unauthorized access within the Peergos ecosystem by using Peergos's features.
    *   Data Modification or Deletion by Unauthorized Parties within Peergos: Moderate Risk Reduction - Protects data integrity and availability within Peergos from unauthorized modifications using Peergos's controls.
    *   Privilege Escalation within Peergos Context: Moderate Risk Reduction - Limits the blast radius of potential security breaches within the Peergos environment.

    *   Data Tampering by Malicious Peergos Nodes (Medium Severity):  Identifies if a malicious Peergos node has altered the data after it was stored within Peergos, using Peergos's integrity verification capabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Corruption during Storage or Retrieval within Peergos: Moderate Risk Reduction - Ensures data reliability within Peergos and prevents applications from using corrupted data retrieved from Peergos, by utilizing Peergos's integrity checks.
    *   Data Tampering by Malicious Peergos Nodes: Moderate Risk Reduction - Detects malicious modifications within Peergos, allowing for corrective actions based on Peergos's integrity verification.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Assume integrity checks are used for critical application files or configurations stored in Peergos, potentially using Peergos's content addressing or similar features.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Potentially missing comprehensive utilization of all available Peergos integrity features for all data types stored in Peergos. Also, automated processes for handling integrity failures reported by Peergos (retries, alerts) might be lacking.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Be Mindful of Metadata Exposure within Peergos](./mitigation_strategies/be_mindful_of_metadata_exposure_within_peergos.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Analyze what metadata is automatically generated and stored by Peergos alongside your data. Refer to Peergos documentation to understand Peergos's metadata handling. This might include file names, sizes, timestamps, access patterns as managed by Peergos, and potentially other information exposed by Peergos.
    2.  Identify any metadata fields within Peergos that could reveal sensitive information about users, application functionality, or data content when stored in Peergos.
    3.  Minimize the storage of sensitive metadata in Peergos if possible. For example, when using Peergos APIs, avoid using descriptive file names that are stored as Peergos metadata; use generic or hashed names instead.
    4.  If sensitive metadata must be stored within Peergos, consider encrypting or obfuscating it *before* storing it in Peergos, especially if Peergos itself doesn't offer metadata encryption. This might involve encrypting file names or other metadata fields before using Peergos APIs to store them.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Privacy Breaches through Peergos Metadata Analysis: Moderate Risk Reduction - Protects user privacy by limiting the information available through Peergos metadata.
    *   Information Leakage about Application Functionality via Peergos Metadata: Minor Risk Reduction - Reduces the attack surface by limiting publicly available information about the application through Peergos metadata.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Assume awareness of metadata exposure within Peergos during development and some basic measures to avoid storing overly sensitive file names as Peergos metadata.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Systematic analysis of all metadata fields managed by Peergos, automated obfuscation or encryption of sensitive metadata before storing in Peergos, and user education on metadata privacy within the Peergos context.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Peer Authentication and Authorization (if directly interacting with Peergos peers)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_peer_authentication_and_authorization__if_directly_interacting_with_peergos_peers_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  If your application directly interacts with Peergos peers (beyond just using Peergos for storage via client libraries), implement robust peer authentication mechanisms as supported by Peergos. This might involve using cryptographic keys, digital signatures, or secure identity protocols offered by Peergos for peer-to-peer communication.
    2.  Verify the identity of each Peergos peer before establishing communication or exchanging sensitive data in peer-to-peer interactions. Do not trust Peergos peers based solely on network addresses or superficial identifiers provided by Peergos.
    3.  Implement peer authorization within the Peergos peer-to-peer context. Define policies that specify which actions each authenticated Peergos peer is allowed to perform. This could include access to specific data, participation in certain Peergos network functions, or execution of specific commands within the Peergos peer network.
    4.  Use secure communication channels for peer-to-peer interactions with Peergos peers. Encrypt all communication between Peergos peers to protect data in transit and prevent eavesdropping within the Peergos peer network. Utilize secure communication protocols supported by Peergos for peer communication.
    5.  Regularly review and update peer authentication and authorization policies for Peergos peer interactions as needed.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Peergos Peer-to-Peer Network Functions (Medium Severity): Prevents unauthorized Peergos peers from participating in network operations or accessing peer-to-peer services within the Peergos network.
