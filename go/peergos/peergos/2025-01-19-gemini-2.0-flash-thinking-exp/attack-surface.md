# Attack Surface Analysis for peergos/peergos

## Attack Surface: [Data Corruption/Availability Issues in Decentralized Storage](./attack_surfaces/data_corruptionavailability_issues_in_decentralized_storage.md)

* **Description:** Malicious or compromised peers in the Peergos network could introduce corrupted data or refuse to serve data, leading to data integrity problems or unavailability.
    * **How Peergos Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Peergos' decentralized nature means your application relies on the trustworthiness and availability of a distributed network of peers, some of which you don't control.
    * **Example:** An attacker controlling several peers injects corrupted chunks into a file being downloaded by a user of your application. The user receives a damaged file.
    * **Impact:** Data loss, application malfunction, user distrust, potential legal liabilities if data integrity is critical.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers should:**
            * Implement robust data verification mechanisms on the application side, even after Peergos verification.
            * Utilize Peergos' pinning features to ensure critical data is hosted by trusted nodes.
            * Consider redundancy strategies by storing multiple copies of important data across different trusted peers.
            * Implement mechanisms to detect and handle data inconsistencies.

## Attack Surface: [Content Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/content_poisoning.md)

* **Description:** Attackers could attempt to associate malicious content with the content hash of legitimate data, potentially tricking users into accessing harmful files.
    * **How Peergos Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Peergos relies on content addressing, where content is identified by its hash. If the process of associating content with a hash is compromised, malicious content can be served under a legitimate hash.
    * **Example:** An attacker manages to inject malware and associate its hash with the hash of a popular software update. Users requesting the update through your application receive the malware.
    * **Impact:** Distribution of malware, phishing attacks, reputational damage, compromise of user systems.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers should:**
            * Implement strong content verification mechanisms beyond Peergos' built-in checks.
            * Utilize content signing or other cryptographic methods to ensure the authenticity and integrity of data.
            * Provide users with ways to verify the source and authenticity of content.

## Attack Surface: [Sybil Attacks in the Peer-to-Peer Network](./attack_surfaces/sybil_attacks_in_the_peer-to-peer_network.md)

* **Description:** An attacker creates a large number of fake identities (peers) to gain disproportionate influence over the Peergos network, potentially disrupting routing, data retrieval, or consensus mechanisms.
    * **How Peergos Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Peergos' reliance on a peer-to-peer network makes it susceptible to Sybil attacks if there are no strong mechanisms to prevent the creation of numerous fake identities.
    * **Example:** An attacker creates thousands of fake peers, overwhelming the routing table and making it difficult for legitimate peers to connect or find data.
    * **Impact:** Network instability, denial of service, censorship, manipulation of network behavior.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers should:**
            * Investigate and potentially implement or leverage Peergos features for peer reputation and identity verification.
            * Consider strategies to limit the impact of Sybil attacks, such as requiring proof-of-work or stake for peer participation (if Peergos allows for such extensions).
            * Monitor network behavior for suspicious patterns indicative of Sybil attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in libp2p (Peergos' Networking Library)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_libp2p__peergos'_networking_library_.md)

* **Description:** Security vulnerabilities in the underlying libp2p library used by Peergos could be exploited to compromise the application.
    * **How Peergos Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Peergos directly depends on libp2p for its networking functionality, inheriting any vulnerabilities present in that library.
    * **Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific libp2p protocol allows an attacker to remotely crash Peergos nodes.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, remote code execution, information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers should:**
            * Regularly update Peergos and its dependencies, including libp2p, to patch known vulnerabilities.
            * Monitor security advisories for libp2p and Peergos.
            * Implement security best practices in their application to minimize the impact of potential libp2p vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Access Control and Permission Model Flaws](./attack_surfaces/access_control_and_permission_model_flaws.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Peergos manages access control and permissions for data could allow unauthorized users to access or modify sensitive information.
    * **How Peergos Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Peergos' permissioning system directly controls who can access and modify data stored within it. Flaws in this system can lead to security breaches.
    * **Example:** A bug in Peergos' permission logic allows a user with read-only access to modify a file.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data breaches, data modification, privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers should:**
            * Thoroughly understand and carefully configure Peergos' access control mechanisms.
            * Regularly audit and test the permission model to identify potential vulnerabilities.
            * Follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions.
