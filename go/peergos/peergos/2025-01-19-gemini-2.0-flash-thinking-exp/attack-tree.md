## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Storage Vulnerabilities in Peergos [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_storage_vulnerabilities_in_peergos__critical_.md)

* This is a critical area because it directly targets the storage of application data within Peergos. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of sensitive information.
    * Exploit Insecure Permissions/Access Control (if implemented by application on top of Peergos) [CRITICAL]
        * This is a critical node and a high-risk path. If the application doesn't implement proper access controls on top of Peergos's storage, attackers can bypass intended security measures.
        * Bypass Application-Level Access Checks
            * Attackers exploit flaws in the application's logic to gain unauthorized access to data stored in Peergos. This path has a medium likelihood and high impact.
    * Modify Data Integrity [CRITICAL]
        * This is a critical area because it targets the trustworthiness of the data. Successful attacks can compromise the application's functionality and user trust.
        * Inject Malicious Content [CRITICAL]
            * This is a critical node and a high-risk path. Attackers aim to insert harmful data into Peergos.
            * Exploit Weaknesses in Content Validation by Application
                * The application fails to properly check the content retrieved from Peergos, allowing malicious data to be used. This path has a medium likelihood and medium-high impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Content Addressing/Verification Weaknesses [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_content_addressingverification_weaknesses__critical_.md)

* This is a critical area because it undermines the core principle of content-addressed storage. Successful exploitation can lead to users receiving malicious content instead of legitimate data.
    * Content Poisoning [CRITICAL]
        * This is a critical node and a high-risk path. Attackers aim to associate malicious content with legitimate content identifiers.
        * Provide Malicious Content for a Known Hash (if application doesn't verify source/signature)
            * If the application trusts content solely based on its hash, attackers can provide malicious content with the correct hash. This path has a medium likelihood and high impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Peergos API/Integration [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_peergos_apiintegration__critical_.md)

* This is a critical area because the API is a primary interface for the application to interact with Peergos. Vulnerabilities here can have significant consequences.
    * Abuse Insecure API Endpoints (if application uses Peergos API directly) [CRITICAL]
        * This is a critical node and a high-risk path. Attackers target weaknesses in the API's security measures.
        * Exploit Missing Authentication/Authorization Checks
            * The API lacks proper checks, allowing unauthorized access and actions. This path has a medium likelihood and high impact.
    * Data Injection through Peergos API [CRITICAL]
        * This is a critical node and a high-risk path. Attackers inject malicious data through the API.
        * Inject Malicious Data that the Application Processes Unsafely
            * The application doesn't sanitize data received from the API, leading to vulnerabilities. This path has a medium likelihood and medium-high impact.
