# Threat Model Analysis for peergos/peergos

## Threat: [Malicious Peer Serving Corrupted Data](./threats/malicious_peer_serving_corrupted_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of a peer in the Peergos network. When the application requests data hosted by this peer, the attacker serves intentionally corrupted or tampered data. This could involve modifying file contents, altering metadata, or providing incomplete data.

**Impact:** The application processes incorrect data, leading to application errors, incorrect calculations, display of false information, or even security vulnerabilities if the corrupted data is used in a sensitive context. This can damage the application's reliability and user trust.

**Affected Peergos Component:** Data Retrieval Module, Peer-to-peer Network.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust data integrity verification mechanisms (e.g., cryptographic hashes) on the application side after retrieving data from Peergos. Utilize Peergos's built-in content addressing to verify data authenticity. Consider using multiple retrievals from different peers and comparing the results (if feasible for the application).

## Threat: [Manipulation of Mutable Data Structures (MDS)](./threats/manipulation_of_mutable_data_structures__mds_.md)

**Description:** An attacker who has gained unauthorized write access to a Peergos MDS used by the application modifies the data within it. This could involve changing values, adding or removing entries, or altering the structure of the MDS.

**Impact:** The application relies on the integrity of the MDS for its functionality. Unauthorized modifications can lead to incorrect application state, broken workflows, unauthorized access to features, or even security vulnerabilities if the MDS controls access permissions.

**Affected Peergos Component:** Mutable Data Structures (MDS) Module, Access Control Mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strict access control policies for MDS, ensuring only authorized users or application components have write access. Regularly audit MDS changes. Utilize cryptographic signatures or other integrity checks on the MDS content if supported by Peergos or implementable at the application level.

## Threat: [Private Key Compromise Leading to Data Breach](./threats/private_key_compromise_leading_to_data_breach.md)

**Description:** An attacker obtains a user's Peergos private key through phishing, malware, or other means. With the private key, the attacker can decrypt data encrypted with the corresponding public key, potentially gaining access to sensitive application data stored in Peergos.

**Impact:** Complete loss of confidentiality for data associated with the compromised private key. This can lead to exposure of personal information, financial data, or other sensitive application-specific data, resulting in significant reputational damage and legal consequences.

**Affected Peergos Component:** Encryption Subsystem, Identity Management.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Educate users on the importance of private key security and best practices for key management. Encourage the use of strong passwords and multi-factor authentication for accessing key storage. Explore options for secure key storage and management within the application or through Peergos features.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Peergos's Access Control Mechanisms](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_peergos's_access_control_mechanisms.md)

**Description:** Flaws in Peergos's permissioning system could allow unauthorized users to access or modify data they shouldn't. This could be due to bugs in the code, logical errors in the design, or misconfigurations.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or privilege escalation within the application's Peergos storage.

**Affected Peergos Component:** Access Control Module, Permission Management.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Thoroughly understand and correctly implement Peergos's access control mechanisms. Regularly review and audit access permissions. Keep Peergos updated to benefit from security patches. If possible, implement an additional layer of access control at the application level.

## Threat: [Bugs and Vulnerabilities in Peergos Core Code](./threats/bugs_and_vulnerabilities_in_peergos_core_code.md)

**Description:** Like any software, Peergos might contain undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, injection flaws, logic errors) that could be exploited by attackers to compromise the application or its data.

**Impact:** A wide range of potential impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, or privilege escalation.

**Affected Peergos Component:** Various modules and components within the Peergos codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical, High, or Medium).

**Mitigation Strategies:** Stay updated with the latest Peergos releases and security patches. Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Peergos. If contributing to Peergos development, follow secure coding practices and perform thorough testing.
