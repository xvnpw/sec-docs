### High and Critical Peergos Threats

This list contains high and critical severity threats directly involving the Peergos platform.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Peer Serves Corrupted Data
    *   **Description:** An attacker controlling a peer in the Peergos network intentionally modifies data chunks they are storing. When our application requests this data, the malicious peer serves the corrupted version.
    *   **Impact:** Our application receives and potentially processes incorrect data, leading to application errors, incorrect information displayed to users, or even security vulnerabilities if the corrupted data is interpreted as code or configuration.
    *   **Affected Peergos Component:** Storage Layer, Peer-to-peer network
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement data integrity checks (e.g., checksums, cryptographic signatures) on data retrieved from Peergos within our application.
        *   Utilize Peergos features for data redundancy and retrieval from multiple sources.
        *   If Peergos supports it, implement or leverage reputation systems for peers to prioritize data from trusted sources.
        *   Verify the content hash of retrieved data against the expected hash.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Access via Permission Misconfiguration
    *   **Description:** Permissions within Peergos are incorrectly configured, allowing unauthorized peers to access sensitive data belonging to our application.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential data stored on Peergos is exposed to unauthorized parties, potentially leading to privacy breaches, data leaks, or misuse of information.
    *   **Affected Peergos Component:** Access Control mechanisms, Permission management
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure and review Peergos permissions for all data associated with our application.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access.
        *   Regularly audit Peergos permissions to ensure they remain appropriate.
        *   Utilize Peergos features for encrypting data at rest and in transit.

*   **Threat:** Compromise of Peergos Private Keys
    *   **Description:** The private keys associated with our application's Peergos identity are compromised (e.g., through insecure storage, phishing attacks).
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can impersonate our application on the Peergos network, access its data, modify its data, or perform unauthorized actions on its behalf.
    *   **Affected Peergos Component:** Identity management, Key management
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store and manage Peergos private keys using strong encryption and access controls.
        *   Implement secure key generation and rotation practices.
        *   Educate developers and operators about the importance of key security and the risks of compromise.
        *   Consider using hardware security modules (HSMs) for key storage.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Peergos's Identity Management
    *   **Description:**  Security flaws exist in how Peergos manages user identities and authentication, allowing attackers to bypass authentication or impersonate legitimate users or applications.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data and functionalities within Peergos, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Peergos Component:** Identity management, Authentication mechanisms
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated on the latest Peergos releases and security advisories.
        *   Monitor for any reported vulnerabilities in Peergos's identity management system.

*   **Threat:** Bugs and Vulnerabilities in Peergos Core Code
    *   **Description:**  Undiscovered security vulnerabilities exist within the Peergos codebase itself.
    *   **Impact:**  A wide range of potential impacts, including remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, and more, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Peergos Component:** Various core modules and functions within Peergos.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical, High, or Medium depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated on the latest Peergos releases and security advisories.
        *   Monitor for any reported vulnerabilities in Peergos.
        *   Consider contributing to or supporting security audits of the Peergos codebase.
        *   Implement security best practices in our application to minimize the impact of potential Peergos vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation, output encoding).
