# Attack Surface Analysis for peergos/peergos

## Attack Surface: [Sybil Attacks](./attack_surfaces/sybil_attacks.md)

- **Description:** An attacker creates a large number of fake identities (nodes) to gain disproportionate influence in the P2P network.
- **Peergos Contribution:** Peergos, as a decentralized P2P system, inherently relies on distributed trust and node participation. The lack of centralized authority makes it vulnerable to Sybil attacks if not properly mitigated at the application or Peergos level.
- **Example:** An attacker spins up thousands of Peergos nodes and uses them to manipulate distributed consensus mechanisms within Peergos, such as voting on data availability or network governance, disrupting the intended operation of the Peergos network.
- **Impact:** Network instability, manipulation of distributed decisions, denial of service, reduced data availability, undermining the integrity of decentralized processes within Peergos.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developers:** Implement robust node identity verification and reputation systems *within the Peergos application layer*. Explore and utilize any Peergos or libp2p features designed for Sybil resistance (if available and applicable). Consider application-level rate limiting or proof-of-work mechanisms for node participation.
    - **Users:** Choose to participate in Peergos networks with established and vetted node communities. Be cautious of joining networks with unknown or anonymous participants where Sybil attacks are more likely.

## Attack Surface: [Eclipse Attacks](./attack_surfaces/eclipse_attacks.md)

- **Description:** An attacker isolates a target Peergos node from the legitimate network, controlling all its peer connections and the information it receives.
- **Peergos Contribution:** Peergos's P2P networking model, while decentralized, relies on peer discovery and connection mechanisms that can be manipulated.  An attacker exploiting vulnerabilities in peer discovery or connection establishment can isolate a target Peergos node.
- **Example:** An attacker targets a Peergos node responsible for indexing or routing critical data within the application. By eclipsing this node, the attacker can prevent it from receiving legitimate network updates, feed it false routing information, and effectively disrupt data access or network functionality for users relying on that node.
- **Impact:** Data manipulation for the eclipsed node, denial of service for the eclipsed node and potentially dependent users, compromise of data integrity and availability within the Peergos application context.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developers:** Implement mechanisms within the Peergos application for nodes to detect potential eclipse attacks. This could involve monitoring network topology changes, cross-verifying information with multiple independent peers, and implementing redundancy in critical node roles. Utilize diverse and robust peer discovery strategies.
    - **Users:** Ensure your Peergos node connects to a diverse and geographically distributed set of peers. Monitor your node's peer connections for anomalies or sudden changes. Regularly check for network consistency by verifying information with peers outside your immediate connection set.

## Attack Surface: [Key Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/key_management_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Insecure generation, storage, or handling of cryptographic keys that are fundamental to Peergos's security model (identity keys, encryption keys, access control keys).
- **Peergos Contribution:** Peergos's security architecture is built upon strong cryptography and relies on secure key management for node identity, data encryption, and access control. Weaknesses in how Peergos or the application handles these keys directly compromise the entire security foundation.
- **Example:** Peergos stores user's private identity keys in an unencrypted file on disk. An attacker gains local system access and retrieves these keys, allowing them to impersonate the user's Peergos identity, access their private data, and potentially manipulate data within the Peergos network as that user.
- **Impact:** Complete compromise of user identity within Peergos, unauthorized access to all data associated with the compromised identity, potential data manipulation or deletion, loss of confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity within the Peergos application.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developers:**  Utilize secure key generation and storage practices *specifically when integrating with Peergos's key management*. Leverage operating system-level key stores or dedicated secure enclaves where possible. Enforce strong password/passphrase policies if keys are encrypted with user-provided secrets. Provide clear guidance to users on secure key backup and recovery procedures.
    - **Users:**  Use strong, unique passwords/passphrases to protect any encrypted private keys used by Peergos. Store private keys securely, ideally using hardware security modules, dedicated key management software, or encrypted storage mechanisms. Regularly back up keys securely and offline.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Flaws in Peergos's permissioning and access control mechanisms that allow users to circumvent intended restrictions and gain unauthorized access to data or perform actions they should not be permitted to.
- **Peergos Contribution:** Peergos likely implements its own access control system to manage permissions for data sharing and operations within its decentralized environment. Vulnerabilities in this *Peergos-specific* authorization logic directly expose sensitive data and functionalities.
- **Example:** A coding error in Peergos's permission checking code allows a user without explicit "read" permissions to bypass the access control and download a private file stored within Peergos, despite the intended access restrictions.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data breaches, privacy violations, potential for unauthorized data modification or deletion, undermining the intended access control model of the Peergos application.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developers:** Implement robust and rigorously tested access control mechanisms *within the Peergos application and when interacting with Peergos's permissioning features*. Conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing specifically focusing on authorization logic. Adhere to the principle of least privilege in permission design and implementation. Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks that could bypass authorization checks.
    - **Users:** Carefully configure and review permissions when sharing data or granting access within Peergos. Regularly audit permissions to ensure they are correctly set and enforced. Be vigilant for any unexpected access behavior and report potential authorization issues.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Critical Peergos Dependencies (Specifically Cryptographic Libraries and libp2p)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_critical_peergos_dependencies__specifically_cryptographic_libraries_and_libp2p_.md)

- **Description:** Security vulnerabilities discovered in core third-party libraries that Peergos *critically depends on* for its security and functionality, particularly cryptographic libraries and libp2p.
- **Peergos Contribution:** Peergos's security posture is directly tied to the security of its underlying dependencies. Vulnerabilities in critical libraries like cryptographic libraries or libp2p can have a cascading impact on Peergos and applications built upon it, potentially bypassing Peergos's intended security measures.
- **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of the cryptographic library used by Peergos for data encryption. If Peergos uses this vulnerable version, attackers could potentially exploit this vulnerability to decrypt data stored within Peergos or compromise secure communication channels. Similarly, vulnerabilities in libp2p could undermine Peergos's network security.
- **Impact:** Wide range of severe impacts depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability, including data breaches, code execution, denial of service, bypass of cryptographic protections, and compromise of network security.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developers:** Implement a proactive dependency management process *specifically for Peergos and its core dependencies*. Regularly scan Peergos's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using automated security scanning tools.  Prioritize keeping critical dependencies like cryptographic libraries and libp2p updated to the latest patched versions. Subscribe to security advisories for Peergos and its key dependencies to be promptly informed of new vulnerabilities.
    - **Users:** Ensure the Peergos application and its underlying libraries are regularly updated by the developers. Stay informed about security updates related to Peergos and its dependencies and encourage developers to apply them promptly.
