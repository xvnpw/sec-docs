# Threat Model Analysis for peergos/peergos

## Threat: [Sybil Attack](./threats/sybil_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker creates a large number of fake Peergos identities (peers) and uses them to overwhelm the network. They might flood the DHT with false routing information, censor content by controlling a large portion of peers involved in content retrieval, or launch denial-of-service attacks by overwhelming legitimate peers with requests.
*   **Impact:** Network instability, content censorship, denial of service, reduced data availability, potential manipulation of network routing, impacting application availability and data integrity.
*   **Peergos Component Affected:** DHT (Distributed Hash Table), Peer Discovery, Network Routing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on peer connections and requests.
    *   Utilize reputation systems or proof-of-work mechanisms (if available in Peergos or as an extension) to make Sybil attacks more costly.
    *   Monitor network behavior for anomalies and suspicious peer activity.
    *   Increase the number of honest, well-connected peers in the network.

## Threat: [Eclipse Attack](./threats/eclipse_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker targets a specific application node running Peergos and isolates it from the legitimate Peergos network. The attacker controls all incoming and outgoing connections of the target node, feeding it false information and preventing it from interacting with honest peers.
*   **Impact:** Data manipulation for the eclipsed node, censorship of information, denial of service for the application relying on the eclipsed Peergos node, potential data corruption if the application trusts the attacker-controlled data, complete compromise of node's network view.
*   **Peergos Component Affected:** Network Connectivity, Peer Discovery, Data Retrieval.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Establish connections to a diverse set of peers from different network locations.
    *   Regularly monitor network connectivity and peer health.
    *   Implement redundancy by running multiple Peergos nodes and cross-validating data.
    *   Use trusted bootstrap nodes for initial peer discovery.

## Threat: [Byzantine Faults/Data Corruption in Distributed Storage](./threats/byzantine_faultsdata_corruption_in_distributed_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious or compromised peers in the Peergos network might serve corrupted or fabricated data when requested. If the application doesn't verify data integrity, it might process and use this corrupted data.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption within the application, application errors, potential security vulnerabilities if the application processes malicious data, loss of data integrity, leading to unreliable application behavior and potential security breaches.
*   **Peergos Component Affected:** Data Storage, Data Retrieval, Content Addressing (CID).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize Peergos's built-in content addressing (CID) and cryptographic verification to ensure data integrity.
    *   Implement application-level data validation and integrity checks on data retrieved from Peergos.
    *   Retrieve data from multiple peers and compare results to detect inconsistencies.
    *   Implement data redundancy and backup mechanisms.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Peergos and its dependencies to the latest versions.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Peergos dependencies.
    *   Monitor security advisories for Peergos dependencies.
    *   Consider using dependency pinning or vendoring to manage dependency versions.

## Threat: [Cryptographic Implementation Flaws](./threats/cryptographic_implementation_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Errors in the implementation or usage of cryptographic algorithms within Peergos for encryption, signing, hashing, etc. These flaws could weaken or break the cryptographic security.
*   **Impact:** Data confidentiality breaches, data integrity compromise, authentication bypass, impersonation, weakened security guarantees, undermining the core security mechanisms of Peergos.
*   **Peergos Component Affected:** Cryptography modules (e.g., encryption, signing, hashing functions).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rely on well-vetted and established cryptographic libraries used by Peergos.
    *   Review Peergos's cryptographic implementation and usage (if feasible).
