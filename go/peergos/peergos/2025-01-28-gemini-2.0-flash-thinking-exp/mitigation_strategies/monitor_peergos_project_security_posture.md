#### 4.2. Analysis of Threats Mitigated

*   **Unawareness of Peergos Security Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** This threat is directly and effectively mitigated by Steps 1 and 2. By actively monitoring security channels and disclosures, the strategy ensures awareness of vulnerabilities, preventing the application from being unknowingly exposed.
*   **Delayed Response to Peergos Security Issues (Medium Severity):** This threat is mitigated by all four steps. Steps 1 and 2 ensure timely awareness, Step 3 can potentially provide even earlier insights, and Step 4 facilitates a faster and more focused response by prioritizing mitigation based on impact.
*   **Misunderstanding of Peergos Security Risks (Medium Severity):** This threat is partially mitigated by all steps, but especially by Steps 2 and 3. Tracking disclosures and participating in the community can improve understanding of the specific security risks associated with `peergos` and best practices for mitigation. However, deeper security analysis and code review of `peergos` itself (beyond the scope of this strategy) might be needed for a complete understanding.

**Overall, the identified threats are relevant and accurately reflect the risks associated with using a dependency like `peergos` without proactive security monitoring. The severity levels assigned are also reasonable.**

#### 4.3. Analysis of Impact

*   **Unawareness of Peergos Security Vulnerabilities:** The stated "High Impact" is accurate. Unawareness is the most critical failure, as it leaves the application completely vulnerable to known exploits. The mitigation strategy directly addresses this with high impact.
*   **Delayed Response to Peergos Security Issues:** The stated "Medium Impact" is also reasonable. While a delayed response is better than no response, it prolongs the window of vulnerability and increases the risk of exploitation. The mitigation strategy effectively reduces this delay, resulting in a medium impact improvement.
*   **Misunderstanding of Peergos Security Risks:** The stated "Medium Impact" is appropriate. Misunderstanding can lead to inadequate or incorrect mitigation strategies. Improved understanding, facilitated by the strategy, leads to better overall security posture, hence a medium impact improvement.

**The impact assessments are realistic and align with the benefits provided by the mitigation strategy.**

#### 4.4. Analysis of Currently Implemented and Missing Implementation

*   **Currently Implemented:** The assessment that proactive monitoring is likely *not* implemented is a common and realistic starting point for many development teams. General software update practices are often insufficient for timely security responses to specific dependencies.
*   **Missing Implementation:** The identified missing implementations are accurate and highlight the key components required for effective security monitoring of `peergos`.  The lack of defined channels, tracking processes, community participation, and impact assessment procedures represents significant gaps in a proactive security posture.

**The "Currently Implemented" and "Missing Implementation" sections effectively pinpoint the areas where the mitigation strategy needs to be implemented to achieve its intended security benefits.**

### 5. Strengths and Weaknesses of the Mitigation Strategy
