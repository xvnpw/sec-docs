# Threat Model Analysis for peergos/peergos

## Threat: [Data Confidentiality Breach due to Encryption Weakness](./threats/data_confidentiality_breach_due_to_encryption_weakness.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in Peergos's encryption implementation or the cryptographic algorithms used to decrypt data stored within Peergos. This could involve cryptanalysis, side-channel attacks, or exploiting known weaknesses in the chosen encryption methods *within Peergos itself*.
    - **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data stored within Peergos, leading to privacy violations, reputational damage, or legal repercussions.
    - **Affected Peergos Component:** Encryption Module, Key Management System.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Ensure Peergos is using strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms and protocols.
        - Regularly update Peergos to benefit from security patches and improvements in cryptographic implementations.
        - Avoid storing highly sensitive data if the encryption mechanisms are not fully trusted or understood.
        - Implement application-level encryption as an additional layer of security.

## Threat: [Sybil Attack Overwhelming Network Resources](./threats/sybil_attack_overwhelming_network_resources.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could create a large number of fake identities (peers) *within the Peergos network* to gain disproportionate influence. This could be used to flood the network with requests, disrupt routing, or manipulate data replication, leading to denial of service or performance degradation *of the Peergos network impacting the application*.
    - **Impact:**  Denial of service for legitimate users *of the application relying on Peergos*, slow performance, inability to access or store data, and potential instability of the Peergos network for the application.
    - **Affected Peergos Component:** Peer Management Module, DHT Routing.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement mechanisms to verify the legitimacy of peers connecting to the application's Peergos node.
        - Utilize Peergos's features for peer reputation or trust if available.
        - Implement rate limiting and resource management on the application's Peergos interactions.
        - Monitor the Peergos network for unusual activity or a sudden influx of new peers.

## Threat: [Routing Table Manipulation Leading to Data Interception](./threats/routing_table_manipulation_leading_to_data_interception.md)

- **Description:** A malicious peer *within the Peergos network* could attempt to manipulate the distributed hash table (DHT) or other routing mechanisms within Peergos to redirect data requests or responses through their controlled node. This allows the attacker to intercept communication and potentially eavesdrop on data exchange *within the Peergos network*.
    - **Impact:**  Confidential information could be exposed to the attacker, and the attacker might be able to modify data in transit *within Peergos*.
    - **Affected Peergos Component:** DHT Routing, Peer Communication.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Rely on Peergos's built-in security features for secure routing if available.
        - Implement end-to-end encryption at the application level for sensitive data being exchanged.
        - Monitor network traffic for unusual routing patterns or suspicious peer involvement.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Peergos Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_peergos_dependencies.md)

- **Description:** Peergos relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited by attackers to compromise the Peergos library and, consequently, the application using it.
    - **Impact:**  A wide range of potential security issues depending on the specific vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    - **Affected Peergos Component:** All components relying on vulnerable dependencies.
    - **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Regularly update Peergos to benefit from updates to its dependencies that address security vulnerabilities.
        - Monitor security advisories for known vulnerabilities in Peergos's dependencies.
        - Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Bugs and Vulnerabilities within Peergos Code](./threats/bugs_and_vulnerabilities_within_peergos_code.md)

- **Description:** Like any software, Peergos might contain undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities in its own codebase. These could be exploited by attackers to compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of data or the Peergos network itself.
    - **Impact:**  A wide range of potential security issues depending on the specific vulnerability, including data breaches, remote code execution, or denial of service.
    - **Affected Peergos Component:** Any part of the Peergos codebase.
    - **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Stay updated with the latest versions of Peergos to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        - Monitor the Peergos project's issue tracker and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
        - Consider contributing to the Peergos project by reporting any discovered vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Weaknesses in Peergos's Authentication Mechanisms](./threats/weaknesses_in_peergos's_authentication_mechanisms.md)

- **Description:** If Peergos has weaknesses in how it authenticates peers or users (if applicable), attackers could potentially bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to data or functionalities *within the Peergos network*.
    - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, ability to perform actions as other users or peers, and potential disruption of the network.
    - **Affected Peergos Component:** Authentication Module.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Rely on strong authentication mechanisms provided by Peergos and ensure they are properly configured.
        - If Peergos allows for it, enforce strong password policies or the use of cryptographic keys for authentication.
        - Regularly review Peergos's authentication documentation and best practices.
