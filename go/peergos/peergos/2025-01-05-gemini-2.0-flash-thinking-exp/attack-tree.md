## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Peergos Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_peergos_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

* This is the ultimate goal. Any successful exploitation of Peergos that leads to application compromise falls under this node.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Peergos API Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_peergos_api_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* Attackers target weaknesses in the Peergos API to gain unauthorized access or manipulate data. This is a critical entry point due to the direct interaction with Peergos' functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization in Peergos API [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization_in_peergos_api__critical_node_.md)

* Successful bypass allows attackers to act as legitimate users, accessing sensitive data and functionalities without proper credentials. This unlocks many subsequent attack possibilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak or Default Credentials in Peergos Configuration *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_or_default_credentials_in_peergos_configuration__high-risk_path.md)

* Attackers attempt to use commonly known default credentials or easily guessable passwords for Peergos administrative or API access.
        * This is high-risk due to the simplicity of the attack and the high impact of gaining full access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Peergos' Authentication Mechanism *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_peergos'_authentication_mechanism__high-risk_path.md)

* Attackers exploit flaws in how Peergos verifies user identity, such as vulnerabilities in JWT handling, session management, or other authentication protocols.
        * This is high-risk due to the potential for widespread unauthorized access if the authentication mechanism is flawed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Peergos API Requests *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_peergos_api_requests__high-risk_path.md)

* Attackers craft malicious API requests to cause unintended behavior or gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Perform Injection Attacks via Peergos API *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/perform_injection_attacks_via_peergos_api__high-risk_path.md)

* Attackers inject malicious code or data into API parameters or data structures processed by Peergos.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into Peergos Data Structures (e.g., filenames, metadata) *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_peergos_data_structures__e_g___filenames__metadata___high-risk_path.md)

* Attackers insert malicious scripts or commands disguised as legitimate data (e.g., in filenames or metadata) that could be executed by the application consuming this data.
            * This is high-risk because it can lead to code execution within the application even without directly compromising Peergos' execution environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Peergos Internal Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_peergos_internal_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* Attackers target flaws within Peergos' internal workings, such as data storage mechanisms or networking protocols, to compromise the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Peergos' Data Storage and Retrieval [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_peergos'_data_storage_and_retrieval__critical_node_.md)

* Attackers focus on weaknesses in how Peergos stores, manages, and retrieves data. This directly threatens the integrity and confidentiality of the stored information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Data Integrity within Peergos Storage [CRITICAL NODE] *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_data_integrity_within_peergos_storage__critical_node___high-risk_path.md)

* Attackers attempt to modify data stored within Peergos without authorization, potentially corrupting information or injecting malicious content.
        * This is a critical node and high-risk path due to the potential for widespread and difficult-to-detect damage. Exploiting weaknesses in content addressing or hashing mechanisms falls under this.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Data Without Proper Permissions within Peergos *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/access_data_without_proper_permissions_within_peergos__high-risk_path.md)

* Attackers bypass Peergos' access control mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to stored data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Flaws in Peergos' Permissioning System *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_flaws_in_peergos'_permissioning_system__high-risk_path.md)

* Attackers specifically target vulnerabilities in how Peergos manages and enforces permissions on data access.
            * This is high-risk as it directly undermines the intended security model for data confidentiality.
