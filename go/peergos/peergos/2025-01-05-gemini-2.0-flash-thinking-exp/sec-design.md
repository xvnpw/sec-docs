## 6. Data Flow

### 6.1. Uploading a File (Detailed)

1. The **User** initiates the upload process through the **Client Application**.
2. The **Client Application** generates a unique encryption key for the file (or uses an existing key based on sharing context).
3. The **Client Application** encrypts the file content using the generated key.
4. The **Client Application** segments the encrypted file into smaller, manageable chunks.
5. The **Client Application** calculates the cryptographic hash (CID) for each chunk.
6. The **Client Application** sends the encrypted chunks and their corresponding CIDs to the local **Peergos Node**.
7. The **Peergos Node** stores the encrypted chunks in the **CAS**, indexed by their CIDs.
8. The **Peergos Node** creates or updates metadata about the uploaded file, including:
    *   File name and size.
    *   Encryption details (e.g., the encryption key, potentially encrypted with the user's public key).
    *   An ordered list of the CIDs of the file's chunks.
    *   Access control lists (who has permission to view/modify).
9. The **Peergos Node** securely stores this metadata, potentially encrypting it and associating it with the user's identity or a shared secret.
10. The **Peergos Node** may announce the availability of the file's metadata (or parts of it, depending on privacy settings) on the **DHT**, allowing authorized peers to discover it.

### 6.2. Downloading a File (Detailed)

1. The **User** requests to download a specific file through the **Client Application**.
2. The **Client Application** requests the file's metadata from the local **Peergos Node**.
3. The **Peergos Node** retrieves the requested metadata. If the metadata is encrypted, it decrypts it using the user's private key or a shared secret.
4. The **Peergos Node** extracts the list of CIDs corresponding to the file's chunks from the metadata.
5. The **Peergos Node** (or the **Client Application** directly, depending on implementation) uses these CIDs to request the corresponding encrypted chunks from the **CAS**. This might involve contacting **Other Peergos Nodes** if the local node doesn't have all the chunks.
6. The **Peergos Node** (or the **Client Application**) retrieves the encrypted chunks from the network.
7. The **Client Application** reassembles the downloaded encrypted chunks in the correct order.
8. The **Client Application** decrypts the reassembled file content using the appropriate decryption key (obtained from the metadata or a secure key store).
9. The **Client Application** presents the decrypted file to the **User**.

## 7. Technology Stack

## 8. Security Considerations (Detailed)

*   **End-to-End Encryption Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Threat:** Weak encryption algorithms or improper implementation could lead to data breaches.
    *   **Mitigation:** Employing strong, well-vetted encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256, ChaCha20) and adhering to best practices in cryptographic implementation. Regular security audits of the cryptographic components.
*   **Key Management Weaknesses:**
    *   **Threat:** Compromised or poorly managed encryption keys could allow unauthorized access to data.
    *   **Mitigation:** Utilizing secure key generation, storage (e.g., hardware-backed keystores), and exchange mechanisms. Implementing robust key rotation policies.
*   **Peer Authentication and Authorization Bypass:**
    *   **Threat:** Attackers could impersonate legitimate peers or gain unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Mitigation:** Employing strong cryptographic authentication mechanisms (e.g., public-key cryptography, mutual TLS). Implementing fine-grained access control lists and enforcing them rigorously.
*   **Data Integrity Attacks:**
    *   **Threat:** Malicious actors could tamper with data during storage or transmission.
    *   **Mitigation:** Utilizing cryptographic hashes (CIDs) to verify the integrity of data blocks. Implementing secure transport protocols to protect data in transit.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks:**
    *   **Threat:** Attackers could flood the network with requests, overwhelming nodes and making the service unavailable.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implementing rate limiting, traffic filtering, and potentially utilizing techniques like proof-of-work or stake to make attacks more costly.
*   **Sybil Attacks:**
    *   **Threat:** An attacker could create a large number of fake identities to gain control over the network or influence consensus mechanisms.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implementing mechanisms to make it difficult and costly to create new identities (e.g., proof-of-humanity, resource-based identity creation).
*   **Data Availability Risks:**
    *   **Threat:** Data could become unavailable if too few nodes are hosting it or if nodes go offline.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implementing data replication strategies to ensure multiple copies of data exist across the network. Utilizing incentive mechanisms for nodes to store and serve data.
*   **Metadata Privacy Leaks:**
    *   **Threat:** Sensitive information could be revealed through unencrypted or poorly protected metadata.
    *   **Mitigation:** Encrypting metadata and carefully controlling access to it. Minimizing the amount of sensitive information stored in metadata.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks:**
    *   **Threat:** Malicious code could be introduced through compromised dependencies or build processes.
    *   **Mitigation:** Employing secure software development practices, verifying the integrity of dependencies, and using secure build pipelines.
