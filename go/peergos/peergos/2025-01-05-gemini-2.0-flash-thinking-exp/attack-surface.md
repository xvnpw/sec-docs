# Attack Surface Analysis for peergos/peergos

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access to Local Peergos Daemon](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access_to_local_peergos_daemon.md)

* **Description:** An attacker on the same machine as the application can interact with the locally running Peergos daemon without proper authentication.
    * **How Peergos Contributes:** If the Peergos daemon's API doesn't require authentication for certain actions or if default configurations leave it open, it creates this vulnerability.
    * **Example:** A malicious script running on the same server could connect to the Peergos daemon and retrieve or modify stored data, or disrupt its operation.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service for the application relying on Peergos.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Configure the Peergos daemon to require authentication for all API interactions.
        * Restrict network access to the Peergos daemon to only authorized processes.
        * Use secure communication channels (e.g., TLS) even for local communication if supported by Peergos.

## Attack Surface: [Content Poisoning via IPFS](./attack_surfaces/content_poisoning_via_ipfs.md)

* **Description:** An attacker injects malicious content into IPFS that the application retrieves through Peergos without proper validation.
    * **How Peergos Contributes:** Peergos facilitates access to IPFS content. If the application trusts data retrieved through Peergos without verification, it's vulnerable.
    * **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious file to IPFS. The application, using Peergos, retrieves this file and executes it or displays it without proper sanitization, leading to code execution or other issues.
    * **Impact:** Code execution on the application server or client, data corruption, defacement.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust content validation mechanisms on data retrieved from IPFS through Peergos.
        * Verify cryptographic signatures or checksums of content where applicable.
        * Isolate the processing of IPFS content in sandboxed environments.
        * Use content addressing (CIDs) to ensure immutability and verify content integrity.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Flaws within Peergos](./attack_surfaces/authorization_flaws_within_peergos.md)

* **Description:**  A user can access or modify data within Peergos that they are not authorized to.
    * **How Peergos Contributes:**  Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in Peergos's permission management system allow for unauthorized access.
    * **Example:** A user with read-only permissions is able to modify files or access private directories within Peergos due to a flaw in the permission checks.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation within the Peergos context.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly review and test Peergos's permission configuration.
        * Enforce the principle of least privilege when granting permissions within Peergos.
        * Regularly audit Peergos access logs and permission settings.
        * Keep Peergos updated to patch known authorization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Public IPFS](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_public_ipfs.md)

* **Description:** The application inadvertently stores sensitive data in public IPFS through Peergos.
    * **How Peergos Contributes:** Peergos provides the interface for interacting with IPFS. If the application doesn't properly handle data privacy before storing it via Peergos, it can be exposed.
    * **Example:** The application stores user credentials or private documents directly into IPFS without encryption, making them publicly accessible to anyone with the CID.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violation, reputational damage.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Never store sensitive data in public IPFS without strong encryption.
        * Implement encryption at the application level before passing data to Peergos for IPFS storage.
        * Carefully consider the privacy implications of storing data on a public network like IPFS.
        * Utilize Peergos's private or encrypted data storage features if available and suitable.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Peergos's P2P Networking](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_peergos's_p2p_networking.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Peergos's peer-to-peer networking protocol or implementation.
    * **How Peergos Contributes:** If Peergos utilizes P2P for communication or data transfer, vulnerabilities in this layer expose the application.
    * **Example:** An attacker could exploit a buffer overflow in Peergos's P2P handling to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code on the Peergos node.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, potential remote code execution on the Peergos node, network disruption.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Peergos updated to the latest version to patch known networking vulnerabilities.
        * Monitor Peergos network traffic for suspicious activity.
        * Isolate the Peergos instance within a secure network segment.
        * Consider the security implications of enabling P2P features if they are not strictly necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities within Peergos](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_within_peergos.md)

* **Description:** Peergos relies on third-party libraries that have known security vulnerabilities.
    * **How Peergos Contributes:** By including these vulnerable dependencies, Peergos indirectly introduces these vulnerabilities into the application's attack surface.
    * **Example:** A vulnerable version of a cryptographic library used by Peergos could be exploited to compromise data encryption.
    * **Impact:** Various impacts depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, ranging from denial of service to remote code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Peergos to benefit from dependency updates and security patches.
        * Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Peergos's dependencies.
        * If possible, contribute to Peergos development by reporting and helping to fix vulnerable dependencies.
