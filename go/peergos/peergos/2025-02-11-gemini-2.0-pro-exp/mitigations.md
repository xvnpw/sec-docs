# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for peergos/peergos

## Mitigation Strategy: [Trusted Bootstrap Peers (Peergos/IPFS Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/trusted_bootstrap_peers__peergosipfs_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Curated List of Bootstrap Nodes for Peergos

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Trusted Nodes:** Identify reliable and trustworthy IPFS nodes to serve as bootstrap peers for the Peergos instance. These could be nodes controlled by the application developers, trusted partners, or, with careful consideration, reputable public IPFS gateways. The key is to minimize reliance on potentially malicious or unreliable nodes.
    2.  **Peergos Configuration:** Configure the Peergos instance (likely through its configuration file or API, depending on how Peergos is integrated) to *exclusively* use the identified trusted bootstrap peers. This limits the initial connections Peergos makes, reducing the attack surface. This often involves modifying the `Bootstrap` list in the IPFS configuration used by Peergos.
    3.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review and update the list of trusted bootstrap peers. Nodes may go offline, become compromised, or otherwise become unsuitable. Automated monitoring of bootstrap peer health is ideal.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eclipse Attacks (on the Peergos/IPFS node):** Severity: High. Makes it significantly harder for an attacker to isolate the Peergos node from the legitimate IPFS network.
    *   **Sybil Attacks (affecting Peergos connectivity):** Severity: Medium (indirectly). By limiting initial connections to trusted nodes, it reduces the chance of connecting to a large number of malicious nodes controlled by an attacker.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eclipse Attacks:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.
    *   **Sybil Attacks:** Minor risk reduction (helps prevent connection to malicious nodes).

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) The Peergos configuration file (`config.json`) is set to use a predefined list of bootstrap nodes.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example) An automated process for updating the bootstrap node list based on node health and reputation is not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Connection Limits and Rate Limiting (libp2p/Peergos Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/connection_limits_and_rate_limiting__libp2ppeergos_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure libp2p Connection Limits and Rate Limiting within Peergos

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Connection Limits:** Configure the underlying libp2p layer (used by Peergos) to limit the maximum number of concurrent connections. This prevents resource exhaustion attacks where an attacker attempts to open a massive number of connections to the Peergos node, overwhelming it. This is often done through the Peergos configuration, which passes settings down to libp2p.
    2.  **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on various Peergos operations (e.g., requests to pin or unpin data, data retrieval requests). This prevents attackers from flooding the system with requests, which could lead to denial of service. This might involve modifying Peergos code or using a proxy that sits in front of Peergos.
    3. **Resource Management:** Configure limits on resources that Peergos can use, such as memory and disk space.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (targeting Peergos):** Severity: High. Limits the impact of connection floods and excessive requests.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion Attacks:** Severity: High. Prevents attackers from consuming all available resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS Attacks:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) Basic connection limits are set in the Peergos configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example) Fine-grained rate limiting on specific Peergos operations is not implemented. Resource limits are not configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Peer ID Verification (Peergos Interaction)](./mitigation_strategies/peer_id_verification__peergos_interaction_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Verify Peer IDs When Connecting to Known Peers

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Known Peers:** If the application interacts with specific, known Peergos nodes (e.g., a set of server nodes operated by the application provider), obtain their Peer IDs in advance through a secure channel (e.g., out-of-band communication, a trusted configuration file).
    2.  **Verification on Connection:** When establishing a connection to these known peers (using Peergos APIs), *explicitly verify* that the connected peer's ID matches the expected Peer ID. The Peergos library (or underlying libp2p) should provide mechanisms for this verification.
    3.  **Reject Mismatches:** If the Peer ID does not match, *immediately terminate* the connection. This prevents connecting to an imposter node.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (targeting specific Peergos connections):** Severity: Medium. Prevents connecting to a malicious node that is impersonating a known, trusted node.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **MITM Attacks:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (for connections to known peers).

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) Not implemented. The application does not currently connect to specific, known Peergos nodes in a way that requires Peer ID verification.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example) This strategy needs to be implemented if the application architecture evolves to include direct communication with known Peergos nodes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Audits and Updates (of Peergos itself)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_audits_and_updates__of_peergos_itself_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Conduct security audits and keep Peergos updated.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schedule Audits:** Establish a regular schedule (e.g., annually, or after major Peergos releases) for conducting security audits of the Peergos codebase.
    2.  **Engage Experts:** Consider engaging a third-party security firm with expertise in decentralized systems and cryptography to perform the audits.
    3.  **Dependency Scanning:** Use automated tools (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk, npm audit) to continuously scan for known vulnerabilities in Peergos and its transitive dependencies (including libp2p and IPFS libraries).
    4.  **Prompt Updates:** Apply security updates to Peergos, libp2p, and all other dependencies *immediately* when they become available. Have a process for testing updates before deploying them to production. This is *critical* for mitigating newly discovered vulnerabilities.
    5. **Fuzzing:** Use fuzz testing tools to automatically generate a large number of diverse inputs to the Peergos library. Monitor for crashes, errors, or unexpected behavior that could indicate vulnerabilities.
    6. **Static Analysis:** Integrate static analysis tools into the development pipeline to automatically scan the Peergos codebase for potential security issues.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Peergos Code:** Severity: High.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Peergos's Dependencies (libp2p, IPFS libraries):** Severity: High.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (targeting Peergos or its dependencies):** Severity: High (reduces the window of opportunity).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Peergos/Dependencies:** Risk reduced from High to Medium (or Low, depending on audit/update effectiveness).
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits:** Risk reduced (mitigation, not prevention).

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) Dependency scanning with Dependabot is enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example) Formal security audits of Peergos are not regularly conducted. Fuzzing is not implemented. A robust process for immediate security updates is not fully in place.
