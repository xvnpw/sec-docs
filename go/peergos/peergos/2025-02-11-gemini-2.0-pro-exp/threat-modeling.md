# Threat Model Analysis for peergos/peergos

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via Weak Encryption Key Management (Peergos-Managed Keys)](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_weak_encryption_key_management__peergos-managed_keys_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Access via Weak Encryption Key Management (Peergos-Managed Keys)

    *   **Description:** If the application relies on Peergos to manage encryption keys (rather than purely client-side encryption), an attacker gains access to Peergos's internal key management system or exploits vulnerabilities in Peergos's key handling code. This allows the attacker to decrypt data stored by any user of that Peergos instance.
    *   **Impact:** Complete loss of confidentiality for all data managed by the compromised Peergos instance.  The attacker can read, copy, and potentially share any user's private information.
    *   **Affected Peergos Component:** `crypto` module (specifically key generation, storage, and retrieval functions within Peergos itself).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Client-Side Encryption:**  *Strongly recommended:* Implement client-side encryption *before* data is sent to Peergos.  This ensures that even if Peergos's internal key management is compromised, the data remains protected.  The application is responsible for managing these keys.
        *   **Audit Peergos Key Management:** If relying on Peergos for key management is unavoidable, thoroughly audit the relevant `crypto` module code for vulnerabilities and best practices.  This requires significant expertise in cryptography and secure coding.
        *   **Isolate Peergos Instances:** If possible, run separate Peergos instances for different user groups or data sensitivity levels to limit the blast radius of a compromise.
        *   **Monitor Peergos Security Advisories:**  Pay close attention to any security advisories or updates related to Peergos's cryptographic components.

## Threat: [Data Tampering via Malicious Node Injection](./threats/data_tampering_via_malicious_node_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Tampering via Malicious Node Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises an existing Peergos node or introduces a malicious node into the network.  This node then attempts to modify data as it's being written or read, corrupting the data or injecting malicious content. The attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in the node software.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of data integrity.  Users may receive incorrect or corrupted data, leading to incorrect decisions, application malfunctions, or even security breaches if the tampered data is executable code.
    *   **Affected Peergos Component:** `p2p` module (node communication and data transfer), `blockstore` (data storage and retrieval), potentially the `ipfs` compatibility layer if used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Validation (Client-Side):** Implement robust data validation on the *client-side* after retrieving data from Peergos.  This includes verifying hashes and digital signatures *before* using the data. This is the *most important* mitigation.
        *   **Redundancy and Replication:** Configure Peergos to use a sufficient level of data replication.  This makes it more difficult for a single malicious node to tamper with data.
        *   **Node Reputation (if available):** If Peergos implements a node reputation system, utilize it to prioritize communication with trusted nodes.
        *   **Regular Integrity Checks:** Periodically perform integrity checks on stored data by re-calculating hashes and comparing them to known good values.
        *   **Monitor Network Activity:** Monitor network traffic and node behavior for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Data Loss via Network Partitioning and Insufficient Replication](./threats/data_loss_via_network_partitioning_and_insufficient_replication.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Loss via Network Partitioning and Insufficient Replication

    *   **Description:** A significant portion of the Peergos network becomes unavailable due to a network partition (e.g., internet outage, firewall misconfiguration) or a coordinated attack that takes down a large number of nodes.  If the application's data is not sufficiently replicated *within Peergos*, it becomes inaccessible.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of data availability.  Users cannot access their data, potentially leading to service disruption and business losses.
    *   **Affected Peergos Component:** `p2p` module (network connectivity and node discovery), `blockstore` (data storage and retrieval), configuration of replication settings.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Increase Replication Factor:** Configure Peergos to use a higher replication factor, ensuring that data is stored on a larger number of geographically diverse nodes.  This is a *Peergos-specific* configuration.
        *   **Network Monitoring:** Monitor the health and connectivity of the Peergos network.  Implement alerts for network partitions or significant node loss.  This helps detect issues related to Peergos's `p2p` module.
        *  **Understand Peergos's limitations:** Understand how many nodes can go down before data loss.

## Threat: [Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Targeting Peergos Node)](./threats/denial-of-service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion__targeting_peergos_node_.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Targeting Peergos Node)

    *   **Description:** An attacker floods the application's *Peergos node* with requests, consuming its resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) and preventing legitimate users from accessing the service through that node. This directly targets Peergos's networking and data handling capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of service availability. Users cannot access the application or their data via the targeted Peergos node.
    *   **Affected Peergos Component:** `p2p` module (network communication), `blockstore` (data access), potentially any component that handles requests within the Peergos node.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting (Peergos Configuration):** If Peergos provides configuration options for rate limiting or resource quotas, configure them appropriately to protect the node.
        *   **Network Monitoring:** Monitor the Peergos node's network traffic for signs of DoS attacks and implement mitigation techniques (e.g., blocking malicious IP addresses).
        *   **Resource Limits:** Configure operating system-level resource limits (e.g., ulimit on Linux) to prevent the Peergos process from consuming excessive resources.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Peergos Code](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_peergos_code.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Peergos Code

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *directly within the Peergos codebase* (e.g., a buffer overflow, a cryptographic flaw, an injection vulnerability). This could allow the attacker to compromise the Peergos node, steal data, or disrupt the network.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from data breaches to complete compromise of the Peergos node and potentially other nodes it interacts with.
    *   **Affected Peergos Component:** Potentially any component, depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the Peergos library up-to-date with the latest security patches.  Monitor the Peergos project for security advisories *very closely*.
        *   **Code Auditing (if feasible):** If resources permit, conduct a security audit of the Peergos codebase, focusing on areas relevant to the application's use case. This is a significant undertaking.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a vulnerability scanner that can analyze Go code to identify potential vulnerabilities in the Peergos library itself.

## Threat: [Malicious Bootstrap Node Poisoning](./threats/malicious_bootstrap_node_poisoning.md)

* **Threat:** Malicious Bootstrap Node Poisoning

    * **Description:** An attacker compromises or controls a bootstrap node that the application uses to initially connect to the Peergos network. The malicious bootstrap node provides incorrect or manipulated information about the network, leading the application to connect to malicious nodes or isolating it from the legitimate network.
    * **Impact:** The application may be unable to access data, may be fed incorrect data, or may be vulnerable to MITM attacks.
    * **Affected Peergos Component:** `p2p` module (specifically the bootstrapping and node discovery process).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Multiple Bootstrap Nodes:** Use a diverse set of bootstrap nodes from trusted sources.
        * **Bootstrap Node Validation:** If possible, implement mechanisms to verify the identity and integrity of bootstrap nodes before connecting. This might involve checking their public keys against a known list or using a reputation system.
        * **Hardcoded, Validated List:** Maintain a list of known-good bootstrap nodes and update it regularly. Validate these nodes through out-of-band channels.
        * **Monitor Network Connections:** Monitor the nodes the application connects to and look for anomalies.
