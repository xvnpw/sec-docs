## Attack Tree Path: [***Compromise Peergos Node(s)*** (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_peergos_node_s___high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the attacker gaining control over one or more Peergos nodes within the network used by the application. A compromised node can be used for various malicious purposes, directly impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
*   **Why it's High-Risk:** Compromising a node provides a direct foothold within the Peergos network, making it a likely and impactful attack vector.
*   **Why it's Critical:** A compromised node can be used to:
    *   Store malicious data.
    *   Manipulate data routing.
    *   Launch further attacks.
    *   Gain access to private keys (leading to identity theft).
*   **Sub-Attack Vectors:**
    *   See below for details on "Exploit Config Vulnerabilities" and "Abuse Identity Mgmt."

## Attack Tree Path: [***Exploit Config Vulnerabilities (Misconfig)*** (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_config_vulnerabilities__misconfig___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This involves the attacker taking advantage of improperly configured Peergos nodes. Misconfigurations are common security weaknesses that can expose vulnerabilities.
*   **Why it's High-Risk:** Misconfigurations are often easy to find and exploit, making this a highly probable attack path.
*   **Examples of Misconfigurations:**
    *   Weak or default passwords.
    *   Exposed sensitive configuration files.
    *   Running the node with unnecessary privileges.
    *   Improperly configured firewall rules.
    *   Disabled or misconfigured security features.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [!!!Abuse Identity Mgmt!!! (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/!!!abuse_identity_mgmt!!!__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This focuses on attacks targeting the cryptographic identities used by Peergos nodes. Compromising an identity allows the attacker to impersonate a legitimate node.
*   **Why it's Critical:** Identity is fundamental to the security of Peergos. A compromised identity grants the attacker significant control and can be used to manipulate data, disrupt the network, or launch further attacks.
*   **Examples of Identity Abuse:**
    *   Stealing a node's private key.
    *   Creating fake identities.
    *   Exploiting weaknesses in identity creation/verification.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard
