# Attack Surface Analysis for peergos/peergos

## Attack Surface: [Compromised User Keys](./attack_surfaces/compromised_user_keys.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a user's private cryptographic keys.
*   **Peergos Contribution:** Peergos's security model *fundamentally relies* on the secrecy of user keys for identity, encryption, and access control. This is the core of Peergos' security.
*   **Example:** An attacker phishes a user's password (used to derive Peergos keys), or malware on the user's device steals the key material.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the user's account and data; potential access to other users' data (if shares exist); impersonation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** *Crucially*, implement MFA to protect key derivation or access. This is the single most important mitigation.
    *   **Secure Key Storage:** Use secure enclaves/HSMs where possible.  If not, use robust KDFs with high iteration counts and salt.
    *   **Client-Side Security:** Educate users on phishing/malware. Encourage up-to-date security software.
    *   **Key Rotation:** Implement a mechanism for users to periodically rotate their keys.
    *   **Secure Account Recovery:** Provide a secure account recovery mechanism that *does not* compromise key security (a challenging problem).

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Compromised Nodes](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_compromised_nodes.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker operates a malicious Peergos node or compromises an existing node.
*   **Peergos Contribution:** Peergos's *decentralized* nature means any node can participate, increasing the risk of malicious actors. This is inherent to the design.
*   **Example:** A malicious node injects false data, corrupts existing data, or performs a denial-of-service attack.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption/loss; denial of service; potential compromise of other nodes; erosion of trust.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Reputation System:** Implement a reputation system to track node behavior.
    *   **Code Auditing and Formal Verification:** Rigorously audit the Peergos codebase; consider formal verification.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run nodes in isolated environments (containers, VMs).
    *   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Deploy an IDS to monitor for suspicious activity.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Prevent nodes from flooding the network.
    *   **Data Redundancy and Replication:** Ensure sufficient data redundancy to mitigate data loss.

## Attack Surface: [Access Control and Sharing Flaws](./attack_surfaces/access_control_and_sharing_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or design flaws in the mechanisms controlling data access and sharing permissions.
*   **Peergos Contribution:** Peergos provides *fine-grained access control and sharing*, a core feature. Flaws here directly impact data security.
*   **Example:** A bug allows wider access than intended, or a revoked share is not enforced.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data disclosure; privacy violation; potential data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Code Review:** Rigorous code reviews of access control and sharing logic.
    *   **Formal Verification:** Consider formal verification of the access control model.
    *   **Extensive Testing:** Unit, integration, and penetration testing.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Grant only the minimum necessary access rights.
    *   **Auditing:** Implement audit logs to track access control changes and data access.

## Attack Surface: [IPFS Integration Vulnerabilities (Peergos handling)](./attack_surfaces/ipfs_integration_vulnerabilities__peergos_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities how Peergos interacts with IPFS.
*   **Peergos Contribution:** How Peergos uses IPFS for content addressing and storage.
*   **Example:**  Peergos does not check data integrity after receiving data from IPFS.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption; serving of malicious content; denial of service; potential compromise of user systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Content Verification:** Implement robust mechanisms to verify the integrity of content retrieved from IPFS (e.g., using cryptographic hashes).
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize any data retrieved from IPFS before using it within Peergos.
