Okay, let's create a detailed design document for the Peergos project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Peergos aims to provide a secure and private space online, giving users full control over their data. It's a peer-to-peer encrypted filesystem and platform, emphasizing privacy, security, and user sovereignty.  It appears to be targeting individuals and potentially small organizations concerned with data privacy and resisting censorship.  The project is open-source, suggesting a community-driven development model.  Given its nature, it likely has a higher-than-average risk appetite in some areas (e.g., reliance on novel cryptographic techniques) but a very low risk appetite in others (e.g., data breaches, unauthorized access).

Business Priorities:

*   Provide a secure and private online storage solution.
*   Ensure user data confidentiality and integrity.
*   Enable censorship resistance and data availability.
*   Maintain a decentralized and peer-to-peer architecture.
*   Foster a strong open-source community.

Business Goals:

*   Attract users seeking privacy-focused alternatives to mainstream cloud storage.
*   Establish a reputation for robust security and reliability.
*   Grow the developer community and encourage contributions.
*   Potentially explore sustainable funding models without compromising core principles.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data breaches or loss of user data due to security vulnerabilities.
*   Compromise of user accounts and unauthorized access to data.
*   Legal or regulatory challenges related to data privacy and content hosting.
*   Scalability issues that hinder performance and user experience.
*   Reputational damage due to security incidents or perceived lack of privacy.
*   Failure to attract and retain users and developers.
*   Malicious attacks, including DDoS, aimed at disrupting the network.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on the GitHub repository):

*   security control: End-to-end encryption: Data is encrypted client-side before being uploaded to the network. (Implemented in core Peergos code and libraries).
*   security control: Cryptographic access control: Access to data is managed through cryptographic keys. (Implemented in core Peergos code and libraries).
*   security control: Peer-to-peer architecture: Decentralization reduces the risk of single points of failure and censorship. (Fundamental to the Peergos design).
*   security control: Use of established cryptographic libraries: Peergos leverages well-vetted libraries like libp2p and IPFS. (Dependencies listed in project files).
*   security control: Open-source code: Transparency allows for community auditing and vulnerability identification. (The entire project is on GitHub).
*   security control: Sandboxing: Browser-based sandboxing limits the potential impact of vulnerabilities in the web interface. (Implicit in browser-based execution).
*   security control: Regular security audits: The project mentions ongoing security reviews. (Referenced in documentation and community discussions).
*   security control: Data integrity checks: Hashing and Merkle trees are used to ensure data integrity. (Implemented in core Peergos code and libraries).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on user-managed keys: Users are responsible for the security of their private keys. Loss of keys means loss of access to data.
*   accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in underlying libraries: While established libraries are used, they are not immune to vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Performance limitations of a decentralized network: P2P networks can be slower than centralized solutions.
*   accepted risk: Dependence on community participation: The network's health relies on a sufficient number of active peers.
*   accepted risk: Evolving threat landscape: New attack vectors and vulnerabilities may emerge over time.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Formal threat modeling: Conduct regular, structured threat modeling exercises.
*   Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the build process.
*   Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Perform regular DAST scans on running instances.
*   Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Use SCA tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
*   Bug bounty program: Incentivize external security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.
*   Two-factor authentication (2FA): Implement 2FA for user accounts, even if they are primarily key-based.
*   Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Deploy an IDS to monitor network traffic for malicious activity.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Users must be authenticated using strong cryptographic keys.
    *   Support for hardware security keys (e.g., YubiKey) should be considered.
    *   Session management must be secure, preventing session hijacking and fixation.

*   Authorization:
    *   Access control must be enforced at the object level, ensuring users can only access data they are authorized to view or modify.
    *   The principle of least privilege should be applied, granting users only the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   Sharing mechanisms must be cryptographically secure and granular.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All user-supplied input must be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, command injection).
    *   File uploads must be carefully scrutinized to prevent the upload of malicious files.
    *   Data sanitization should be applied where appropriate.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Only strong, well-vetted cryptographic algorithms and libraries should be used.
    *   Key management must be secure, protecting private keys from unauthorized access.
    *   Cryptographic operations must be performed correctly, avoiding common pitfalls (e.g., weak random number generation).
    *   Regularly review and update cryptographic practices to address emerging threats and best practices.

## BUILD

The Peergos build process appears to involve multiple components and languages (Java, Go, JavaScript).  While the repository doesn't explicitly detail a CI/CD pipeline, it's highly recommended to implement one.  The following describes a recommended build process, incorporating security best practices.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- "Git Push" --> GitRepo["GitHub Repository"]
    GitRepo -- "Webhook Trigger" --> CI_Server["CI Server (e.g., GitHub Actions)"]
    CI_Server -- "Build Java" --> JavaBuild["Java Build (Maven/Gradle)"]
    CI_Server -- "Build Go" --> GoBuild["Go Build"]
    CI_Server -- "Build JavaScript" --> JSBuild["JavaScript Build (npm/yarn)"]
    JavaBuild -- "SAST, SCA" --> JavaArtifact["Java Artifact (JAR)"]
    GoBuild -- "SAST, SCA" --> GoArtifact["Go Artifact (Binary)"]
    JSBuild -- "SAST, SCA" --> JSArtifact["JavaScript Artifact (Bundled Files)"]
    CI_Server -- "Docker Build" --> DockerImage["Docker Image"]
    DockerImage -- "Image Scan" --> DockerRegistry["Docker Registry"]
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code to the GitHub repository.
2.  A webhook triggers the CI server (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
3.  The CI server checks out the code and starts separate build processes for Java, Go, and JavaScript components.
4.  Each build process includes:
    *   Compilation/bundling of the code.
    *   Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify vulnerabilities in the source code.
    *   Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to identify vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
    *   Linting to enforce code style and identify potential errors.
5.  If all checks pass, build artifacts (JAR, binary, bundled files) are created.
6.  A Docker image is built, incorporating the build artifacts.
7.  The Docker image is scanned for vulnerabilities.
8.  The Docker image is pushed to a Docker registry.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   Automated builds: Ensure consistent and reproducible builds.
*   SAST: Identify vulnerabilities in the source code.
*   SCA: Identify vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
*   Linting: Enforce code style and identify potential errors.
*   Docker image scanning: Identify vulnerabilities in the container image.
*   Signed commits: Verify the integrity and authenticity of code changes.
*   Least privilege: Build processes should run with minimal necessary permissions.
