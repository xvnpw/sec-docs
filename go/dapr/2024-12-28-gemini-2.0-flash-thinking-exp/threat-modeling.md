## High and Critical Dapr Threats

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the Dapr framework.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Dapr Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Spoofing Service Identity** | An attacker could impersonate a legitimate service when communicating with the Dapr sidecar. This could be achieved by manipulating network traffic or exploiting vulnerabilities in service discovery mechanisms to register a malicious service with the same identity. | Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, disruption of service by intercepting or manipulating inter-service communication. | Dapr Sidecar (Service Invocation API) | High | - **Enable mTLS:** Enforce mutual TLS authentication between Dapr sidecars using Sentry for certificate management. This verifies the identity of communicating services. - **Use Dapr Access Control Policies:** Define fine-grained access control policies to restrict which services can invoke other services based on their app-id. - **Secure Service Discovery:** Ensure the underlying service discovery mechanism (e.g., Kubernetes DNS) is secure and prevents malicious registration of fake services. |
| **Tampering with Dapr Configuration** | An attacker could gain access to and modify the Dapr configuration files (e.g., component YAMLs, configuration CRDs in Kubernetes). This could involve changing component settings, access control policies, or secrets configurations. | Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, disruption of service by altering component behavior or disabling security features. | Dapr Operator, Dapr Sidecar (Configuration Loading) | Critical | - **Secure Configuration Storage:** Store Dapr configuration securely and restrict access to authorized personnel/processes. Use Kubernetes RBAC or similar mechanisms. - **Configuration Validation:** Implement validation checks for Dapr configuration to prevent malicious or incorrect settings from being applied. - **Immutable Infrastructure:** Deploy Dapr configuration using immutable infrastructure principles to prevent runtime modifications. - **Audit Logging:** Enable audit logging for changes to Dapr configuration. |
| **Tampering with State Store Data via Dapr** | An attacker could bypass application logic and directly manipulate data in the state store through the Dapr state management API. This could involve unauthorized creation, modification, or deletion of state data. | Data corruption, unauthorized data modification, business logic bypass leading to financial loss or other damages. | Dapr Sidecar (State Management API) | High | - **Enforce Application-Level Authorization:** Rely on application-level authorization checks even when using Dapr's state management. Dapr's access control policies can provide an additional layer of defense. - **Secure State Store Access:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to the underlying state store. - **Data Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt sensitive data stored in the state store. |
| **Tampering with Pub/Sub Messages via Dapr** | An attacker could intercept and modify messages being published or subscribed to through Dapr's pub/sub mechanism. This could involve altering message content or headers. | Data corruption, manipulation of application behavior, potential security breaches by injecting malicious data. | Dapr Sidecar (Pub/Sub API) | High | - **Message Signing and Verification:** Implement message signing and verification mechanisms to ensure message integrity. - **Secure Pub/Sub Broker:** Secure the underlying pub/sub broker with appropriate authentication and authorization. - **Encryption in Transit:** Use TLS encryption for communication between Dapr sidecars and the pub/sub broker. |
| **Information Disclosure via Dapr APIs** | An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in Dapr's APIs (gRPC or HTTP) to extract sensitive information about the application, its configuration, or other services. This could involve sending crafted requests or exploiting known vulnerabilities. | Exposure of configuration details, internal service information, potential vulnerabilities in the application itself. | Dapr Sidecar (gRPC and HTTP APIs) | High | - **Regularly Update Dapr:** Keep Dapr updated with the latest security patches. - **Secure Dapr API Endpoints:** Implement authentication and authorization for accessing Dapr API endpoints, even within the cluster. - **Input Validation on Dapr API Calls:** While Dapr handles some validation, be mindful of potential vulnerabilities when interacting with Dapr APIs from your application. |
| **Exposure of Secrets via Dapr** | If secrets are not managed securely within Dapr's secrets management component, an attacker could gain access to sensitive credentials. This could happen due to misconfiguration, vulnerabilities in the secrets store integration, or insufficient access control. | Compromise of sensitive credentials, unauthorized access to resources, potential lateral movement within the system. | Dapr Sidecar (Secrets Management API), Sentry | Critical | - **Use Secure Secret Stores:** Integrate Dapr with secure secret stores (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager). - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary access to secrets. - **Regularly Rotate Secrets:** Implement a process for regularly rotating secrets. - **Secure Communication with Secret Stores:** Ensure secure communication (e.g., TLS) between Dapr and the secret store. |
| **Denial of Service against Dapr Sidecar** | An attacker could overload the Dapr sidecar with requests, causing it to become unresponsive and impacting the application's functionality. This could involve sending a large number of requests to Dapr APIs or exploiting resource exhaustion vulnerabilities. | Application unavailability, performance degradation, potential cascading failures. | Dapr Sidecar | High | - **Resource Limits and Quotas:** Configure resource limits and quotas for Dapr sidecars in the deployment environment (e.g., Kubernetes resource requests and limits). - **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on Dapr API endpoints to prevent abuse. - **Circuit Breakers:** Implement circuit breakers in the application to prevent cascading failures if the Dapr sidecar becomes unavailable. |
| **Denial of Service against Dapr Control Plane Components** | An attacker could target Dapr control plane components (e.g., Placement service, Operator) with denial-of-service attacks, potentially disrupting the entire Dapr infrastructure. | Disruption of Dapr functionality, impacting all Dapr-enabled applications in the cluster. | Dapr Placement Service, Dapr Operator | High | - **Resource Limits and Quotas:** Configure resource limits and quotas for Dapr control plane components. - **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Dapr control plane network from untrusted networks. - **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on control plane APIs. - **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor the health and performance of Dapr control plane components and set up alerts for anomalies. |
| **Elevation of Privilege via Dapr Component Misconfiguration** | Incorrectly configured Dapr components (e.g., bindings, pub/sub) could grant unintended access or capabilities to attackers. For example, a misconfigured binding could allow unauthorized access to an external system. | Unauthorized access to resources, ability to perform actions with elevated privileges in external systems. | Dapr Sidecar (Bindings, Pub/Sub Components) | High | - **Thoroughly Review Component Configurations:** Carefully review the configuration of all Dapr components and ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege. - **Security Audits of Component Configurations:** Regularly audit Dapr component configurations for potential security vulnerabilities. - **Use Secure Defaults:** Rely on secure default configurations for Dapr components where possible. |
| **Information Disclosure via Dapr Control Plane** | An attacker gaining unauthorized access to the Dapr control plane could potentially access sensitive information about deployed applications, their configurations, and potentially secrets. | Exposure of application topology, configuration details, and potentially sensitive credentials. | Dapr Operator, Dapr Dashboard | High | - **Secure Dapr Control Plane Access:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the Dapr control plane components and dashboard. - **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Dapr control plane network. - **Regularly Update Dapr:** Keep Dapr control plane components updated with the latest security patches. |
| **Elevation of Privilege via Dapr API Exploitation** | Vulnerabilities in Dapr's APIs could be exploited to gain unauthorized access or perform actions with elevated privileges within the Dapr framework or the application. | Unauthorized access to resources, ability to manipulate application state or behavior. | Dapr Sidecar (gRPC and HTTP APIs) | High | - **Regularly Update Dapr:** Keep Dapr updated with the latest security patches. - **Secure Dapr API Endpoints:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing Dapr API endpoints. - **Input Validation on Dapr API Calls:** Be vigilant about potential vulnerabilities when interacting with Dapr APIs. |
