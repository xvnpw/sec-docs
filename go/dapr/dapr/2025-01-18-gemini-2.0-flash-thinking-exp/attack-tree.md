## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Service Invocation Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_service_invocation_weaknesses.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Exploit Missing or Weak Access Policies:
      * Description: Attacker exploits the lack of or poorly configured authorization policies for service-to-service calls.
      * Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive services and data.
    * Inject Malicious Payloads in Request Data:
      * Description: Attacker crafts malicious payloads within service invocation requests to exploit vulnerabilities in the receiving service.
      * Impact: Potential for code execution, data manipulation, or denial of service in the target service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit State Management Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_state_management_weaknesses.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Bypass State Access Control Policies:
      * Description: Attacker circumvents access control mechanisms to read or write state data they are not authorized to access.
      * Impact: Exposure or modification of sensitive application data.
    * Modify State Data to Alter Application Logic:
      * Description: Attacker manipulates state data to change the application's behavior or gain unauthorized privileges.
      * Impact: Unexpected application behavior, privilege escalation, or data corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Secrets Management Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_secrets_management_weaknesses.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Exploit Weak or Missing Access Control for Secrets:
      * Description: Attacker gains unauthorized access to secrets stored and managed by Dapr due to inadequate access controls.
      * Impact: Exposure of sensitive credentials, API keys, and other confidential information.
    * Retrieve Secrets Intended for Other Applications/Components:
      * Description: Attacker accesses secrets that are not intended for their application or component due to improper scoping or isolation.
      * Impact: Potential compromise of other applications or services.
    * Expose Secrets in Logs or Error Messages:
      * Description: Sensitive secrets are inadvertently included in application logs or error messages, making them accessible to attackers.
      * Impact: Direct exposure of sensitive credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dapr Control Plane Weaknesses (More impactful, potentially system-wide)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dapr_control_plane_weaknesses__more_impactful__potentially_system-wide_.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Compromise Dapr Placement Service:
      * Description: Attacker compromises the Placement service, which is responsible for service discovery and actor placement.
      * Impact: Ability to disrupt service communication, redirect traffic, or potentially take over actor instances.
    * Compromise Dapr Operator:
      * Description: Attacker compromises the Dapr Operator, which manages the deployment and lifecycle of Dapr components.
      * Impact: Ability to deploy malicious components, alter configurations, or disrupt the Dapr control plane.
    * Compromise Dapr Sentry (Certificate Authority):
      * Description: Attacker compromises the Dapr Sentry, which acts as a certificate authority for mTLS.
      * Impact: Ability to issue malicious certificates, potentially impersonating services or intercepting secure communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sidecar Communication Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sidecar_communication_weaknesses.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Sidecar Communication:
      * Description: Attacker intercepts and potentially modifies communication between the application and its Dapr sidecar.
      * Impact: Ability to eavesdrop on sensitive data, manipulate requests and responses, or impersonate either the application or the sidecar.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Dapr Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_dapr_configuration.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Modify Configuration to Bypass Security Measures:
      * Description: Attacker gains unauthorized access to Dapr configuration and modifies it to disable security features or weaken security controls.
      * Impact: Significant reduction in the application's security posture, potentially opening up numerous attack vectors.
