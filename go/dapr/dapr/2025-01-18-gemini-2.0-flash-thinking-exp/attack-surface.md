# Attack Surface Analysis for dapr/dapr

## Attack Surface: [Sidecar API Exposure (HTTP/gRPC)](./attack_surfaces/sidecar_api_exposure__httpgrpc_.md)

*   **Description:** The Dapr sidecar exposes HTTP and gRPC APIs on each application instance for interacting with Dapr building blocks (service invocation, state management, pub/sub, bindings, actors, etc.).
*   **How Dapr Contributes:** Dapr introduces these new network endpoints that, if not secured, can be directly targeted by attackers. The application's attack surface expands beyond its own APIs.
*   **Example:** An attacker could send malicious requests to the sidecar's service invocation endpoint to call internal application services without proper authorization checks.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to application functionalities, data manipulation, denial of service, potential for further exploitation of internal services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable and enforce authentication and authorization for the sidecar API. Utilize Dapr's built-in security features like Access Control Policies (ACPs) or integrate with external authorization systems.
    *   Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict access to the sidecar API to authorized entities only.
    *   Regularly review and update ACPs to ensure they accurately reflect the intended access control policies.
    *   Disable unused Dapr building blocks to reduce the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Inter-Sidecar Communication Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/inter-sidecar_communication_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Dapr sidecars communicate with each other to facilitate service invocation and other distributed functionalities.
*   **How Dapr Contributes:** Dapr introduces inter-service communication pathways that need to be secured. Without proper security measures, these channels can be vulnerable.
*   **Example:** Without mutual TLS (mTLS) enabled, an attacker could potentially eavesdrop on communication between sidecars or perform man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept or modify messages.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, manipulation of inter-service communication, impersonation of services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable and enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) for inter-sidecar communication. This ensures that only authenticated and authorized sidecars can communicate with each other.
    *   Implement certificate rotation strategies to minimize the impact of compromised certificates.
    *   Monitor inter-sidecar communication for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Dapr Control Plane Component Compromise](./attack_surfaces/dapr_control_plane_component_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Dapr's control plane components (dapr-operator, dapr-placement, dapr-sentry) manage the Dapr infrastructure and provide essential services.
*   **How Dapr Contributes:**  Compromising these components can have a wide-ranging impact on all applications using the Dapr instance.
*   **Example:** An attacker gaining access to the `dapr-operator` could modify Dapr component configurations, potentially introducing vulnerabilities or disrupting service. Compromising `dapr-sentry` could lead to the issuance of malicious certificates, undermining mTLS.
*   **Impact:** Widespread service disruption, data breaches across multiple applications, complete compromise of the Dapr infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure access to the Kubernetes API server as Dapr control plane components interact with it. Implement strong authentication and authorization (RBAC).
    *   Harden the nodes where Dapr control plane components are running.
    *   Regularly update Dapr control plane components to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing and managing Dapr control plane components.
    *   Monitor the activity of Dapr control plane components for suspicious behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Component Vulnerabilities in Dapr and its Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/component_vulnerabilities_in_dapr_and_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Like any software, Dapr and its underlying dependencies may contain vulnerabilities.
*   **How Dapr Contributes:** By introducing Dapr, applications become reliant on its security. Vulnerabilities in Dapr directly impact the application's security posture.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific version of the Dapr runtime or a dependency used by a Dapr building block could be exploited.
*   **Impact:**  Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, and information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Dapr and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for Dapr and its dependencies.
    *   Implement a vulnerability scanning process for Dapr components.
