# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dapr/dapr

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Mutual TLS (mTLS) for Service Invocation using Dapr](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_mutual_tls__mtls__for_service_invocation_using_dapr.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Verify Dapr is deployed with mTLS enabled. Check Dapr system configuration for `mtls: enabled: true`. This ensures all service-to-service communication managed by Dapr is encrypted and mutually authenticated by default.
    *   Step 2: Implement certificate rotation for Dapr-managed certificates. Utilize tools like `cert-manager` in Kubernetes to automate the rotation of certificates used by Dapr for mTLS. This reduces the risk associated with long-lived certificates.
    *   Step 3: Define and enforce Dapr access control policies for service invocation. Use Dapr's Configuration API to create and apply access control policies (using `Configuration` CRD in Kubernetes) that explicitly define which Dapr applications are authorized to invoke other Dapr applications.
    *   Step 4: Regularly audit Dapr access control policies. Review the defined Dapr access control policies to ensure they are up-to-date, enforce least privilege, and are effectively mitigating unauthorized service invocations.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity): Mitigated by Dapr's mTLS ensuring encrypted and authenticated communication between services.
    *   Service Impersonation (High Severity): Mitigated by mTLS verifying the identity of services communicating through Dapr.
    *   Unauthorized Service Invocation (High Severity): Mitigated by Dapr access control policies restricting which services can call other services.
*   **Impact:**
    *   MITM Attacks: High - Significantly reduces the risk by Dapr's built-in mTLS.
    *   Service Impersonation: High - Significantly reduces the risk by Dapr's mTLS authentication.
    *   Unauthorized Service Invocation: High - Significantly reduces the risk by Dapr's policy enforcement.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, Dapr default configuration enables mTLS cluster-wide.
    *   Location: Dapr system configuration, Kubernetes manifests for Dapr control plane.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Granular Dapr access control policies are not fully defined and enforced per service. Relying on network policies for basic isolation, but not leveraging Dapr's policy engine extensively.
    *   Automated certificate rotation for Dapr certificates is not fully implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Dapr RBAC for Secret Access](./mitigation_strategies/implement_dapr_rbac_for_secret_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Configure Dapr to use a secure secret store backend (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets). This is configured in Dapr component definitions for secret stores.
    *   Step 2: Define Dapr access control policies for secret access. Utilize Dapr's Configuration API to create and apply access control policies that specify which Dapr applications are authorized to access specific secrets within the configured secret store.
    *   Step 3: Enforce Dapr RBAC policies. Ensure Dapr's RBAC enforcement is active and correctly configured to control access to secrets based on the defined policies.
    *   Step 4: Regularly audit Dapr secret access policies and logs. Review Dapr access control policies for secrets and monitor Dapr logs for any unauthorized secret access attempts.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Secret Exposure via Dapr (High Severity): Mitigated by Dapr RBAC controlling which applications can retrieve secrets through Dapr's Secret Store API.
    *   Privilege Escalation through Secret Access (Medium Severity): Mitigated by limiting application access to only necessary secrets via Dapr RBAC.
    *   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Resources (High Severity): Reduced by controlling access to secrets used to access sensitive resources via Dapr RBAC.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Secret Exposure via Dapr: High - Significantly reduces the risk by Dapr's RBAC.
    *   Privilege Escalation through Secret Access: Medium - Reduces the risk by limiting secret access.
    *   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Resources: High - Significantly reduces the risk by controlling secret access.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Using Azure Key Vault as secret store.
    *   Location: Dapr component configuration for secret store, Dapr system configuration for RBAC.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dapr RBAC policies for secret access are not fully defined and enforced. Currently relying on Azure Key Vault's IAM and network policies, but not leveraging Dapr's fine-grained RBAC for secrets.
    *   Auditing of secret access through Dapr is not fully configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Dapr Binding Configurations and Secrets](./mitigation_strategies/secure_dapr_binding_configurations_and_secrets.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Avoid hardcoding sensitive credentials in Dapr binding component configurations. Instead, utilize Dapr's Secret Store integration to reference secrets stored in a secure backend within binding configurations.
    *   Step 2: Review and apply the principle of least privilege when configuring binding permissions within Dapr component definitions. Ensure bindings only have the necessary permissions to interact with external resources.
    *   Step 3: Implement input validation within your application for data received from Dapr input bindings. While not directly a Dapr feature, this is crucial for securing applications using Dapr bindings.
    *   Step 4: Regularly audit Dapr binding component configurations. Review binding configurations to ensure no secrets are exposed and permissions are appropriately configured.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Credential Exposure in Dapr Configurations (High Severity): Mitigated by using Dapr Secret Store to manage binding credentials instead of hardcoding them.
    *   Unauthorized Actions via Bindings (Medium Severity): Mitigated by applying least privilege to binding permissions in Dapr component definitions.
    *   Injection Attacks via Binding Input (High Severity): Mitigated by input validation in application code processing data from Dapr bindings.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Credential Exposure in Dapr Configurations: High - Significantly reduces the risk by using Dapr Secret Store.
    *   Unauthorized Actions via Bindings: Medium - Reduces the risk by limiting binding permissions.
    *   Injection Attacks via Binding Input: High - Significantly reduces the risk through application-level validation.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Using Dapr secret store for some binding credentials.
    *   Location: Dapr component configurations for bindings.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent use of Dapr secret store for *all* binding credentials. Some bindings might still rely on less secure methods.
    *   Automated auditing of Dapr binding configurations for security best practices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Authentication and Authorization for Dapr APIs](./mitigation_strategies/implement_authentication_and_authorization_for_dapr_apis.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Enable authentication for Dapr APIs. Configure Dapr to require authentication for accessing its HTTP and gRPC APIs. This can be done by configuring API tokens or integrating with external authentication providers within Dapr system configuration.
    *   Step 2: Implement RBAC for Dapr APIs. Utilize Dapr's RBAC features to control access to Dapr APIs based on application identity or roles. Define policies that restrict access to sensitive Dapr API endpoints.
    *   Step 3: Securely manage Dapr API tokens. If using API tokens, ensure they are securely generated, stored (ideally in a secret store), and rotated.
    *   Step 4: Implement API rate limiting and throttling for Dapr APIs. Configure rate limiting in Dapr to protect against abuse and denial-of-service attacks targeting Dapr APIs.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Dapr Control Plane (High Severity): Mitigated by Dapr API authentication and authorization.
    *   Privilege Escalation via Dapr APIs (Medium Severity): Mitigated by Dapr RBAC restricting access to sensitive API operations.
    *   Denial-of-Service Attacks on Dapr Control Plane (Medium Severity): Mitigated by Dapr API rate limiting and throttling.
    *   Configuration Tampering via APIs (High Severity): Mitigated by Dapr API authentication and authorization preventing unauthorized configuration changes.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Dapr Control Plane: High - Significantly reduces the risk by Dapr API security.
    *   Privilege Escalation via Dapr APIs: Medium - Reduces the risk by limiting API access.
    *   Denial-of-Service Attacks on Dapr Control Plane: Medium - Reduces the risk of API overload.
    *   Configuration Tampering via APIs: High - Significantly reduces the risk by API access control.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Authentication is enabled for Dapr APIs using API tokens.
    *   Location: Dapr system configuration, Kubernetes manifests for Dapr control plane.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   RBAC for Dapr APIs is not fully implemented. Relying on API token authentication for basic access control, but not fine-grained RBAC policies.
    *   API rate limiting and throttling are not configured for Dapr APIs.
