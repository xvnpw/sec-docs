# Attack Surface Analysis for dapr/dapr

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Dapr APIs (Control & Data Plane)](./attack_surfaces/exposed_dapr_apis__control_&_data_plane_.md)

*   **Description:** `daprd` exposes HTTP/gRPC APIs for control plane operations (configuration, health, metadata) and data plane operations (service invocation, state management, pub/sub, bindings, actors, secrets). These APIs become entry points for potential attacks.
*   **Dapr Contribution to Attack Surface:** Dapr *introduces* these APIs as a core mechanism for application interaction with Dapr runtime features. Without Dapr, these specific APIs would not exist.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the service invocation API and directly calls application services, bypassing intended application logic and authorization checks.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to application functionalities, service disruption, manipulation of application state, and potential privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement strong authentication (e.g., API tokens, mTLS) and authorization policies for all Dapr APIs. Utilize Dapr's built-in access control features and integrate with existing identity providers.
    *   **Network Policies:** Restrict network access to `daprd` APIs using network policies or firewalls. Limit access to only authorized clients and services.
    *   **API Gateway/Reverse Proxy:** Use an API gateway or reverse proxy in front of `daprd` to enforce security policies, rate limiting, and potentially offload authentication and authorization.
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on the application side and within Dapr components to prevent injection attacks through API parameters.

## Attack Surface: [Inter-Sidecar Communication Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/inter-sidecar_communication_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Dapr sidecars communicate with each other for service invocation, actor communication, and other internal operations. This inter-sidecar communication channel can be targeted.
*   **Dapr Contribution to Attack Surface:** Dapr *mandates* sidecar-to-sidecar communication for core functionalities like service invocation and actor interactions in distributed applications.
*   **Example:** A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack intercepts gRPC communication between two sidecars, potentially stealing sensitive data exchanged during a service invocation or manipulating the message content.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches through interception of sensitive data, service disruption by manipulating messages, and potential for impersonation or spoofing attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mutual TLS (mTLS):** Enforce mTLS for all inter-sidecar communication to encrypt traffic and authenticate sidecars. Dapr Sentry is designed to manage certificates for mTLS.
    *   **Network Segmentation and Policies:** Isolate Dapr sidecars within a secure network segment and implement network policies to restrict communication paths and prevent lateral movement in case of compromise.
    *   **Secure Network Infrastructure:** Ensure the underlying network infrastructure is secure and protected against network-level attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Component Configuration Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/component_configuration_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Dapr relies on component configuration files (YAML) to define connections to state stores, pub/sub brokers, bindings, etc. Misconfigurations in these files can introduce security vulnerabilities.
*   **Dapr Contribution to Attack Surface:** Dapr *relies* on external component configurations, making misconfiguration a potential vulnerability point.
*   **Example:** A developer accidentally includes database credentials directly in a state store component YAML file, which is then committed to a public repository or accessible to unauthorized personnel.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, unauthorized access to backend systems, data breaches, and potential compromise of external services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Configuration Management:** Implement secure configuration management practices. Store component configurations in version control, but *never* commit sensitive credentials directly.
    *   **Secret Management:** Utilize Dapr's secret management capabilities or external secret management solutions to securely manage credentials and sensitive configuration values. Inject secrets into component configurations at runtime.
    *   **Input Validation and Schema Validation:** Validate component configuration files against a schema to catch syntax errors and potential misconfigurations early in the development process.
    *   **Least Privilege (Component Access):** Configure components with the least privileges necessary to perform their intended functions.

## Attack Surface: [Secret Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/secret_management_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Dapr's secret management feature, while intended for security, can introduce vulnerabilities if not implemented and used correctly.
*   **Dapr Contribution to Attack Surface:** Dapr *provides* secret management as a feature, and vulnerabilities can arise from its implementation or misuse.
*   **Example:** Choosing a weak or insecure secret store backend (e.g., local file system in development) for production deployments, leading to easy compromise of secrets. Or, insufficient access control policies on secrets within Dapr, allowing unauthorized applications to retrieve sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive secrets (API keys, database passwords, etc.), leading to data breaches, unauthorized access to external services, and broader system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Secret Store Backend:** Choose a robust and secure secret store backend suitable for production environments (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
    *   **Access Control for Secrets:** Implement fine-grained access control policies for secrets within Dapr. Ensure only authorized applications and services can access specific secrets.
    *   **Secret Rotation:** Implement regular secret rotation policies to limit the window of opportunity if a secret is compromised.
    *   **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:** Never hardcode secrets in application code or component configurations. Always retrieve secrets from a secure secret store at runtime.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of secret management practices and configurations.

## Attack Surface: [`daprd` Binary Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/_daprd__binary_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Like any software, the `daprd` binary itself can contain security vulnerabilities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could directly compromise the sidecar and potentially the host system.
*   **Dapr Contribution to Attack Surface:** Dapr *introduces* the `daprd` binary as a core runtime component, making its security crucial.
*   **Example:** A remote code execution vulnerability is discovered in `daprd`. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the host running the sidecar, potentially gaining full control of the system.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, privilege escalation, and full system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Dapr Updated:** Regularly update Dapr to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities. Subscribe to Dapr security advisories and release notes.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement vulnerability scanning for `daprd` binaries and dependencies as part of the CI/CD pipeline and runtime environment.
    *   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of Dapr deployments, including the `daprd` binary.
    *   **Isolation:** Run `daprd` in isolated environments (e.g., containers, VMs) with restricted privileges to limit the impact of a potential compromise.

## Attack Surface: [Control Plane Services Compromise (Kubernetes Deployments)](./attack_surfaces/control_plane_services_compromise__kubernetes_deployments_.md)

*   **Description:** In Kubernetes deployments, Dapr control plane services (Placement, Operator, Sentry) manage and secure the Dapr infrastructure. Compromising these services can have widespread impact.
*   **Dapr Contribution to Attack Surface:** Dapr *introduces* these control plane services as essential components for managing Dapr in Kubernetes.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises the Sentry service. This could allow them to forge certificates, bypass mTLS authentication, and gain unauthorized access to all Dapr communication within the cluster, effectively undermining the entire Dapr security posture.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of Dapr security, widespread data breaches, service disruption across the entire Dapr-enabled application ecosystem, and potential control over the Kubernetes cluster itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Kubernetes Deployment:** Follow Kubernetes security best practices to secure the underlying Kubernetes cluster. This includes RBAC, network policies, security audits, and regular updates.
    *   **RBAC and Authorization:** Implement strong Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies to restrict access to Dapr control plane services and their APIs.
    *   **Network Policies (Control Plane):** Isolate Dapr control plane services within a dedicated namespace and implement network policies to restrict access to only authorized components and administrators.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Dapr control plane services and their configurations.
    *   **Least Privilege (Control Plane Services):** Run Dapr control plane services with the least privileges necessary.
