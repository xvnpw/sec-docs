# Threat Model Analysis for dapr/dapr

## Threat: [Malicious Sidecar Injection](./threats/malicious_sidecar_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the deployment process and injects a rogue sidecar container instead of the legitimate Dapr sidecar. This malicious sidecar can intercept all communication, manipulate data, and potentially execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of the application's Dapr interactions, data breaches, service disruption, and potential control over the application and underlying infrastructure.
*   **Dapr Component Affected:** Sidecar Injection Mechanism
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong access control and security policies for Kubernetes admission controllers and CI/CD pipelines.
    *   Use image signing and verification to ensure only trusted Dapr sidecar images are deployed.
    *   Employ pod security policies or admission controllers to restrict container capabilities and resource requests.
    *   Regularly audit deployment configurations and processes for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Sidecar Configuration Tampering](./threats/sidecar_configuration_tampering.md)
