Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Dapr, with high and critical severity:

**I. Unauthenticated/Unauthorized Access to Dapr APIs**

*   **Description:**  Dapr exposes HTTP/gRPC APIs for various functionalities (service invocation, state management, pub/sub, etc.). Lack of proper authentication or authorization allows unauthorized entities to interact with these APIs.
*   **How Dapr Contributes:** Dapr introduces these APIs as a core part of its functionality, enabling inter-service communication and access to building blocks. If not secured, these become direct attack vectors.
*   **Example:** An attacker could directly call the service invocation API of a sensitive service without proper authentication, potentially accessing or modifying data. An external actor could publish malicious messages to a pub/sub topic if authorization is not enforced.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of application state, denial of service, and potential compromise of other services.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement authentication and authorization using Dapr's built-in middleware or application-level checks.
    *   Utilize API gateways or service meshes to enforce authentication and authorization policies before requests reach Dapr.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring access control policies.
    *   Regularly review and update authentication and authorization configurations.

**II. Insecure Dapr Component Configuration**

*   **Description:** Dapr relies on components (state stores, pub/sub brokers, bindings, etc.) configured through YAML files or Kubernetes configurations. Insecure configurations can introduce vulnerabilities *within the Dapr context*.
*   **How Dapr Contributes:** Dapr's extensibility through components requires careful configuration. Misconfigurations directly expose the application to risks *managed by Dapr*.
*   **Example:** Using default credentials for a state store component *configured within Dapr*, allowing anonymous access to a message broker *integrated through Dapr's pub/sub*, or configuring a binding with overly permissive access rights *defined in Dapr*.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches (accessing state store data *managed by Dapr*), message manipulation or injection (pub/sub *handled by Dapr*), unauthorized access to external resources (bindings *configured through Dapr*).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using default credentials for Dapr components.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for all configured components.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to components.
    *   Securely manage and store component configuration files.
    *   Regularly review and audit component configurations.

**III. Control Plane Compromise**

*   **Description:** The Dapr control plane (dapr-operator, dapr-sentry, dapr-placement) manages the Dapr infrastructure. Compromise of these components can have widespread impact *on the Dapr deployment*.
*   **How Dapr Contributes:** Dapr's architecture includes these central control plane components, making their security paramount *for the entire Dapr ecosystem*.
*   **Example:** An attacker gaining access to the dapr-operator could deploy malicious components or modify configurations affecting all applications *using that Dapr instance*. Compromising dapr-sentry could lead to the generation of forged certificates, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks *on Dapr communication*.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Dapr infrastructure, affecting all applications using it. Potential for data breaches, denial of service, and unauthorized access to all services *managed by that Dapr instance*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure access to the Kubernetes cluster where the Dapr control plane is deployed.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing control plane components.
    *   Regularly update the Dapr control plane components to the latest versions with security patches.
    *   Harden the underlying infrastructure where the control plane is running.
    *   Monitor the control plane for suspicious activity.

**IV. Sidecar Injection Vulnerabilities**

*   **Description:** In Kubernetes environments, Dapr sidecars are injected as containers alongside application containers. Vulnerabilities in the injection process or the sidecar itself can be exploited.
*   **How Dapr Contributes:** Dapr's reliance on the sidecar pattern necessitates a secure injection mechanism.
*   **Example:** An attacker gaining control of the Kubernetes namespace could potentially manipulate the sidecar injection process to deploy a malicious Dapr sidecar or modify the configuration of existing Dapr sidecars.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the application container through the malicious Dapr sidecar, data breaches, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the Kubernetes namespace and control access to it.
    *   Utilize Kubernetes security features like Pod Security Policies/Pod Security Admission to restrict container capabilities and resource usage.
    *   Regularly update the Dapr sidecar injector and ensure it's running securely.
    *   Implement network policies to restrict communication between sidecars and other pods.
