Okay, let's create a design document for the Dapr project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) aims to simplify the development of distributed applications, specifically microservices.  It addresses several key business priorities:

*   Faster Time to Market: By providing pre-built building blocks for common distributed system patterns (service invocation, pub/sub, state management, etc.), Dapr reduces the amount of custom code developers need to write, accelerating development.
*   Reduced Operational Complexity: Dapr abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than the intricacies of specific cloud providers or technologies. This reduces operational overhead and makes applications more portable.
*   Increased Developer Productivity:  Developers can use any language or framework to build their applications and leverage Dapr's capabilities through standard HTTP or gRPC APIs. This increases flexibility and productivity.
*   Improved Application Resiliency and Scalability: Dapr's building blocks are designed to be resilient and scalable, helping developers build robust applications that can handle failures and scale to meet demand.
*   Vendor Neutrality: Dapr is platform-agnostic, meaning it can run on any cloud provider, on-premises, or even on edge devices. This avoids vendor lock-in and provides greater flexibility.

Based on these priorities, the most important business risks that need to be addressed are:

*   Security Vulnerabilities in Dapr Itself:  Since Dapr acts as a sidecar and handles critical functions like service communication and state management, any vulnerability in Dapr could be exploited to compromise the entire application or even the entire system.
*   Misconfiguration of Dapr: Incorrect configuration of Dapr components (e.g., insecure state stores, improperly configured access control) could expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized access.
*   Supply Chain Attacks:  Compromised dependencies or build processes for Dapr could introduce vulnerabilities into the runtime.
*   Denial of Service: Attacks targeting Dapr sidecars or the control plane could disrupt application functionality.
*   Data Breaches:  If Dapr's state stores or communication channels are compromised, sensitive data could be exposed.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Dapr incorporates several security controls, and also has some accepted risks.

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: mTLS Communication: Dapr uses mutual TLS (mTLS) by default for communication between Dapr sidecars and between applications and Dapr sidecars. This encrypts traffic and provides authentication. Implemented in Dapr sidecar and control plane. Described in Dapr documentation.
*   security control: API Token Authentication: Applications authenticate to the Dapr sidecar using API tokens. Implemented in Dapr sidecar. Described in Dapr documentation.
*   security control: Access Control Policies: Dapr allows defining fine-grained access control policies to restrict which applications can invoke which services or access specific resources. Implemented in Dapr sidecar and control plane. Described in Dapr documentation.
*   security control: Secret Management: Dapr integrates with secret stores (like Kubernetes Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider key vaults) to securely manage and access secrets. Implemented in Dapr components. Described in Dapr documentation.
*   security control: Component-Specific Security: Each Dapr component (state store, pub/sub broker, etc.) has its own security considerations and configuration options. Described in Dapr component documentation.
*   security control: Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: The Dapr project undergoes regular security audits and penetration testing. Described in Dapr community and security documentation.
*   security control: Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC): The Dapr project follows secure coding practices, including code reviews, static analysis, and vulnerability scanning. Described in Dapr community and contribution guidelines.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Complexity of Configuration: Dapr's flexibility and extensive configuration options can lead to misconfigurations if not carefully managed. This risk is mitigated by providing clear documentation and best practices, but it remains a potential area of concern.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on Underlying Infrastructure Security: Dapr relies on the security of the underlying infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes, cloud provider services). While Dapr provides its own security controls, vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure could impact Dapr's security.
*   accepted risk: Sidecar Overhead: The sidecar architecture introduces some performance overhead. This is generally accepted as a trade-off for the benefits Dapr provides, but it's a factor to consider in performance-sensitive applications.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Network Policies: Implement network policies (e.g., Kubernetes Network Policies) to restrict network traffic between Dapr sidecars and applications, limiting the blast radius of potential attacks.
*   Regular Dependency Updates: Establish a process for regularly updating Dapr and its dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
*   Security Hardening Guides: Develop and maintain security hardening guides for deploying Dapr in different environments.
*   Runtime Security Monitoring: Implement runtime security monitoring tools to detect and respond to suspicious activity within Dapr sidecars and applications.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All communication between applications and Dapr sidecars must be authenticated using API tokens.
    *   All communication between Dapr sidecars must be authenticated using mTLS.
    *   Dapr control plane components must authenticate to each other using mTLS.

*   Authorization:
    *   Access control policies must be defined to restrict which applications can invoke which services.
    *   Access control policies must be defined to restrict access to Dapr resources (state stores, pub/sub topics, etc.).
    *   The principle of least privilege should be applied to all access control policies.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All input received by Dapr components must be validated to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    *   Input validation should be performed at the component level, based on the specific data types and formats expected.

*   Cryptography:
    *   mTLS must be used for all communication between Dapr sidecars and between applications and Dapr sidecars.
    *   Data at rest in state stores should be encrypted using appropriate encryption algorithms and key management practices.
    *   Secrets must be stored securely using a secret store.

## BUILD

Dapr uses GitHub Actions for its CI/CD pipeline. The build process includes several security checks.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- "Commits Code" --> GitHubRepo["GitHub Repository"];
    GitHubRepo -- "Triggers" --> GitHubActions["GitHub Actions"];
    GitHubActions -- "Runs" --> BuildJob["Build Job"];
    BuildJob -- "Performs" --> StaticAnalysis["Static Analysis (SAST)"];
    BuildJob -- "Performs" --> DependencyScanning["Dependency Scanning"];
    BuildJob -- "Performs" --> Linting["Linting"];
    BuildJob -- "Performs" --> UnitTests["Unit Tests"];
    BuildJob -- "Builds" --> BuildArtifacts["Build Artifacts (Container Images, Binaries)"];
    BuildArtifacts -- "Pushed to" --> ContainerRegistry["Container Registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry)"];
    BuildArtifacts -- "Pushed to" --> ArtifactRepository["Artifact Repository"];

```

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   Static Analysis (SAST):  Dapr uses static analysis tools (e.g., GoSec) to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   Dependency Scanning:  Dapr uses dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   Linting:  Dapr uses linters to enforce coding standards and identify potential errors.
*   Unit Tests:  Dapr has a comprehensive suite of unit tests to ensure code correctness.
*   Signed Commits: Dapr contributors are encouraged to sign their commits to ensure code integrity.
*   Automated Builds:  All builds are automated through GitHub Actions, reducing the risk of manual errors.
*   Container Image Scanning:  Container images built by Dapr are scanned for vulnerabilities before being pushed to a container registry.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Service-to-service communication: Dapr facilitates communication between microservices, which is critical for application functionality.
    *   State management: Dapr manages application state, which is essential for maintaining data consistency and supporting business operations.
    *   Pub/sub messaging: Dapr enables asynchronous communication between services, supporting event-driven architectures and business processes.
    *   Secret management: Dapr provides access to secrets, which are necessary for secure access to external resources and services.

*   Data Sensitivity:
    *   Application State: The sensitivity of application state depends on the specific application. It could range from non-sensitive data to highly sensitive data like PII, financial data, or healthcare information.
    *   Secrets: Secrets are highly sensitive and must be protected from unauthorized access.
    *   Communication Data: Data transmitted between services via Dapr may contain sensitive information, depending on the application.
    *   Configuration Data: Dapr configuration data may contain sensitive information, such as connection strings or API keys.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   Questions:
    *   What specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR) must Dapr deployments adhere to?
    *   What are the specific threat models for the applications that will be using Dapr?
    *   What are the existing security monitoring and incident response capabilities in the target deployment environment?
    *   What level of access do developers have to the production environment?
    *   Are there any specific performance requirements or limitations for Dapr deployments?

*   Assumptions:
    *   BUSINESS POSTURE: The organization prioritizes rapid development and deployment of microservices, with a focus on agility and scalability.
    *   SECURITY POSTURE: The organization has a moderate risk appetite and is willing to accept some risks in exchange for faster development and deployment. The organization has basic security controls in place (e.g., firewalls, access control), but may not have advanced security measures like runtime security monitoring.
    *   DESIGN: Dapr will be deployed in a Kubernetes environment. The organization will use a managed Kubernetes service (e.g., AKS, EKS, GKE). The organization will use Dapr's default security settings (e.g., mTLS enabled) unless there is a specific reason to change them.
