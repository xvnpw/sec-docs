# Threat Model Analysis for dapr/dapr

## Threat: [Unauthorized Service Invocation via Dapr](./threats/unauthorized_service_invocation_via_dapr.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, either external or through a compromised service, successfully invokes a Dapr-enabled service without proper authorization. The attacker crafts a request that is accepted by the Dapr sidecar, bypassing any application-level checks that might exist. This leverages Dapr's service invocation mechanism directly.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breaches: Sensitive data can be accessed or modified.
        *   Unauthorized actions: The attacker can trigger actions within the target service.
        *   Service disruption: The target service may be overloaded or experience instability.
    *   **Dapr Component Affected:**
        *   Service Invocation Building Block (specifically, the gRPC or HTTP proxy within the Dapr sidecar).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **mTLS (Mandatory):**  Enforce *strict* mutual TLS between *all* services and their Dapr sidecars.  This is the primary defense against unauthorized invocation.  Ensure certificates are properly managed and rotated.
        *   **Dapr Access Control Policies (Mandatory):** Define fine-grained access control policies within Dapr, explicitly specifying which services are allowed to invoke which other services and which operations are permitted.  Use the `allowed_services` and `operations` configurations.  This is *critical* for limiting the blast radius of a compromised service.
        *   **Service Mesh Integration (Strongly Recommended):** Use a service mesh (Istio, Linkerd) in conjunction with Dapr.  Service meshes provide advanced traffic management, observability, and security features, including more sophisticated authorization policies that can augment Dapr's built-in controls.
        *   **Application-Level Authentication/Authorization (Defense in Depth):** While Dapr provides a layer of security, *always* implement robust authentication and authorization *within your application code itself*. Dapr's security should be considered a defense-in-depth measure, not the sole security mechanism.

## Threat: [Secrets Exposure via Dapr Secrets API](./threats/secrets_exposure_via_dapr_secrets_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to secrets managed by a secrets store (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider secret managers) *through* the Dapr Secrets API. This could be due to a misconfigured Dapr component, a compromised service exploiting Dapr's access, or a vulnerability within the Dapr secrets management building block itself.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Credential theft: Attackers gain access to sensitive credentials (database passwords, API keys, etc.).
        *   System compromise: Stolen credentials can be used to compromise other systems and services, potentially escalating the attack.
    *   **Dapr Component Affected:**
        *   Secrets Management Building Block (specifically, the Dapr sidecar's interaction with the configured secrets store and the API exposed to the application).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure the Underlying Secrets Store (Mandatory):** Implement strong authentication and authorization on the underlying secrets store itself. Use strong passwords, access keys, or managed identities, and follow the principle of least privilege.
        *   **Dapr Secrets Scoping (Mandatory):** Utilize Dapr's secret scoping feature to *strictly* limit which applications (and therefore, which Dapr sidecars) can access which secrets.  This prevents a compromised application from accessing secrets it doesn't need.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (for Dapr):** Grant the Dapr sidecar *only* the minimum necessary permissions to access secrets within the secrets store. Use fine-grained access control policies provided by the secrets store (e.g., Vault policies, IAM roles).
        *   **Auditing (Mandatory):** Enable comprehensive audit logging on both the secrets store *and* within Dapr (if supported by the secrets component) to track all secret access and modification attempts.
        *   **Avoid Environment Variables:** Never pass secrets to the application via environment variables.  Always use the Dapr Secrets API to retrieve secrets.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in Dapr Runtime](./threats/vulnerability_in_dapr_runtime.md)

*   **Description:** A security vulnerability is discovered in the Dapr runtime itself (e.g., a buffer overflow, a remote code execution vulnerability, a denial-of-service vulnerability). This vulnerability directly impacts the Dapr sidecar code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   System compromise: Attackers could gain control of the Dapr sidecar and potentially the host system or container.
        *   Data breaches: Attackers could access sensitive data processed by Dapr or residing in connected components.
        *   Denial of service: Attackers could crash the Dapr sidecar, disrupting application functionality.
    *   **Dapr Component Affected:**
        *   Potentially all Dapr components, as the vulnerability exists within the core runtime.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Stay Up-to-Date (Mandatory):** Regularly update Dapr to the *latest* stable version.  Security patches are frequently released to address discovered vulnerabilities.  Automate this process as much as possible.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning (Mandatory):** Use container vulnerability scanners to continuously scan the Dapr sidecar image for known vulnerabilities. Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline.
        *   **Security Monitoring (Mandatory):** Actively monitor Dapr's official security advisories, release notes, and community forums (e.g., GitHub issues, Discord) for information about new vulnerabilities and mitigation guidance.
        *   **Least Privilege (for Dapr Sidecar):** Run the Dapr sidecar with the least privileged user possible within the container and on the host system.  This limits the potential damage from a successful exploit.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Dapr sidecars from untrusted networks using network policies (e.g., Kubernetes NetworkPolicies).

## Threat: [Pub/Sub Message Injection via Dapr](./threats/pubsub_message_injection_via_dapr.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker, potentially through a compromised service that has publish access, injects malicious messages into a Dapr pub/sub topic. This directly exploits Dapr's pub/sub mechanism. The attacker crafts messages that are accepted by the Dapr sidecar and delivered to subscribers.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data poisoning: Subscribing services receive and process malicious data, leading to incorrect behavior, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.
        *   Denial of service: Subscribers can be overwhelmed with a flood of malicious messages, causing them to become unresponsive or crash.
        *   Command injection: If message contents are used to construct commands without proper sanitization, attackers might achieve code execution on subscribers.
    *   **Dapr Component Affected:**
        *   Publish & Subscribe Building Block (specifically, the interaction between the Dapr sidecar and the configured pub/sub component, e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure the Message Broker (Mandatory):** Implement strong authentication and authorization on the underlying message broker itself (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ). This is a foundational security measure.
        *   **Dapr Pub/Sub Access Control (If Supported - Mandatory where available):**  If the specific Dapr pub/sub component supports access control lists (ACLs) or similar mechanisms, *use them* to restrict which services can *publish* to specific topics. This is crucial to prevent unauthorized message injection.
        *   **TLS Encryption (Mandatory):** Ensure that all communication between Dapr and the message broker is encrypted using TLS. This prevents eavesdropping and tampering with messages in transit.
        *   **Message Validation (Mandatory in Subscribers):** Implement *strict* input validation in *all* subscribing services to reject malformed or malicious messages.  Never trust data received from the pub/sub system.  This is the *primary* defense against data poisoning and command injection.
        *   **Message Signing (Recommended):** Consider digitally signing messages at the publisher (application level) and verifying signatures at the subscriber. This provides strong assurance of message integrity and authenticity, but adds complexity.
