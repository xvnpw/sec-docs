## Attack Tree Path: [***1.1.1!!!*** Known CVEs in Dapr Runtime](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1!!!_known_cves_in_dapr_runtime.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a publicly known and documented vulnerability (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures - CVE) in the specific version of the Dapr runtime that the application is using. These vulnerabilities might allow for remote code execution, privilege escalation, or denial of service within the Dapr sidecar.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on how quickly patches are applied)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete control over the Dapr sidecar, potentially leading to control over the application)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Public exploits or proof-of-concept code may be readily available)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires understanding of vulnerability exploitation, but readily available tools and information can lower the skill barrier)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), vulnerability scanners, and security information and event management (SIEM) systems can often detect known CVE exploitation attempts)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Keep the Dapr runtime updated to the latest stable release.
    *   Implement regular vulnerability scanning of the Dapr runtime and its dependencies.
    *   Monitor security advisories and mailing lists for Dapr and related projects.
    *   Implement a robust patch management process.

## Attack Tree Path: [***2.1.1!!!*** Read/Write arbitrary data in State Store](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1!!!_readwrite_arbitrary_data_in_state_store.md)

*   **Description:** The application does not properly enforce access control policies on the Dapr state store. An attacker, potentially without needing to authenticate to the application itself, can directly interact with the Dapr API to read, write, or delete data stored within the configured state store component (e.g., Redis, Cosmos DB, etc.). This could lead to data breaches, data corruption, or injection of malicious data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration or lack of proper authorization checks)
*   **Impact:** High (Sensitive data exposure, data integrity compromise, potential for further attacks)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Requires understanding of the Dapr state store API and the configured component)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires knowledge of API interactions and potentially the specific state store technology)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring of Dapr state store API calls and auditing access logs for unusual activity)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement strict access control policies using Dapr's built-in features (scopes, policies).
    *   Enforce application-level authorization checks before interacting with the Dapr state store API.
    *   Use least privilege principles when configuring the Dapr component's access to the underlying state store.
    *   Regularly audit Dapr configuration and access logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [***2.2.1!!!*** Call arbitrary services without proper authorization](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1!!!_call_arbitrary_services_without_proper_authorization.md)

*   **Description:** The application's service invocation configuration within Dapr is too permissive. An attacker can use the Dapr service invocation API to call services within the application or other Dapr-enabled services without proper authentication or authorization. This could allow the attacker to trigger unintended actions, access sensitive data, or bypass security controls.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration or lack of proper authorization checks)
*   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized access to services and data, potential for privilege escalation or denial of service)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Requires understanding of the Dapr service invocation API and the application's service topology)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires knowledge of API interactions and service-to-service communication)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring of Dapr service invocation API calls and auditing access logs for unusual activity. Service mesh tracing can also help.)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement strict access control policies using Dapr's service invocation features (access policies, mTLS).
    *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization within the application itself for all service endpoints.
    *   Use network policies (e.g., Kubernetes NetworkPolicies) to restrict communication between services.
    *   Regularly audit Dapr configuration and access logs.
    *   Implement service mesh tracing to visualize and monitor service interactions.
