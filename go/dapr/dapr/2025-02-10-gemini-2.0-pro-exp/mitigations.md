# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dapr/dapr

## Mitigation Strategy: [API Token Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/api_token_authentication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate Strong Tokens:** Create strong, randomly generated API tokens for both `--app-api-token` (for application-to-Dapr communication) and `--dapr-api-token` (for Dapr-to-Dapr communication). Use a cryptographically secure random number generator.  Avoid predictable patterns or easily guessable values.
    2.  **Secure Token Storage:** Store these tokens *securely*.  *Never* hardcode them directly into application code or configuration files.  Use a secrets management solution like Kubernetes Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, or AWS Secrets Manager.
    3.  **Configure Dapr:** When starting the Dapr sidecar (either via the CLI or in a Kubernetes deployment), provide the `--app-api-token` and `--dapr-api-token` arguments, referencing the securely stored tokens.  For example, in Kubernetes, you might use environment variables populated from Secrets.
    4.  **Configure Application:**  In your application code, when making calls to the Dapr API, include the `dapr-api-token` header in HTTP requests or the corresponding metadata in gRPC calls.  Retrieve the token value from the secure storage location.
    5.  **Token Rotation:** Implement a process for regularly rotating the API tokens.  The frequency of rotation depends on your security policy, but a good practice is to rotate them at least every few months, or more frequently if a compromise is suspected.
    6.  **Auditing:** Monitor the usage of API tokens to detect any unauthorized access attempts.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Dapr Sidecar API (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from directly interacting with the Dapr sidecar's API and potentially accessing sensitive resources or manipulating application behavior.
    *   **Unauthorized Inter-Sidecar Communication (Severity: High):** If `--dapr-api-token` is used, it prevents unauthorized communication between Dapr sidecars, limiting the impact of a compromised sidecar.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Dapr Sidecar API:** Risk reduced significantly (from Critical to Low/Negligible) with proper implementation and token management.
    *   **Unauthorized Inter-Sidecar Communication:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low/Negligible) with proper implementation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. API tokens are generated and used in the Kubernetes deployment manifests (using environment variables from Secrets).  Token rotation is *not* currently automated.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated token rotation is missing.  A scheduled job or process needs to be implemented to periodically generate new tokens, update the Kubernetes Secrets, and restart the Dapr sidecars.
    *   Auditing of API token usage is not fully implemented.  We need to integrate with a logging/monitoring system to track API calls and identify suspicious patterns.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Segmentation (Focusing on Dapr-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/network_segmentation__focusing_on_dapr-specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dapr API Port Control:** Use Kubernetes NetworkPolicies (or equivalent) to *specifically* restrict access to the Dapr sidecar's API ports (e.g., 3500 for HTTP, 50001 for gRPC).  Allow *only* the application container to communicate with these ports.
    2.  **Dapr-to-Dapr Communication:** If using Dapr-to-Dapr communication (e.g., for service invocation between sidecars), create NetworkPolicies that allow communication *only* between authorized Dapr sidecars.
    3. **Control Plane Access:** Restrict network access to the Dapr control plane components (Sentry, Operator, Placement) to only authorized management tools and services.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Dapr Sidecar API (Severity: Critical):** Limits the attack surface by preventing direct access to the sidecar API from unauthorized sources on the network.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Dapr APIs (Severity: High):** Reduces the impact of DoS attacks.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from easily accessing the Dapr sidecar if they compromise another part of the system.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Dapr Sidecar API:** Risk reduced significantly (from Critical to Medium/Low).
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Dapr APIs:** Risk reduced (from High to Medium).
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Medium/Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic Kubernetes NetworkPolicies are in place, restricting access to the Dapr sidecar's API port.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The current NetworkPolicies are relatively permissive and could be refined.
    *   Network policies for Dapr-to-Dapr communication and control plane access need to be explicitly defined.

## Mitigation Strategy: [mTLS (Mutual TLS) - Leveraging Dapr Sentry](./mitigation_strategies/mtls__mutual_tls__-_leveraging_dapr_sentry.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Ensure Sentry Deployment:** Verify that the Dapr Sentry component is deployed and running correctly. This is a *core Dapr component* for mTLS.
    2.  **Trust Anchor Security:**  The Sentry root certificate (trust anchor) must be securely stored and managed.  In Kubernetes, this is typically a Secret.  Protect this Secret *very* carefully.
    3.  **Automatic Rotation:** Confirm that Sentry's automatic certificate rotation is enabled and functioning.  This is a key Dapr feature.
    4.  **Monitor Sentry Health:**  Continuously monitor the health and status of the Sentry component and the validity of the generated certificates. This is crucial for maintaining mTLS.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Dapr Sidecar API (Severity: Critical):** Ensures only authenticated applications with valid certificates (issued by Sentry) can communicate with the sidecar.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from intercepting/modifying communication between the application and the Dapr sidecar.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Dapr Sidecar API:** Risk reduced significantly (from Critical to Low/Negligible).
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** Risk eliminated (from High to Negligible).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Dapr Sentry is deployed and mTLS is enabled by default. Automatic certificate rotation is also enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Enhanced monitoring of Sentry and certificate status is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting (Using Dapr Middleware)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting__using_dapr_middleware_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify API Limits:** Determine appropriate rate limits for *Dapr API endpoints* based on expected traffic.
    2.  **Configure `ratelimit` Middleware:** Add a `ratelimit` middleware component to the *Dapr configuration*. This is a *Dapr-specific* configuration.
    3.  **Define Limits:** In the middleware configuration, specify the maximum requests per time unit and burst capacity.
    4.  **Test and Tune:** Thoroughly test the rate limiting to ensure it works without impacting legitimate traffic.
    5.  **Monitor:** Monitor Dapr's rate limiting metrics to track throttled requests and identify potential DoS attempts.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Dapr APIs (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the Dapr sidecar API.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Dapr APIs:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Medium/Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not yet implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Rate limiting middleware needs to be added to the Dapr configuration, and limits need to be defined and tested.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Dapr Control Plane](./mitigation_strategies/secure_dapr_control_plane.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **Secure Deployment:** Deploy Dapr control plane components (Sentry, Operator, Placement) following Kubernetes security best practices (RBAC, network policies, pod security policies).
    2.  **Authentication and Authorization:** Restrict access to control plane components. Use strong authentication.
    3.  **Regular Updates:** Keep Dapr control plane components updated with the latest security patches.
    4.  **Auditing and Monitoring:** Enable auditing and monitoring for control plane components.
    5.  **Sentry Root Certificate Protection:** Store the Sentry root certificate securely, restrict access, and monitor its usage.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Compromised Dapr Control Plane (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from gaining control over the entire Dapr deployment.

* **Impact:**
    * **Compromised Dapr Control Plane:** Risk reduced significantly (from Critical to Medium/Low).

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Basic Kubernetes security practices are followed for control plane deployment.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * More robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for control plane access are needed.
    * Enhanced auditing and monitoring of control plane components are required.
    * Formalized process for regular updates and patching of control plane components.
