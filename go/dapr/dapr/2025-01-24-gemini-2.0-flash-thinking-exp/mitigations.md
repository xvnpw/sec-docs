# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dapr/dapr

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Mutual TLS (mTLS) for Service-to-Service Communication](./mitigation_strategies/implement_mutual_tls__mtls__for_service-to-service_communication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable mTLS in Dapr Configuration:** Modify your Dapr configuration file (e.g., `dapr-config.yaml`) to enable mTLS by setting `spec.security.mtls.enabled: true`.
    2.  **Configure Certificate Provider (Optional):** If not using the default Dapr certificate provider, configure a custom certificate provider in the Dapr configuration. This might involve specifying a Kubernetes Secret containing certificates or integrating with an external certificate management system.
    3.  **Deploy Dapr Configuration:** Apply the updated Dapr configuration to your Kubernetes cluster or Dapr runtime environment. Dapr will automatically handle certificate distribution and mTLS setup for service invocations.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Eavesdropping (High Severity) - Unauthorized interception of communication between Dapr sidecars, potentially exposing sensitive data during service invocation.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity) - An attacker intercepts and potentially modifies communication between Dapr sidecars, leading to data breaches or service disruption during service invocation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Eavesdropping: High Risk Reduction - Encrypts communication between Dapr sidecars, making it unreadable to eavesdroppers.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: High Risk Reduction - Mutual authentication enforced by mTLS ensures both communicating Dapr sidecars are verified, preventing MITM attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in the `production` Kubernetes cluster for inter-service communication within the `backend` namespace. Configuration is defined in `kubernetes/dapr-config.yaml` with `mtlsEnabled: true`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Not yet fully enabled in the `staging` environment. Needs to be consistently applied across all namespaces where Dapr is used, including external service integrations that communicate through Dapr if applicable.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Access Control Policies (ACLs) for Service Invocation using Dapr Policy Engine](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_access_control_policies__acls__for_service_invocation_using_dapr_policy_engine.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Dapr Policy Documents:** Create Dapr policy documents (YAML files) that specify access control rules for service invocation. Use Dapr's policy specification to define rules based on service identities, namespaces, operations, and metadata. Example policy: `apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Policy\nmetadata:\n  name: service-invocation-policy\nspec:\n  targets:\n  - targetServices: ["service-a"]\n    operations: ["InvokeMethod"]\n  policy:\n    rules:\n    - subjects:\n      - kind: ServiceAccount\n        name: "service-b"\n        namespace: "backend"\n      operations: ["InvokeMethod"]\n      effect: "allow"`.
    2.  **Deploy Policies to Dapr Control Plane:** Apply these policy documents to the Kubernetes cluster where Dapr control plane is running using `kubectl apply -f policy.yaml`. Dapr's policy engine will automatically load and enforce these policies for service-to-service calls.
    3.  **Test Policy Enforcement:** Thoroughly test the policies by attempting to invoke services from both authorized and unauthorized services. Monitor Dapr sidecar logs and control plane logs for policy enforcement decisions and errors.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Service Invocation (High Severity) - Malicious or compromised services invoking other services through Dapr without proper authorization, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or denial of service.
    *   Lateral Movement (Medium Severity) - Prevents attackers who have compromised one service from easily moving laterally to other services within the application via Dapr service invocation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Service Invocation: High Risk Reduction - Dapr policy engine strictly controls which services can call other services through Dapr, preventing unauthorized access at the Dapr layer.
    *   Lateral Movement: Medium Risk Reduction - Makes lateral movement more difficult within the Dapr mesh by requiring attackers to bypass or circumvent Dapr's access control policies.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented for critical services in the `payment` and `user-profile` components within the `production` environment. Policies are defined in `kubernetes/policies/service-invocation-policies.yaml` and applied to the cluster.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  ACLs need to be expanded to cover all inter-service communication within the application, including less critical but still sensitive services. Policies for `staging` and `development` environments are not yet defined. Policy management and auditing processes need to be established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure State Store Encryption using Dapr Component Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/configure_state_store_encryption_using_dapr_component_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify State Store Component Configuration:** Locate the Dapr component configuration file for your state store (e.g., `statestore.yaml`).
    2.  **Configure Encryption Settings in Component:**  Within the component configuration, add or modify settings to enable encryption at rest and/or in transit. The specific settings depend on the state store component being used. For example, for Redis, you might configure TLS and encryption options within the `metadata` section of the component definition. Example for Azure Blob Storage: `apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Component\nmetadata:\n  name: statestore\nspec:\n  type: state.azure.blobstorage\n  version: v1\n  metadata:\n  - name: accountName\n    value: "[your-account-name]"\n  - name: accountKey\n    value: "[your-account-key]"\n  - name: containerName\n    value: "dapr-state-store"\n  - name: encryption.enabled\n    value: "true"`.
    3.  **Deploy Updated Component Configuration:** Apply the updated component configuration to your Dapr environment. Dapr will pass these configuration settings to the state store component, enabling encryption if supported by the underlying state store.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Breach from State Store Compromise (High Severity) - If the state store is compromised, encryption configured via Dapr component settings prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within.
    *   Data Interception in Transit (Medium Severity) - Protects state data while it is being transmitted between Dapr and the state store, preventing eavesdropping during transit if in-transit encryption is configured.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Breach from State Store Compromise: High Risk Reduction - Renders stored data unreadable without decryption keys, significantly mitigating the impact of a state store breach when encryption at rest is enabled via Dapr configuration.
    *   Data Interception in Transit: Medium Risk Reduction - Protects data during transit, but physical security of the state store and access control are still crucial.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Enabled for the `Redis` state store used in the `production` environment. Dapr component configuration for Redis includes TLS settings. Configuration is managed through [Infrastructure as Code Tool].
*   **Missing Implementation:** Encryption at rest and in transit needs to be verified and enabled for the `PostgreSQL` state store used in the `staging` environment by updating its Dapr component configuration.  Need to ensure consistent encryption settings across all state store components used with Dapr.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Secure Secret Stores Integrated with Dapr Secret Store API](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_secure_secret_stores_integrated_with_dapr_secret_store_api.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose and Configure Dapr Secret Store Component:** Select a supported Dapr secret store component (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets) and configure it in a Dapr component YAML file. Example for Azure Key Vault: `apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Component\nmetadata:\n  name: azurekeyvault\nspec:\n  type: secretstores.azure.keyvault\n  version: v1\n  metadata:\n  - name: vaultName\n    value: "[your-key-vault-name]"\n  - name: tenantId\n    value: "[your-tenant-id]"\n  - name: clientId\n    value: "[your-client-id]"\n  - name: clientSecret\n    value: "[your-client-secret]"`.  **Note:** For production, use managed identities instead of client secrets where possible.
    2.  **Deploy Secret Store Component:** Apply the secret store component configuration to your Dapr environment.
    3.  **Retrieve Secrets via Dapr Secret Store API in Application Code:** Modify application code to use the Dapr Secret Store API (via Dapr SDK or HTTP API) to retrieve secrets by name. Example using Dapr SDK: `secret, err := client.GetSecret(ctx, "azurekeyvault", "my-secret-name", nil)`.
    4.  **Secure Secret Store Access:** Configure access control within the chosen secret store (e.g., Azure Key Vault policies, Vault policies) to restrict which applications or services can access specific secrets.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of Secrets in Code/Configuration (High Severity) - Prevents accidental or intentional exposure of sensitive secrets by avoiding hardcoding them in application code or Dapr component configuration files (except for initial secret store access credentials, which should be managed securely).
    *   Unauthorized Access to Secrets (High Severity) - Limits access to secrets to only authorized applications and services through the secure secret store and its access control mechanisms, accessed via Dapr's API.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of Secrets in Code/Configuration: High Risk Reduction - Eliminates the risk of secrets being directly exposed in code repositories, configuration files, or build artifacts by centralizing secret retrieval through Dapr's API.
    *   Unauthorized Access to Secrets: High Risk Reduction -  Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access by leveraging dedicated secret stores and enforcing access control at the secret store level, accessed through Dapr.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Integrated with `Azure Key Vault` in the `production` environment. Dapr components are configured to retrieve secrets from Key Vault using managed identities. Application code uses Dapr SDK to fetch secrets via the Dapr Secret Store API.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Secret store integration needs to be extended to the `staging` and `development` environments. RBAC policies within Key Vault need to be reviewed and refined to ensure least privilege access for Dapr components and applications. Secure bootstrapping of initial secret store credentials needs to be further hardened.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Pod Security Policies/Pod Security Standards to Secure Dapr Sidecars](./mitigation_strategies/implement_pod_security_policiespod_security_standards_to_secure_dapr_sidecars.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose and Implement Pod Security Standard (PSS) or Pod Security Policy (PSP):** Select an appropriate Pod Security Standard (Baseline or Restricted) or Pod Security Policy based on your security requirements and Kubernetes version. PSS is generally recommended for newer Kubernetes versions.
    2.  **Apply PSS/PSP to Dapr Sidecar Namespaces:** Apply the chosen PSS or PSP to the Kubernetes namespaces where applications with Dapr sidecars are deployed. This can be done using namespace labels for PSS or by creating PSP resources and RBAC rules targeting these namespaces.
    3.  **Restrict Dapr Sidecar Capabilities via PSS/PSP:** Configure PSS/PSP to restrict capabilities specifically relevant to Dapr sidecar containers. This includes limiting privileged containers, host network access, host path mounts, and other potentially risky capabilities that a Dapr sidecar might inherit. Focus on restrictions that minimize the attack surface of the Dapr sidecar without hindering its core functionality.
    4.  **Audit and Enforce PSS/PSP for Dapr Sidecars:** Regularly audit the applied PSS/PSP to ensure they are effective in securing Dapr sidecars. Use Kubernetes admission controllers to enforce PSS/PSP and prevent deployments of pods with Dapr sidecars that violate the policies.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Sidecar Container Escape (High Severity) - Prevents a compromised Dapr sidecar container from escaping its container boundaries and gaining access to the host system or other containers in the pod by limiting its capabilities through PSS/PSP.
    *   Privilege Escalation (High Severity) - Limits the privileges of the Dapr sidecar container enforced by PSS/PSP, reducing the potential for privilege escalation attacks if the sidecar is compromised.
    *   Host Resource Access (Medium Severity) - Restricts the Dapr sidecar's access to host resources (network, file system) through PSS/PSP, limiting the impact of a potential compromise.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Sidecar Container Escape: High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of container escape for Dapr sidecars by limiting capabilities and enforcing security boundaries via PSS/PSP.
    *   Privilege Escalation: High Risk Reduction -  Minimizes the potential for privilege escalation in Dapr sidecars by running them with reduced privileges enforced by PSS/PSP.
    *   Host Resource Access: Medium Risk Reduction - Limits Dapr sidecar access to host resources, but proper network segmentation and other security measures are still important for overall security.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  `Baseline` Pod Security Standard is enforced in the `production` and `staging` namespaces, impacting Dapr sidecars deployed in these namespaces. Namespace labels are used to apply the PSS.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to evaluate and potentially implement the `Restricted` Pod Security Standard for stricter security for Dapr sidecars. PSPs are deprecated and should be migrated to PSS if still in use.  Detailed audit of Dapr sidecar required capabilities and further restrictions based on the `Restricted` PSS are needed to specifically harden Dapr sidecars.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Dapr Control Plane and Sidecar Components](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_dapr_control_plane_and_sidecar_components.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Dapr Releases and Security Advisories:** Regularly check the official Dapr GitHub repository, release notes, security advisories, and community channels for new Dapr releases, security patches, and vulnerability announcements.
    2.  **Establish a Patching Schedule for Dapr:** Define a regular schedule for updating Dapr control plane components and sidecars. Prioritize security patches and aim for timely updates, especially for critical vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Automate Dapr Updates (where possible):**  Automate the update process for Dapr control plane components and sidecars using infrastructure as code tools, Helm charts, or Kubernetes operators. This reduces manual effort and ensures consistent and timely updates across environments.
    4.  **Test Dapr Updates in Non-Production Environments:**  Thoroughly test Dapr updates in `staging` or `development` environments before rolling them out to `production`. Verify Dapr functionality, application compatibility, and identify any potential issues introduced by the update.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Dapr Vulnerabilities (High Severity) -  Outdated Dapr control plane and sidecar components may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to compromise the application, Dapr infrastructure, or the underlying infrastructure.
    *   Denial of Service (Medium Severity) - Some Dapr vulnerabilities can be exploited to cause denial of service attacks against Dapr components or applications relying on Dapr.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Dapr Vulnerabilities: High Risk Reduction -  Regularly patching Dapr components eliminates known attack vectors and significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of Dapr-specific vulnerabilities.
    *   Denial of Service: Medium Risk Reduction -  Patches can address vulnerabilities in Dapr that could lead to DoS attacks, improving the availability and resilience of Dapr-based applications.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Dapr control plane components in `production` are updated using a semi-automated process with Helm charts. Sidecar updates are generally triggered by application deployments, which often pull the latest Dapr sidecar image.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  The Dapr update process needs to be fully automated and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for both control plane and sidecars. A clear and documented patching schedule and process for monitoring Dapr releases and security advisories needs to be formally established. Testing of Dapr updates in `staging` needs to be more rigorous and include specific Dapr functionality testing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement RBAC for Dapr Control Plane Access](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rbac_for_dapr_control_plane_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define RBAC Roles for Dapr Control Plane:** Define Kubernetes RBAC roles that specify granular permissions for accessing Dapr control plane resources (e.g., Dapr configurations, components, policies, actors).  Roles should align with the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary permissions to different users or service accounts.
    2.  **Bind RBAC Roles to Users/Service Accounts:** Bind the defined RBAC roles to specific users, groups, or service accounts that need to interact with the Dapr control plane. Use RoleBindings or ClusterRoleBindings in Kubernetes to establish these associations.
    3.  **Enforce RBAC for Dapr API Access:** Ensure that access to the Dapr control plane APIs (e.g., Kubernetes API server for Dapr CRDs) is strictly controlled by the implemented RBAC policies. Verify that only authorized users and service accounts can perform actions on Dapr control plane resources.
    4.  **Regularly Review and Audit RBAC Policies:** Periodically review and audit the RBAC policies defined for the Dapr control plane to ensure they are still appropriate, up-to-date, and effectively enforce least privilege access.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Dapr Control Plane (High Severity) - Prevents unauthorized users or compromised accounts from accessing and manipulating the Dapr control plane, which could lead to configuration changes, service disruptions, or security policy bypasses.
    *   Privilege Escalation within Dapr Infrastructure (Medium Severity) - Limits the potential for privilege escalation within the Dapr infrastructure by restricting access to sensitive control plane operations to only authorized entities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Dapr Control Plane: High Risk Reduction - RBAC effectively restricts access to the Dapr control plane, preventing unauthorized modifications and ensuring only authorized personnel can manage Dapr configurations and policies.
    *   Privilege Escalation within Dapr Infrastructure: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of privilege escalation by enforcing granular access control to Dapr control plane operations.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic RBAC is implemented for Kubernetes cluster access, which indirectly protects the Dapr control plane running within Kubernetes.  However, Dapr-specific RBAC roles and bindings are not explicitly defined.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to define and implement Dapr-specific RBAC roles and bindings that precisely control access to Dapr control plane resources (CRDs). This includes defining roles for viewing, creating, updating, and deleting Dapr configurations, components, policies, etc., and binding these roles to appropriate users and service accounts.  Regular auditing of these RBAC policies needs to be established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Review and Audit Dapr Component Configurations](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_review_and_audit_dapr_component_configurations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Schedule for Configuration Audits:** Define a regular schedule (e.g., monthly, quarterly) for reviewing and auditing Dapr component configuration files (YAML files).
    2.  **Review Component Configurations for Security Misconfigurations:** During audits, systematically review each Dapr component configuration file for potential security misconfigurations, such as:
        *   Exposed sensitive information (though secrets should be in secret stores, check for accidental inclusion).
        *   Overly permissive access settings in component metadata.
        *   Use of insecure or deprecated component versions or features.
        *   Incorrect or missing encryption settings.
        *   Unnecessary or unused components that increase the attack surface.
    3.  **Document Audit Findings and Remediation Actions:** Document all findings from the configuration audits, including identified misconfigurations and potential security risks.  Track remediation actions taken to address these findings and ensure they are implemented effectively.
    4.  **Automate Configuration Audits (where possible):** Explore tools and scripts to automate parts of the Dapr component configuration audit process. This could include scripts to check for common misconfigurations or compliance with security best practices.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Security Misconfigurations in Dapr Components (Medium to High Severity) - Dapr component configurations might contain security misconfigurations that could weaken the overall security posture of the application, leading to vulnerabilities or unintended access.
    *   Exposure of Sensitive Information (Medium Severity) - Although secrets should be managed separately, accidental inclusion of sensitive information in component configurations could lead to exposure if configurations are not properly secured.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Security Misconfigurations in Dapr Components: Medium to High Risk Reduction - Regular audits help identify and rectify security misconfigurations in Dapr components, preventing potential vulnerabilities and strengthening the security of Dapr integrations.
    *   Exposure of Sensitive Information: Medium Risk Reduction - Audits can help detect accidental inclusion of sensitive information in component configurations, allowing for remediation before potential exposure.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Manual review of Dapr component configurations is performed during major deployments or changes, but no formal scheduled audit process is in place.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to establish a formal, scheduled process for regularly reviewing and auditing Dapr component configurations.  Documentation of audit procedures and findings is needed. Automation of configuration audits should be explored to improve efficiency and consistency.
