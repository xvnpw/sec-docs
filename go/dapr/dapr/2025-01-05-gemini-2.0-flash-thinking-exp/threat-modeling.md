# Threat Model Analysis for dapr/dapr

## Threat: [Compromised Dapr Sidecar](./threats/compromised_dapr_sidecar.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Dapr sidecar process. This could be achieved through container vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the sidecar process itself. Once compromised, the attacker can intercept, modify, or forge requests and responses between the application and other services via Dapr building blocks. They might also be able to access secrets or state data handled by the sidecar.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the application, denial of service by disrupting communication, and potential compromise of other services the application interacts with.

**Affected Component:** Dapr Sidecar (daprd process)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong container security practices (e.g., least privilege, regular image scanning, resource limits).
*   Harden the sidecar container image by removing unnecessary components.
*   Enforce secure communication channels between the application and the sidecar (e.g., using localhost-only communication where applicable and securing network policies).
*   Regularly update the Dapr sidecar to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Monitor sidecar logs and metrics for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) on Service Invocation](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__on_service_invocation.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between two services going through the Dapr Service Invocation building block. This could involve eavesdropping on network traffic or exploiting vulnerabilities in the Dapr service invocation implementation. The attacker can then read sensitive data being exchanged or modify requests to perform unauthorized actions on the receiving service.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to services, and potential manipulation of data or actions in the receiving service.

**Affected Component:** Dapr Service Invocation API, Dapr Sidecar's proxy functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable and enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service communication within the Dapr mesh.
*   Ensure proper certificate management and rotation for mTLS.
*   Secure the network infrastructure to prevent unauthorized access and eavesdropping.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to State Store](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_state_store.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the underlying state store *through the Dapr State Management API*. This could be due to misconfigured access control policies within Dapr or vulnerabilities in the Dapr State Management implementation. The attacker can then read, modify, or delete application state data.

**Impact:** Data corruption, loss of application state, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and potential application malfunction.

**Affected Component:** Dapr State Management API.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing the state store *via Dapr's access control policies*.
*   Configure Dapr's access control policies to restrict which applications can access specific state.
*   Encrypt sensitive data stored in the state store at rest and in transit.

## Threat: [Secrets Exfiltration via Secrets API](./threats/secrets_exfiltration_via_secrets_api.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to secrets managed by Dapr's Secrets API. This could be due to misconfigured access control policies within Dapr or vulnerabilities in the Dapr Secrets API implementation. The attacker can then retrieve sensitive credentials or configuration data.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to potential compromise of other systems and resources that rely on those secrets.

**Affected Component:** Dapr Secrets API.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict access control policies for accessing secrets using Dapr's configuration.
*   Choose a secure secrets store backend and follow its security best practices.
*   Rotate secrets regularly.
*   Audit access to secrets.

## Threat: [Control Plane Compromise](./threats/control_plane_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of Dapr control plane components (e.g., Placement service, Operator, Sentry). This could be due to vulnerabilities in these Dapr components or insecure deployment practices of the Dapr control plane. A compromised control plane can allow the attacker to manipulate service discovery, access control policies, and certificate management, affecting the entire Dapr mesh.

**Impact:** Widespread disruption of the Dapr infrastructure, unauthorized access to services, and potential data breaches across multiple applications.

**Affected Component:** Dapr Control Plane components (Placement, Operator, Sentry).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the infrastructure hosting the Dapr control plane components.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing control plane APIs.
*   Regularly update Dapr control plane components to patch vulnerabilities.
*   Monitor control plane logs and metrics for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Sidecar Impersonation](./threats/sidecar_impersonation.md)

**Description:** A malicious process or container attempts to impersonate a legitimate Dapr sidecar. This could involve running a rogue process on the same network or exploiting vulnerabilities in the Dapr sidecar discovery mechanism. If successful, applications might mistakenly communicate with the malicious process, sending sensitive data or executing unintended actions.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized actions performed by the application, and potential compromise of the application itself.

**Affected Component:** Dapr Sidecar (daprd process), Dapr service discovery mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong authentication mechanisms between applications and their sidecars (e.g., using mTLS or secure local communication channels).
*   Implement network segmentation and policies to prevent unauthorized processes from communicating on the Dapr network.
*   Monitor for unexpected network connections and processes.
