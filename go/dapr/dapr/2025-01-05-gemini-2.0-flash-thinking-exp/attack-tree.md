## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Dapr Sidecar Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_dapr_sidecar_vulnerabilities.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE]** Container Escape from Sidecar (AND)
    * Identify Vulnerability in Sidecar Containerization
    * Exploit Vulnerability to Access Host System
* **[HIGH RISK PATH]** **[CRITICAL NODE]** Abuse Sidecar API without Authentication/Authorization (AND)
    * Identify Missing or Weak Authentication/Authorization on Sidecar API
    * Send Malicious Requests Directly to Sidecar
        * Invoke Unauthorized Services
        * Access/Modify Application State

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Container Escape from Sidecar](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__container_escape_from_sidecar.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies a vulnerability within the container runtime or the sidecar's container configuration that allows them to break out of the container's isolation.
* **Steps:**  The attacker first needs to find a specific vulnerability (e.g., a flaw in `runc`, a misconfigured security context). They then craft an exploit that leverages this vulnerability to gain access to the underlying host operating system. This grants them significant control beyond the application's intended scope.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Abuse Sidecar API without Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__abuse_sidecar_api_without_authenticationauthorization.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The Dapr sidecar exposes an API for interacting with its functionalities. If this API is not properly secured with authentication and authorization, an attacker can directly send requests to the sidecar.
* **Steps:** The attacker identifies that the sidecar API is accessible without proper credentials. They then craft malicious requests to perform actions like invoking services on behalf of the application, accessing or modifying the application's state, or publishing messages through the pub/sub mechanism, all without proper authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Dapr Building Blocks](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_dapr_building_blocks.md)

* **[HIGH RISK PATH]** **[CRITICAL NODE]** Service Invocation Exploitation
    * Bypass Access Control Policies (AND)
        * Identify Weaknesses in Dapr Access Control Configuration
        * Craft Requests to Circumvent Policies
* **[HIGH RISK PATH]** **[CRITICAL NODE]** State Management Exploitation
    * Unauthorized Data Access (AND)
        * Identify Weak or Missing Access Control on State Store
        * Directly Access State Store Using Dapr APIs
    * Data Manipulation/Corruption (AND)
        * Gain Unauthorized Access to State Store
        * Modify or Delete Critical Application Data
* **[HIGH RISK PATH]** **[CRITICAL NODE]** Secrets Management Exploitation
    * Unauthorized Secret Access (AND)
        * Identify Weaknesses in Secret Store Access Control
        * Access Sensitive Secrets Intended for the Application

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Service Invocation Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__service_invocation_exploitation.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The Service Invocation building block allows applications to call other services through Dapr. If access control policies are weak or misconfigured, attackers can bypass these policies.
* **Steps:** The attacker analyzes the Dapr access control configuration and identifies weaknesses. They then craft requests that exploit these weaknesses to call services they are not authorized to access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] State Management Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__state_management_exploitation.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The State Management building block allows applications to store and retrieve state. If access controls on the state store are weak or missing, attackers can gain unauthorized access.
* **Steps:** The attacker identifies a lack of proper access control on the underlying state store. They then use Dapr APIs to directly access, modify, or delete application state data, potentially leading to data breaches or corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Secrets Management Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__secrets_management_exploitation.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Dapr's Secrets Management building block allows applications to retrieve secrets from secret stores. If access controls on the secret store are weak, attackers can access sensitive information.
* **Steps:** The attacker identifies vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the access controls of the secret store being used by Dapr. They then use Dapr APIs to retrieve sensitive secrets intended for the application, potentially compromising credentials, API keys, or other sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Dapr Control Plane Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_dapr_control_plane_vulnerabilities.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE]** Compromise Placement Service (AND)
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Placement Service
    * Manipulate Service Instance Information
        * Redirect Traffic to Malicious Instances
* **[CRITICAL NODE]** Compromise Operator (Kubernetes) (AND)
    * Exploit Kubernetes Vulnerabilities to Access Dapr Operator
    * Modify Dapr Configurations or Deploy Malicious Components
* **[CRITICAL NODE]** Compromise Sentry (mTLS Certificate Authority) (AND)
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Sentry
    * Issue Malicious Certificates
        * Impersonate Services or Intercept Communication
* **[HIGH RISK PATH]** **[CRITICAL NODE]** Configuration Tampering (AND)
    * Gain Unauthorized Access to Dapr Configuration Stores (e.g., Kubernetes ConfigMaps, CRDs)
    * Modify Dapr Configurations to Introduce Vulnerabilities or Redirect Traffic

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Placement Service](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_placement_service.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The Placement service is responsible for service discovery and actor placement. If compromised, an attacker can manipulate service instance information.
* **Steps:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Placement service itself. Once compromised, they can manipulate the information about available service instances, potentially redirecting traffic intended for legitimate services to malicious instances under their control.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Operator (Kubernetes)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_operator__kubernetes_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The Dapr Operator runs within Kubernetes and manages Dapr components. Compromising the Operator allows for wide-ranging control over Dapr.
* **Steps:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Kubernetes environment to gain access to the Dapr Operator. With access, they can modify Dapr configurations, deploy malicious components within the Dapr infrastructure, or disrupt Dapr's operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Sentry (mTLS Certificate Authority)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_sentry__mtls_certificate_authority_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Dapr Sentry acts as a certificate authority for mTLS. If compromised, an attacker can issue malicious certificates.
* **Steps:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Sentry component. Upon successful compromise, they can issue their own certificates, allowing them to impersonate legitimate services within the Dapr mesh or intercept communication between services.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Configuration Tampering](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__configuration_tampering.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Dapr's configuration is stored in various locations (e.g., Kubernetes ConfigMaps, CRDs). If an attacker gains unauthorized access to these stores, they can modify Dapr's behavior.
* **Steps:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the storage locations of Dapr's configuration. They then modify these configurations to introduce vulnerabilities, redirect traffic, disable security features, or otherwise manipulate Dapr's behavior to their advantage.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Insecure Dapr Deployment Practices](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_insecure_dapr_deployment_practices.md)

* **[HIGH RISK PATH]** **[CRITICAL NODE]** Weak Authentication/Authorization Configuration (AND)
    * Dapr APIs Exposed Without Proper Authentication
    * Weak or Default Credentials Used for Dapr Components
* **[HIGH RISK PATH]** **[CRITICAL NODE]** Lack of Network Segmentation (AND)
    * Dapr Sidecars Accessible from Untrusted Networks
    * Attackers Can Directly Interact with Dapr Components
* **[HIGH RISK PATH]** **[CRITICAL NODE]** Insecure Secrets Management for Dapr Configuration (AND)
    * Dapr Configurations Containing Sensitive Information Stored Insecurely
    * Attackers Can Access These Secrets

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Weak Authentication/Authorization Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__weak_authenticationauthorization_configuration.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If Dapr APIs are exposed without proper authentication or if weak or default credentials are used for Dapr components, attackers can easily gain unauthorized access.
* **Steps:** The attacker discovers that Dapr APIs are accessible without requiring authentication. Alternatively, they find or guess weak or default credentials used for accessing Dapr components. This allows them to interact with Dapr without proper authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Lack of Network Segmentation](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__lack_of_network_segmentation.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If Dapr sidecars and control plane components are accessible from untrusted networks, attackers can directly interact with them.
* **Steps:** Due to a lack of network segmentation, the attacker can directly reach Dapr sidecars or control plane components from outside the intended secure network. This allows them to bypass network-level security controls and potentially exploit vulnerabilities directly.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Insecure Secrets Management for Dapr Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__insecure_secrets_management_for_dapr_configuration.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If sensitive information (like API keys, database credentials) is stored insecurely within Dapr configurations, attackers can access these secrets.
* **Steps:** The attacker discovers that sensitive information is embedded directly within Dapr configuration files or stored in an insecure manner. They then access these configuration files and extract the sensitive secrets, which can be used to further compromise the application or other connected systems.
