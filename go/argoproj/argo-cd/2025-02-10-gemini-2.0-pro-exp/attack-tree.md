## Attack Tree Path: [[[Gain Unauthorized Control over Target Kubernetes Cluster(s)]]](./attack_tree_paths/__gain_unauthorized_control_over_target_kubernetes_cluster_s___.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker.  Successful exploitation of any of the child nodes leads to this outcome.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Complete control over the Kubernetes cluster(s), allowing for malicious deployments, data exfiltration, and service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Compromise Argo CD Instance]]](./attack_tree_paths/__compromise_argo_cd_instance__.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining administrative or operational control over the Argo CD server itself. This is a critical stepping stone to controlling the managed clusters.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Provides a direct path to manipulating deployments and accessing cluster resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Abuse Argo CD API] === `|||||` [[Direct API Calls (if exposed)]]](./attack_tree_paths/_abuse_argo_cd_api__===______direct_api_calls__if_exposed___.md)

*   **Description:**  If the Argo CD API is exposed to the internet or an untrusted network without proper authentication and authorization, an attacker can directly interact with it using standard HTTP requests.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Allows the attacker to create, modify, or delete applications, sync deployments, and potentially access sensitive information.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (High if exposed, otherwise Low)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (API calls are logged, but might be missed without proper monitoring and alerting).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Never expose the Argo CD API directly to the public internet.
    *   Use a reverse proxy or API gateway with strong authentication (e.g., OIDC, OAuth 2.0, mTLS).
    *   Implement strict authorization policies using Argo CD's RBAC.
    *   Enable and monitor API access logs.
    *   Use network policies to restrict access to the API server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Compromise Argo CD Credentials] === [Stolen Token]](./attack_tree_paths/_compromise_argo_cd_credentials__===__stolen_token_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains a valid Argo CD API token through various means, such as theft from a compromised system, interception of network traffic, or social engineering.
*   **Impact:** High - Grants the attacker access to Argo CD with the permissions associated with the stolen token.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (unusual activity from the token's associated user/service account might be detected).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use short-lived tokens.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Regularly rotate tokens.
    *   Monitor for suspicious login activity and token usage.
    *   Educate users about the risks of token theft and phishing.
    *   Store tokens securely (e.g., using a secrets management system).

## Attack Tree Path: [[Compromise Argo CD Credentials] === [Phishing]](./attack_tree_paths/_compromise_argo_cd_credentials__===__phishing_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker tricks a legitimate Argo CD user into revealing their credentials (username/password or API token) through a deceptive email, website, or other communication.
*   **Impact:** High - Grants the attacker access to Argo CD with the compromised user's permissions.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (depends on email security, user reporting, and anomaly detection).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   User education and awareness training on phishing techniques.
    *   Implement strong email security measures (e.g., spam filtering, DMARC, DKIM, SPF).
    *   Use multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Encourage users to report suspicious emails and communications.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Exploit Misconfigured Argo CD Access/Permissions]]](./attack_tree_paths/__exploit_misconfigured_argo_cd_accesspermissions__.md)

*   **Description:**  Leveraging overly permissive or incorrectly configured access controls within Argo CD to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Can lead to complete control over managed clusters, depending on the misconfiguration.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Overly Permissive RBAC]] === `||` [[Cluster-wide Admin]]](./attack_tree_paths/__overly_permissive_rbac___===______cluster-wide_admin__.md)

*   **Description:**  The Argo CD service account, or a user account used to interact with Argo CD, is granted the `cluster-admin` role within the target Kubernetes cluster(s). This grants excessive privileges.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Provides full control over the target cluster(s), bypassing any intended restrictions.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (a common misconfiguration)
*   **Effort:** Very Low (if the role is already granted)
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires auditing RBAC configurations)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Never grant the `cluster-admin` role to Argo CD or its users.
    *   Create custom roles and role bindings with the *minimum* necessary permissions for Argo CD to function.
    *   Regularly review and audit RBAC configurations.
    *   Use the principle of least privilege.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Weak/Default App Project Config]] === `||` [[No App Restrictions]]](./attack_tree_paths/__weakdefault_app_project_config___===______no_app_restrictions__.md)

*   **Description:**  Argo CD AppProjects are not configured with appropriate restrictions, or the default AppProject is used without modification, allowing applications to be deployed to any cluster, namespace, or with any resources.
*   **Impact:** Very High - An attacker can deploy malicious applications, potentially gaining control of the cluster or accessing sensitive data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (a common misconfiguration)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires auditing AppProject configurations)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Always define specific AppProjects with restrictions on:
        *   Source repositories (allowed Git repos).
        *   Destination clusters and namespaces.
        *   Allowed Kubernetes resource types (e.g., Deployments, Services, Secrets).
    *   Avoid using the default AppProject with overly broad permissions.
    *   Regularly review and audit AppProject configurations.
