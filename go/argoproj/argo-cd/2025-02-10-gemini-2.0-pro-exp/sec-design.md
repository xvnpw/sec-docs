## DEPLOYMENT

Possible Deployment Solutions:

1.  **High Availability (HA) Deployment:** Multiple replicas of Argo CD components (API server, application controller, repo server) running across multiple Kubernetes nodes. This provides redundancy and fault tolerance.
2.  **Standard Deployment:** Single replicas of Argo CD components. Simpler to set up but less resilient.
3.  **Namespace-Scoped Deployment:** Argo CD deployed within a specific Kubernetes namespace, limiting its scope of operation.
4.  **Cluster-Scoped Deployment:** Argo CD deployed with cluster-wide access, allowing it to manage applications across all namespaces.

## BUILD

Argo CD's build process is primarily managed through Makefiles and Dockerfiles. The build process leverages GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Developer] --> B[GitHub Repository]
    B --> C[GitHub Actions]
    C --> D[Build (Make)]
    D --> E[Test (Unit, Integration)]
    E --> F[Build Docker Images]
    F --> G[Push to Image Registry]
    G --> H[Argo CD Release]
```

Build Process Description:

1.  **Developer:** Developers commit code changes to the Argo CD GitHub repository.
2.  **GitHub Repository:** The central repository for Argo CD source code.
3.  **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD pipelines triggered by events in the GitHub repository (e.g., push, pull request).
4.  **Build (Make):** The `make` command is used to compile the code, build binaries, and generate necessary artifacts.
5.  **Test (Unit, Integration):** Unit and integration tests are executed to ensure code quality and functionality.
6.  **Build Docker Images:** Dockerfiles are used to build container images for the various Argo CD components (API server, application controller, repo server).
7.  **Push to Image Registry:** The built container images are pushed to a container image registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Quay.io).
8.  **Argo CD Release:** New releases of Argo CD are created based on the built artifacts and container images.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: GitHub Actions workflows are defined in code and version-controlled, providing an audit trail.
*   security control: Use of signed commits in the Git repository.
*   security control: Automated testing (unit, integration) to identify bugs and vulnerabilities early.
*   security control: Use of minimal Docker base images to reduce the attack surface.
*   security control: Dependency management to track and update third-party libraries.
*   security control: Static analysis (linters, code quality checks) integrated into the build process.
*   security control: Secrets management (e.g., API keys, credentials) handled securely within GitHub Actions.
*   security control: Image signing (optional, but recommended) to ensure image integrity.
*   security control: Vulnerability scanning of container images (optional, but recommended) before pushing to the registry.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Continuous Delivery of Applications: Argo CD is critical for automating and managing the deployment of applications to Kubernetes clusters. Any disruption to Argo CD can impact the ability to deploy new features, bug fixes, and security updates.
*   Application Management: Argo CD provides a central point of control for managing application configurations and deployments. Compromise of Argo CD could lead to unauthorized changes to applications.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Application Configurations (Low to High Sensitivity): Git repositories managed by Argo CD contain application configurations, which may include sensitive information such as database connection strings, API keys, and other secrets. The sensitivity depends on how secrets are managed (e.g., using Kubernetes Secrets, external secrets management solutions).
*   Kubernetes Credentials (High Sensitivity): Argo CD requires credentials to access Kubernetes clusters. These credentials must be protected to prevent unauthorized access to the clusters.
*   User Credentials (High Sensitivity): User credentials used to authenticate with Argo CD must be protected to prevent unauthorized access to the system.
*   Audit Logs (Medium Sensitivity): Audit logs contain information about user actions and system events, which can be valuable for security investigations.
*   Application Data (Varies): The sensitivity of application data depends on the specific applications being deployed. Argo CD itself does not directly handle application data, but it manages the deployment of applications that may process sensitive data.
