# Attack Surface Analysis for argoproj/argo-cd

## Attack Surface: [SSO Integration Weaknesses (Identity Spoofing/Account Takeover)](./attack_surfaces/sso_integration_weaknesses__identity_spoofingaccount_takeover_.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in Argo CD's *implementation* of SSO integration (OIDC, SAML, etc.) allow attackers to impersonate legitimate users or gain unauthorized access. This focuses on how Argo CD *handles* the SSO process, not vulnerabilities in the SSO provider itself.
*   **How Argo CD Contributes:** Argo CD's logic for processing claims, validating tokens, and mapping users to roles is the critical area. Misconfigurations or bugs *within Argo CD* in this process are the vulnerability.
*   **Example:** Argo CD fails to properly validate the `aud` (audience) claim in a JWT, allowing an attacker to use a token intended for a different service to gain access to Argo CD. Or, Argo CD has a bug in its claim mapping logic, granting a user with a "developer" claim administrative privileges.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over Argo CD, ability to deploy malicious applications, modify configurations, and access sensitive data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough SSO Configuration Review (Argo CD Side):** Focus specifically on Argo CD's configuration:
        *   **Claim Mapping:** *Meticulously* verify that claims from the SSO provider are *correctly* mapped to Argo CD roles and permissions. Test edge cases.
        *   **Scope Validation:** Ensure Argo CD requests *only* the necessary scopes and *validates* the returned scopes.
        *   **Audience Restriction:** Ensure Argo CD *strictly* enforces audience validation, rejecting tokens not intended for it.
    *   **Strong Secrets (Argo CD Side):** Use strong, unique secrets for Argo CD's interaction with the SSO provider.
    *   **Regular Audits (Argo CD Configuration):** Periodically audit Argo CD's SSO configuration, *not just the provider's*.
    *   **Code Review (if custom integrations):** If any custom code interacts with the SSO process, perform rigorous code reviews.
    *   **Short-Lived Tokens and Refresh Handling:** Ensure Argo CD is configured to handle short-lived tokens and refresh tokens securely, including proper validation of refresh tokens.

## Attack Surface: [API Token Exposure/Leakage](./attack_surfaces/api_token_exposureleakage.md)

*   **Description:** Argo CD API tokens, used for programmatic access, are accidentally exposed or leaked. This is a direct risk because Argo CD *generates and manages* these tokens.
*   **How Argo CD Contributes:** Argo CD is responsible for the security of the API tokens it issues. The vulnerability lies in how these tokens are handled and stored *after* creation by Argo CD.
*   **Example:** An API token is accidentally committed to a public Git repository, or it's exposed in CI/CD logs. An attacker discovers the token and uses it to deploy a malicious application.  The root cause is the insecure handling of the token *after* Argo CD created it.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over Argo CD, ability to deploy malicious applications, modify configurations, and access sensitive data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Token Storage:** *Never* store API tokens in code repositories or configuration files. Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).  This is the primary mitigation.
    *   **Token Rotation:** Regularly rotate API tokens to limit the impact of a potential leak.  Argo CD should facilitate this.
    *   **Least Privilege (Token Scope):** Create API tokens with the *minimum* necessary permissions. Argo CD's RBAC system should be used to enforce this. Avoid using highly privileged tokens for routine tasks.
    *   **Monitoring (Argo CD API Usage):** Monitor Argo CD's API usage for suspicious activity, such as unusual requests or access from unexpected locations. Argo CD should provide audit logs for this.
    *   **CI/CD Security (Token Handling):** Secure CI/CD pipelines to prevent accidental exposure of secrets. Use dedicated secret management features provided by the CI/CD platform, and ensure they integrate securely with Argo CD.

## Attack Surface: [RBAC Misconfiguration (Privilege Escalation)](./attack_surfaces/rbac_misconfiguration__privilege_escalation_.md)

*   **Description:** Argo CD's internal Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies are misconfigured, granting users more privileges than intended *within Argo CD*.
*   **How Argo CD Contributes:** This is entirely within Argo CD's control. The vulnerability is in the *definition and enforcement* of RBAC policies *within Argo CD itself*.
*   **Example:** A user is granted the `applications, update` permission within a project when they should only have `applications, get`. They can then modify application configurations and potentially deploy malicious code *through Argo CD*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources within Argo CD, ability to modify configurations, potential deployment of malicious applications *via Argo CD*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the *absolute minimum* necessary permissions within Argo CD to perform their tasks.
    *   **Regular RBAC Audits (Argo CD Policies):** Periodically review and audit Argo CD's RBAC policies to ensure they are correctly configured and aligned with security requirements. This is a critical, ongoing task.
    *   **Use Built-in Roles (where appropriate):** Prefer using Argo CD's built-in roles whenever possible, as these are generally well-defined.
    *   **Careful Custom Role Definition:** If custom roles are necessary, define them *very* carefully and test them *thoroughly* against a test instance of Argo CD.
    *   **Deny-by-Default:** Start with a "deny-by-default" approach within Argo CD, explicitly granting access only where absolutely needed.
    *   **Testing (Argo CD RBAC):** Thoroughly test RBAC policies *within Argo CD* to ensure they function as intended and prevent unintended access. Use a dedicated test environment.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Argo CD or its Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_argo_cd_or_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Unpatched vulnerabilities in Argo CD itself or the libraries it *directly* uses are exploited by attackers.
*   **How Argo CD Contributes:** This is inherent to any software. Argo CD's codebase and its chosen dependencies are the direct source of this risk.
*   **Example:** A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability is discovered in a library used by Argo CD's API server. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain control of the Argo CD server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, complete system compromise *of the Argo CD instance*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Argo CD Updated:** Regularly update Argo CD to the *latest stable version* to receive security patches. This is the most important mitigation.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to Argo CD's security advisories and mailing lists to stay informed about new vulnerabilities.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use an SCA tool to identify and track Argo CD's dependencies and their associated vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning (Argo CD Deployment):** Regularly run vulnerability scans against the *deployed Argo CD instance* itself.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management system to ensure that Argo CD's dependencies are up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities.
