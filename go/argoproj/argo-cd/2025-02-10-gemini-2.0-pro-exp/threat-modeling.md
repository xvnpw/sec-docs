# Threat Model Analysis for argoproj/argo-cd

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection into Git Repository (Compromised Developer Account, leveraged by Argo CD)](./threats/malicious_code_injection_into_git_repository__compromised_developer_account__leveraged_by_argo_cd_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains write access to a Git repository that Argo CD is configured to synchronize from.  The attacker injects malicious code or modifies application manifests.  Argo CD *automatically* applies these malicious changes to the Kubernetes cluster, as it's designed to enforce the state defined in Git. This is distinct from a general Git compromise because Argo CD *amplifies* the impact by automatically deploying the malicious changes.
*   **Impact:** Deployment of malicious code, potential for complete cluster compromise, data breaches, denial of service.  Argo CD's automation makes this rapid and widespread.
*   **Affected Component:** Argo CD Application Controller (sync process), Argo CD Repo Server (manifest generation), Kubernetes Cluster (through Argo CD's actions).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong authentication (MFA) and authorization for all Git repository access.
    *   Implement mandatory code review and approval processes (pull requests) with multiple reviewers.
    *   Use branch protection rules in the Git provider (e.g., require approvals, status checks).
    *   Implement Git commit signing.
    *   Use a GitOps workflow that requires *manual approval* for deployments to production environments, *even with Argo CD*. This breaks the fully automated chain, providing a human checkpoint.
    *   Integrate SAST and SCA tools into the CI/CD pipeline *before* Argo CD syncs.
    *   Use image signing and verification.

## Threat: [Argo CD RBAC Misconfiguration (Excessive Permissions)](./threats/argo_cd_rbac_misconfiguration__excessive_permissions_.md)

*   **Description:** Argo CD's own internal RBAC is misconfigured.  A user or service account within Argo CD is granted more permissions than necessary.  This allows an attacker (or a compromised/malicious user) to use Argo CD's interface or API to make unauthorized changes to applications, deploy to restricted namespaces, or access sensitive data *through Argo CD*. This is specific to Argo CD's internal authorization mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to applications and data managed *by Argo CD*, potential for cluster compromise (if Argo CD's service account is also overly permissive), disruption of services.
*   **Affected Component:** Argo CD API Server (RBAC enforcement).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement the principle of least privilege *within Argo CD*: Grant users and service accounts only the minimum necessary permissions *within the Argo CD system*.
    *   Regularly audit and review Argo CD's RBAC configurations.
    *   Use Argo CD's built-in RBAC features (roles, policies, groups) effectively. Define granular roles.
    *   Avoid using the default `admin` account for regular operations.
    *   Test RBAC configurations thoroughly.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Argo CD Vulnerability (Zero-Day or Unpatched)](./threats/exploitation_of_argo_cd_vulnerability__zero-day_or_unpatched_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within Argo CD itself* (e.g., in the API Server, Application Controller, or Repo Server). This is a direct attack on the Argo CD software.  The vulnerability could allow for remote code execution within the Argo CD components, privilege escalation within Argo CD, or denial of service specifically targeting Argo CD.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of *Argo CD*, potential for cluster compromise (depending on Argo CD's service account permissions), data breaches, denial of service *of Argo CD*.
*   **Affected Component:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (Argo CD API Server, Application Controller, Repo Server).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Argo CD to the latest stable version.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE) specifically for Argo CD.
    *   Implement a robust vulnerability management process.
    *   Consider using a WAF to protect the Argo CD API Server (but this won't protect against all vulnerabilities).
    *   Run Argo CD with the least privileged Kubernetes service account possible (this limits the blast radius if Argo CD *is* compromised).

## Threat: [Malicious Application Manifest (Unvalidated Input, deployed by Argo CD)](./threats/malicious_application_manifest__unvalidated_input__deployed_by_argo_cd_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious application manifest (e.g., a Helm chart or Kustomize configuration).  Argo CD, *without performing sufficient validation*, deploys this manifest to the Kubernetes cluster. The malicious manifest might exploit vulnerabilities in the target application or in Kubernetes itself.  The threat is amplified because Argo CD is the mechanism of deployment.
*   **Impact:** Deployment of a compromised application, potential for privilege escalation within the cluster, data breaches.  Argo CD's automation speeds up the deployment of the malicious manifest.
*   **Affected Component:** Argo CD Application Controller (sync process), Argo CD Repo Server (manifest rendering).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use tools like `kubeval`, `kube-linter`, `conftest`, or `gator` to validate Kubernetes manifests *before* Argo CD deploys them. Integrate these tools into the CI/CD pipeline *upstream* of Argo CD.
    *   Implement policies to enforce specific configuration standards.
    *   Use Helm charts or Kustomize configurations from trusted sources.
    *   Regularly scan deployed applications for vulnerabilities (this is a reactive measure, but still important).

## Threat: [Sidecar Injection into Argo CD Pods](./threats/sidecar_injection_into_argo_cd_pods.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges within the Kubernetes cluster modifies the pod specifications for Argo CD components (API Server, Application Controller, Repo Server) to inject a malicious sidecar container. This is a direct attack on the running Argo CD instances.
*   **Impact:** The malicious sidecar could intercept network traffic *to and from Argo CD*, steal credentials *used by Argo CD*, modify Argo CD's behavior, or exfiltrate data *managed by Argo CD*.
*   **Affected Component:** All Argo CD components (API Server, Application Controller, Repo Server) - the attack targets the running pods.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly control access to modify pod specifications using Kubernetes RBAC.
    *   Use Pod Security Policies (PSP) or Pod Security Admission (PSA) to restrict the capabilities of containers and prevent unauthorized sidecar injection.
    *   Implement runtime security monitoring tools (e.g., Falco, Sysdig Secure) to detect malicious sidecar injections and other suspicious container behavior *in real-time*.
    *   Use network policies to restrict communication between Argo CD pods and other pods in the cluster.

## Threat: [Insecure Communication between Argo CD Components](./threats/insecure_communication_between_argo_cd_components.md)

* **Description:** Communication between Argo CD components (e.g., API Server and Application Controller) is not encrypted or authenticated. This allows an attacker with network access to intercept or modify traffic *internal to Argo CD*.
* **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks against Argo CD's internal communication, data leakage of Argo CD's internal state, unauthorized modification of Argo CD's configuration or behavior.
* **Affected Component:** Communication channels between Argo CD API Server, Application Controller, and Repo Server.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use TLS encryption for *all* communication between Argo CD components.
    *   Use mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication to verify the identity of each Argo CD component.
    *   Configure network policies to restrict communication to only the necessary ports and protocols *within the Argo CD deployment*.
