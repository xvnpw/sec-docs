# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for argoproj/argo-cd

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict RBAC Implementation (Argo CD's RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_rbac_implementation__argo_cd's_rbac_.md)

*   **1. Strict RBAC Implementation (Argo CD's RBAC)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Roles:** Define clear roles within your team (e.g., Developer, Operator, Security Admin, Auditor).
        2.  **Map Permissions:** For each role, identify the *minimum* Argo CD permissions required. Use the Argo CD documentation to understand the specific actions allowed by each permission (`get`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `sync`, `override`, etc.) on each resource type (Applications, Projects, Repositories, Clusters, etc.).
        3.  **Create Argo CD Policies:** Define Argo CD policies (using the `policy.csv` file or the UI) that map roles to permissions.  Example:
            ```
            p, role:developer, applications, get, my-project/*, allow
            p, role:developer, applications, sync, my-project/*, allow
            p, role:operator, applications, *, my-project/*, allow
            g, alice, role:developer
            g, bob, role:operator
            ```
        4.  **Integrate with SSO/OIDC:** Configure Argo CD to authenticate users via your SSO/OIDC provider.  Map groups from your identity provider to Argo CD roles.  This ensures centralized user management.
        5.  **Regular Review:** Schedule recurring reviews (e.g., quarterly) of the RBAC configuration.  Use scripts to compare the current configuration with a known-good baseline.
        6.  **Test:** Thoroughly test the RBAC configuration by having users with different roles attempt various actions within Argo CD.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** (Severity: High) - Prevents users from accessing or modifying resources they shouldn't.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** (Severity: High) - Limits the ability of a compromised user account to gain higher privileges within Argo CD.
        *   **Accidental Misconfiguration:** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the risk of users accidentally making changes that could disrupt deployments.
        *   **Insider Threats:** (Severity: Medium) - Limits the damage a malicious insider can do.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced.  Users are restricted to their defined permissions.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced.  Attackers cannot easily elevate their privileges.
        *   **Accidental Misconfiguration:** Risk reduced.  Fewer users have permission to make critical changes.
        *   **Insider Threats:** Risk reduced.  The scope of potential damage is limited.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic RBAC policies defined in `policy.csv`.
        *   SSO integration with Okta is configured.
        *   Group mapping from Okta to Argo CD roles is partially implemented (only for developers).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No regular, automated review of RBAC policies.
        *   Group mapping is not implemented for all roles (e.g., operators, security admins).
        *   Testing of RBAC configuration is ad-hoc, not systematic.
        *   No project-level permissions are defined; all permissions are currently global.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Secrets (Argo CD's Secret Management)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_secrets__argo_cd's_secret_management_.md)

*   **2. Secure Handling of Secrets (Argo CD's Secret Management)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Choose a Secrets Manager:** Select a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        2.  **Install and Configure Plugin:** Install the appropriate Argo CD plugin for your chosen secrets manager (e.g., Argo CD Vault Plugin). Configure the plugin with the necessary credentials and connection details *within Argo CD*.
        3.  **Define Secret Paths:** Determine the paths within your secrets manager where secrets will be stored.  Use a consistent naming convention.
        4.  **Modify Application Manifests:** Update your Kubernetes manifests (or Helm charts, Kustomize files) to reference secrets using the plugin's syntax.  Example (using Argo CD Vault Plugin):
            ```yaml
            apiVersion: v1
            kind: Secret
            metadata:
              name: my-secret
              annotations:
                vault.argocd.argoproj.io/secret-path: secret/my-app/database-password
            type: Opaque
            data:
              password: <placeholder>  # This will be replaced by the plugin
            ```
        5.  **Configure Argo CD Service Account:** Ensure the service account used by Argo CD has the necessary permissions to read secrets from your secrets manager.  Use the principle of least privilege. This is often done *outside* of Argo CD, but the configuration *within* the manifests is key.
        6. **Test:** Deploy a test application that uses secrets and verify that the secrets are correctly injected via Argo CD.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Secret Exposure:** (Severity: High) - Prevents secrets from being stored in plain text in Git repositories or Argo CD's configuration.
        *   **Credential Theft:** (Severity: High) - Reduces the risk of attackers stealing credentials.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** (Severity: High) - Protects sensitive data accessed by applications.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Secret Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced. Secrets are stored securely in a dedicated secrets manager.
        *   **Credential Theft:** Risk significantly reduced. Attackers cannot easily obtain credentials.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** Risk significantly reduced. Access to sensitive data is controlled.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   HashiCorp Vault is used as the secrets manager.
        *   The Argo CD Vault Plugin is installed and configured.
        *   Some application manifests are updated to use the plugin.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Not all application manifests have been updated to use the plugin.  Some secrets are still stored in Git (encrypted with SOPS, but this is less secure).
        *   The Argo CD service account has broader permissions to Vault than necessary.
        *   No testing procedure to verify secret injection.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration of Argo CD components](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_of_argo_cd_components.md)

*   **3. Secure Configuration of Argo CD components:**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Disable Default Admin:** After setting up SSO/OIDC, disable the default `admin` user *within Argo CD's configuration*.
        2.  **Secure Redis:**
            *   If using the bundled Redis, change the default password *immediately* via Argo CD's configuration.
            *   Consider using an external, managed Redis service.
        3.  **API Server TLS:** Ensure that the Argo CD API server is configured to use TLS (HTTPS) with a valid certificate *within Argo CD's configuration*.
        4. **Regular Updates:** Keep Argo CD and its components up-to-date via Argo CD deployments to patch security vulnerabilities.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access (Argo CD Components):** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from accessing or compromising Argo CD's internal components.
        *   **Data Breach (Redis):** (Severity: Medium) - Protects sensitive data stored in Redis (e.g., session tokens).
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** (Severity: High) - TLS protects against eavesdropping on API communication.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access (Argo CD Components):** Risk significantly reduced.  Access to components is restricted.
        *   **Data Breach (Redis):** Risk reduced.  Redis is secured with a strong password.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.  TLS encrypts communication.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Argo CD API server is configured with TLS.
        *    Argo CD is regularly updated.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The default `admin` user is still enabled.
        *   The bundled Redis is used with the default password.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitoring and Alerting (Argo CD Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/monitoring_and_alerting__argo_cd_specific_.md)

*   **4. Monitoring and Alerting (Argo CD Specific):**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Enable Prometheus Metrics:** Ensure Argo CD is configured to expose its metrics in Prometheus format (usually enabled by default).
        2. **Audit Logs:** Enable Argo CD's audit logs *within Argo CD's configuration*.
        3. **Application Health Monitoring:** Integrate application health checks into your deployments and monitor them *through Argo CD*. Use Argo CD's health checks to ensure applications are running as expected.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Undetected Security Incidents:** (Severity: Medium) - Provides early warning of potential security issues.
        *   **Performance Degradation:** (Severity: Medium) - Helps identify performance bottlenecks.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: Medium) - Alerts on resource usage approaching limits.
        *   **Unauthorized Activity:** (Severity: Medium) - Audit logs provide a record of all actions performed within Argo CD.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Undetected Security Incidents:** Risk reduced.  Alerts provide timely notification of potential problems.
        *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduced.  Performance issues can be identified and addressed quickly.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced.  Alerts allow for proactive resource management.
        *   **Unauthorized Activity:** Risk reduced.  Audit logs provide a trail for investigation.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Prometheus is configured to scrape Argo CD metrics.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Audit logs are not enabled.
        *   Application health monitoring is not consistently implemented.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration as Code (GitOps for Argo CD)](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_as_code__gitops_for_argo_cd_.md)

* **5. Configuration as Code (GitOps for Argo CD)**

    * **Description:**
        1.  **Create a Git Repository:** Create a dedicated Git repository to store your Argo CD configuration (projects, applications, RBAC policies).
        2.  **Define Configuration as Code:**  Use YAML files to define your Argo CD configuration.  Example:
            ```yaml
            # argocd-project.yaml
            apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
            kind: AppProject
            metadata:
              name: my-project
            spec:
              sourceRepos:
              - 'https://github.com/my-org/my-repo'
              destinations:
              - namespace: my-app
                server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
              # ... other project settings ...
            ```
        3.  **Deploy Argo CD Itself with Argo CD:**  Use Argo CD to deploy and manage its *own* configuration from this Git repository. This is known as "bootstrapping" or "managing Argo CD with Argo CD."
        4.  **Implement Change Control:**  Use pull requests and code reviews to manage changes to your Argo CD configuration.
        5.  **Automated Synchronization:**  Configure Argo CD to automatically synchronize its configuration from the Git repository.
        6. **Rollback Capability:** Leverage Git's version history and Argo CD's sync history to easily roll back to a previous, known-good configuration if necessary.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Configuration Drift:** (Severity: Medium) - Ensures that the actual Argo CD configuration matches the desired state defined in Git.
        *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents unauthorized modifications to Argo CD's configuration.
        *   **Accidental Misconfiguration:** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the risk of errors when making configuration changes.
        *   **Difficult Rollbacks:** (Severity: Medium) - Makes it easy to revert to a previous configuration.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Configuration Drift:** Risk significantly reduced.  Argo CD's configuration is continuously synchronized with Git.
        *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** Risk reduced.  Changes are tracked and reviewed through Git.
        *   **Accidental Misconfiguration:** Risk reduced.  Changes are made through a controlled process (pull requests, code reviews).
        *   **Difficult Rollbacks:** Risk significantly reduced.  Git and Argo CD provide a version history for easy rollbacks.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   None

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Argo CD's configuration is not managed as code.
        *   Changes to Argo CD's configuration are made directly through the UI or CLI.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits within Argo CD manifests](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_within_argo_cd_manifests.md)

* **6. Resource Limits within Argo CD manifests**
    * **Description:**
        1.  **Argo CD Resource Limits:**
            *   Edit the Argo CD deployment manifests (e.g., `argocd-server`, `argocd-repo-server`, `argocd-application-controller`) *that are managed by Argo CD*.
            *   Set resource requests and limits for CPU and memory for each container.  Start with reasonable values and adjust based on monitoring. Example:
                ```yaml
                resources:
                  requests:
                    cpu: 100m
                    memory: 256Mi
                  limits:
                    cpu: 500m
                    memory: 1Gi
                ```
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (Argo CD):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents Argo CD components from being overwhelmed.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents applications from consuming excessive resources.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (Argo CD):** Risk reduced. Argo CD components are protected from resource exhaustion.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced. Resource usage is controlled.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   None

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No resource limits are configured for Argo CD components.
