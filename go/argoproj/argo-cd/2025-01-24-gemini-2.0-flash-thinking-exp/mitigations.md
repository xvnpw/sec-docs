## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Argo CD](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__within_argo_cd.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Argo CD.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Roles:** Identify different user roles interacting with Argo CD (e.g., administrators, developers, operators, read-only users).
    2.  **Create Argo CD Roles:**  In Argo CD, create roles using `Role` and `RoleBinding` resources.
    3.  **Grant Permissions:** Define granular permissions for each role using Argo CD's RBAC policy language, restricting access to necessary resources and actions (e.g., `applications:get,list,watch,create,update,delete`, `projects:get,list,watch`, `clusters:get,list,watch`, `*:*`).
    4.  **Assign Roles to Users/Groups:** Bind Argo CD roles to users or groups from your identity provider using `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding`.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Audit:** Periodically review RBAC policies and monitor audit logs for unauthorized access attempts.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access and modification of Argo CD resources.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Limits damage from compromised accounts by restricting privileges.
    *   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk from malicious internal actions by limiting access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Significant risk reduction.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Significant risk reduction.
    *   **Insider Threats:** Moderate risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. RBAC is enabled with basic admin/developer roles defined in `argocd-rbac-cm.yaml` and `argocd-server` deployment.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Granular roles for operators/read-only users are missing. Integration with central IdP for group-based roles is not configured. Formal RBAC policy reviews are needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Integrate with Enterprise Identity Providers (IdP)](./mitigation_strategies/integrate_with_enterprise_identity_providers__idp_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Integrate Argo CD with Enterprise Identity Providers (IdP).
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose IdP:** Select a compatible IdP (OIDC, SAML, LDAP).
    2.  **Configure Argo CD Authentication:** Configure Argo CD server to authenticate against the IdP by setting up OIDC, SAML, or LDAP configurations in `argocd-cm.yaml` ConfigMap (e.g., `oidc.issuer`, `oidc.clientID`, `oidc.clientSecret`, `oidc.scopes`).
    3.  **Map IdP Groups to Argo CD Roles (Optional/Recommended):** Map IdP groups to Argo CD roles using `policy.default` and `policy.csv` in `argocd-rbac-cm.yaml` for centralized group-based policies.
    4.  **Test Integration:** Verify user authentication via IdP and correct role assignments.
    5.  **Disable Local Accounts (Optional/Recommended):** Disable local Argo CD accounts after IdP integration is verified.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Weak Password Security (Medium Severity):** Reduces reliance on potentially weaker local Argo CD passwords.
    *   **Account Management Overhead (Low Severity):** Simplifies user management via centralized IdP.
    *   **Lack of Centralized Audit (Medium Severity):** Enables centralized auditing of Argo CD access through IdP logs.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Weak Password Security:** Moderate risk reduction.
    *   **Account Management Overhead:** Minor risk reduction.
    *   **Lack of Centralized Audit:** Moderate risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Argo CD uses local accounts and basic authentication.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Configuration for OIDC integration with the organization's IdP is missing, including OIDC group mapping to Argo CD roles.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_multi-factor_authentication__mfa_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Argo CD users.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable MFA in IdP (Recommended):** Enable MFA in the integrated IdP for Argo CD users, leveraging IdP's MFA enforcement.
    2.  **Configure Argo CD for MFA (Local Accounts - Discouraged):** If using local accounts (not recommended), configure Argo CD for MFA using a provider like TOTP.
    3.  **Educate Users:** Train users on MFA importance and setup.
    4.  **Regularly Review MFA Enforcement:** Ensure consistent MFA enforcement, especially for admins and privileged users.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Compromise (High Severity):** Significantly reduces risk of unauthorized access from compromised usernames/passwords.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Compromise:** Significant risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. MFA is not enforced for Argo CD access.
*   **Missing Implementation:** MFA needs to be enabled in the organization's IdP and Argo CD integration configured to use IdP-enforced MFA. Local account MFA configuration is not recommended but would be needed if local accounts were used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Argo CD's Cluster-Admin Privileges](./mitigation_strategies/limit_argo_cd's_cluster-admin_privileges.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit Argo CD's Cluster-Admin Privileges.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Namespace-Scoped Installation (Recommended):** Install Argo CD in a dedicated namespace (e.g., `argocd`).
    2.  **Create Dedicated Service Account:** Create a minimal Kubernetes Service Account for Argo CD.
    3.  **Grant Namespace-Specific RBAC:** Grant custom `Role` and `RoleBinding` within target namespaces instead of `cluster-admin`. Provide only necessary permissions (e.g., `create`, `get`, `list`, `update`, `delete`, `patch` for deployments, services, etc.).
    4.  **Avoid Cluster-Wide Resources (Where Possible):** Minimize Argo CD's need for cluster-wide resource management. Scope permissions carefully if needed.
    5.  **Regularly Review Permissions:** Periodically review Argo CD's Service Account permissions.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised Argo CD Instance (High Severity):** Limits the impact of a compromised Argo CD instance to namespace-scoped permissions.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk of cluster-wide damage from Argo CD misconfigurations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised Argo CD Instance:** Significant risk reduction.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration:** Moderate risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Argo CD is in a dedicated namespace (`argocd`), but currently uses a cluster-admin Service Account.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Creation of a least-privilege Service Account for Argo CD is needed. Namespace-specific RBAC roles/bindings for target namespaces must be configured, and cluster-admin privileges removed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Integrate with Secure Secret Management Solutions](./mitigation_strategies/integrate_with_secure_secret_management_solutions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Integrate Argo CD with Secure Secret Management Solutions.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Secret Management Solution:** Select a solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager, Kubernetes Secrets Store CSI driver).
    2.  **Configure Argo CD Integration:** Configure Argo CD to use the chosen solution. This involves installing plugins/controllers (e.g., for Vault, Sealed Secrets), configuring Argo CD to retrieve secrets, and using secret management mechanisms in manifests (e.g., Kustomize secret generators, Helm value files).
    3.  **Migrate Secrets:** Migrate secrets from Git/insecure storage to the secret management solution.
    4.  **Enforce Secret Rotation:** Implement secret rotation within the solution.
    5.  **Audit Secret Access:** Enable auditing in the solution and Argo CD to track secret access.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Secrets Exposure in Git (High Severity):** Eliminates storing secrets in Git.
    *   **Unencrypted Secrets Storage (High Severity):** Ensures secure, encrypted secret storage.
    *   **Stale Secrets (Medium Severity):** Facilitates secret rotation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Secrets Exposure in Git:** Significant risk reduction.
    *   **Unencrypted Secrets Storage:** Significant risk reduction.
    *   **Stale Secrets:** Moderate risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Secrets are managed as Kubernetes Secrets, sometimes in manifests or basic Kustomize generators, without dedicated secret management.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Selection/deployment of a secret management solution is needed. Argo CD integration must be configured. Secret migration and rotation implementation are also required.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Argo CD is updated periodically, but without a strict schedule or active security advisory monitoring.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal update schedule/process are missing. Active security advisory monitoring and automated updates are not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor Argo CD Components](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_argo_cd_components.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Monitor Argo CD Components.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Monitoring:** Enable monitoring for Argo CD components (`argocd-server`, `argocd-repo-server`, `argocd-application-controller`) using Prometheus metrics.
    2.  **Set Up Dashboards:** Create dashboards (e.g., Grafana) visualizing key metrics: resource utilization, API latency/errors, sync status/errors, component health.
    3.  **Configure Alerts:** Set up alerts for critical events: high resource usage, API errors, failed syncs, component restarts/crashes.
    4.  **Log Analysis:** Regularly review Argo CD logs for errors, warnings, suspicious activity. Integrate logs with a centralized system.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Detects resource exhaustion/performance issues in Argo CD.
    *   **Component Failures (Medium Severity):** Identifies component instability disrupting deployments.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic Prometheus metrics are collected from Argo CD components.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive dashboards and alerting are not fully configured. Log analysis and centralized logging integration are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Policies for Argo CD Components](./mitigation_strategies/network_policies_for_argo_cd_components.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Network Policies for Argo CD Components.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Network Policies:** Create Kubernetes Network Policies to restrict traffic to/from Argo CD components.
    2.  **Default Deny Policy (Recommended):** Start with a default deny policy for the Argo CD namespace.
    3.  **Allow Necessary Traffic:** Allow specific traffic: ingress to `argocd-server` from authorized networks, egress from `argocd-server` to target clusters, egress from `argocd-repo-server` to Git, internal Argo CD component communication.
    4.  **Test Network Policies:** Test policies to ensure correct configuration and no disruption.
    5.  **Regularly Review Policies:** Periodically review Network Policies.
