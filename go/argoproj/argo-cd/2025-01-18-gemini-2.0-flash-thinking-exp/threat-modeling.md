# Threat Model Analysis for argoproj/argo-cd

## Threat: [Compromised Git Credentials](./threats/compromised_git_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the credentials used *by Argo CD* to authenticate to Git repositories. This could happen through exploiting vulnerabilities in Argo CD's secret storage or insecure configuration of Argo CD. The attacker could then modify application manifests within the Git repository, which Argo CD would then deploy.

**Impact:** Malicious application deployments, introduction of vulnerabilities or backdoors into deployed applications, potential data breaches if sensitive information is exposed through the modified manifests, disruption of the deployment process.

**Affected Component:**
*   Repo Server (responsible for fetching and processing Git repository data using the stored credentials).
*   Settings/Secrets Management (where Git credentials are stored within Argo CD).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store Git credentials securely using Argo CD's built-in secret management with encryption at rest.
*   Consider using external secrets managers (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) integrated with Argo CD.
*   Implement the principle of least privilege for Git credentials within Argo CD's configuration.
*   Regularly rotate Git credentials used by Argo CD.
*   Monitor access logs for suspicious activity related to Git credentials within Argo CD.

## Threat: [Compromised Kubernetes Credentials](./threats/compromised_kubernetes_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the credentials used *by Argo CD* to authenticate to Kubernetes clusters. This could occur through exploiting vulnerabilities in Argo CD's secret storage or insecure configuration of Argo CD. The attacker could then directly manipulate Kubernetes resources *through Argo CD*.

**Impact:** Deployment of arbitrary workloads (including malicious containers) *via Argo CD*, unauthorized access to sensitive data within the Kubernetes cluster *through Argo CD's access*, modification or deletion of existing deployments and resources *managed by Argo CD*, potential cluster takeover *if Argo CD's credentials are overly permissive*, denial of service.

**Affected Component:**
*   Application Controller (responsible for deploying and managing applications in Kubernetes using the stored credentials).
*   Settings/Cluster Management (where Kubernetes cluster connection details are stored within Argo CD).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store Kubernetes cluster credentials securely using Argo CD's built-in secret management with encryption at rest.
*   Consider using workload identity or similar mechanisms to avoid storing long-lived credentials *within Argo CD*.
*   Implement the principle of least privilege for Argo CD's Kubernetes access using RBAC *within Argo CD's configuration*.
*   Regularly rotate Kubernetes credentials used by Argo CD.
*   Monitor Kubernetes audit logs for suspicious activity originating from Argo CD's service account.

## Threat: [Exploiting Argo CD API Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_argo_cd_api_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits vulnerabilities in the Argo CD API (e.g., authentication bypass, authorization flaws, remote code execution). This allows them to perform unauthorized actions *within Argo CD*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to Argo CD functionalities, including managing applications, accessing secrets stored within Argo CD, modifying Argo CD settings, potentially leading to malicious deployments or data breaches *orchestrated through Argo CD*.

**Affected Component:**
*   API Server (handles API requests and authentication/authorization).
*   UI (if the vulnerability is related to the frontend interacting with the API).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Argo CD updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for the Argo CD API (e.g., using Dex for OIDC integration).
*   Enforce network policies to restrict access to the Argo CD API.
*   Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing of the Argo CD deployment.
*   Implement rate limiting and input validation on the API endpoints.

## Threat: [Malicious Manifests via Supply Chain Attack](./threats/malicious_manifests_via_supply_chain_attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency or a tool used in the generation or storage of application manifests *that Argo CD subsequently deploys*. This results in malicious manifests being deployed *by Argo CD*.

**Impact:** Deployment of compromised applications *by Argo CD*, introduction of vulnerabilities or backdoors, potential data breaches, disruption of services.

**Affected Component:**
*   Repo Server (fetches and processes the malicious manifests).
*   Application Controller (deploys the applications based on the malicious manifests).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong security practices for managing dependencies and build pipelines *that feed into Argo CD*.
*   Use tools like Sigstore (cosign, Rekor) to sign and verify the integrity of container images and other artifacts *deployed by Argo CD*.
*   Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities *before they are deployed by Argo CD*.
*   Implement controls to verify the integrity and authenticity of manifest generation tools and processes *used in conjunction with Argo CD*.

## Threat: [Secrets Exposure through Argo CD UI or API](./threats/secrets_exposure_through_argo_cd_ui_or_api.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, is inadvertently exposed through the Argo CD UI or API, either due to a bug *within Argo CD* or misconfiguration *of Argo CD*.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to external services or databases, potential compromise of other systems.

**Affected Component:**
*   UI (if secrets are displayed without proper masking or redaction).
*   API Server (if API responses inadvertently expose secrets).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure secrets are properly masked or redacted in the Argo CD UI and API responses.
*   Avoid logging sensitive information *within Argo CD components*.
*   Use Argo CD's built-in secret management or external secrets managers to handle sensitive data.
*   Regularly review Argo CD's code and configuration for potential secret exposure vulnerabilities.
