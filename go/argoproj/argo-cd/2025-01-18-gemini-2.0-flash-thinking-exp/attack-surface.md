# Attack Surface Analysis for argoproj/argo-cd

## Attack Surface: [Web UI Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/web_ui_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

**Description:**  An attacker injects malicious scripts into the Argo CD web interface, which are then executed by other users' browsers.

**How Argo CD Contributes:** Argo CD's dynamic UI, which displays information about applications, deployments, and configurations fetched from various sources, can be vulnerable if input sanitization is insufficient.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious application name or description in a Git repository that, when rendered in the Argo CD UI, executes JavaScript to steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user.

**Impact:** Account compromise, unauthorized actions within Argo CD (e.g., triggering deployments, modifying configurations), information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding within the Argo CD codebase.
*   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
*   Regularly update Argo CD to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [API Server Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/api_server_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker bypasses the authentication or authorization mechanisms of the Argo CD API server to gain unauthorized access to its functionalities.

**How Argo CD Contributes:** Argo CD's API server is the central point for managing applications, deployments, and configurations. Vulnerabilities here grant significant control.

**Example:** A flaw in the API's authentication logic allows an attacker to forge authentication tokens or exploit weaknesses in the authorization checks to access or modify resources they shouldn't.

**Impact:** Complete control over Argo CD, including the ability to deploy malicious applications, modify existing deployments, and access sensitive information.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., SSO/OIDC) for accessing the Argo CD API.
*   Implement robust and granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Argo CD.
*   Regularly audit and review API access policies within Argo CD.
*   Keep Argo CD updated to patch known authentication and authorization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Git Repository Credential Compromise](./attack_surfaces/git_repository_credential_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the credentials Argo CD uses to access Git repositories.

**How Argo CD Contributes:** Argo CD relies on these credentials to fetch application manifests and track changes. Compromise allows manipulation of the source of truth that Argo CD trusts.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Argo CD's secret management or gains access to the Argo CD server's configuration files to retrieve Git repository credentials.

**Impact:** Ability to modify application manifests, potentially injecting malicious code or altering deployment configurations, leading to compromised deployments managed by Argo CD.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Securely store Git repository credentials using Argo CD's built-in secret management or external secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
*   Implement the principle of least privilege for Git repository access within Argo CD's configuration.
*   Regularly rotate Git repository credentials used by Argo CD.

## Attack Surface: [Target Kubernetes Cluster Credential Compromise](./attack_surfaces/target_kubernetes_cluster_credential_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the credentials Argo CD uses to connect to target Kubernetes clusters.

**How Argo CD Contributes:** Argo CD uses these credentials to deploy and manage applications within the target clusters. Compromise of these credentials managed by Argo CD grants direct access to the cluster.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Argo CD's secret management or gains access to the Argo CD server's configuration files to retrieve Kubernetes cluster credentials (e.g., kubeconfig).

**Impact:** Full control over the target Kubernetes cluster managed by Argo CD, including the ability to deploy, modify, and delete any resource.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Securely store Kubernetes cluster credentials using Argo CD's built-in secret management or external secret management solutions.
*   Implement the principle of least privilege for cluster access configured within Argo CD.
*   Regularly rotate Kubernetes cluster credentials used by Argo CD.

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of GitOps Workflow via Repository Access](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_gitops_workflow_via_repository_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to the Git repository managed by Argo CD directly modifies application manifests to introduce malicious changes.

**How Argo CD Contributes:** Argo CD's core functionality is to synchronize the state of the Kubernetes cluster with the desired state defined in the Git repository. Argo CD automatically deploys changes from the configured repository.

**Example:** An attacker compromises a developer's Git credentials and pushes changes to the application's deployment manifest, injecting a malicious container image or altering resource configurations. Argo CD then automatically deploys these changes.

**Impact:** Deployment of compromised applications by Argo CD, potential data breaches, denial of service, and other malicious activities within the target cluster.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strict access controls and code review processes for the Git repositories managed by Argo CD.
*   Implement branch protection rules to prevent unauthorized changes to repositories monitored by Argo CD.
*   Utilize Git signing to verify the authenticity of commits processed by Argo CD.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Secrets in Transit](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_secrets_in_transit.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, is exposed during transmission between Argo CD and target clusters.

**How Argo CD Contributes:** Argo CD needs to transmit secrets to the Kubernetes API server for application deployments. If this transmission, managed by Argo CD, is not properly secured, it becomes an attack vector.

**Example:** Secrets are passed as plain text environment variables by Argo CD or are not encrypted during communication with the Kubernetes API server when initiated by Argo CD.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to other systems or data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure that Argo CD and the Kubernetes API server communicate over HTTPS with valid TLS certificates.
*   Utilize Kubernetes Secrets objects for managing sensitive information instead of passing them directly in manifests processed by Argo CD.
*   Consider using external secret management solutions that integrate with Argo CD for more secure secret handling.
