## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Argo CD API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_argo_cd_api_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * SQL Injection in Argo CD Database: Attackers inject malicious SQL code into API requests to gain unauthorized access to the Argo CD database, potentially exposing sensitive information like secrets and application configurations.
    * Authentication/Authorization Bypass: Attackers exploit flaws in the API's authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain access without proper credentials, allowing them to perform actions they shouldn't.
    * Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Argo CD Components: Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in the API or its underlying components to execute arbitrary code on the Argo CD server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Argo CD RBAC Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_argo_cd_rbac_misconfigurations.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Privilege Escalation: Attackers exploit misconfigured roles or role bindings to gain higher privileges within Argo CD than intended, enabling them to manage applications they shouldn't have access to.
    * Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Resources: Attackers leverage overly permissive RBAC rules to access sensitive information like application configurations, secrets, or deployment details of other applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Argo CD Secrets Management](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_argo_cd_secrets_management.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Secret Leakage through Argo CD: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how Argo CD stores or manages secrets, allowing them to retrieve sensitive credentials. This could involve insecure storage practices or flaws in access control mechanisms.
    * Manipulation of Secrets: Attackers gain unauthorized access to modify secrets used for application deployment, potentially injecting malicious configurations or compromising application credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Manipulate Argo CD's Deployment Process](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_argo_cd's_deployment_process.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Path: Compromise the Git Repository](./attack_tree_paths/sub-path_compromise_the_git_repository.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Gain Access to Git Credentials: Attackers steal credentials used by Argo CD to access the Git repository, allowing them to modify application configurations.
    * Inject Malicious Code into Git Repository: Attackers, having gained access to the Git repository, modify application manifests or configurations to introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors that Argo CD will then deploy.

## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Path: Exploit External System Integrations](./attack_tree_paths/sub-path_exploit_external_system_integrations.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Compromise the Image Registry: Attackers compromise the container image registry used by Argo CD and push malicious container images that Argo CD will subsequently deploy.
    * Compromise the Helm Chart Repository: Attackers compromise the Helm chart repository and introduce malicious Helm charts that Argo CD will use for deployments.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Argo CD's Interaction with Kubernetes](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_argo_cd's_interaction_with_kubernetes.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Path: Abuse Argo CD's Service Account Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/sub-path_abuse_argo_cd's_service_account_permissions.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Leverage Excessive Permissions: Attackers exploit overly permissive roles granted to Argo CD's service account in Kubernetes to perform actions beyond deployment, potentially impacting other namespaces or resources within the cluster.
    * Credential Theft from Argo CD's Service Account: Attackers steal the service account token used by Argo CD to interact with the Kubernetes API, granting them direct access to the cluster with Argo CD's privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Path: Manipulate Argo CD's Resource Creation](./attack_tree_paths/sub-path_manipulate_argo_cd's_resource_creation.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Inject Malicious Kubernetes Resources: Attackers manipulate Argo CD's deployment process to inject vulnerable or malicious deployments, services, or other Kubernetes objects into the cluster.

## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Path: Exploit Argo CD's Sync Waves and Hooks](./attack_tree_paths/sub-path_exploit_argo_cd's_sync_waves_and_hooks.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Introduce Malicious Pre/Post Sync Hooks: Attackers inject malicious code into pre or post-sync hooks, which Argo CD executes during the deployment process, allowing for arbitrary code execution within the Kubernetes cluster.
