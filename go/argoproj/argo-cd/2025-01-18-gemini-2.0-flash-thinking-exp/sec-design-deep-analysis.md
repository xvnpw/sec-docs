        * Exploitation of vulnerabilities in authentication providers (e.g., OIDC, SAML).
        * Authorization bypass due to misconfigured RBAC policies within Argo CD.
        * Exposure of sensitive data through insecure API endpoints.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enforce strong password policies for local users (if enabled).
        * Mandate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users.
        * Implement robust and granular RBAC policies within Argo CD, adhering to the principle of least privilege. Regularly review and audit these policies.
        * Securely configure and regularly update authentication providers (OIDC, SAML).
        * Implement rate limiting and request throttling to mitigate brute-force attacks.
        * Ensure all API communication is over HTTPS (TLS) with strong cipher suites.
        * Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
        * Regularly audit API endpoints for potential vulnerabilities.
