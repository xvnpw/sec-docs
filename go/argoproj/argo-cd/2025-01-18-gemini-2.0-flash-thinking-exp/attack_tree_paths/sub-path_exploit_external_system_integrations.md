#### Sub-Path: Compromise the Image Registry

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Compromise the Image Registry:** Attackers compromise the container image registry used by Argo CD and push malicious container images that Argo CD will subsequently deploy.

##### Detailed Description of Attack Vector:

An attacker gains unauthorized access to the container image registry used by Argo CD. This could be achieved through various means, including:

* **Credential Compromise:** Stealing or guessing credentials of users with write access to the registry.
* **Vulnerability Exploitation:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the registry software itself.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:** Compromising the build pipeline or developer workstations used to push images.
* **Insider Threats:** Malicious actions by individuals with legitimate access.

Once inside, the attacker can push modified or entirely new container images. These malicious images could contain:

* **Backdoors:** Allowing persistent remote access to the deployed application or infrastructure.
* **Malware:**  Designed to steal data, disrupt operations, or perform other malicious activities.
* **Compromised Dependencies:**  Introducing vulnerabilities through malicious or outdated dependencies within the image.

When Argo CD synchronizes with the Git repository or receives a deployment trigger, it will pull these compromised images and deploy them to the target environment.

##### Impact Assessment:

A successful compromise of the image registry can have severe consequences:

* **Integrity Violation:** The deployed application is no longer trustworthy, as its core components have been tampered with.
* **Confidentiality Breach:** Malicious code within the container can exfiltrate sensitive data from the application or the underlying infrastructure.
* **Availability Disruption:** Malware within the container can cause the application to crash, become unresponsive, or be used for denial-of-service attacks.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A security breach stemming from compromised deployments can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
* **Financial Losses:**  Downtime, data breaches, and incident response efforts can lead to significant financial losses.
* **Supply Chain Contamination:** The compromised image can potentially affect other applications or environments that rely on the same registry.

##### Technical Details:

* **Attacker Actions:**
    * Gain unauthorized access to the registry API or management interface.
    * Authenticate using compromised credentials or exploited vulnerabilities.
    * Push malicious images with the same tags as legitimate images (tag poisoning) or new tags.
    * Potentially delete or modify existing legitimate images to cover their tracks.
* **Tools and Techniques:**
    * Credential stuffing or brute-force attacks.
    * Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in container registry software (e.g., Docker Registry, Harbor, AWS ECR, Google GCR, Azure ACR).
    * Use of standard container image building tools (e.g., Docker, Podman) to create malicious images.
    * Network reconnaissance and exploitation techniques to gain initial access.

##### Detection Strategies:

* **Image Scanning:** Implement automated vulnerability scanning of images within the registry. This can help identify known vulnerabilities and potential malware signatures.
* **Content Trust/Image Signing:** Utilize technologies like Docker Content Trust (Notary) or similar mechanisms to cryptographically sign and verify the integrity and publisher of container images. Argo CD can be configured to only deploy signed images.
* **Registry Access Logging and Monitoring:**  Monitor registry access logs for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized login attempts, unexpected image pushes or pulls, and modifications to image metadata.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Implement systems that can detect unusual patterns in registry activity, such as a sudden surge in image pushes or pulls from unknown sources.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the container registry infrastructure and access controls.
* **Binary Authorization:**  Implement a system that allows only trusted and verified images to be deployed to the Kubernetes cluster.

##### Mitigation Strategies:

* **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Enforce strong password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and role-based access control (RBAC) for the container image registry.
* **Vulnerability Management:** Regularly patch and update the container registry software to address known vulnerabilities.
* **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the container image registry within a secure network segment with restricted access.
* **Secure Image Building Practices:** Implement secure development practices for building container images, including minimizing the image size, using minimal base images, and regularly scanning for vulnerabilities during the build process.
* **Content Trust/Image Signing:**  Mandate the use of image signing and verification to ensure the integrity and authenticity of container images.
* **Immutable Infrastructure:** Treat deployed containers as immutable. If a compromise is suspected, redeploy from a known good image rather than trying to patch a running container.
* **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and regularly test an incident response plan specifically for container registry compromises.

#### Sub-Path: Compromise the Helm Chart Repository

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Compromise the Helm Chart Repository:** Attackers compromise the Helm chart repository and introduce malicious Helm charts that Argo CD will use for deployments.

##### Detailed Description of Attack Vector:

An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Helm chart repository used by Argo CD. This could involve:

* **Credential Compromise:** Stealing or guessing credentials of users with write access to the repository.
* **Vulnerability Exploitation:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Helm chart repository software (e.g., ChartMuseum, JFrog Artifactory, cloud-based Helm repositories).
* **Supply Chain Attacks:** Compromising the build pipeline or developer workstations used to push Helm charts.
* **Insider Threats:** Malicious actions by individuals with legitimate access.

Once inside, the attacker can upload modified or entirely new Helm charts. These malicious charts could contain:

* **Modified Kubernetes Manifests:**  Introducing malicious containers, altering resource configurations to grant excessive permissions, or deploying backdoors within the application.
* **Malicious Hooks:**  Adding pre-install, post-install, or other lifecycle hooks that execute malicious code on the Kubernetes cluster.
