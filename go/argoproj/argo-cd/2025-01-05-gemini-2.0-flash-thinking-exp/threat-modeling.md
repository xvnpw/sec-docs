# Threat Model Analysis for argoproj/argo-cd

## Threat: [Compromised Argo CD UI/API Credentials](./threats/compromised_argo_cd_uiapi_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to valid Argo CD user credentials (username/password, API keys, SSO tokens). This could be through phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting vulnerabilities in other systems where these credentials might be reused. The attacker can then log in to the Argo CD UI or use the API as the compromised user.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can view sensitive application configurations and secrets managed within Argo CD, modify existing applications managed by Argo CD, deploy new malicious applications through Argo CD, delete applications managed by Argo CD, and potentially gain access to the underlying Kubernetes clusters if the compromised user has sufficient permissions within Argo CD.
*   **Affected Argo CD Component:** `server` (UI and API components).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies and complexity requirements for Argo CD users.
    *   Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all Argo CD user accounts.
    *   Regularly rotate API keys and tokens used for accessing the Argo CD API.
    *   Integrate with robust Identity Providers (IdPs) for authentication and authorization of Argo CD users.
    *   Monitor login attempts and unusual activity within the Argo CD system.
    *   Educate users about phishing and credential security best practices for accessing Argo CD.

## Threat: [Compromised Git Repository Credentials Used by Argo CD](./threats/compromised_git_repository_credentials_used_by_argo_cd.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the credentials (e.g., SSH keys, personal access tokens) that Argo CD is configured to use for accessing Git repositories. This could be through insecure storage within Argo CD, leaked secrets from the Argo CD environment, or compromised systems where these credentials were used or stored. The attacker can then modify application manifests in the Git repository that Argo CD monitors, leading to Argo CD deploying those changes.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can inject malicious code or configurations into application deployments managed by Argo CD, leading to compromised applications, data breaches within those applications, or denial of service for those applications. Argo CD will automatically deploy these malicious changes to the Kubernetes clusters it manages.
*   **Affected Argo CD Component:** `repo-server` (responsible for fetching Git repositories).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store Git repository credentials securely using Argo CD's built-in secret management features or integrate with external secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) configured for Argo CD.
    *   Implement strict access control and auditing on the Git repositories that Argo CD accesses.
    *   Regularly rotate Git repository access credentials used by Argo CD.
    *   Grant Argo CD read-only access to Git repositories whenever possible to limit the impact of compromised credentials.
    *   Implement Git signing and verification to ensure the integrity of commits processed by Argo CD.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Git Repository Manipulation (Directly Affecting Argo CD's Operation)](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_git_repository_manipulation__directly_affecting_argo_cd's_operation_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with write access to a Git repository monitored by Argo CD directly modifies application manifests (e.g., Kubernetes Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps) in a way that exploits Argo CD's reconciliation logic or introduces vulnerabilities that directly impact Argo CD's operation or the security of other applications managed by it. This is distinct from simply injecting malicious application code; it targets Argo CD's workflow.
*   **Impact:** Leads to the deployment of configurations that could disrupt Argo CD's ability to manage applications, potentially allowing for unauthorized access to resources managed by Argo CD, or creating vulnerabilities that affect multiple applications managed by the same Argo CD instance.
*   **Affected Argo CD Component:** `application-controller` (responsible for syncing applications based on Git state).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access control and code review processes for Git repositories monitored by Argo CD.
    *   Utilize branch protection rules and require approvals for merge requests affecting repositories managed by Argo CD.
    *   Implement static and dynamic analysis tools to scan manifests for vulnerabilities and potential misconfigurations that could impact Argo CD before deployment.
    *   Employ Git signing and verification to ensure the authenticity of commits processed by Argo CD.

## Threat: [Compromised Kubernetes Cluster Credentials Stored by Argo CD](./threats/compromised_kubernetes_cluster_credentials_stored_by_argo_cd.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Kubernetes cluster credentials (e.g., kubeconfig files, service account tokens) that Argo CD uses to interact with managed clusters. This could be due to insecure storage within Argo CD's data store, vulnerabilities in Argo CD's components that allow for credential retrieval, or compromised infrastructure where Argo CD is running, allowing access to its persistent storage.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can directly access and control the managed Kubernetes clusters that Argo CD is responsible for, potentially leading to full cluster compromise, data breaches within applications running on those clusters, and denial of service for those clusters and applications.
*   **Affected Argo CD Component:** `application-controller` (manages cluster interactions), `server` (secret management if not using external solutions).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store Kubernetes cluster credentials securely using Argo CD's built-in secret management features with appropriate encryption at rest or integrate with external secret management solutions.
    *   Minimize the scope of permissions granted to Argo CD's service accounts in the target clusters using Kubernetes RBAC principles of least privilege.
    *   Regularly rotate Kubernetes cluster credentials used by Argo CD.
    *   Harden the infrastructure where Argo CD is deployed to prevent unauthorized access to its data and processes.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within Argo CD](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_argo_cd.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with limited permissions within Argo CD exploits vulnerabilities in the authorization model or code of Argo CD itself to gain higher privileges within the Argo CD system. This could allow them to manage applications or clusters they are not intended to access, bypassing intended access controls enforced by Argo CD.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can perform actions beyond their authorized scope within Argo CD, potentially leading to unauthorized modification or deletion of applications managed by Argo CD and access to sensitive information managed by Argo CD. This could also lead to the attacker gaining control over Kubernetes clusters managed by Argo CD.
*   **Affected Argo CD Component:** `server` (authorization logic), `application-controller`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit and review Argo CD RBAC configurations to ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege.
    *   Keep Argo CD updated to the latest version to patch known privilege escalation and other security vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement thorough input validation and sanitization within Argo CD components to prevent injection attacks that could lead to privilege escalation.
    *   Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing specifically targeting the Argo CD deployment and its authorization mechanisms.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Secrets within Argo CD](./threats/insecure_storage_of_secrets_within_argo_cd.md)

*   **Description:** Argo CD might store sensitive secrets (e.g., Git credentials, cluster credentials, API keys) in an insecure manner within its internal data store or configuration files, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access if the Argo CD deployment itself is compromised.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of sensitive credentials managed by Argo CD, potentially leading to full control over Git repositories accessed by Argo CD or managed Kubernetes clusters.
*   **Affected Argo CD Component:** `server` (secret management).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize Argo CD's built-in secret management features with appropriate encryption at rest.
    *   Prioritize integration with external, dedicated secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault for storing sensitive credentials used by Argo CD.
    *   Avoid storing secrets directly in Argo CD's configuration files or environment variables.
