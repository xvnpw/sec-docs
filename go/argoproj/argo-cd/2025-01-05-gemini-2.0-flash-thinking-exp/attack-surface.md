# Attack Surface Analysis for argoproj/argo-cd

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Missing Argo CD Web UI Authentication](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_missing_argo_cd_web_ui_authentication.md)

*   **How Argo CD Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Argo CD provides a web UI for managing applications and deployments. If authentication is weak or missing, unauthorized users can gain access.
    *   **Example:** Default administrator credentials are not changed, allowing anyone to log in and control deployments.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over deployed applications, potential data breaches, and infrastructure compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for local users.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        *   Integrate with robust external authentication providers (OIDC, OAuth2, SAML).
        *   Regularly audit user accounts and permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Argo CD API Authentication Bypass or Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/argo_cd_api_authentication_bypass_or_weaknesses.md)

*   **How Argo CD Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Argo CD exposes an API for programmatic interaction. Weaknesses in API authentication allow unauthorized access to manage deployments.
    *   **Example:** API keys are exposed or easily guessable, allowing attackers to manipulate applications via the API.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to web UI compromise, leading to control over deployments and potential data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely manage and rotate API keys.
        *   Implement robust authentication mechanisms for API access (e.g., mutual TLS).
        *   Enforce rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
        *   Restrict API access based on source IP or other network controls.

## Attack Surface: [Git Repository Credential Exposure](./attack_surfaces/git_repository_credential_exposure.md)

*   **How Argo CD Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Argo CD stores credentials to access Git repositories. If these are compromised, attackers can modify application manifests.
    *   **Example:** Git credentials are stored in plain text in Argo CD's configuration or database, allowing retrieval by an attacker.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can inject malicious code into application deployments, leading to compromised applications and potentially the underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets with encryption at rest) to store Git credentials.
        *   Avoid storing credentials directly in Argo CD's configuration files.
        *   Implement strict access controls to the Argo CD backend and database.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Manifest Injection via Git](./attack_surfaces/malicious_manifest_injection_via_git.md)

*   **How Argo CD Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Argo CD automatically synchronizes deployments from Git repositories. If a repository is compromised, malicious manifests will be deployed.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a Git repository managed by Argo CD and introduces a manifest that deploys a malicious container or modifies existing deployments to exfiltrate data.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised applications, potential data breaches, and unauthorized access to Kubernetes clusters.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls and authentication for Git repositories.
        *   Utilize branch protection rules and code review processes in Git.
        *   Employ Git signing to verify the authenticity of commits.
        *   Consider using a GitOps workflow with pull requests and approvals before deployments.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Manifest Templating Engines](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_manifest_templating_engines.md)

*   **How Argo CD Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Argo CD supports templating engines like Helm and Kustomize. Vulnerabilities in these engines can be exploited through malicious input in manifests.
    *   **Example:** Exploiting a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability in Helm templates to execute arbitrary code during manifest rendering.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution within the Argo CD environment or the target Kubernetes cluster.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep templating engine versions up-to-date with security patches.
        *   Implement secure coding practices when writing templates, avoiding dynamic code generation based on untrusted input.
        *   Utilize linters and security scanners for templating languages.

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of Argo CD's Kubernetes Service Account](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_argo_cd's_kubernetes_service_account.md)

*   **How Argo CD Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Argo CD uses a Kubernetes Service Account to interact with managed clusters. If this account is compromised, attackers gain significant control.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Argo CD namespace and retrieves the Service Account token, allowing them to impersonate Argo CD and manipulate resources in managed clusters.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the target Kubernetes clusters managed by Argo CD.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to the Argo CD namespace and its secrets.
        *   Implement strong network segmentation to limit access to the Argo CD pod.
        *   Regularly rotate Service Account tokens if feasible.
        *   Consider using workload identity or similar mechanisms to minimize the reliance on static Service Account tokens.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Secrets within Manifests](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_secrets_within_manifests.md)

*   **How Argo CD Contributes to the Attack Surface:** While not directly Argo CD's fault, it deploys manifests. If secrets are hardcoded or insecurely managed within these manifests, they become vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** Database passwords or API keys are directly embedded in Kubernetes Secret manifests managed by Argo CD.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access to external services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never hardcode secrets in manifests.
        *   Utilize Kubernetes Secrets with encryption at rest.
        *   Integrate with external secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and reference secrets dynamically in manifests.
        *   Employ tools like `kustomize` or Helm to manage secrets securely.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Argo CD Components or Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_argo_cd_components_or_dependencies.md)

*   **How Argo CD Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Like any software, Argo CD and its dependencies may contain vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
    *   **Example:** A known security flaw in a specific version of the Argo CD controller allows for remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Range from denial of service to remote code execution on the Argo CD server, potentially leading to full compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Argo CD updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
        *   Regularly scan Argo CD's container images for vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Argo CD and its dependencies.
