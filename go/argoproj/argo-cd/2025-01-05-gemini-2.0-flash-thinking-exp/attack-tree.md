## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Argo CD [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_argo_cd__critical_.md)

- This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. Success here means full compromise of the target application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Argo CD Access Control [CRITICAL, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_argo_cd_access_control__critical__high_risk_path_.md)

- This critical node represents gaining unauthorized access to the Argo CD interface. It's a high-risk path because successful exploitation immediately grants the attacker significant control over the deployment process.
  - Attack Vectors:
    - Brute-force Argo CD Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH]: Repeatedly attempting different username and password combinations to gain access. This is high-risk if strong password policies and account lockout mechanisms are not in place.
    - Exploit Known Argo CD Authentication/Authorization Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]: Leveraging publicly known security flaws in Argo CD's authentication or authorization mechanisms. This is high-risk if Argo CD is not regularly updated.
    - Compromise an Authorized User Account [HIGH RISK PATH]: Gaining access through social engineering, phishing, or malware targeting legitimate Argo CD users. This is high-risk due to the human element and the potential for privileged access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate GitOps Workflow [CRITICAL, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_gitops_workflow__critical__high_risk_path_.md)

- This critical node represents subverting the core GitOps process managed by Argo CD. It's a high-risk path because it allows attackers to inject malicious changes into the application deployment pipeline.
  - Attack Vectors:
    - Compromise the Git Repository Hosting Application Manifests [CRITICAL, HIGH RISK PATH]: Gaining control over the Git repository that holds the application's deployment configurations. This is a critical node and a high-risk path because it allows for persistent and potentially widespread compromise.
      - Compromise Git Credentials Used by Argo CD [HIGH RISK PATH]: Stealing the credentials that Argo CD uses to access the Git repository. This bypasses many security controls on the Git repository itself.
      - Inject Malicious Code/Configurations into Application Manifests [HIGH RISK PATH]: Directly modifying the Kubernetes manifests or other configuration files in the Git repository to introduce malicious elements. This is high-risk if code review and proper change management are lacking.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Argo CD's Kubernetes Interaction [CRITICAL, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_argo_cd's_kubernetes_interaction__critical__high_risk_path_.md)

- This critical node represents abusing Argo CD's authorized access to the Kubernetes cluster. It's a high-risk path because it allows attackers to directly manipulate the runtime environment of the application.
  - Attack Vectors:
    - Leverage Excessive Permissions of Argo CD's Service Account [CRITICAL, HIGH RISK PATH]: Exploiting a misconfiguration where Argo CD's service account has more permissions than necessary in the Kubernetes cluster. This is a critical node and a high-risk path because it enables various malicious actions.
      - Deploy Malicious Workloads [HIGH RISK PATH]: Using Argo CD's service account permissions to deploy attacker-controlled containers or other Kubernetes resources.
      - Modify Existing Deployments to Inject Malicious Code [HIGH RISK PATH]: Using Argo CD's service account permissions to alter running application deployments, injecting malicious code or configurations.
      - Access Sensitive Data or Secrets within the Cluster [HIGH RISK PATH]: Using Argo CD's service account permissions to read sensitive data or secrets stored within the Kubernetes cluster.
