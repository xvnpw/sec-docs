## 4. Data Flow

The typical data flow within Argo CD for application synchronization involves these key steps:

1. **Configuration Change in Git:** A user commits changes to the application configuration in a Git repository. This could be updates to Kubernetes manifests, Helm chart values, Kustomize configurations, or other declarative definitions.
2. **Argo CD Application Controller Detection:** The Application Controller continuously monitors Argo CD Application resources (CRDs). It detects changes in the desired state, either through manual synchronization requests via the API Server or through periodic reconciliation loops.
3. **Repo Server Manifest Retrieval Request:** The Application Controller requests the Repo Server to fetch the latest application manifests from the specified Git repository and revision. The request includes details about the Git repository URL, revision, and application path.
4. **Repo Server Git Access and Manifest Generation:** The Repo Server accesses the Git repository using configured credentials, retrieves the manifests, and generates Kubernetes manifests if necessary (e.g., using Helm or Kustomize).
5. **Manifest Delivery to Application Controller:** The Repo Server returns the generated Kubernetes manifests to the Application Controller.
6. **Application Controller State Comparison:** The Application Controller compares the desired state (manifests from Repo Server) with the actual state of the application in the target Kubernetes cluster. It queries the Kubernetes API Server of the target cluster to retrieve the current state of resources associated with the application.
7. **Synchronization Decision and Action:** Based on the comparison, the Application Controller determines if synchronization is required. If there are differences (drift), it generates a set of Kubernetes API operations (create, update, delete) to reconcile the actual state with the desired state.
8. **Kubernetes API Synchronization Execution:** The Application Controller sends the generated Kubernetes API operations to the Kubernetes API Server of the target cluster. The Kubernetes API Server applies these changes, updating the resources in the cluster.
9. **Status Update and Health Check:** The Application Controller monitors the progress of the synchronization and updates the status of the Argo CD Application resource. It also performs health checks on the deployed application by querying Kubernetes resources and executing configured health probes.
10. **Event Generation and Notifications:** Events related to the synchronization process, health status changes, and deployment operations are generated by the Application Controller and API Server. The Notifications Controller processes these events and sends notifications to configured external systems.
11. **User Monitoring via API Server:** Users can monitor the application status, synchronization progress, and health through the Argo CD Web UI or CLI, which interact with the API Server to retrieve and display real-time information.

## 5. Security Considerations for Threat Modeling
