# Attack Surface Analysis for argoproj/argo-cd

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**  Using easily guessable or default usernames and passwords for Argo CD access.
*   **Argo CD Contribution:** Argo CD, if not properly configured, might retain default credentials, providing an easily exploitable initial access point.
*   **Example:** An administrator deploys Argo CD and neglects to change the default `admin` password. An attacker exploits these default credentials to gain unauthorized access to the Argo CD UI and API.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Argo CD, enabling attackers to view application configurations, secrets, and potentially deploy malicious applications or modify existing ones.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Password Policy:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for all Argo CD user accounts.
    *   **Disable Default Accounts:** Disable or remove default accounts like `admin` if possible, or immediately change their passwords upon installation.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for all Argo CD user accounts to add an extra layer of security beyond passwords.

## Attack Surface: [Excessive Kubernetes Permissions for Argo CD](./attack_surfaces/excessive_kubernetes_permissions_for_argo_cd.md)

*   **Description:** Granting Argo CD service accounts overly broad permissions within the Kubernetes cluster, such as `cluster-admin` or excessive namespace-level permissions.
*   **Argo CD Contribution:** Argo CD requires Kubernetes permissions to function. Over-provisioning these permissions beyond necessity amplifies the potential damage if Argo CD is compromised.
*   **Example:** Argo CD is granted the `cluster-admin` role. If Argo CD is compromised through a vulnerability, the attacker inherits `cluster-admin` privileges and can control the entire Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Kubernetes cluster, including all workloads, data, and infrastructure. Potential for data breaches, denial of service, and complete system takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant Argo CD service accounts only the minimum necessary permissions required for its operation using Kubernetes RBAC.
    *   **Namespace Scoping:** Restrict Argo CD's permissions to specific namespaces where it manages applications, avoiding cluster-wide permissions if feasible.
    *   **Regular Permission Review:** Periodically audit Argo CD's Kubernetes permissions to ensure they remain appropriate and minimally permissive.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious YAML/Helm Charts in Git Repositories (Argo CD Deployment)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_yamlhelm_charts_in_git_repositories__argo_cd_deployment_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers injecting malicious YAML manifests or Helm charts into Git repositories that Argo CD monitors, leading to their deployment by Argo CD.
*   **Argo CD Contribution:** Argo CD's core function is to automatically synchronize and deploy applications from Git repositories. This direct automation makes it a conduit for deploying malicious configurations if the source Git repository is compromised.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to a Git repository used by Argo CD. They modify a Helm chart to include a malicious container image. Argo CD synchronizes this change and deploys the compromised application into the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Impact:** Deployment of compromised applications into the Kubernetes cluster, potentially leading to data breaches, resource hijacking, denial of service, or further compromise of the cluster and applications.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Git Repository Access Control:** Implement strict access control and authentication for Git repositories used by Argo CD. Utilize branch protection and code review processes.
    *   **Repository Scanning:** Implement automated scanning of Git repositories for malicious code, secrets, and misconfigurations *before* Argo CD synchronizes changes.
    *   **Image Registry Security:** Use trusted and secure container image registries. Implement image scanning and vulnerability management for container images used in Helm charts and YAML manifests.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of sensitive Argo CD API endpoints without proper authentication, allowing unauthorized users to interact directly with Argo CD functionalities.
*   **Argo CD Contribution:** Misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in Argo CD's API server can lead to unauthenticated API endpoints, bypassing intended access controls.
*   **Example:** An Argo CD instance is deployed with a misconfiguration exposing the API server without authentication. An attacker uses these unauthenticated API endpoints to list applications, retrieve secrets, or trigger application deployments.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Argo CD functionalities, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized application deployments, denial of service, and control over managed applications.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce Authentication on API:** Ensure all sensitive Argo CD API endpoints require robust authentication and authorization.
    *   **API Gateway/Ingress Configuration:** Use an API gateway or ingress controller to properly secure and authenticate access to the Argo CD API server.
    *   **Network Policies:** Implement network policies to restrict access to the Argo CD API server to authorized networks and clients.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Secrets Management within Argo CD](./attack_surfaces/insecure_secrets_management_within_argo_cd.md)

*   **Description:** Storing secrets in plaintext or using weak encryption within Argo CD's configuration or internal storage.
*   **Argo CD Contribution:** Argo CD manages sensitive credentials. Weak internal secret management directly increases the risk of secret exposure if Argo CD itself is compromised.
*   **Example:** Argo CD stores Git repository credentials in plaintext in its configuration database. An attacker gains access to the Argo CD database and retrieves these plaintext credentials, compromising access to the Git repositories.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive secrets, leading to unauthorized access to Git repositories, Kubernetes clusters, databases, and other systems protected by these secrets.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **External Secret Stores:** Integrate Argo CD with external, dedicated secret stores (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider secret managers) to manage and store secrets securely outside of Argo CD's internal storage.
    *   **Encryption at Rest:** Ensure Argo CD's internal data storage, including secrets, is encrypted at rest using strong encryption algorithms.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Argo CD Components](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_argo_cd_components.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitable vulnerabilities present in Argo CD server components (API server, application controller, UI server) or the CLI.
*   **Argo CD Contribution:** As software, Argo CD is susceptible to vulnerabilities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities directly compromises Argo CD's security and can impact managed Kubernetes clusters.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of the Argo CD API server. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to achieve remote code execution on the Argo CD server, potentially gaining control of Argo CD and the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of Argo CD, potentially leading to control over managed applications, data breaches, denial of service, and further compromise of the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High** (depending on the severity of the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates and Patching:** Keep Argo CD and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan Argo CD components and infrastructure for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   **Security Hardening:** Harden Argo CD deployments by following security best practices, such as disabling unnecessary features and using secure configurations.
