# Threat Model Analysis for argoproj/argo-cd

## Threat: [Malicious Commit Injection](./threats/malicious_commit_injection.md)

Description: An attacker with write access to the Git repository pushes a commit containing malicious application manifests. Argo CD automatically synchronizes with the repository and deploys the compromised application to the Kubernetes cluster.
Impact: Deployment of backdoored applications, unauthorized access to cluster resources, data exfiltration, denial of service.
Affected Argo CD Component: Application Controller, Git Repository Integration
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement strong access control on Git repositories (authentication, authorization).
    * Enforce code review and pull request workflows for all Git commits.
    * Utilize branch protection rules to prevent direct pushes to main branches.
    * Implement Git repository auditing and monitoring for suspicious activities.
    * Consider signed commits to verify commit integrity.

## Threat: [Git Repository Compromise](./threats/git_repository_compromise.md)

Description: An attacker gains full control of the Git repository (e.g., through compromised credentials or platform vulnerability). They can then modify application configurations and deploy malicious applications via Argo CD.
Impact: Widespread compromise of applications across all managed clusters, complete control over deployed environments, significant data breach potential, system-wide denial of service.
Affected Argo CD Component: Application Controller, Git Repository Integration
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:

## Threat: [Compromised Kubernetes Credentials in Argo CD](./threats/compromised_kubernetes_credentials_in_argo_cd.md)

Description: Argo CD stores credentials to access managed Kubernetes clusters. If these credentials are compromised (through Argo CD server compromise, information disclosure, or insecure storage), attackers gain direct access to the clusters.
Impact: Full control over the Kubernetes clusters, ability to deploy arbitrary workloads, access sensitive data within the clusters, denial of service, cluster-wide compromise.
Affected Argo CD Component: Argo CD Server (Secrets Management, Cluster Credentials Storage)
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Securely store Kubernetes cluster credentials within Argo CD, utilizing built-in secrets management or external secret stores.
    * Implement strong access control for the Argo CD server to limit access to these credentials.
    * Regularly rotate Kubernetes cluster credentials used by Argo CD.
    * Monitor access to Kubernetes clusters for unauthorized activity.
    * Consider using short-lived credentials or workload identity where possible.

## Threat: [Malicious Application Deployment via Argo CD (Exploiting Argo CD Functionality)](./threats/malicious_application_deployment_via_argo_cd__exploiting_argo_cd_functionality_.md)

Description: An attacker, having compromised Git or Argo CD server, uses Argo CD's intended functionality to deploy malicious applications to Kubernetes clusters. This bypasses traditional deployment security checks as it leverages the trusted deployment pipeline.
Impact: Deployment of compromised applications, unauthorized resource access within Kubernetes, data breaches, denial of service, cluster instability, bypass of security controls.
Affected Argo CD Component: Application Controller, Git Repository Integration, Sync Engine
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement security scanning and vulnerability assessments of application manifests and container images *before* they are committed to Git or deployed by Argo CD.
