## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via Argo CD [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_argo_cd__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has compromised the application managed by Argo CD, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Argo CD Configuration/Misconfiguration [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_argo_cd_configurationmisconfiguration__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses arising from improper configuration of Argo CD. Misconfigurations are common and often easier to exploit than code vulnerabilities.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Misconfigurations can directly lead to unauthorized access, data exposure, and control over Argo CD and managed applications. They are often overlooked and can persist for extended periods.

    *   **2.1. Misconfigured RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configuration of Argo CD.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** RBAC is the primary mechanism for controlling access within Argo CD. Misconfigurations here can grant excessive privileges to unauthorized users, allowing them to manage and modify applications they should not have access to.
            *   **2.1.1. Overly Permissive Roles [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** RBAC roles are defined with overly broad permissions, granting more access than necessary.
                *   **Why High-Risk:**  This directly violates the principle of least privilege. Attackers exploiting this can gain admin-like access with low-privilege accounts.
                    *   **2.1.1.1. Granting excessive permissions to users/groups [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                        *   **Attack Vector:** Directly assigning overly permissive roles to users or groups.
                        *   **Why High-Risk:** Simple misconfiguration with direct and significant impact.
                    *   **2.1.1.2. Default, overly broad roles not customized [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                        *   **Attack Vector:** Using default RBAC roles without customization, which are often too broad for production environments.
                        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Organizations may overlook customizing default roles, leaving them vulnerable.

    *   **2.2. Insecure Secret Management [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Improper handling and storage of sensitive secrets by Argo CD.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Secrets are critical for authentication and authorization. Compromising secrets can grant attackers complete control over applications and infrastructure.
            *   **2.2.1. Exposed Secrets in Argo CD Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Secrets are stored in plaintext or easily accessible locations within Argo CD's configuration.
                *   **Why High-Risk:**  Plaintext secrets are trivial to retrieve if an attacker gains access to configuration files or the Argo CD database.
                    *   **2.2.1.1. Secrets stored in plaintext in Argo CD manifests or settings [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                        *   **Attack Vector:** Directly embedding secrets in plaintext within Argo CD manifests, configuration files, or settings.
                        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Extremely insecure practice, easily discoverable.

    *   **2.3. Weak GitOps Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Weaknesses in the configuration of the GitOps workflow used by Argo CD, particularly related to Git repository access and security.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Git repositories are the source of truth in GitOps. Compromising Git access or integrity allows attackers to manipulate application deployments and introduce malicious code.
            *   **2.3.1. Unsecured Git Repository Access [HIGH RISK PATH]::**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Lack of proper access controls on the Git repository used by Argo CD.
                *   **Why High-Risk:**  Overly permissive access allows unauthorized individuals to modify application configurations and potentially introduce backdoors.
                    *   **2.3.1.1. Lack of proper Git repository access controls (e.g., overly permissive) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                        *   **Attack Vector:** Git repository permissions are not properly configured, allowing unintended users or groups to read or write to the repository.
                        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Simple misconfiguration in Git repository settings with significant security implications.
            *   **2.3.2. Insecure Git Repository Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Inherent security weaknesses in how the Git repository itself is configured and managed.
                *   **Why High-Risk:**  Fundamental flaws in repository setup can undermine the entire GitOps security model.
                    *   **2.3.2.1. Git repository not properly secured (e.g., public repository with sensitive data) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                        *   **Attack Vector:** Using a publicly accessible Git repository to store sensitive application configurations.
                        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Public repositories are inherently insecure for sensitive data, allowing anyone to access and modify configurations.
                    *   **2.3.2.2. Branch protection policies not enforced or bypassed by Argo CD [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                        *   **Attack Vector:** Branch protection policies in the Git repository are not enforced by Argo CD or can be bypassed.
                        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Branch protection is designed to prevent direct modifications to critical branches. Bypassing this allows attackers to directly inject malicious changes.

    *   **2.4. Misconfigured Network Policies/Firewall Rules [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Network policies or firewall rules are misconfigured, allowing unauthorized network access to Argo CD components.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Network segmentation is crucial for security. Misconfigurations can expose Argo CD services to untrusted networks, increasing the attack surface.
            *   **2.4.1. Overly permissive network policies allowing unauthorized access to Argo CD components [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Network policies are too broad, allowing access from networks that should be restricted.
                *   **Why High-Risk:**  Violates the principle of least privilege in network access control.
            *   **2.4.2. Firewall rules misconfigured to expose Argo CD services unnecessarily [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Firewall rules are set up to expose Argo CD services (like the API server) to the internet or untrusted networks without proper justification.
                *   **Why High-Risk:**  Unnecessary exposure increases the risk of external attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Argo CD Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_argo_cd_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Directly exploiting security vulnerabilities within the Argo CD software itself.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Vulnerabilities in Argo CD can provide direct pathways for attackers to gain control over the system and managed applications.
    *   **3.1. Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Targeting publicly known vulnerabilities in Argo CD.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Known vulnerabilities are well-documented, and exploits are often readily available, making them easy to exploit if systems are not patched.
            *   **3.1.1. Unpatched Argo CD version with known vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Running an outdated version of Argo CD that contains known security flaws.
                *   **Why High-Risk:**  Organizations failing to patch software are easy targets for attackers exploiting known vulnerabilities.
            *   **3.1.2. Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Argo CD components (API Server, Repo Server, Application Controller, UI) [HIGH RISK PATH]::**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting specific, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in different components of Argo CD.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Public disclosure increases awareness and the likelihood of exploitation if patches are not applied promptly.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Compromise Argo CD Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__compromise_argo_cd_credentials__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Obtaining valid credentials for accessing Argo CD, either for service accounts or user accounts.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Valid credentials provide legitimate access to Argo CD, allowing attackers to bypass many security controls and perform actions as authorized users.
    *   **4.1. Credential Theft from Argo CD Components [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Stealing credentials used by Argo CD components (API Server, Repo Server, Application Controller, Database).
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Component credentials often grant broad access and can be used to directly control Argo CD and its underlying infrastructure.
            *   **4.1.1. Stealing API Server credentials [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Obtaining credentials used to authenticate to the Argo CD API server.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** API server credentials grant full control over the Argo CD API, allowing management of applications and configurations.
            *   **4.1.2. Stealing Repo Server credentials [HIGH RISK PATH]::**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Obtaining credentials used by the Argo CD Repo Server to access Git repositories.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Repo Server credentials allow access to application configurations in Git, enabling modification and potential backdoor injection.
            *   **4.1.3. Stealing Application Controller credentials [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Obtaining credentials used by the Argo CD Application Controller to interact with the Kubernetes API.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Application Controller credentials can grant access to the Kubernetes cluster where applications are deployed, potentially leading to cluster compromise.
            *   **4.1.4. Stealing Database credentials (if Argo CD uses external DB) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Obtaining credentials for the database used by Argo CD (if an external database is configured).
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Database credentials provide access to all Argo CD data, including application configurations, secrets, and user information.
