# Attack Surface Analysis for go-kit/kit

## Attack Surface: [Improper Request Decoding (Especially in Custom Decoders)](./attack_surfaces/improper_request_decoding__especially_in_custom_decoders_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from mishandling malformed or malicious input during the request decoding process, particularly when using custom decoders instead of standard (JSON, Protobuf) ones.
*   **How `go-kit/kit` Contributes:** `go-kit/kit` provides the framework for defining decoders (`transport/http.DecodeRequestFunc`, `transport/grpc`'s implicit Protobuf decoding).  The *implementation* of these decoders is where vulnerabilities can be introduced.  This is a *direct* contribution.
*   **Example:** A custom decoder that attempts to unmarshal a request body into an arbitrary struct without proper type checking or validation, leading to a potential RCE via unsafe deserialization.  Another example: a decoder that doesn't limit the size of the input, allowing for a DoS attack via a very large request.
*   **Impact:**  DoS, RCE, data breaches, injection attacks (SQLi, command injection, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible) or High (for DoS and injection attacks).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use standard decoders (JSON, Protobuf) whenever possible.
    *   If custom decoders are necessary, *rigorously* validate all input *before* and *after* decoding.  This includes:
        *   Type checking.
        *   Length limits.
        *   Whitelist-based validation of allowed values.
        *   Sanitization of data before using it in any sensitive operations.
    *   Use a robust input validation library.
    *   Implement resource limits (e.g., maximum request size).

## Attack Surface: [Incorrectly Implemented Middleware](./attack_surfaces/incorrectly_implemented_middleware.md)

*   **Description:**  Middleware components that introduce vulnerabilities due to logic errors, incorrect ordering, or bypassing security checks.
*   **How `go-kit/kit` Contributes:** `go-kit/kit`'s middleware pattern is a core feature.  The *implementation* of the middleware logic is where vulnerabilities are introduced. This is a *direct* contribution, as the framework enables and encourages the use of middleware.
*   **Example:** An authentication middleware that incorrectly handles errors, allowing unauthenticated requests to proceed.  Another example: a rate-limiting middleware that can be bypassed by manipulating request headers.  A logging middleware that logs sensitive data from requests.
*   **Impact:**  Bypassing security controls (authentication, authorization, rate limiting), data breaches, DoS.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the bypassed security control).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly test all middleware components, including edge cases and error conditions.
    *   Follow secure coding practices within middleware.
    *   Ensure correct ordering of middleware (e.g., authentication *before* authorization).
    *   Avoid logging sensitive data within middleware.
    *   Use well-vetted, open-source middleware libraries whenever possible, and keep them up-to-date.
    *   Implement robust error handling within middleware.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Transport Configuration (e.g., Weak TLS)](./attack_surfaces/improper_transport_configuration__e_g___weak_tls_.md)

*   **Description:**  Misconfiguration of transport-level settings, such as using weak TLS ciphers or protocols in the `transport/http` package.
*   **How `go-kit/kit` Contributes:** `go-kit/kit`'s `transport/http` and `transport/grpc` packages allow for configuration of the underlying transport mechanisms (e.g., `http.Server`, gRPC server options).  The framework *directly* provides the mechanisms for this configuration, making misconfiguration a direct risk.
*   **Example:**  Using `http.Server` with `TLSConfig` that allows outdated TLS versions or weak ciphers.  Not setting appropriate timeouts on the server.
*   **Impact:**  Man-in-the-middle attacks, data breaches, DoS.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong TLS configurations:
        *   Enforce TLS 1.2 or higher.
        *   Use a strong cipher suite.
        *   Disable insecure protocols and ciphers.
    *   Set appropriate timeouts (ReadTimeout, WriteTimeout, IdleTimeout) on the `http.Server`.
    *   Regularly review and update TLS configurations.
    *   Use a tool like `testssl.sh` to test the TLS configuration.
