# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for go-kit/kit

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit Endpoint Exposure Control (within go-kit/kit)](./mitigation_strategies/explicit_endpoint_exposure_control__within_go-kitkit_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **`go-kit/kit` Endpoint Definition Review:** Examine all uses of `endpoint.Endpoint` within the codebase.  Each of these represents a potential entry point into the service.
2.  **Transport-Specific Handler Separation:**  Within the `go-kit/kit` transport layer (e.g., `kithttp.NewServer`, `kitgrpc.NewServer`), ensure that public and internal endpoints are *not* mixed within the same handler.  Create separate `kithttp.Server` (or equivalent) instances for public and internal endpoints.  This leverages `go-kit/kit`'s own mechanisms for handling different sets of endpoints.
    ```go
    // Public endpoints (using kithttp)
    publicHandler := kithttp.NewServer(
        makePublicEndpoint(myService),
        decodePublicRequest,
        encodePublicResponse,
    )

    // Internal endpoints (using kithttp - separate instance)
    internalHandler := kithttp.NewServer(
        makeInternalEndpoint(myService),
        decodeInternalRequest,
        encodeInternalResponse,
    )
    ```
3.  **`go-kit/kit` Options for Security:** Utilize `go-kit/kit`'s server options (e.g., `kithttp.ServerErrorHandler`, `kithttp.ServerBefore`) to implement security-related logic *specifically* within the `go-kit/kit` framework.  For example, use `ServerErrorHandler` to customize error responses and avoid leaking internal details.  Use `ServerBefore` to perform authentication/authorization checks *before* the endpoint logic is executed.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unintentional Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Prevents internal `go-kit/kit` endpoints from being accidentally exposed through misconfiguration of the transport layer.
*   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Ensures that only intended public endpoints are accessible, reducing the attack surface within the `go-kit/kit` framework.

**Impact:**
*   **Unintentional Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low).
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. Public endpoints are handled using `kithttp.NewServer`. Internal endpoints are currently using the same `kithttp.NewServer` instance.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Separate `kithttp.NewServer` instances (or equivalent for other transports) need to be created for internal endpoints.  `go-kit/kit` server options (e.g., `ServerErrorHandler`, `ServerBefore`) should be used to implement security checks within the `go-kit/kit` framework.

## Mitigation Strategy: [go-kit/kit Middleware Configuration and Ordering](./mitigation_strategies/go-kitkit_middleware_configuration_and_ordering.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Middleware Inventory:**  List all middleware used with `go-kit/kit` endpoints (e.g., logging, tracing, rate limiting, authentication).
2.  **`go-kit/kit` Middleware Ordering:**  Carefully define the order in which middleware is applied using `endpoint.Chain`.  Ensure that security-critical middleware (authentication, authorization) is executed *before* other middleware (logging, tracing).  Incorrect ordering can create bypass vulnerabilities.
    ```go
    // Correct ordering: Authentication -> Rate Limiting -> Logging
    chainedEndpoint := endpoint.Chain(
        authMiddleware,
        ratelimitMiddleware,
        loggingMiddleware,
    )(myEndpoint)
    ```
3.  **`go-kit/kit` Logging Middleware Customization:**  Customize the `go-kit/kit/log` integration to ensure sensitive data is *never* logged.  This might involve creating a custom logger that wraps `go-kit/kit/log.Logger` and implements redaction logic.  This is *specifically* about configuring the logging *within* the `go-kit/kit` context.
4.  **`go-kit/kit` Rate Limiting Configuration:**  Use `go-kit/kit/ratelimit` to configure rate limiting *specifically* for `go-kit/kit` endpoints.  Choose an appropriate algorithm (token bucket, leaky bucket) and configure the limits based on the endpoint's sensitivity and expected traffic.
5. **`go-kit/kit` Circuit Breaker Configuration:** Use and properly configure `go-kit/kit/circuitbreaker` middleware to prevent cascading failures. Tune the thresholds and timeouts appropriately for your service's dependencies.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Authentication Bypass (High Severity):** Incorrect middleware ordering can allow unauthenticated requests to bypass security checks.
*   **Information Disclosure via Logs (Medium Severity):**  Improperly configured logging middleware can leak sensitive data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium to High Severity):**  Misconfigured or missing rate limiting can allow attackers to overwhelm the service.
*   **Cascading Failures (High Severity):** Misconfigured or missing circuit breaker can allow one service failure to take down the entire system.

**Impact:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low).
*   **Information Disclosure via Logs:** Risk significantly reduced (from Medium to Low).
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced (depending on rate limiting configuration).
*   **Cascading Failures:** Risk reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic logging middleware is used.  Middleware ordering is not explicitly defined or reviewed.  No custom redaction logic is in place for `go-kit/kit` logging. Rate limiting and circuit breaker are not implemented.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Explicit middleware ordering needs to be defined and enforced using `endpoint.Chain`.  The `go-kit/kit/log` integration needs to be customized to prevent sensitive data logging. `go-kit/kit/ratelimit` and `go-kit/kit/circuitbreaker` needs to be implemented and configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of go-kit/kit Errors](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_go-kitkit_errors.md)

**Description:**
1.  **`go-kit/kit` Error Response Customization:** Use `go-kit/kit`'s error handling mechanisms (e.g., `kithttp.ServerErrorEncoder`, `kitgrpc.ErrorResponseFunc`) to *customize* error responses sent to clients.  Avoid returning raw Go errors or internal implementation details.
    ```go
    // Example using kithttp.ServerErrorEncoder
    server := kithttp.NewServer(
        myEndpoint,
        decodeRequest,
        encodeResponse,
        kithttp.ServerErrorEncoder(func(ctx context.Context, err error, w http.ResponseWriter) {
            // Return a generic error message to the client
            w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
            w.Write([]byte("An internal error occurred."))
            // Log the detailed error internally
            level.Error(logger).Log("err", err)
        }),
    )
    ```
2.  **Consistent Error Handling within `go-kit/kit`:**  Ensure that all `go-kit/kit` components (endpoints, middleware, transport layers) handle errors consistently.  Use `go-kit/kit`'s recommended patterns for error propagation and reporting.
3. **Do not expose stack traces:** Ensure that stack traces are not exposed to the client.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure via Error Messages (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from gaining insights into the internal workings of the service by analyzing error messages.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure via Error Messages:** Risk significantly reduced (from Medium to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Default `go-kit/kit` error handling is used.  No custom error encoders or response functions are implemented.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Custom error encoders/response functions (e.g., `kithttp.ServerErrorEncoder`, `kitgrpc.ErrorResponseFunc`) need to be implemented to control the format and content of error responses sent to clients.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Custom go-kit/kit Transports and Encodings](./mitigation_strategies/secure_custom_go-kitkit_transports_and_encodings.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Avoid Custom Implementations (if possible):**  Prioritize using the built-in transports (HTTP, gRPC) and encodings (JSON, Protobuf) provided by `go-kit/kit`. These are generally well-tested and maintained.
2.  **Rigorous Code Review (if custom):** If a custom transport or encoding *must* be implemented, subject the code to *extremely* thorough code review, focusing on security aspects:
    *   **Input Validation:**  Validate all input received from the custom transport or encoding.
    *   **Buffer Handling:**  Ensure proper buffer management to prevent buffer overflows or other memory-related vulnerabilities.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Handle errors gracefully and avoid leaking sensitive information.
    *   **Cryptography (if applicable):** If the custom transport involves encryption or signing, use well-established cryptographic libraries and follow best practices.
3.  **Security Testing (if custom):** Perform dedicated security testing (e.g., fuzzing) on the custom transport or encoding implementation to identify potential vulnerabilities.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Various vulnerabilities depending on the custom implementation (High Severity):** Custom transports and encodings can introduce a wide range of vulnerabilities if not implemented securely. This includes injection attacks, buffer overflows, denial-of-service, and more.

**Impact:**
*   **Various vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced by thorough review and testing (but the risk remains higher than using standard components).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   The project currently uses the standard `kithttp` transport and JSON encoding.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No action needed currently, as no custom transports or encodings are used.  If custom implementations are added in the future, this mitigation strategy becomes critical.
