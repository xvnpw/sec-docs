# Threat Model Analysis for go-kit/kit

## Threat: [Endpoint Hijacking via Malicious Middleware](./threats/endpoint_hijacking_via_malicious_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts or compromises a custom middleware component *specifically designed to interact with go-kit's transport layer*. This malicious middleware intercepts incoming requests *before* they reach the intended `go-kit` endpoint handler. The attacker leverages the middleware's position within the `go-kit` request processing pipeline to modify the request, steal credentials passed through `go-kit` mechanisms, redirect the request, or inject code that executes within the application's context, *taking advantage of go-kit's request handling flow*.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application. The attacker gains full control over the affected endpoint, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized actions, and system compromise. This is critical because it bypasses *all* subsequent `go-kit` layers.
*   **Affected Kit Component:** `transport` layer (specifically, custom middleware implementations that hook into `go-kit`'s transport mechanisms), `endpoint` layer (as the intended `go-kit` endpoint is bypassed).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Code Review:** Mandatory, thorough code reviews for *all* custom middleware, with a focus on security implications, *specifically examining how the middleware interacts with go-kit's request/response lifecycle*.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use Go modules to track and update all middleware dependencies. Regularly check for security advisories related to used middleware, *paying close attention to any that integrate with go-kit*.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Middleware should only have the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation *before* any `go-kit` middleware processing.
    *   **Use Well-Vetted Middleware:** Prefer community-maintained, well-tested middleware *known to be compatible with go-kit* over custom implementations.

## Threat: [Context Manipulation for Impersonation](./threats/context_manipulation_for_impersonation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a `go-kit` middleware, endpoint, or service to modify the `context.Context` object *that is passed between go-kit components*. They inject values that impersonate another user or role, bypassing authentication or authorization checks that *rely on context data as managed by go-kit*. This leverages the central role of `context.Context` in `go-kit`'s design.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources and functionality. The attacker performs actions they are not permitted to, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized modifications. This is high severity because it abuses a core `go-kit` mechanism.
*   **Affected Kit Component:** `endpoint` layer, `service` layer, any `go-kit` middleware that modifies the `context.Context`. The `context.Context`, *as used within the go-kit framework*, is the primary vector.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Context Validation:** Treat `go-kit` context values as potentially untrusted. Validate any security-critical data extracted from the `go-kit` context *within* the service layer.
    *   **Strong Typing:** Use strongly-typed structures within the `go-kit` context for security-related data.
    *   **Independent Authorization:** Implement authorization checks *within* the service layer, *independent* of `go-kit` context values set by earlier components. Do *not* rely solely on the `go-kit` context for security.
    *   **Unexported Context Keys:** Use unexported context keys *as recommended by go-kit* to prevent accidental or malicious overwriting.
    *   **Avoid Sensitive Data in Context:** Minimize sensitive data stored directly in the `go-kit` context.

## Threat: [Request/Response Tampering via Middleware](./threats/requestresponse_tampering_via_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to endpoint hijacking, but a malicious `go-kit` middleware modifies the request or response body, headers, or other parameters *as they are processed by go-kit's transport layer*. This could lead to data corruption, injection of malicious data, or bypassing security controls *that rely on the integrity of the request/response as handled by go-kit*.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity violations, potential for code injection, unauthorized actions, and information disclosure. This is high severity due to the potential for widespread impact through a single compromised middleware.
*   **Affected Kit Component:** `transport` layer (specifically, custom middleware implementations interacting with `go-kit`'s transport mechanisms).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   (Same as Endpoint Hijacking - focus on `go-kit` middleware security)
    *   **Checksums/Signatures:** For critical data, consider checksums or digital signatures to verify integrity *between go-kit layers*.
    *   **Logging of Modifications:** Log any modifications made by `go-kit` middleware to requests or responses.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_logs.md)

*   **Description:** The application logs sensitive data due to careless logging practices *within go-kit components* (middleware, endpoints, or the service layer), *potentially using go-kit's logging facilities incorrectly*. This includes logging raw requests/responses, context values, or error details that contain sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, leading to potential account compromise, data breaches, and privacy violations. High severity due to the potential for widespread and persistent exposure.
*   **Affected Kit Component:** Any component that uses logging, *particularly if using go-kit's logging integrations or patterns* (`middleware`, `endpoint`, `service`, `transport`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Log Review:** Thoroughly review all logging statements *within go-kit components* to ensure they do not include sensitive information.
    *   **Data Redaction:** Use a logging library that supports redaction or masking, *especially if integrating with go-kit's logging*.
    *   **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize data *before* logging, *paying attention to data handled by go-kit*.
    *   **Structured Logging:** Use structured logging (e.g., JSON) *as recommended by go-kit* for easier filtering.
    *   **Log Level Management:** Use appropriate log levels to minimize sensitive data exposure in production.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass via Context Manipulation](./threats/authorization_bypass_via_context_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability to modify the `go-kit` `context.Context` and inject values that bypass authorization checks *that are implemented using go-kit's context propagation*. This is a specific type of elevation of privilege, directly targeting `go-kit`'s core mechanism.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, leading to data breaches or unauthorized modifications. High severity because it undermines `go-kit`'s intended use.
*   **Affected Kit Component:** `endpoint` layer, `service` layer, any `go-kit` middleware that modifies or relies on the `context.Context` for authorization.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   (Same as "Context Manipulation for Impersonation" - focus on independent authorization checks within the service layer, *not solely relying on go-kit's context*)
    *   **RBAC/ABAC:** Implement a robust authorization model (RBAC or ABAC) and enforce it consistently, *independent of the go-kit context*.
