## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Endpoint Layer -> Insecure Decoding -> [***JSON Vulnerabilities***]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_endpoint_layer_-_insecure_decoding_-__json_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles JSON input.  If the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize incoming JSON data before passing it to `go-kit`'s decoders (or any JSON parsing library), an attacker could inject malicious payloads.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **JSON Injection:** Injecting unexpected data types, exploiting type confusion, or using other JSON-specific attack techniques.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Sending extremely large or deeply nested JSON objects to consume excessive resources.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some cases, vulnerabilities in JSON parsing libraries or custom decoding logic can lead to RCE.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement robust input validation *before* decoding.
    *   Use a schema validation library (e.g., `go-playground/validator` or a JSON Schema validator).
    *   Enforce strict data types and formats.
    *   Avoid overly permissive decoding configurations.
    *   Test with fuzzing tools specifically targeting JSON payloads.
    *   Keep JSON parsing libraries up-to-date.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Endpoint Layer -> Bypass Middleware -> [Missing Checks]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_endpoint_layer_-_bypass_middleware_-__missing_checks_.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves bypassing security middleware that should be protecting endpoints.  If middleware is misconfigured, not applied to all relevant endpoints, or can be circumvented, an attacker can gain unauthorized access.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Missing Authentication Middleware:**  Accessing endpoints that should require authentication without providing any credentials.
    *   **Missing Authorization Middleware:**  Accessing resources that the authenticated user should not have permission to access.
    *   **Incorrectly Configured Middleware:**  Middleware that is present but doesn't function as intended (e.g., weak authentication checks, incorrect authorization rules).
    *   **Exploiting Middleware Logic Flaws:** Finding vulnerabilities in the middleware's own code to bypass its checks.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (with proper auditing and monitoring)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Ensure that *all* relevant endpoints are protected by appropriate middleware.
    *   Implement comprehensive tests to verify that middleware is correctly applied and cannot be bypassed.
    *   Use a consistent and well-defined middleware strategy.
    *   Regularly audit middleware configurations.
    *   Implement centralized authentication and authorization logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Transport Layer -> Transport-Level Auth Bypass -> [***Missing Auth***]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_transport_layer_-_transport-level_auth_bypass_-__missing_auth_.md)

*   **Description:** This path represents a complete lack of authentication at the transport layer (e.g., HTTP).  An attacker can directly access the application without providing any credentials.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **No TLS:**  Accessing the application over plain HTTP, allowing eavesdropping and modification of traffic.
    *   **Missing API Keys:**  Accessing endpoints that should require API keys without providing them.
    *   **Missing Client Certificates:**  Accessing endpoints that should require client certificates (mutual TLS) without providing them.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Ideally, this is a basic security measure)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Always use TLS for communication.
    *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms at the transport layer (e.g., mutual TLS, API keys, JWTs).
    *   Ensure that authentication is enforced *before* any `go-kit` processing occurs.
    *   Regularly audit transport-layer security configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Endpoint Layer -> [Improper Error Handling]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_endpoint_layer_-__improper_error_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves exploiting vulnerabilities related to how the application handles errors, both within endpoint handlers and potentially within middleware.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Information Leakage:**  Error messages that reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings (e.g., stack traces, database queries, internal file paths).
    *   **Logic Flaws:**  Incorrect error handling logic that allows requests to proceed further than they should, potentially bypassing security checks.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Triggering error conditions that consume excessive resources.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Return generic error messages to the client.
    *   Log detailed errors securely (without exposing sensitive information).
    *   Avoid any behavior that could reveal internal implementation details.
    *   Implement robust error handling logic that prevents requests from proceeding unexpectedly.
    *   Use a consistent error handling strategy throughout the application.
