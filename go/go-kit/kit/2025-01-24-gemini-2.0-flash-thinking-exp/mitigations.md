# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for go-kit/kit

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS/TLS for all HTTP Endpoints (go-kit `http` transport)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_httpstls_for_all_http_endpoints__go-kit__http__transport_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce HTTPS/TLS for all HTTP Endpoints (go-kit `http` transport)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain TLS Certificates:** Acquire valid TLS certificates for your domain or service.
    2.  **Configure `http.Server` in `go-kit`:** Within your `go-kit` service's `main.go` or transport setup, when creating your `http.Server` using `httptransport.NewServer`, ensure you configure it to listen on HTTPS. This typically involves using `http.ListenAndServeTLS` directly if you are managing the `http.Server` lifecycle yourself, or configuring TLS within your infrastructure (e.g., reverse proxy in front of `go-kit` service).
    3.  **Specify Certificate and Key Files:** Provide the paths to your TLS certificate and private key files when configuring `http.ListenAndServeTLS` or your reverse proxy.
    4.  **Enforce TLS Configuration:**  Within your `http.Server` configuration (or reverse proxy), enforce TLS version 1.2 or higher and use strong cipher suites.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents eavesdropping on communication handled by `go-kit`'s `http` transport.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Protects data transmitted via `go-kit`'s `http` transport from being intercepted.
*   **Impact:** **High Risk Reduction** for MITM attacks and data eavesdropping on `go-kit` HTTP endpoints.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented for the public API gateway (`api-gateway` service) which uses `go-kit`'s `http` transport.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Input Validation in go-kit Handlers](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_input_validation_in_go-kit_handlers.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Robust Input Validation in go-kit Handlers
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Input Schemas:** For each `go-kit` service endpoint handler, define clear input schemas that specify expected data types and formats.
    2.  **Validate within go-kit Handlers:** Inside your `go-kit` endpoint handlers (functions passed to `httptransport.NewServer` or `grpctransport.NewServer`), implement input validation logic *before* invoking your service logic.
    3.  **Utilize go-kit Context:** Leverage `go-kit`'s context to pass validated data to your service layer, ensuring only validated data is processed.
    4.  **Return Validation Errors via go-kit Response:** Use `go-kit`'s response encoders to return informative error responses (e.g., HTTP 400) when validation fails, clearly indicating the validation issues.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents injection vulnerabilities by validating inputs processed by `go-kit` handlers.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Ensures `go-kit` services operate on valid data, preventing unexpected behavior.
*   **Impact:** **Medium to High Risk Reduction** for injection attacks and data integrity within `go-kit` services.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some basic validation exists in `go-kit` handlers, but it's inconsistent and not schema-driven.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting Middleware in go-kit](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_middleware_in_go-kit.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Rate Limiting Middleware in go-kit
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create go-kit Middleware:** Develop `go-kit` middleware that implements rate limiting logic. This middleware will wrap your service endpoints.
    2.  **Apply Middleware to go-kit Endpoints:** Use `endpoint.Chain` in `go-kit` to apply the rate limiting middleware to your service endpoints during endpoint creation.
    3.  **Configure Rate Limits:** Define rate limits within the middleware configuration, potentially configurable via environment variables or configuration files.
    4.  **Handle Rate Limit Exceeded in Middleware:** The middleware should intercept requests exceeding the limit and return appropriate error responses (e.g., HTTP 429) using `go-kit`'s error handling mechanisms.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks (High Severity):** Protects `go-kit` services from being overwhelmed by excessive requests at the transport layer.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Limits the rate of attempts handled by `go-kit` endpoints.
*   **Impact:** **High Risk Reduction** for DoS/DDoS attacks targeting `go-kit` services. **Medium Risk Reduction** for brute-force attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in the `api-gateway` service using `go-kit` middleware for public endpoints.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure CORS Middleware in go-kit for Browser Clients
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use go-kit CORS Middleware:** Utilize a suitable CORS middleware for `go-kit` (or implement a custom one using `go-kit` middleware pattern).
    2.  **Apply CORS Middleware to HTTP Transport:** When creating your `httptransport.NewServer` in `go-kit`, wrap your endpoints with the CORS middleware using `endpoint.Chain` or within the `http.Handler` chain.
    3.  **Configure Allowed Origins in Middleware:** Configure the CORS middleware with a strict list of allowed origins, methods, and headers. **Avoid wildcard origins in production.**
    4.  **Handle Credentials Carefully:** If your `go-kit` service needs to handle credentials in cross-origin requests, configure `Allow-Credentials` in the CORS middleware with caution and ensure `Allow-Origin` is not a wildcard.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - Medium to High Severity:** Prevents CSRF attacks against browser-facing `go-kit` services.
    *   **Unauthorized Access from Untrusted Domains (Medium Severity):** Restricts browser-based access to `go-kit` APIs to trusted origins.
*   **Impact:** **Medium to High Risk Reduction** for CSRF and unauthorized browser access to `go-kit` services.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in `api-gateway` service using `go-kit` middleware.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable TLS for go-kit gRPC Server:** When creating your gRPC server using `grpctransport.NewServer` in `go-kit`, configure TLS options. This involves providing TLS certificate and key files to the gRPC server configuration.
    2.  **Implement Authentication Interceptors in go-kit:** Create gRPC interceptors within your `go-kit` service to handle authentication. This can involve verifying tokens in request metadata or implementing mutual TLS authentication.
    3.  **Apply Interceptors to go-kit gRPC Endpoints:** Use `grpctransport.ServerOption` to apply your authentication interceptors when creating the gRPC server in `go-kit`.
    4.  **Implement Authorization Logic in go-kit Services:** Within your `go-kit` service logic, implement authorization checks based on the authenticated identity obtained from the interceptors.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on gRPC (High Severity):** Secures gRPC communication within `go-kit` services.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping on gRPC (High Severity):** Protects gRPC data in transit within `go-kit` services.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to gRPC Services (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized clients from accessing `go-kit` gRPC services.
*   **Impact:** **High Risk Reduction** for MITM attacks, data eavesdropping, and unauthorized access to `go-kit` gRPC services.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented for gRPC communication between `order-service` and `payment-service` which are `go-kit` services.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Mutual TLS (mTLS) for go-kit Service-to-Service Communication](./mitigation_strategies/implement_mutual_tls__mtls__for_go-kit_service-to-service_communication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Mutual TLS (mTLS) for go-kit Service-to-Service Communication
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate Certificates for go-kit Services:** Generate unique TLS certificates for each `go-kit` microservice that will participate in mTLS.
    2.  **Configure mTLS in go-kit HTTP or gRPC Transports:** Configure both the client and server sides of your `go-kit` service communication to use mTLS. For HTTP, this involves configuring `tls.Config` in `http.Client` and `http.Server`. For gRPC, configure TLS credentials with client certificate verification enabled.
    3.  **Verify Client Certificates in go-kit Servers:** Configure `go-kit` servers (both HTTP and gRPC) to require and verify client certificates during TLS handshake.
    4.  **Distribute Certificates Securely:** Securely distribute client certificates to the `go-kit` services that need to initiate mTLS connections.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** Provides strong mutual authentication and encryption for service-to-service communication within `go-kit` architecture.
    *   **Service Impersonation (High Severity):** Prevents malicious services from impersonating legitimate `go-kit` services.
    *   **Unauthorized Service-to-Service Communication (High Severity):** Restricts communication to only mutually authenticated `go-kit` services.
*   **Impact:** **High Risk Reduction** for MITM attacks, service impersonation, and unauthorized service-to-service communication within `go-kit` microservices.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented for internal `go-kit` service communication.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize and Mask Sensitive Data in go-kit Logging](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_and_mask_sensitive_data_in_go-kit_logging.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize and Mask Sensitive Data in go-kit Logging
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Identify all types of sensitive data (PII, secrets, etc.) that might be logged by your `go-kit` services.
    2.  **Implement Sanitization/Masking in go-kit Logging:** Within your `go-kit` service's logging logic (e.g., using `log.Logger` from `go-kit/log`), implement mechanisms to automatically sanitize or mask sensitive data *before* it is logged. This could involve replacing sensitive values with placeholders or hashing them.
    3.  **Use Structured Logging:** Utilize structured logging formats (e.g., JSON) with `go-kit/log` to make it easier to filter and redact sensitive fields programmatically.
    4.  **Review Logs Regularly:** Periodically review logs generated by `go-kit` services to ensure sensitive data is not inadvertently being logged and that sanitization/masking is effective.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Leakage via Logs (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data in `go-kit` service logs.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Varies):** Helps meet compliance requirements related to handling and logging sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** **Medium to High Risk Reduction** for data leakage via logs generated by `go-kit` services.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not consistently implemented. Basic logging is present in `go-kit` services, but no systematic sanitization or masking of sensitive data is in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Protect Metrics Endpoints Exposed by go-kit](./mitigation_strategies/protect_metrics_endpoints_exposed_by_go-kit.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Protect Metrics Endpoints Exposed by go-kit
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict Access to Metrics Endpoint:** Configure your infrastructure (e.g., reverse proxy, firewall) to restrict access to the `/metrics` endpoint (or whichever endpoint your `go-kit` service exposes for metrics) to only authorized monitoring systems and personnel.
    2.  **Implement Authentication for Metrics Endpoint (Optional):** For more granular control, consider implementing authentication for the metrics endpoint itself within your `go-kit` service. This could be basic authentication or token-based authentication.
    3.  **Expose Metrics on Internal Network Only (Recommended):** Ideally, expose metrics endpoints only on your internal network, not directly to the public internet.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Metrics (Low to Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access to potentially sensitive internal system information exposed through metrics endpoints of `go-kit` services.
*   **Impact:** **Low to Medium Risk Reduction** for information disclosure via metrics from `go-kit` services.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not explicitly implemented. Metrics endpoints are currently exposed without specific access restrictions.
