## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Transport Layer Vulnerabilities (HTTP/gRPC) leading to Code Execution/Data Breach](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_transport_layer_vulnerabilities__httpgrpc__leading_to_code_executiondata_breach.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target weaknesses in how the application handles incoming requests over HTTP or gRPC. This can involve injecting malicious payloads through custom encoders/decoders that are not properly sanitizing input, exploiting misconfigurations in endpoint definitions that bypass authentication or authorization, or leveraging vulnerabilities in custom middleware/interceptors that handle authentication, authorization, or other security-sensitive logic.

**Why High-Risk:** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the application and potentially the underlying system. It can also result in direct access to sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Service Discovery Vulnerabilities leading to Service Disruption or Data Interception](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_service_discovery_vulnerabilities_leading_to_service_disruption_or_data_interception.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target the service discovery mechanism (e.g., Consul, etcd) used by the go-kit application. This can involve injecting false service endpoints into the registry, causing traffic intended for legitimate services to be redirected to malicious ones. Alternatively, attackers can impersonate legitimate services, intercepting communication and potentially stealing or manipulating data.

**Why High-Risk:** Compromising service discovery can disrupt the entire application by breaking communication between services. It also allows attackers to eavesdrop on sensitive data exchanged between services or manipulate that data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Endpoint/Service Definition Vulnerabilities leading to Data Breach/Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_endpointservice_definition_vulnerabilities_leading_to_data_breachcode_execution.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in how the application's endpoints are defined and how they handle input parameters. A common attack vector is insecure parameter handling, where user-supplied input is directly used in database queries (leading to SQL injection) or file paths (leading to path traversal). Lack of proper input validation can also lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

**Why High-Risk:** Successful exploitation can lead to direct access to the application's database, allowing attackers to steal or modify sensitive data. In some cases, it can also lead to remote code execution if vulnerabilities like command injection are present.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Transport Layer Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_transport_layer_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** This represents the initial point of entry for many attacks. If the transport layer (HTTP or gRPC) is compromised, attackers can bypass security controls and interact directly with the application's internal components.

**Why Critical:** A successful attack at this stage can have cascading effects, allowing attackers to exploit further vulnerabilities within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Input via Custom Encoders/Decoders](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_input_via_custom_encodersdecoders.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers implement custom logic for encoding and decoding request and response bodies. If this logic is flawed and doesn't properly sanitize or validate input, attackers can inject malicious data that is processed by the application, potentially leading to code execution or data breaches.

**Why Critical:** This is a direct path to code execution or data breaches, often relying on developer-introduced vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Endpoint Definition Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_endpoint_definition_weaknesses.md)

**Attack Vector:** If endpoint definitions are not properly secured with authentication and authorization middleware, attackers can bypass access controls and invoke sensitive operations without proper authorization.

**Why Critical:** This directly undermines the application's access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access to critical functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Custom Middleware Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_custom_middleware_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers implement custom middleware for various purposes, including security. Vulnerabilities in this custom middleware (e.g., authentication bypass, insecure logging) can be exploited to bypass intended security measures.

**Why Critical:** Custom middleware often handles crucial security logic, and vulnerabilities here can have a significant impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Input via Protobuf Handling](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_input_via_protobuf_handling.md)

**Attack Vector:** Similar to custom encoders/decoders, vulnerabilities in how the application parses and handles protobuf messages can allow attackers to inject malicious data, leading to code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Why Critical:** Protobuf is a common serialization format for gRPC, and vulnerabilities in its handling can have severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Custom Interceptor Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_custom_interceptor_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Similar to custom middleware, vulnerabilities in developer-implemented gRPC interceptors can bypass intended security measures.

**Why Critical:** Custom interceptors often handle crucial security logic for gRPC communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Service Discovery Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_service_discovery_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** This represents a critical point of failure in a microservice architecture. If the service discovery mechanism is compromised, attackers can disrupt communication between services, intercept data, or impersonate services.

**Why Critical:** Service discovery is fundamental to the operation of a microservice application, and its compromise can have widespread impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Service Registry Data](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_service_registry_data.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the service registry is not properly secured, attackers can directly modify the registry data, injecting false service endpoints and redirecting traffic.

**Why Critical:** This allows attackers to control the flow of communication within the application, leading to service disruption or data interception.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Endpoint/Service Definition Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_endpointservice_definition_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** This represents a fundamental flaw in how the application exposes its functionality. Vulnerabilities here can allow attackers to directly interact with sensitive operations in unintended ways.

**Why Critical:** This is a broad category encompassing various vulnerabilities that can have significant impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Parameter Handling](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_parameter_handling.md)

**Attack Vector:** Failure to properly sanitize and validate input parameters in endpoint handlers can lead to common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, path traversal, and command injection.

**Why Critical:** These are well-known and often easily exploitable vulnerabilities that can have severe consequences, including data breaches and remote code execution.
