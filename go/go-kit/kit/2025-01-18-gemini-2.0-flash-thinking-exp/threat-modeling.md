# Threat Model Analysis for go-kit/kit

## Threat: [Insufficient TLS Configuration](./threats/insufficient_tls_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker could intercept communication between the client and the Go-Kit application (Man-in-the-Middle attack) if TLS is not properly configured. This includes using weak ciphers, outdated TLS versions, or invalid certificates. While the underlying TLS is handled by Go's standard library, the *configuration* within the Go-Kit `transport/http` is the relevant point.

**Impact:** Confidential data transmitted between the client and server (including authentication credentials, personal information, etc.) could be exposed to the attacker.

**Affected Go-Kit Component:** `transport/http` (specifically the parts handling TLS configuration, often relying on standard Go libraries like `crypto/tls` but configured within Go-Kit's HTTP server setup).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce HTTPS and disable HTTP within the Go-Kit HTTP server configuration.
*   Use strong TLS ciphers and disable weak or outdated ones when configuring the `http.Server`.
*   Ensure valid and up-to-date TLS certificates are provided to the `http.Server`.
*   Configure the server to use the latest recommended TLS protocol versions.
*   Regularly review and update TLS configurations.

## Threat: [Lack of gRPC Authentication/Authorization](./threats/lack_of_grpc_authenticationauthorization.md)

**Description:** An attacker could access gRPC services without proper authentication or authorization if these mechanisms are not implemented in the Go-Kit gRPC transport. Go-Kit provides the framework for building these mechanisms, but the developer is responsible for implementing them.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality provided by the gRPC services.

**Affected Go-Kit Component:** `transport/grpc` (specifically the interceptors or middleware that *should* be implemented using Go-Kit's gRPC support for authentication and authorization).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, JWT, mutual TLS) using Go-Kit's gRPC interceptor capabilities.
*   Implement fine-grained authorization controls to restrict access based on user roles or permissions, leveraging Go-Kit's context propagation features.
*   Use gRPC interceptors provided by Go-Kit to enforce authentication and authorization for all service calls.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data in Logs](./threats/sensitive_data_in_logs.md)

**Description:** Go-Kit's logging abstraction, if not configured carefully, can inadvertently log sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, or personal data. This data could be exposed if the logs are compromised. While the underlying logging might be a third-party library, the way Go-Kit's `log` package is used can contribute to this.

**Impact:** Data breaches and privacy violations.

**Affected Go-Kit Component:** `log` package (and any custom logging implementations used with Go-Kit's `log.Logger` interface).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid logging sensitive data directly through the Go-Kit logger.
*   Implement custom logging wrappers or middleware to redact or mask sensitive information before passing it to the underlying logger.
*   Securely store and manage log files.
*   Regularly review log configurations and content within the Go-Kit application.
