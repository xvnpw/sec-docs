# Attack Surface Analysis for go-kit/kit

## Attack Surface: [Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/serializationdeserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploiting flaws in how data is converted between different formats (e.g., JSON, Protobuf) during request and response processing. Vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

**How Kit Contributes:** `go-kit`'s architecture relies on standard Go libraries (like `encoding/json`, `protobuf`) for serialization/deserialization within its transport layers (HTTP, gRPC). The choice of transport and how `go-kit` handles request decoding and response encoding directly exposes the application to vulnerabilities in these processes, especially when dealing with untrusted input.

**Example:** An attacker sends a crafted JSON payload to an HTTP endpoint handled by a `go-kit` service. A vulnerability in the JSON deserialization process, within the `go-kit` request handling pipeline, allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:** Critical - Potential for remote code execution, data breaches, and complete system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Go and all dependencies, including serialization libraries, updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input data *before* it reaches `go-kit`'s decoding mechanisms.
*   Avoid using custom serialization/deserialization logic within `go-kit` services unless absolutely necessary and ensure it is rigorously tested for security vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using safer serialization formats or libraries if the default ones have known vulnerabilities and `go-kit` allows for such customization.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Endpoint Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_endpoint_exposure.md)

**Description:** Accessing service endpoints without proper authentication or authorization, allowing unauthorized users to interact with sensitive functionalities.

**How Kit Contributes:** `go-kit`'s design makes it straightforward to define and expose multiple endpoints for a service. The responsibility of securing these endpoints falls on the developer. If authentication and authorization middleware are not implemented within the `go-kit` service definition, these endpoints are inherently vulnerable.

**Example:** A `go-kit` service defines an endpoint `/admin/users/delete` using `go-kit`'s routing capabilities. If no authentication or authorization middleware is added to this endpoint within the `go-kit` service definition, an attacker can directly access it and delete user accounts.

**Impact:** High - Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or execution of privileged actions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0) using `go-kit`'s middleware capabilities. Apply this middleware to all sensitive endpoints.
*   Enforce authorization policies within `go-kit` middleware to control access based on user roles or permissions.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining and exposing endpoints within `go-kit` services.
*   Regularly review and audit exposed endpoints and their associated middleware configurations in `go-kit`.

## Attack Surface: [Service Registry Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/service_registry_poisoning.md)

**Description:** Manipulating the service registry used by `go-kit` (e.g., Consul, Eureka) to redirect traffic to malicious instances or disrupt service discovery.

**How Kit Contributes:** `go-kit`'s integration with service discovery systems is a core feature for building microservices. `go-kit` clients rely on the service registry to locate and communicate with other services. If this registry is compromised, `go-kit` services will unknowingly connect to malicious instances.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the Consul server used by a `go-kit` application. They register a malicious service instance with the same name as a legitimate service that `go-kit` clients are configured to discover. Subsequent requests from `go-kit` services are routed to the attacker's server.

**Impact:** High - Man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception, denial of service, and potential for further compromise of internal systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the service registry itself with strong authentication and authorization, independent of `go-kit`.
*   Use mutual TLS (mTLS) for communication between `go-kit` services and the service registry to verify identities.
*   Implement mechanisms within `go-kit` clients to verify the authenticity and integrity of service instances discovered through the registry (e.g., through signed certificates or checksums).
*   Monitor the service registry for unexpected changes or registrations that could indicate an attack.
