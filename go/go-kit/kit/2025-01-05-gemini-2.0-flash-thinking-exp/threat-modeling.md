# Threat Model Analysis for go-kit/kit

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass due to Middleware Misconfiguration](./threats/authentication_bypass_due_to_middleware_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a misconfiguration in authentication middleware (either provided by `go-kit/kit`'s examples or custom implementations) to bypass authentication checks. This could involve incorrect header parsing, flawed token validation, or missing authentication checks on certain endpoints facilitated by `go-kit/kit`'s transport mechanisms. The attacker can then access protected resources or perform actions without proper authorization.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to perform privileged actions, potential for data manipulation or deletion.

**Affected Component:** `auth` package examples, custom authentication middleware using `kit/transport/http` or `kit/transport/grpc` middleware patterns.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly review and test authentication middleware configurations provided by or built upon `go-kit/kit` patterns.
*   Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests specifically for authentication logic within `go-kit/kit`'s transport layers.
*   Follow established security best practices for authentication and authorization when implementing middleware with `go-kit/kit`.
*   Ensure all endpoints requiring authentication are properly protected by the middleware within the `go-kit/kit` application.
*   Consider using well-vetted and maintained authentication libraries integrated with `go-kit/kit`.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Verbose Logging](./threats/information_disclosure_via_verbose_logging.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to application logs (either through compromised systems, misconfigured logging infrastructure, or insider access) and discovers sensitive information that was inadvertently logged by `go-kit/kit`'s logging integrations or custom logging middleware built using `kit/log` interfaces. This could include API keys, user credentials, internal service endpoints, or other confidential data handled by the `go-kit/kit` application.

**Impact:** Compromise of user accounts, unauthorized access to internal systems, data breaches, violation of privacy regulations.

**Affected Component:** `log` package, custom logging middleware using `kit/log` interfaces.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict policies on what data is logged within `go-kit/kit` applications.
*   Utilize structured logging provided by or compatible with `go-kit/kit` to facilitate easier redaction and analysis.
*   Configure logging middleware to redact sensitive information before logging, especially when using `go-kit/kit`'s transport layers.
*   Secure log storage and restrict access to authorized personnel only for logs generated by `go-kit/kit` applications.
*   Regularly review log configurations and log output for potential leaks within the `go-kit/kit` application's logging setup.

## Threat: [Exposure of Internal Details via Error Responses](./threats/exposure_of_internal_details_via_error_responses.md)

**Description:** An attacker triggers errors in the application, and the `go-kit/kit` transport layer (HTTP or gRPC) returns error responses that contain excessive internal details, such as stack traces, internal error messages, or database query details handled within the `go-kit/kit` service. This information can aid the attacker in understanding the application's architecture, identifying vulnerabilities, and crafting more targeted attacks against the `go-kit/kit` service.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, aiding reconnaissance efforts for further attacks against the `go-kit/kit` application.

**Affected Component:** `transport/http` error encoding, `transport/grpc` error encoding.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement custom error encoders within `go-kit/kit`'s transport layers that sanitize error responses and avoid exposing sensitive internal information.
*   Log detailed error information on the server-side for debugging purposes within the `go-kit/kit` service, but do not expose it directly to clients.
*   Return generic error messages to clients from the `go-kit/kit` service while providing more specific details in internal logs.

## Threat: [Metrics and Tracing Data Leakage](./threats/metrics_and_tracing_data_leakage.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to metrics or tracing data exposed by `go-kit/kit`'s observability integrations (e.g., Prometheus, Zipkin). This data, collected and exposed through `go-kit/kit`'s mechanisms, can reveal insights into the application's performance, internal state, and potentially even security vulnerabilities if certain metrics or traces expose sensitive information or patterns related to the `go-kit/kit` service.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for identifying performance bottlenecks or vulnerabilities within the `go-kit/kit` application, understanding application behavior for malicious purposes.

**Affected Component:** `metrics` package, `tracing` package, specific metrics and tracing integrations (e.g., `prometheus`, `zipkin`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement authentication and authorization for accessing metrics and tracing endpoints exposed by the `go-kit/kit` application.
*   Be mindful of the level of detail exposed in metrics and traces collected and managed by `go-kit/kit`. Avoid exposing sensitive business logic or data patterns.
*   Secure the infrastructure where metrics and tracing data from the `go-kit/kit` application is stored and processed.
