# Attack Surface Analysis for go-kit/kit

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Custom Encoders/Decoders](./attack_surfaces/insecure_custom_encodersdecoders.md)

*   **Description:**  Developers implement custom logic for encoding requests and decoding responses for various transports (HTTP, gRPC). If this logic is flawed, it can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Kit Contributes:** `go-kit` provides the flexibility to define custom encoders and decoders through its transport abstractions. This places the responsibility for secure implementation on the developer, and vulnerabilities here are directly tied to how `go-kit` facilitates this customization.
    *   **Example:** A custom HTTP decoder for a JSON request might not properly sanitize input, leading to vulnerabilities if this data is later used in database queries or other sensitive operations. A custom gRPC decoder might be vulnerable to deserialization attacks if it doesn't validate the incoming data structure.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data injection, data corruption, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test custom encoder/decoder implementations.
        *   Utilize well-established and secure serialization libraries.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the decoder logic.
        *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data without strict validation.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured or Vulnerable Middleware](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_or_vulnerable_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** Middleware components in `go-kit` intercept and process requests/responses. Incorrect configuration or vulnerabilities within *custom* middleware can create security holes. While built-in middleware vulnerabilities are possible, the direct contribution of `go-kit` lies in its middleware chaining mechanism and the potential for flaws in *user-defined* middleware.
    *   **How Kit Contributes:** `go-kit`'s architecture heavily relies on middleware for cross-cutting concerns. The framework provides the structure for middleware chaining, and vulnerabilities in custom middleware built using this structure are directly related to `go-kit`'s design.
    *   **Example:** An authentication middleware implemented using `go-kit`'s middleware pattern might have a flaw allowing bypass under certain conditions.
    *   **Impact:** Authentication/Authorization bypass, information disclosure, cross-site scripting (if related to response manipulation), denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (when vulnerabilities in authentication or authorization middleware are present).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly audit and test custom middleware implementations for vulnerabilities.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege when designing and implementing middleware.
        *   Keep dependencies used within custom middleware up-to-date.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Service Discovery Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_service_discovery_communication.md)

*   **Description:**  `go-kit` often integrates with service discovery systems (like Consul, etcd). If the communication with these systems is not secured, it can be compromised.
    *   **How Kit Contributes:** `go-kit` provides integrations for various service discovery mechanisms. The configuration of these integrations, particularly regarding secure communication, is a direct aspect of how `go-kit` is used.
    *   **Example:**  If the connection to Consul is not using TLS, an attacker on the network could intercept service registration information and potentially redirect traffic to malicious services.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, redirection to malicious services, denial of service by manipulating service registry.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use TLS/HTTPS for communication with service discovery systems.
        *   Implement proper authentication and authorization when interacting with the service registry.
        *   Secure the service discovery infrastructure itself.
