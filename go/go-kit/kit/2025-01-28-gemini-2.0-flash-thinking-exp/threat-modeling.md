# Threat Model Analysis for go-kit/kit

## Threat: [Insecure Transport Configuration (HTTP)](./threats/insecure_transport_configuration__http_.md)

**Description:** Attacker intercepts communication by exploiting missing or weak TLS configuration in Go-Kit's HTTP transport. They can eavesdrop on sensitive data, modify requests/responses, or impersonate parties.
**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data integrity compromise, service disruption, reputational damage.
**Affected Kit Component:** `transport/http` module (server and client options).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce TLS for all HTTP endpoints using `httptransport.ServerOptions` and `httptransport.ClientOptions`.
*   Utilize strong TLS cipher suites and protocols.
*   Implement proper certificate management and rotation.
*   Regularly audit TLS configurations.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Transport Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_transport_libraries.md)

**Description:** Attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Go's standard libraries (`net/http`, `google.golang.org/grpc`) or third-party libraries used by Go-Kit for transport. This can lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
**Impact:** Potentially critical system compromise, wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability.
**Affected Kit Component:** `transport/http`, `transport/grpc`, `transport/thrift` modules, and underlying Go standard libraries.
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Go version updated to the latest stable release.
*   Regularly update all Go dependencies, including transport libraries.
*   Monitor security advisories for Go and relevant libraries.
*   Implement vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipelines.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass due to Middleware Misconfiguration](./threats/authorization_bypass_due_to_middleware_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** Attacker bypasses authorization checks due to misconfigured or flawed authorization middleware in Go-Kit. This allows unauthorized access to protected endpoints and resources, leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities, privilege escalation, data breaches.
**Affected Kit Component:** Middleware chain, `endpoint.Endpoint` definition, custom authorization middleware.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly test authorization middleware logic and configuration.
*   Ensure authorization middleware is correctly applied to all protected endpoints.
*   Use well-tested and reviewed authorization middleware libraries or patterns.
*   Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for authorization logic.

## Threat: [Insecure Service Discovery Communication](./threats/insecure_service_discovery_communication.md)

**Description:** Attacker intercepts or manipulates communication between Go-Kit services and service discovery systems (e.g., Consul, etcd) if not secured. They can disrupt service registration, redirect traffic, or gain information about the service topology, potentially leading to service disruption or unauthorized access.
**Impact:** Service disruption, man-in-the-middle attacks, potential unauthorized access, information disclosure about service infrastructure.
**Affected Kit Component:** `sd` package, service discovery integrations (e.g., Consul, etcd registrators).
**Risk Severity:** High (when communication is not secured)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure communication channels with service discovery systems using TLS/SSL and authentication.
*   Implement access control policies for service discovery systems.
*   Use encrypted communication for service registration and discovery.

## Threat: [Service Impersonation or Spoofing](./threats/service_impersonation_or_spoofing.md)

**Description:** Attacker deploys a rogue service that impersonates a legitimate Go-Kit service. Without proper inter-service authentication, the rogue service can intercept requests, steal data, or disrupt operations by responding maliciously.
**Impact:** Data breaches, service disruption, man-in-the-middle attacks, unauthorized actions performed under the guise of a legitimate service.
**Affected Kit Component:** Inter-service communication mechanisms, potentially `sd` package for routing.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for inter-service communication to authenticate both client and server services.
*   Utilize service mesh technologies that provide secure service-to-service authentication and authorization.
*   Verify service identities during communication using cryptographic methods.

## Threat: [Vulnerable or Malicious Middleware](./threats/vulnerable_or_malicious_middleware.md)

**Description:** Attacker exploits vulnerabilities in third-party or custom middleware used in Go-Kit applications. Malicious middleware could be intentionally designed to compromise security. This can lead to various attacks depending on the middleware's functionality and vulnerabilities, potentially leading to critical system compromise.
**Impact:** Wide range of impacts, potentially critical system compromise, data breaches, service disruption.
**Affected Kit Component:** Middleware chain, custom middleware implementations, third-party middleware libraries.
**Risk Severity:** High (when vulnerabilities are present or middleware is malicious)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully vet and review all middleware components, especially third-party ones.
*   Keep middleware libraries updated to the latest versions.
*   Implement security testing for custom middleware.
*   Follow secure coding practices when developing middleware.
*   Regularly audit middleware dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
