# Attack Surface Analysis for go-kit/kit

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (gRPC/Thrift Transport)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities__grpcthrift_transport_.md)

## Description:
Exploiting flaws in the deserialization process of data formats like Protocol Buffers (gRPC) or Thrift, potentially leading to remote code execution or denial of service.
## How Kit Contributes:
Go-Kit supports gRPC and Thrift transports, relying on their respective serialization libraries. Vulnerabilities in these libraries or custom deserialization logic within Go-Kit services become attack vectors.  If developers introduce custom deserialization within Go-Kit endpoints, they inherit the risks.
## Example:
A vulnerability in the Protobuf library allows an attacker to craft a malicious Protobuf message that, when deserialized by a Go-Kit gRPC service, triggers a buffer overflow and leads to remote code execution.
## Impact:
Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), data corruption.
## Risk Severity:
Critical
## Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Use latest versions of serialization libraries:** Keep Protobuf, Thrift, and Go-Kit dependencies updated to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
*   **Input validation before deserialization:**  Perform basic validation on the raw input data *before* passing it to the deserialization process within Go-Kit endpoint logic to filter out potentially malicious payloads.
*   **Limit message size:** Enforce limits on the size of incoming messages within Go-Kit transport configuration to prevent resource exhaustion and potential buffer overflows during deserialization.
*   **Avoid custom deserialization logic:** Minimize or avoid implementing custom deserialization logic within Go-Kit services, relying on well-vetted libraries.

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data Logging (Logging Middleware)](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_logging__logging_middleware_.md)

## Description:
Logging middleware inadvertently logs sensitive information like user credentials, API keys, or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) into application logs.
## How Kit Contributes:
Go-Kit's logging middleware, if used, can be configured to log request and response details.  Default or careless configuration can easily lead to logging sensitive data present in requests or responses handled by Go-Kit endpoints.
## Example:
Logging middleware is configured to log the entire request body for debugging purposes in development. This configuration is accidentally deployed to production, and requests containing user passwords in plain text are logged, creating a significant data breach risk.
## Impact:
Data Breach, Privacy violation, compliance issues.
## Risk Severity:
High
## Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Filter sensitive data in logging middleware:** Configure Go-Kit's logging middleware to specifically redact or mask sensitive data fields (e.g., passwords, API keys, credit card numbers) before logging. Implement this redaction within the middleware itself.
*   **Log only necessary information:**  Minimize the amount of data logged by Go-Kit middleware to only what is essential for debugging and monitoring. Avoid logging full request/response bodies in production unless absolutely necessary and with careful redaction.
*   **Secure log storage:** Ensure logs generated by Go-Kit applications are stored in secure locations with appropriate access controls and encryption.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass (Middleware Misconfiguration)](./attack_surfaces/authenticationauthorization_bypass__middleware_misconfiguration_.md)

## Description:
Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in authentication and authorization middleware allow unauthorized users to access protected endpoints or perform actions they are not permitted to.
## How Kit Contributes:
Go-Kit's middleware-centric architecture heavily relies on middleware for implementing authentication and authorization. Incorrectly implemented or configured middleware within Go-Kit services directly leads to bypass vulnerabilities. Developers are responsible for correctly using and configuring these middleware components.
## Example:
An authentication middleware in a Go-Kit service is intended to verify JWT tokens. However, due to a coding error in the middleware logic, it incorrectly validates tokens or fails to handle certain error conditions, allowing attackers to bypass authentication and access protected endpoints without proper credentials.
## Impact:
Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches, privilege escalation, data manipulation.
## Risk Severity:
Critical
## Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Use well-vetted authentication/authorization libraries and middleware:** Utilize established and security-audited libraries and pre-built Go-Kit middleware components for authentication and authorization logic whenever possible. Avoid writing custom, potentially flawed, security middleware from scratch.
*   **Thoroughly test middleware configuration and logic:**  Rigorous unit and integration testing of authentication and authorization middleware within Go-Kit services is crucial to identify bypass vulnerabilities. Include negative test cases to verify proper failure handling.
*   **Principle of least privilege in authorization middleware:** Implement authorization policies within Go-Kit middleware based on the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary permissions and roles.
*   **Regular security audits of middleware:** Conduct regular security audits specifically focusing on authentication and authorization middleware implementations and configurations within Go-Kit applications.

## Attack Surface: [Service Registry Poisoning (Service Discovery Integration)](./attack_surfaces/service_registry_poisoning__service_discovery_integration_.md)

## Description:
Attackers compromise the service registry (e.g., Consul, etcd) and register malicious service endpoints, redirecting traffic intended for legitimate services to attacker-controlled services.
## How Kit Contributes:
Go-Kit is often used to build microservices that rely on service discovery. If Go-Kit services are configured to dynamically discover endpoints from a compromised service registry, they can be tricked into connecting to malicious services. Go-Kit's client-side service discovery mechanisms are vulnerable if the registry is compromised.
## Example:
An attacker gains unauthorized write access to a Consul service registry used by a Go-Kit application. They register a malicious endpoint for a critical service (e.g., payment processing). Go-Kit services, upon refreshing their service endpoint list from Consul, now receive the malicious endpoint and start routing requests, including sensitive payment data, to the attacker's service.
## Impact:
Data breaches, service disruption, man-in-the-middle attacks, complete compromise of application functionality, supply chain attack if malicious service is further propagated.
## Risk Severity:
Critical
## Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Secure service registry access:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to the service registry itself (Consul, etcd, etc.). Restrict write access to the registry to only authorized and secured systems.
*   **Mutual TLS for registry communication:** Use mutual TLS (mTLS) to encrypt and authenticate communication between Go-Kit services and the service registry, preventing unauthorized interception or modification of registry data in transit.
*   **Input validation and integrity checks on registry data:** Implement validation and integrity checks within Go-Kit clients on data retrieved from the service registry. Verify service endpoint data against expected formats and potentially use signatures or checksums to ensure data integrity.
*   **Monitoring and alerting for registry changes:** Monitor the service registry for unexpected changes or registrations of unknown services and set up alerts for suspicious activity.  Implement automated responses to revert or flag suspicious registry modifications.
