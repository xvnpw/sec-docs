## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Man-in-the-Middle Attack to intercept sensitive data.](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_man-in-the-middle_attack_to_intercept_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Critical Node: Weak TLS/SSL Configuration:**
    *   **Attack Vector:**  If TLS/SSL is misconfigured (e.g., using outdated ciphers, weak protocols, or no HSTS), an attacker positioned on the network path between the client and the Go-Kit application can intercept and decrypt the communication.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, sensitive data (credentials, personal information, business data) can be exposed to the attacker.
    *   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong TLS configurations, use up-to-date ciphers and protocols, implement HSTS, regularly audit TLS configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Denial of Service (DoS) attack by overwhelming the service with requests.](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_denial_of_service__dos__attack_by_overwhelming_the_service_with_requests.md)

*   **Critical Node: Lack of Request Rate Limiting at Transport Level:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Without transport-level rate limiting, an attacker can send a large volume of requests to the Go-Kit application, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and causing service unavailability for legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, application downtime, business impact due to unavailability.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust rate limiting at the transport layer (e.g., using middleware or load balancers) to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given time frame.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Data Breach, Data Manipulation, Privilege Escalation.](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_data_breach__data_manipulation__privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Critical Node: SQL Injection:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If endpoint handlers do not properly sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code. This code can be executed by the database, allowing the attacker to bypass security controls, access sensitive data, modify data, or even gain administrative privileges on the database server.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, loss of data integrity, unauthorized data modification, potential full database compromise.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks to prevent SQL injection, implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data used in database queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_remote_code_execution__rce__on_the_server.md)

*   **Critical Node: Command Injection:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If endpoint handlers execute external system commands based on user-provided input without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands. These commands will be executed on the server with the privileges of the application, potentially allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, attacker can execute arbitrary code, install malware, steal data, disrupt services.
    *   **Mitigation:** Avoid executing external commands based on user input if possible. If necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization, use secure command execution methods, and minimize the privileges of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Gain administrative control over the application.](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_gain_administrative_control_over_the_application.md)

*   **Critical Node: Publicly exposed administrative endpoints without proper authentication:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If administrative endpoints (used for configuration, management, or monitoring) are exposed publicly without proper authentication, an attacker can directly access these endpoints. This allows them to bypass normal access controls and gain administrative privileges over the Go-Kit application.
    *   **Impact:** Full administrative control, attacker can modify application configuration, access sensitive data, disrupt services, potentially compromise the underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Mitigation:** Ensure administrative endpoints are not publicly accessible. Implement strong authentication and authorization for all administrative endpoints, restrict access to authorized personnel or internal networks.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Bypass access controls and access resources or functionalities without proper authorization.](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_bypass_access_controls_and_access_resources_or_functionalities_without_proper_authori_fea281ed.md)

*   **Critical Node: Lack of Authorization Checks in Endpoints:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If endpoint handlers lack proper authorization checks, attackers can bypass intended access controls. They can directly access resources or functionalities they are not supposed to access, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or actions.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities, data breaches, data manipulation, privilege escalation.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust authorization checks in all endpoint handlers. Use Go-Kit middleware to enforce authorization policies, ensure consistent authorization logic across all endpoints, and follow the principle of least privilege.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access.](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_bypass_authentication_and_gain_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Critical Node: Flaws in Custom Authentication Middleware Implementation:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If custom authentication middleware is implemented with logic errors or vulnerabilities, attackers can find ways to bypass the authentication process. This could involve exploiting logic flaws in the authentication checks, bypassing token validation, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the middleware code itself.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application, account compromise, data breaches, unauthorized actions.
    *   **Mitigation:** Thoroughly review and test custom authentication middleware code, use well-vetted authentication libraries, follow secure coding practices, and conduct penetration testing to identify bypass vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Steal credentials and gain unauthorized access.](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_steal_credentials_and_gain_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Critical Node: Insecure storage or handling of authentication credentials:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If authentication credentials (passwords, API keys, tokens) are stored insecurely (e.g., in plain text, weakly hashed, in code repositories) or handled improperly (e.g., logged excessively), attackers can steal these credentials. Stolen credentials can then be used to gain unauthorized access to the application as legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, unauthorized access, data breaches, unauthorized actions.
    *   **Mitigation:** Never store credentials in plain text. Use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with salt for password storage. Store API keys and other secrets securely using dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider secret managers). Avoid logging sensitive credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Information Disclosure through log files.](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_information_disclosure_through_log_files.md)

*   **Critical Node: Excessive logging of sensitive data:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If logging middleware is configured to log excessive amounts of data, including sensitive information (passwords, API keys, PII, etc.), this sensitive data can be exposed in log files. If these log files are not properly secured, attackers can gain access to them and extract the sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive data, privacy violations, potential for further attacks using leaked credentials or PII.
    *   **Mitigation:** Carefully configure logging middleware to avoid logging sensitive data. Implement data masking or redaction for sensitive information in logs. Securely store and manage log files, restrict access to authorized personnel only.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Modify service registrations, redirect traffic to malicious services, or perform service disruption.](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_modify_service_registrations__redirect_traffic_to_malicious_services__or_perform_serv_f19b57c6.md)

*   **Critical Node: Unauthenticated access to service discovery backend:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If the service discovery backend (e.g., Consul, etcd) is not properly secured and allows unauthenticated access, attackers can directly interact with it. They can modify service registrations, potentially redirecting traffic intended for legitimate Go-Kit services to malicious services under their control. They can also disrupt service discovery, leading to service unavailability.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, redirection of traffic to malicious services (potentially for phishing or data theft), widespread application impact.
    *   **Mitigation:** Secure the service discovery backend with strong authentication and authorization. Restrict access to the service discovery backend to only authorized services and personnel. Regularly audit service registrations for anomalies.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit known vulnerabilities in Go-Kit dependencies for various impacts (DoS, RCE - depending on the vulnerability).](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_go-kit_dependencies_for_various_impacts__dos__rce_-__5dec9296.md)

*   **Critical Node: Vulnerabilities in Go-Kit's Dependencies:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Go-Kit applications rely on numerous dependencies. If any of these dependencies contain known vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the Go-Kit application. Vulnerabilities in dependencies can range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution.
    *   **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, impacts can range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution, leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or service disruption.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement a robust dependency management process. Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools. Keep Go-Kit and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Monitor security advisories for Go dependencies.
