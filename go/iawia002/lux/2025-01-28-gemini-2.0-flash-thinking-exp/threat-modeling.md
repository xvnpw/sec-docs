# Threat Model Analysis for iawia002/lux

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability within the `lux` library or its dependencies. This could involve sending crafted requests or inputs to trigger the vulnerability. For example, an attacker might exploit a code injection vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server or client running the application.
*   **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, impacts can range from information disclosure (e.g., leaking sensitive data), denial of service (crashing the application), to remote code execution (gaining full control of the system).
*   **Affected Lux Component:** Core `lux` library code, potentially specific modules or functions depending on the vulnerability. Dependencies of `lux` are also in scope.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update `lux` to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Use automated dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in `lux` and its dependencies.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Python and libraries used by `lux`.
    *   Implement a process for promptly addressing reported vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious URL Injection via Parsing Manipulation](./threats/malicious_url_injection_via_parsing_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a target website or manipulates its content in a way that causes `lux` to extract URLs pointing to malicious resources instead of legitimate media. This could involve injecting malicious URLs into website metadata or content that `lux` parses. The attacker aims to trick the application into downloading or processing malicious content.
*   **Impact:** If the application automatically downloads and processes content from extracted URLs, it could download and potentially execute malware. This could lead to system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Affected Lux Component:** URL extraction logic within website-specific parsing modules, core URL handling functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on application's handling of extracted URLs - considered High if auto-download is enabled without validation)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict validation of URLs extracted by `lux` before using them. Verify URL schemes (HTTPS preferred), domains, and potentially file extensions.
    *   Use Content Security Policy (CSP) if extracted media is displayed in a web context to restrict content sources.
    *   Process downloaded media in a sandboxed or isolated environment.
    *   Require user confirmation before downloading or processing content from URLs extracted by `lux`, especially from untrusted sources.
