# Attack Surface Analysis for iawia002/lux

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can force the server application, through `lux`, to make requests to unintended internal or external resources. This can bypass firewalls, expose internal services, or leak sensitive data.
*   **How lux contributes to the attack surface:** `lux` directly processes URLs provided to it for video downloading. If an application blindly passes user-supplied URLs to `lux`, it becomes vulnerable to SSRF. `lux` will attempt to connect to and retrieve data from the provided URL, regardless of its origin (internal or external).
*   **Example:** An application uses `lux` to fetch video information based on user input. An attacker provides the URL `http://metadata.internal-service:169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`. `lux` processes this URL, and the application inadvertently retrieves sensitive metadata from an internal cloud service, which the attacker can then access.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive internal data, access to internal services (potentially leading to further exploitation), port scanning of internal networks, and in some cases, remote code execution if internal services are vulnerable.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict URL Validation and Allowlisting:** Implement robust validation and sanitization of all user-provided URLs *before* passing them to `lux`. Use a strict allowlist of permitted domains or URL patterns. Blacklisting is generally less effective.
    *   **Network Segmentation and Firewalls:** Isolate the application server in a network segment with restricted outbound access. Implement firewalls to limit the destinations the server can reach, especially blocking access to internal infrastructure from the application server's network.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Network Access):** Configure the application server with minimal network permissions, specifically restricting outbound connections to only necessary external services and blocking access to internal networks if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities (File System Overwrite/Exposure)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities__file_system_overwriteexposure_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate file paths used by `lux` to save downloaded videos, allowing them to write files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system, potentially overwriting critical system files or exposing sensitive data by saving files in publicly accessible directories.
*   **How lux contributes to the attack surface:** `lux` downloads video content and saves it to disk. If the application allows user-controlled filenames or download paths to be used directly with `lux`'s saving functionality without proper sanitization, path traversal vulnerabilities become possible.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to "name" their downloaded video. An attacker provides a filename like `../../../../var/www/public/malicious.php`. If the application uses this filename directly with `lux`, the attacker could potentially save a malicious PHP script (`malicious.php`) into the web server's public directory, leading to remote code execution when accessed via a web browser.
*   **Impact:**  Arbitrary file write, potentially leading to remote code execution, system compromise, data corruption, or denial of service by overwriting critical system files.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Absolute Paths and Controlled Download Directory:**  Always use absolute paths for the download directory and ensure it is within a tightly controlled and secure location. Never directly use user-provided paths for saving files.
    *   **Strict Filename Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate user-provided filenames. Use allowlists for characters and restrict path separators (like `/` and `\`, `..`). Generate filenames programmatically based on sanitized user input or internal logic instead of directly using user input.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (File System Access):** Run the application with minimal file system permissions. The user account running the application should only have write access to the designated download directory and no write access to system directories or other sensitive locations.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities Leading to Remote Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** `lux` relies on third-party Python libraries. Critical vulnerabilities in these dependencies, particularly in libraries handling data parsing or network requests, can be exploited to achieve remote code execution on the server running the application.
*   **How lux contributes to the attack surface:** `lux`'s functionality is directly dependent on its libraries. If a dependency has a critical vulnerability (e.g., in a parsing library used to process website responses or a request library with an RCE flaw), and `lux` uses the vulnerable functionality, then the application using `lux` becomes vulnerable.
*   **Example:** `lux` depends on an older version of a parsing library that has a known remote code execution vulnerability triggered when processing maliciously crafted HTML. If a video hosting site (or an attacker-controlled site) serves such malicious HTML, and `lux` parses it, the vulnerability in the dependency could be triggered, leading to code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and other severe security breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Dependency Updates and Management:**  Maintain a rigorous process for regularly updating `lux` and *all* of its dependencies to the latest versions. Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies and automate updates.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning and Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Implement automated vulnerability scanning and SCA tools to continuously monitor `lux`'s dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Integrate these tools into the development and deployment pipeline.
    *   **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on identifying and exploiting potential vulnerabilities arising from `lux`'s dependencies and usage.
    *   **Vendor Security Advisories and Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories for `lux` and its dependencies to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities and promptly apply patches.
