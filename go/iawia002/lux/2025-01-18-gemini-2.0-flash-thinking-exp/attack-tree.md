## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Command Injection Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_command_injection_vulnerability.md)

*   **Critical Node: Application constructs lux command with unsanitized user input**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application dynamically builds the command to execute `lux`, incorporating user-provided data (e.g., the video URL, download options) directly into the command string without proper sanitization or validation.
    *   **Critical Node: Inject malicious commands into lux execution**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can manipulate the user-provided input to inject malicious shell commands. When the application executes the constructed command, these injected commands are also executed by the system, with the same privileges as the application. This allows the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_path_traversal_vulnerability.md)

*   **Critical Node: Application allows user-controlled output path for lux downloads**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application permits users to specify the directory or filename where the downloaded content from `lux` should be saved.
    *   **Critical Node: Inject path traversal sequences (e.g., ../../)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can insert path traversal sequences (like `../../`) into the user-controlled output path. This allows them to navigate outside the intended download directory and write the downloaded files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system. This can lead to overwriting critical system files or placing malicious scripts in web-accessible directories.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Downloaded Content](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_downloaded_content.md)

*   **Critical Node: Application automatically processes downloaded content without proper sanitization**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application, upon successful download using `lux`, automatically processes the downloaded content without implementing adequate security measures like malware scanning or sandboxing. This processing could involve opening the file, executing it, or using it in further operations.
    *   **Critical Node: Download a file with embedded malicious code (e.g., script, executable)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can either upload malicious content to the target website from which `lux` downloads or compromise that website to replace legitimate content with malicious files. When the application uses `lux` to download from this compromised source, it retrieves the malicious file. If the application then automatically processes this file, the embedded malicious code is executed within the application's context, potentially leading to code execution, data breaches, or other forms of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in lux Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_lux_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The `lux` library relies on other third-party libraries for various functionalities. If any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker might be able to exploit these vulnerabilities through interactions with `lux`. This could involve crafting specific URLs or input that triggers the vulnerability in the underlying dependency, potentially leading to remote code execution or information disclosure within the application's environment. The likelihood of this path being high-risk depends on the specific dependencies used by the version of `lux` and whether known, exploitable vulnerabilities exist.
