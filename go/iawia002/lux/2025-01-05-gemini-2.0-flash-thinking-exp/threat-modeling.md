# Threat Model Analysis for iawia002/lux

## Threat: [Malicious Content Download](./threats/malicious_content_download.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a URL to `lux` that points to a resource hosting malicious content (e.g., a video file containing an exploit, an executable disguised as media). `lux` downloads this content, and if the application processes or stores it without proper sanitization, it could lead to harm. The vulnerability lies in `lux`'s function of downloading arbitrary content based on user-provided URLs.

**Impact:**
* **Server-Side:**  Malware execution on the server hosting the application, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
* **Client-Side (if content is served to users):**  Malware execution on user devices, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Affected Lux Component:** `downloader` module (responsible for fetching content).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Content Security Analysis:** Implement virus scanning and malware detection on downloaded files *immediately* after `lux` completes the download and before any further processing or storage.
* **Sandboxing:**  Run the `lux` download process and any initial processing of the downloaded content in an isolated environment with limited permissions.
* **Input Validation (Limited Effectiveness):** While difficult to validate the *content* itself, validate the source URL to ensure it aligns with expected patterns (though this is not a strong defense against malicious content).

## Threat: [Exploiting `lux` URL Parsing Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting__lux__url_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL that exploits vulnerabilities in `lux`'s URL parsing logic within its `extractor` modules. This could lead to unexpected behavior within `lux`, crashes, or potentially even remote code execution *within the `lux` process*.

**Impact:**
* **Denial of Service:**  The application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to errors within `lux`.
* **Remote Code Execution:**  In a severe case, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server running `lux` by exploiting a flaw in how `lux` handles a crafted URL.
* **Information Disclosure:**  Error messages or internal state leaks from `lux` due to parsing errors could reveal sensitive information.

**Affected Lux Component:** `extractor` modules (responsible for parsing URLs and extracting download information).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Regular Updates:** Keep `lux` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address parsing vulnerabilities.
* **Input Sanitization (Limited Effectiveness):** While `lux` is designed to handle URLs, basic sanitization to remove obviously malicious or unexpected characters *before* passing to `lux` might offer a minor defense layer.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling around calls to `lux` functions to prevent application crashes and potentially mask sensitive error information.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `lux`](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via__lux_.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a malicious URL that, when processed by `lux`, forces the server running the application to make requests to internal or unintended external resources. This exploits `lux`'s functionality of fetching content from URLs.

**Impact:**
* **Access to Internal Resources:**  Attackers can access internal services or data that are not publicly accessible.
* **Port Scanning:**  Attackers can scan internal networks to identify open ports and running services using the server running `lux` as a proxy.
* **Data Exfiltration:**  Attackers can potentially exfiltrate data from internal systems by making requests to external attacker-controlled servers.

**Affected Lux Component:** `downloader` module (if it doesn't properly validate the target of the download based on the extracted information).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **URL Validation and Filtering:** Implement strict validation and filtering of URLs *before* passing them to `lux`, preventing requests to internal or blacklisted addresses or address ranges. This should occur *before* `lux` attempts to process the URL.
* **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the server running `lux` from sensitive internal networks to limit the impact of potential SSRF attacks.
