## 6. Security Considerations (For Threat Modeling)

This section details potential security considerations and potential attack vectors that should be thoroughly examined during the threat modeling process.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Threat:** Maliciously crafted URLs could be used to trigger unexpected behavior, such as server-side request forgery (SSRF) or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against internal systems or the user's machine.
    *   **Threat:** Command injection vulnerabilities could arise if user-provided input is not properly sanitized before being used in system commands.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization techniques for all user-provided data, including URLs and command-line arguments. Utilize parameterized queries or equivalent mechanisms when interacting with external systems.

*   **Website Interaction and Data Handling:**
    *   **Threat:** Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of downloaded media if HTTPS is not strictly enforced and certificate validation is not performed correctly.
    *   **Threat:** Sensitive user information (e.g., cookies, authentication tokens) could be inadvertently exposed if the application does not handle website interactions securely.
    *   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in the underlying HTTP client library could be exploited by malicious websites.
    *   **Mitigation:** Enforce HTTPS for all website interactions and implement proper certificate validation. Avoid storing or logging sensitive user data. Keep the HTTP client library up-to-date with the latest security patches.

*   **Platform Extractor Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in the parsing logic of platform extractors could lead to buffer overflows, denial-of-service, or other exploitable conditions when processing malicious or unexpected website content.
    *   **Threat:** If platform extractors interact directly with website APIs, vulnerabilities in those APIs could be exploited.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement rigorous input validation and error handling within platform extractors. Regularly review and update extractors to address changes in target website structures and potential vulnerabilities. Consider using secure parsing libraries.

*   **File System Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Path traversal vulnerabilities could allow malicious users to write downloaded files to arbitrary locations on the file system, potentially overwriting critical system files or introducing malware.
    *   **Threat:** The application might overwrite existing files without explicit user confirmation, leading to data loss.
    *   **Threat:** Insecure default file permissions for downloaded files could expose them to unauthorized access.
    *   **Mitigation:** Restrict the ability of users to specify arbitrary download paths. Implement checks to prevent overwriting existing files without user consent. Set appropriate file permissions for downloaded files.

*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the application could be exploited.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement a robust dependency management strategy, regularly scanning for and updating vulnerable dependencies. Utilize software composition analysis (SCA) tools.

*   **Update Mechanism Security:**
    *   **Threat:** If the application has an auto-update feature, a compromised update server or insecure update process could be used to distribute malware.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement secure update mechanisms, including code signing and verification of update packages. Use HTTPS for update downloads.

## 7. Future Considerations

*   **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Development of a GUI to cater to users who prefer a visual interface, potentially using frameworks like Qt or Electron.
*   **Plugin Architecture:** Implementing a plugin system to allow users and developers to extend the functionality by adding support for new platforms, features, or post-processing tasks.
*   **Proxy Support:** Enabling users to download media through HTTP or SOCKS proxy servers for anonymity or to bypass network restrictions.
*   **Advanced Download Management:** Implementing features like segmented downloads, download scheduling, and queue management.
*   **Integration with Media Players:** Providing options to directly open downloaded media in a user's preferred media player.
