# Attack Surface Analysis for iawia002/lux

## Attack Surface: [Malicious URL Input / URL Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_url_input__url_injection.md)

*   **How `lux` contributes to the attack surface:** `lux`'s core functionality is downloading content from URLs. If an application directly uses user-provided URLs as input for `lux` without validation, it becomes vulnerable to attackers providing malicious URLs.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a URL pointing to an internal network resource (`http://internal-server/sensitive-data`) or a resource that triggers a denial-of-service on another server. `lux` attempts to download this resource, potentially exposing internal data or participating in a DDoS attack.
    *   **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), exposure of internal resources, contributing to external attacks, potential for local file access if `lux` is configured improperly.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all URLs before passing them to `lux`. Use allowlists of permitted domains or URL patterns.
        *   **URL Parsing and Analysis:**  Parse the URL to understand its components before using it with `lux`.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the application server from internal networks if possible, limiting the impact of SSRF.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in `lux` Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in__lux__dependencies.md)

*   **How `lux` contributes to the attack surface:** `lux` relies on other Python libraries (e.g., `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies directly impact the security of any application using `lux`.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability exists in the `requests` library that allows for arbitrary code execution. If the application uses a version of `lux` that depends on the vulnerable version of `requests`, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability through `lux`.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the dependency vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep `lux` and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use security scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.
        *   **Dependency Pinning:** Use a requirements file to pin specific versions of dependencies to ensure consistency and control over updates.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Redirection](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_redirection.md)

*   **How `lux` contributes to the attack surface:** `lux` follows HTTP redirects. An attacker could provide an initial URL that redirects to an internal resource, potentially bypassing initial URL validation checks if only the first URL is validated.
    *   **Example:** The application validates the initial URL, which is benign. However, the website at that URL redirects `lux` to an internal service (`http://internal-server/admin`).
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential for further exploitation of internal services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Validate Final URL:**  If possible, validate the final URL after redirects, not just the initial URL.
        *   **Control Redirection Behavior:** Configure `lux` or the underlying HTTP client to limit or control redirection behavior.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** As mentioned before, isolate the application server.
