## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lux Input Handling [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lux_input_handling__cn_.md)

This represents a broad category of attacks where the attacker manipulates the input provided to the `lux` library to achieve malicious goals. This is a critical node because it serves as the entry point for several high-risk paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious URL Injection [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_url_injection__hr_.md)

The attacker crafts a malicious URL that is then processed by `lux`. This path is high-risk because it can lead to exploiting vulnerabilities in `lux` itself or the target website.

    * **Trigger Vulnerability in Lux Itself [HR]:** The malicious URL specifically targets weaknesses within the `lux` library's code.
        * **Execute Arbitrary Code on Server (if Lux has such vulnerability) [CN, HR]:** A highly critical outcome where a vulnerability in `lux` allows the attacker to run arbitrary code on the server hosting the application.
            * Likelihood: Low
            * Impact: Critical
            * Effort: High
            * Skill Level: Advanced

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via URL Parameters [CN, HR]](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_url_parameters__cn__hr_.md)

If the application naively constructs the `lux` command line using user-provided URL parameters without proper sanitization, the attacker can inject arbitrary commands.
    * **If Application Passes User Input to Lux Without Sanitization:**  A prerequisite for this attack.
    * **Execute Arbitrary Commands on Server [CN, HR]:** The attacker successfully executes commands on the server.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: Critical
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Intermediate

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal via URL (if Lux handles local file output) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_via_url__if_lux_handles_local_file_output___hr_.md)

If `lux` allows specifying the output file path and the application doesn't sanitize the URL or output path, the attacker can manipulate where `lux` saves downloaded files.
    * **Overwrite Sensitive Application Files [CN, HR]:** The attacker overwrites critical application files, leading to a loss of integrity or denial of service.
        * Likelihood: Low
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
    * **Read Sensitive Application Files [HR]:** The attacker forces `lux` to save downloaded content to a location where it can read sensitive application files.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Novice

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lux Output Handling [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lux_output_handling__cn_.md)

This category involves attacks that leverage the content downloaded by `lux` or how the application processes it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Downloaded Content [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_downloaded_content__hr_.md)

The attacker provides a URL that leads `lux` to download malicious content.
    * **Drive-by Download Exploitation [HR]:** If the application directly serves the downloaded content without sanitization, it can lead to client-side attacks.
        * **If Application Directly Serves Downloaded Content Without Sanitization:** A prerequisite for this attack.
        * **Compromise User Browsers [HR]:** Malicious content (e.g., JavaScript) compromises the browsers of users accessing the downloaded content.
            * Likelihood: Medium
            * Impact: Medium
            * Effort: Low
            * Skill Level: Novice
    * **Exploiting Application's Processing of Downloaded Content [HR]:** If the application parses the downloaded content (e.g., JSON, XML), the attacker can inject malicious payloads.
        * **If Application Parses Downloaded Files (e.g., JSON, XML):** A prerequisite for this attack.
        * **Inject Malicious Payloads Leading to Code Execution [CN, HR]:**  Malicious payloads in the downloaded content are processed by the application, leading to code execution on the server.
            * Likelihood: Medium
            * Impact: High
            * Effort: Medium
            * Skill Level: Intermediate

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lux Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lux_dependencies.md)

This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the external libraries that `lux` relies on.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used by Lux [HR]:**  `lux` depends on other libraries, and vulnerabilities in these can be exploited.
        * **If Lux Relies on Vulnerable Versions of External Libraries:** A prerequisite for this attack.
        * **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Those Libraries [CN, HR]:** The attacker leverages known vulnerabilities in `lux`'s dependencies to compromise the application.
            * Likelihood: Medium (depends on dependency)
            * Impact: Varies (can be High or Critical)
            * Effort: Low (if exploit is public) to High (if 0-day)
            * Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Integration with Lux [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_integration_with_lux__cn_.md)

This focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application integrates and uses the `lux` library.

    * **Lack of Input Validation Before Passing to Lux [CN, HR]:**  The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-provided input before passing it to `lux`. This is a critical node because it enables many of the input-based attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering (Indirectly Related)](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering__indirectly_related_.md)

While not a direct technical vulnerability in `lux`, social engineering can be used to trick users into providing malicious URLs.
    * **Tricking Users into Providing Malicious URLs to the Application:** The attacker manipulates users.
    * **Leading to Exploitation via "Exploit Lux Input Handling" [HR]:**  The socially engineered malicious URL is then processed by `lux`, potentially triggering any of the input-related high-risk paths.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: Varies depending on the subsequent exploit
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Novice
