# Attack Surface Analysis for iawia002/lux

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker tricks the server into making requests to unintended locations, potentially accessing internal resources or external systems.
*   **How Lux Contributes:** `lux`'s core function is to fetch data from URLs provided by the user. It's designed to interact with a wide range of websites, making it a prime target for SSRF.  `lux`'s handling of redirects and embedded URLs within fetched content is a key contributor.
*   **Example:**
    *   Attacker provides a URL like `https://www.example.com/video.mp4?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/` (AWS metadata endpoint). If `lux` follows this redirect or embedded URL without proper validation, it could expose AWS credentials.
    *   Attacker provides a URL like `https://legit-video-site.com/playlist.m3u8`, but the `playlist.m3u8` file contains a segment URL pointing to `file:///etc/passwd`.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal services, sensitive data (credentials, configuration files), potential for remote code execution (RCE) if internal services are vulnerable.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Allow-listing:** Maintain a list of *explicitly allowed* domains and URL prefixes. Reject any URL that doesn't match the allow-list *before* passing it to `lux`. Do *not* rely on `lux`'s internal validation.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Run the application using `lux` in a network environment that restricts access to internal resources. Use firewalls and network policies to limit outbound connections.
    *   **Dedicated SSRF Prevention Library:** Use a library specifically designed to prevent SSRF.
    *   **Disable URL Redirection Following (If Possible):** If redirects are not strictly required, configure `lux` (or the underlying HTTP client) to *not* follow them.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate *every* part of the URL (scheme, hostname, port, path, query parameters) using a robust URL parsing library. Reject unusual characters or patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides input that triggers a computationally expensive regular expression, causing the application to become unresponsive.
*   **How Lux Contributes:** `lux` uses regular expressions extensively within its site extractors to parse HTML, JSON, and other data formats. The vulnerability lies *within* `lux`'s code.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a specially designed URL or modifies a legitimate website's content (if possible) to include a string that triggers catastrophic backtracking in one of `lux`'s regular expressions. A regex like `(a+)+$` with input `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!` can cause this.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service; the application becomes unavailable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Review Regular Expressions:** Carefully examine the regular expressions used in the `lux` extractors (especially for frequently used sites). Look for known ReDoS patterns.
    *   **Use a ReDoS Detection Tool:** Employ static analysis tools to detect potentially vulnerable regular expressions.
    *   **Implement Timeouts:** Set strict timeouts for regular expression matching within your application's interaction with `lux`. Terminate long-running matches.
    *   **Input Length Limits:** Impose reasonable limits on input string lengths processed by `lux`'s regular expressions.

## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious XML entities, potentially leading to file disclosure or SSRF.
*   **How Lux Contributes:** If a site extractor *within `lux`* processes XML data and uses a vulnerable XML parser, XXE is possible. The vulnerability is within `lux`'s handling of potentially untrusted XML from external sites.
*   **Example:** If a site provides metadata in XML, and `lux`'s extractor for that site doesn't disable external entity resolution, an attacker could provide a URL to a page containing malicious XML.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of local files, potential for SSRF.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Verify XML Parser Configuration:**  Confirm that any XML parser used *within `lux`'s relevant extractors* has external entity resolution *disabled*. This is crucial; the application using `lux` might not have direct control over this.
    *   **Contribute to `lux` (if necessary):** If you identify a vulnerable extractor, consider contributing a fix to the `lux` project to disable external entities.

## Attack Surface: [Infinite Playlist Loops/Resource Exhaustion (M3U8)](./attack_surfaces/infinite_playlist_loopsresource_exhaustion__m3u8_.md)

* **Description:** Maliciously crafted M3U8 playlists can cause `lux` to enter infinite loops or consume excessive resources.
    * **How Lux Contributes:** `lux` has specific logic for handling M3U8 playlists, and this logic is the direct source of the vulnerability.
    * **Example:** An attacker provides a URL to an M3U8 playlist where `#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE` is manipulated, or segments reference each other cyclically, causing `lux` to repeatedly download the same segments.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Limit Playlist Depth and Segment Count:** Within your application's interaction with `lux`, set reasonable limits on playlist depth and segment count.
        * **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for downloading segments and processing the playlist *within your application's use of `lux`*.
        * **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor resource usage to detect and prevent excessive consumption *caused by `lux`*.
