## Attack Tree Path: [1. Execute Arbitrary Code [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1__execute_arbitrary_code__hr_.md)

*   **1.1 Command Injection via URL/Filename Manipulation [HR]**
    *   **Description:**  The attacker exploits insufficient input sanitization to inject operating system commands into either the URL or the filename processed by `lux`.
    *   **1.1.1 Exploit `lux`'s URL parsing logic [HR]**
        *   **1.1.1.1 Pass malicious URL to `lux` that triggers OS command execution [CN]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker crafts a URL containing shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `` ` ``, `$()`) that, when processed by `lux`, are interpreted by the underlying operating system as commands.  For example, a URL like `http://example.com/video; rm -rf /` could be used.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Heavily dependent on the application's input sanitization)
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Full system compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Might be caught by intrusion detection systems or logs)
    *   **1.1.2 Exploit `lux`'s filename handling [HR]**
        *   **1.1.2.1 Trigger command execution during file saving or processing [CN]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker crafts a filename containing shell metacharacters. When `lux` saves the downloaded file or interacts with it (e.g., passing it to another program), the injected command is executed.  An example filename could be `video; whoami > /tmp/output.txt .mp4`.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Dependent on input sanitization and how filenames are used internally)
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Full system compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **1.3 Dependency Vulnerabilities [HR]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a known vulnerability in one of `lux`'s Go library dependencies.
    *   **1.3.1 Exploit a known vulnerability in a Go library used by `lux`**
        *   **1.3.1.2 Craft input or network conditions to trigger the vulnerability. [CN]**
            *   **Description:** After identifying a vulnerable dependency (e.g., using a dependency scanner), the attacker crafts specific input or manipulates network conditions to trigger the vulnerability.  The exact nature of the input/conditions depends on the specific vulnerability.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low/Medium (Depends on the exploitability of the specific vulnerability and whether it's been patched)
            *   **Impact:** Variable (Depends on the vulnerability; could range from DoS to full code execution)
            *   **Effort:** Medium/High
            *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium/Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exfiltrate Sensitive Data [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exfiltrate_sensitive_data__hr_.md)

*   **2.1 Access Downloaded Content [HR]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to files downloaded by `lux`.
    *   **2.1.1.1 If the application doesn't properly isolate `lux`'s output, an attacker might access downloaded files directly. [CN]**
        *   **Description:** If the application using `lux` doesn't properly configure the download directory (e.g., sets weak permissions, uses a predictable path, or allows directory listing), an attacker can directly access the downloaded files. This could include private videos, documents, or other sensitive data.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on directory permissions and web server configuration)
        *   **Impact:** Medium/High (Depends on the sensitivity of the downloaded content)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice/Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (If directory listing is enabled or permissions are too permissive)

*   **2.2 Extract Credentials/API Keys from URLs [HR]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker obtains sensitive information (credentials, API keys) that are embedded in URLs passed to `lux`.
    *   **2.2.1.1 Exploit a separate vulnerability to access log files. [CN]**
        *   **Description:** If `lux` or the application logs the full URLs (including any embedded credentials), and an attacker gains access to these log files (through a separate vulnerability like directory traversal or misconfigured log access), they can extract the credentials.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on log file permissions and the presence of other vulnerabilities)
        *   **Impact:** Medium/High (Depends on the sensitivity of the logged credentials)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Depends on log monitoring and intrusion detection)
    *   **2.2.2.1 Attacker provides a URL containing sensitive data, hoping the application will pass it to `lux` and expose it somehow. [CN]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker provides a URL containing sensitive data (e.g., a URL with an embedded API key) to the application.  If the application blindly passes this URL to `lux`, and `lux` logs it, exposes it in an error message, or otherwise makes it accessible, the attacker can retrieve the sensitive data.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the application's handling of URLs and `lux`'s logging/error handling)
        *   **Impact:** High (Exposure of credentials or API keys)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Depends on logging and monitoring practices)
