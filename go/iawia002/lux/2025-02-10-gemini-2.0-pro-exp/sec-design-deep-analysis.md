### 2. Security Implications of Key Components

Based on the C4 diagrams and the codebase, we can break down the security implications of each key component:

**2.1 Command-Line Interface (CLI):**

*   **Inferred Architecture:** The CLI is the entry point, parsing arguments using a library (likely `flag` or a similar package).  It then calls functions in the `downloader` package based on the parsed arguments.
*   **Security Implications:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  This is the *most critical* area for the CLI.  Insufficient validation of user-provided URLs, filenames, and other options can lead to various attacks.
        *   **URL Validation:**  The code *must* strictly validate URLs to prevent accessing unintended resources or local files.  This includes checking the scheme (e.g., enforcing `https://`), validating the domain name, and potentially restricting allowed paths.  Failure to do so could lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities.
        *   **Filename Sanitization:**  The CLI must sanitize filenames provided by the user or extracted from websites to prevent directory traversal attacks (e.g., using `../` to write files outside the intended download directory).  It should also handle special characters and potentially limit filename length to avoid issues with the underlying filesystem.
        *   **Option Validation:**  All command-line options should be strictly validated to ensure they are within expected ranges and formats.  This prevents unexpected behavior or potential injection attacks.
    *   **Injection Attacks:**  If user input is directly used in system commands or shell scripts without proper escaping, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities.  This is less likely in Go, but still a concern if external commands are used.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Maliciously crafted input could potentially cause the CLI to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) or enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**2.2 Downloader Engine:**

*   **Inferred Architecture:** This component manages the download process, handling retries, concurrency, and interaction with the `website parsers`. It likely uses Go's `net/http` package for making HTTP requests.
*   **Security Implications:**
    *   **Network Security:**  While `lux` uses HTTPS, which is good, there are still potential issues:
        *   **Certificate Validation:**  The downloader *must* properly validate the TLS certificates of the websites it connects to.  Failure to do so could allow Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.  Go's `net/http` client does this by default, but custom configurations or insecure settings could bypass this protection.
        *   **HTTP Headers:**  The downloader should carefully handle HTTP headers, especially those related to redirects (e.g., `Location`) and cookies.  Following malicious redirects could lead to phishing or other attacks.
        *   **Timeouts:**  Appropriate timeouts should be set for network requests to prevent the downloader from hanging indefinitely on unresponsive servers.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The downloader should limit the number of concurrent downloads and the size of downloaded files to prevent resource exhaustion (memory, disk space, network bandwidth).
    *   **Error Handling:**  Proper error handling is crucial to prevent unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.  Errors from network requests, file operations, and website parsers should be handled gracefully and securely.
    * **Data Handling:** Although temporary, the video URLs and potentially cookies are handled. Securely handling and disposing of this data is important.

**2.3 Website Parsers:**

*   **Inferred Architecture:**  Each parser is responsible for extracting video URLs and metadata from a specific website.  This likely involves parsing HTML, JSON, or other data formats.  This is a high-risk area due to the complexity and variability of website structures.
*   **Security Implications:**
    *   **Parsing Vulnerabilities:**  This is the *most likely* place for vulnerabilities.  Parsing untrusted data from websites is inherently risky.
        *   **XXE (XML External Entity) Attacks:**  If a parser uses an XML parser, it *must* be configured to disable external entities to prevent XXE attacks.  This is a common vulnerability in XML parsers.
        *   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Attacks:**  While `lux` doesn't render HTML in a browser, if a parser mishandles HTML content, it could potentially extract malicious data that could be used in other contexts.  Proper escaping and sanitization are crucial.
        *   **JSON Parsing Issues:**  Even JSON parsing can be vulnerable if the parser has bugs or if the JSON data is unexpectedly large or deeply nested.
        *   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):**  Poorly crafted regular expressions used for parsing can be exploited to cause denial-of-service attacks.  Regular expressions should be carefully reviewed and tested for performance and security.
    *   **Logic Errors:**  Errors in the parsing logic could lead to incorrect video URLs being extracted, potentially pointing to malicious content.
    *   **Website Changes:**  Changes to the website's structure or API can break the parser, potentially leading to security issues if the parser doesn't handle the changes gracefully.

**2.4 Filesystem:**

*   **Inferred Architecture:**  `lux` writes downloaded video files to the local filesystem.  This likely uses Go's `os` and `io` packages.
*   **Security Implications:**
    *   **Directory Traversal:**  As mentioned earlier, the CLI and downloader must prevent directory traversal attacks by sanitizing filenames and paths.
    *   **File Permissions:**  Downloaded files should be created with appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
    *   **Disk Space Exhaustion:**  The downloader should handle potential disk space exhaustion gracefully, preventing the system from becoming unstable.
    *   **Symlink Attacks:**  If `lux` follows symbolic links, it could be tricked into writing files to unintended locations.  This should be carefully considered and potentially disabled.

**2.5 Various Websites:**

*   **Security Implications:**  `lux` has no control over the security of the websites it interacts with.  This is a significant accepted risk.
    *   **Malicious Content:**  Websites could host malicious content (e.g., malware disguised as video files) that could harm the user's system.
    *   **Tracking and Privacy:**  Websites could track the user's activity and collect personal information.

### 3. Mitigation Strategies

Based on the identified security implications, here are actionable mitigation strategies:

**3.1 General Mitigations:**

*   **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Regular security audits and penetration testing are *essential* to identify and address vulnerabilities that may be missed by other methods.  This should be performed by experienced security professionals.
*   **Static Analysis:**  Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., `go vet`, `staticcheck`, `gosec`) into the build process to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities and coding errors.  Address all identified issues.
*   **Dependency Management:**  Regularly update dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.  Use a dependency scanning tool (e.g., `go list -m -u all`, `dependabot`) to identify vulnerable dependencies.
*   **SBOM:** Generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) during the build process to track all dependencies and their versions. This facilitates vulnerability management.
*   **Fuzzing:** Implement fuzzing tests to automatically generate a wide range of inputs and test the application's resilience to unexpected data. This is particularly important for the CLI and website parsers.

**3.2 CLI Mitigations:**

*   **Robust Input Validation:**
    *   **URL Validation:**  Use a well-vetted URL parsing library (e.g., Go's `net/url` package) and enforce strict validation rules.  Consider using a whitelist of allowed schemes and domains if possible.  Reject any URLs that don't conform to the expected format.
    *   **Filename Sanitization:**  Use a robust filename sanitization library or function to remove or escape potentially dangerous characters (e.g., `../`, `/`, `\`, control characters).  Consider using a whitelist of allowed characters.
    *   **Option Validation:**  Define a strict schema for command-line options and validate all input against this schema.  Reject any invalid options.
*   **Avoid Shell Commands:**  Minimize the use of external shell commands.  If necessary, use Go's `os/exec` package with proper argument escaping to prevent command injection.

**3.3 Downloader Engine Mitigations:**

*   **Secure Network Communication:**
    *   **Verify TLS Certificates:** Ensure that TLS certificate validation is enabled and that the downloader correctly handles certificate errors.  Do not disable certificate verification.
    *   **Handle Redirects Carefully:**  Limit the number of redirects followed and validate the target URL of each redirect to prevent redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Set Timeouts:**  Set appropriate timeouts for all network requests to prevent the downloader from hanging indefinitely.
    *   **User-Agent:** Consider setting a custom User-Agent string that identifies `lux` and potentially includes a contact email address for reporting issues.
*   **Resource Management:**
    *   **Limit Concurrent Downloads:**  Implement a mechanism to limit the number of concurrent downloads to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   **Limit File Sizes:**  Consider implementing a maximum file size limit to prevent downloading excessively large files.
*   **Secure Error Handling:**  Handle all errors gracefully and securely.  Log errors appropriately for debugging and auditing.

**3.4 Website Parser Mitigations:**

*   **Secure Parsing Libraries:**  Use well-vetted and secure parsing libraries for HTML, XML, JSON, and other data formats.
*   **Disable External Entities (XXE):**  If using an XML parser, explicitly disable external entities to prevent XXE attacks.
*   **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize all data extracted from websites before using it.  Escape HTML and other potentially dangerous characters.
*   **Regular Expression Security:**  Carefully review and test all regular expressions for performance and security.  Avoid using overly complex or potentially vulnerable regular expressions. Use a tool to analyze regular expressions for ReDoS vulnerabilities.
*   **Unit Tests:**  Write comprehensive unit tests for each website parser to ensure that they correctly handle various inputs and edge cases.
*   **Isolate Parsers (Optional):**  Consider running each website parser in a separate process or container to isolate them from each other and from the main downloader process. This can limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

**3.5 Filesystem Mitigations:**

*   **Prevent Directory Traversal:**  As mentioned earlier, rigorously sanitize filenames and paths to prevent directory traversal attacks.
*   **Set Appropriate File Permissions:**  Create downloaded files with the least permissive permissions necessary.
*   **Handle Disk Space Exhaustion:**  Check for available disk space before starting a download and handle potential disk space exhaustion gracefully.
*   **Avoid Symlink Attacks:**  Consider disabling the following of symbolic links or carefully validating the target of any symbolic links encountered.

**3.6 Deployment and Build Process Mitigations:**

*   **Secure Build Environment:**  Use a secure build environment (e.g., GitHub Actions) with appropriate access controls and secrets management.
*   **Code Signing (Recommended):**  Digitally sign the released binaries to ensure their integrity and authenticity. This helps users verify that they are downloading a genuine version of `lux`.
*   **Reproducible Builds (Recommended):**  Strive for reproducible builds, where the same source code always produces the same binary output. This enhances transparency and trust.

**3.7 Addressing Accepted Risks:**

*   **User Education:**  Provide clear documentation and warnings to users about the potential risks of downloading content from untrusted sources, including the possibility of malware and copyright infringement.
*   **Content Filtering (Optional and Difficult):**  Exploring options for content filtering (e.g., checking downloaded files against known malware signatures) is extremely challenging and may have legal and ethical implications. This is likely not feasible.
*   **Legal Disclaimer:** Include a clear legal disclaimer in the project's documentation and license, stating that users are responsible for complying with copyright laws and terms of service.
