# Threat Model Analysis for iawia002/lux

## Threat: [Malicious URL Input Leading to RCE (via Lux Vulnerability)](./threats/malicious_url_input_leading_to_rce__via_lux_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL that, when processed by `lux`, exploits a vulnerability *within lux's code* related to parsing or handling website responses.  This is distinct from the application failing to validate the URL; the vulnerability exists *within lux itself*. This could involve a buffer overflow, format string vulnerability, or other code injection flaw in how `lux` parses HTML, JSON, or other data returned by the target website, or in how it interacts with external libraries *after* a download. The attacker might leverage a zero-day vulnerability in `lux` or a known but unpatched vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the system running the application. The attacker could gain complete control of the application and potentially the underlying system.
    *   **Affected `lux` Component:** URL parsing logic (potentially within `utils.py` or site-specific extractor modules), interaction with external libraries (e.g., `ffmpeg` calls within `processor.go` or similar), and the download handling logic itself. Specifically vulnerable areas could include regular expression handling, HTML/XML parsing, and interaction with external processes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `lux` updated to the *absolute latest* version. This is the *most crucial* mitigation, as it addresses known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Code Review (If Feasible):** If you have the resources, conduct a security-focused code review of `lux`'s core components, particularly those involved in URL parsing, data handling, and external library interaction. Focus on areas known to be prone to vulnerabilities (e.g., string manipulation, input validation).
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run `lux` within a sandboxed environment (e.g., a container with limited privileges, a virtual machine) to contain the impact of a successful exploit. This limits the attacker's ability to compromise the entire system.
        *   **Vulnerability Reporting:** If you discover a vulnerability in `lux`, report it responsibly to the maintainers.
        *   **Fuzzing (Advanced):** Consider using fuzzing techniques to test `lux`'s input handling and identify potential vulnerabilities. This requires specialized security expertise.
        * **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the least necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation (Impacting Lux)](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation__impacting_lux_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in one of `lux`'s *direct* dependencies. This vulnerability is triggered when `lux` uses the vulnerable dependency during its normal operation (e.g., making a network request, parsing HTML, processing media). The attacker does not need to craft a special URL; the vulnerability is inherent in the dependency.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific dependency and vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or other impacts. The impact is on the application using `lux`, but the root cause is a vulnerability in a library `lux` depends on.
    *   **Affected `lux` Component:** Any component of `lux` that uses the vulnerable dependency. This is a broad threat, potentially affecting all parts of `lux`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the specific dependency and vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use automated dependency scanning tools (e.g., `Dependabot`, `Snyk`, `OWASP Dependency-Check`) to *continuously* monitor for vulnerable dependencies.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Regularly update *all* of `lux`'s dependencies to their latest patched versions. Prioritize updates for dependencies with known security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to the dependencies used by `lux`. Be proactive in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.
        *   **Dependency Pinning (with Caution):** Consider pinning dependency versions to specific, known-good versions. However, this can make it harder to receive security updates, so it should be done carefully and with a plan for regularly reviewing and updating pinned versions.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Within Lux)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__within_lux_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides input (e.g., a URL or a series of URLs) that, while not necessarily malicious in intent, triggers a bug or design flaw *within lux* that causes excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory, bandwidth, or disk space). This could be due to an infinite loop in a site-specific extractor, uncontrolled recursion, or inefficient handling of large or complex data structures. The vulnerability is *internal* to `lux`.
    *   **Impact:** The application using `lux` becomes slow or unresponsive, potentially crashing. This can lead to denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Affected `lux` Component:** Download handling logic (`download.go` or similar), stream merging logic, and, most likely, site-specific extractors that handle complex playlists, segmented downloads, or intricate website structures.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `lux` updated to the latest version, as updates often include bug fixes and performance improvements that can mitigate resource exhaustion issues.
        *   **Code Review (Targeted):** If you suspect a specific site extractor is causing problems, conduct a code review of that extractor, focusing on potential infinite loops, uncontrolled recursion, and inefficient data handling.
        *   **Fuzzing (Targeted):** Consider using fuzzing techniques to test specific site extractors and identify inputs that trigger excessive resource consumption.
        * **Timeout Limits (Within Lux, if possible):** If `lux` provides configuration options for timeouts, use them to limit the time spent on individual operations. If not, consider modifying `lux` (and contributing the changes back) to add such limits.
        * **Resource Limits (External):** Use operating system features (e.g., `ulimit` on Linux) or containerization technologies (e.g., Docker) to limit the resources available to the process running `lux`.
