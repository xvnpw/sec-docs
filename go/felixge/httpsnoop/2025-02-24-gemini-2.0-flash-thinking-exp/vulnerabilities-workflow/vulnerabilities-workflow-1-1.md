## Vulnerability List

### No High or Critical Vulnerabilities Identified

Based on the analysis of the `httpsnoop` package, specifically considering the perspective of an external attacker targeting a publicly available instance of an application using this package, no vulnerabilities meeting the criteria (valid, not mitigated, rank at least high, and not excluded by the specified conditions) were identified.

**Explanation:**

After a detailed review of the code, including `wrap.go`, `wrap_generated_lt_1.8.go`, `capture_metrics.go`, `wrap_generated_gteq_1.8_test.go`, `wrap_generated_gteq_1.8.go`, `capture_metrics_test.go`, `docs.go`, and `codegen/main.go`, no inherent vulnerabilities within the `httpsnoop` library itself were found that could be directly exploited by an external attacker to achieve high or critical impact.

The library's design focuses on safely wrapping the `http.ResponseWriter` to capture metrics without introducing security flaws. The code generation and hook mechanisms are implemented in a manner that does not expose exploitable attack vectors in a publicly accessible application context.

The test suite and the overall structure of the project emphasize robustness and compatibility, and do not reveal any indications of security weaknesses that would meet the specified criteria for inclusion in this vulnerability list.

Therefore, according to the given instructions and constraints, there are currently no vulnerabilities to report for the `httpsnoop` package that fit the high or critical severity level and are exploitable by an external attacker on a publicly available instance.
