## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities leading to SQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities_leading_to_sql_injection.md)

*   Critical Node: Compromise Application via go-sql-driver/mysql
    *   This is the ultimate goal and a critical point of focus for security.
*   Critical Node: Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities
    *   This node represents a broad category of attacks that are highly likely and impactful.
*   Critical Node: Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Application Queries
    *   This node specifically targets the most common and dangerous vulnerability when interacting with databases.
*   Attack Vector: Application fails to sanitize user input (Leaf Node)
    *   Likelihood: High
    *   Impact: High
    *   Description: The application does not properly clean or escape user-provided data before using it in SQL queries.
    *   Mitigation: Implement robust input validation and sanitization. Use parameterized queries.
*   Attack Vector: Application uses dynamic query construction with unsanitized input (Leaf Node)
    *   Likelihood: High
    *   Impact: High
    *   Description: The application builds SQL queries by directly concatenating strings, including user input, without proper sanitization.
    *   Mitigation: Avoid dynamic query construction. Use parameterized queries exclusively.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Connection Management Vulnerabilities leading to Credential Exposure](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_connection_management_vulnerabilities_leading_to_credential_exposure.md)

*   Critical Node: Compromise Application via go-sql-driver/mysql
    *   This is the ultimate goal and a critical point of focus for security.
*   Critical Node: Exploit Connection Management Vulnerabilities
    *   This node represents vulnerabilities in how the application manages its connection to the database, particularly concerning credentials.
*   Critical Node: Connection String Credential Exposure
    *   This node highlights the critical risk of exposing the credentials used to access the database.
*   Attack Vector: Hardcoded credentials in the application code (Leaf Node)
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Description: Database credentials (username, password) are directly embedded within the application's source code.
    *   Mitigation: Never hardcode credentials. Use environment variables or secure secret management.
*   Attack Vector: Credentials stored in easily accessible configuration files (Leaf Node)
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Description: Database credentials are stored in configuration files without proper protection or encryption, making them easily accessible to attackers.
    *   Mitigation: Secure configuration files with appropriate permissions. Consider encrypting sensitive data within configuration files or using dedicated secret management.
