# Attack Surface Analysis for go-sql-driver/mysql

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (Direct)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__direct_.md)

**How MySQL Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The driver executes SQL queries provided by the application. If these queries are built by concatenating user-supplied data without proper sanitization or parameterization, attackers can inject malicious SQL code.

**Example:** A web form takes a username as input. The application constructs a query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '` + userInput + `'`. An attacker enters `' OR '1'='1'; --` as the username, bypassing authentication.

**Impact:** Data breaches (reading sensitive data), data modification or deletion, authentication bypass, and potentially remote code execution on the database server (depending on database configurations and privileges).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Always use parameterized queries (prepared statements) with placeholders for user input.** This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection.
* Avoid dynamic SQL construction by concatenating strings.
* If dynamic SQL is absolutely necessary, use robust input validation and sanitization techniques, but this is generally discouraged.
* Implement the principle of least privilege for database users.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (via Stored Procedures/Functions)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__via_stored_proceduresfunctions_.md)

**How MySQL Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If the application calls stored procedures or functions with user-controlled input, vulnerabilities within those database objects can be exploited.

**Example:** A stored procedure takes a search term as input and uses it in a dynamic SQL query within the procedure. An attacker provides malicious input that injects SQL code into the stored procedure's query.

**Impact:** Similar to direct SQL injection: data breaches, data modification, and potentially other malicious actions within the database.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Securely code stored procedures and functions, ensuring they properly handle user input and avoid dynamic SQL construction within them.
* Apply the same input validation and sanitization principles to parameters passed to stored procedures as you would for direct queries.
* Review and audit stored procedure code for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass (Weak or Default Credentials)](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass__weak_or_default_credentials_.md)

**How MySQL Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The driver uses the provided credentials to authenticate with the MySQL server. If these credentials are weak, default, or easily guessable, attackers can gain unauthorized access.

**Example:** The application uses the default "root" user with a common or no password for the database connection.

**Impact:** Full access to the database, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete any data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong password policies for all database users.
* Change default database credentials immediately upon installation.
* Implement proper access control mechanisms and the principle of least privilege for database users.
* Avoid storing database credentials directly in the application code. Use secure configuration management or environment variables.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Lack of TLS)](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle_attacks__lack_of_tls_.md)

**How MySQL Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If the connection to the MySQL server is not encrypted using TLS, attackers on the network can intercept communication between the application and the database.

**Example:** An attacker on the same network as the application and database intercepts the unencrypted connection and captures database credentials or sensitive data being transmitted.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, including database credentials and query results. Attackers could potentially modify data in transit.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Always enforce TLS encryption for connections to the MySQL server.** Configure the `go-sql-driver/mysql` to require TLS.
* Ensure the MySQL server is properly configured to support and require TLS connections.
* Use valid and trusted SSL/TLS certificates.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting MySQL Server Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_mysql_server_vulnerabilities.md)

**How MySQL Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The application interacts with a specific version of the MySQL server. If that version has known security vulnerabilities, attackers might be able to exploit them through the application's interaction.

**Example:** A known buffer overflow vulnerability in a specific MySQL version could be triggered by sending a specially crafted query.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service on the database server.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep the MySQL server software up-to-date with the latest security patches.**
* Follow security best practices for hardening the MySQL server.
