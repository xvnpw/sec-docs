# Threat Model Analysis for go-sql-driver/mysql

## Threat: [Plaintext Credential Exposure in Connection String](./threats/plaintext_credential_exposure_in_connection_string.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the application's configuration or environment where the database connection string is stored. This string, used by `go-sql-driver/mysql`'s `driver.Open` function, contains the database username and password in plain text. The attacker can directly retrieve these credentials.

**Impact:** The attacker can use the exposed credentials to directly access the MySQL database, bypassing application security measures. This allows them to read, modify, or delete any data the compromised user has access to, potentially leading to data breaches, data corruption, or service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Unencrypted Connection](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_unencrypted_connection.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the MySQL database when the connection established by `go-sql-driver/mysql` is not encrypted using TLS/SSL. The attacker can eavesdrop on the communication, capturing sensitive data like credentials and query results being transmitted through the driver.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted between the application and the database, including credentials, application data, and potentially personally identifiable information (PII). This can lead to data breaches, identity theft, and further attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [SQL Injection Exploitation via Driver Query Execution](./threats/sql_injection_exploitation_via_driver_query_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries, and the application, using `go-sql-driver/mysql`'s query execution functions (like `db.Query` or `db.Exec`), executes this malicious code against the database because the application failed to properly sanitize or parameterize user input. The driver is the mechanism through which the malicious SQL reaches the database.

**Impact:** Successful SQL injection can allow the attacker to bypass authentication and authorization controls, read sensitive data, modify or delete data, execute arbitrary commands on the database server, or potentially compromise the underlying operating system.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the `go-sql-driver/mysql` Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the__go-sql-drivermysql__library.md)

**Description:** Security flaws or bugs exist within the `go-sql-driver/mysql` library code itself. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities when the application uses the affected versions of the driver.

**Impact:** Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, an attacker could potentially bypass security measures implemented by the driver, cause a denial of service by crashing the driver or the application, or in severe cases, potentially execute arbitrary code within the application's process.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Driver Options Leading to Insecurity](./threats/misconfiguration_of_driver_options_leading_to_insecurity.md)

**Description:** The application uses insecure or default configurations when initializing the `go-sql-driver/mysql` connection. This could involve disabling secure connection options (like TLS verification) or using less secure authentication methods supported by the driver.

**Impact:** This can expose the application and database to various attacks. For example, disabling TLS verification makes the application susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, even if the server supports TLS. Using weaker authentication methods can make brute-force attacks easier.

**Risk Severity:** High
