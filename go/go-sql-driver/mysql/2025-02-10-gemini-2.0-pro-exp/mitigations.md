## Mitigation Strategy: [Least Privilege Principle (Database User Permissions)](./mitigation_strategies/least_privilege_principle__database_user_permissions_.md)

*   **1. Least Privilege Principle (Database User Permissions)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  Within the MySQL server (using the MySQL command line, a GUI tool like MySQL Workbench, or a script), identify all distinct functionalities of the application that require database access.
        2.  For each functionality, determine the *minimum* set of database privileges required. Use `SHOW GRANTS FOR 'user'@'host';` to inspect existing privileges.
        3.  Create separate MySQL users for each distinct functionality (or group functionalities with identical needs).  Use `CREATE USER 'user'@'host' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';`.
        4.  Grant *only* the necessary privileges to each user.  Use the `GRANT` statement with specific table and column restrictions.  For example:
            *   `GRANT SELECT ON database.table TO 'user'@'host';` (Read-only access to a specific table)
            *   `GRANT INSERT, UPDATE ON database.table TO 'user'@'host';` (Insert and update access)
            *   `GRANT SELECT (column1, column2) ON database.table TO 'user'@'host';` (Read-only access to specific columns)
            *   `GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE database.procedure_name TO 'user'@'host';` (Execute a stored procedure)
            *   **Crucially, avoid:** `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ...`, `GRANT ... WITH GRANT OPTION`, and privileges on the `mysql` database itself (unless absolutely necessary for administrative users, *not* application users).
        5.  Use `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;` after making changes to user privileges to ensure they take effect.
        6.  Regularly review and audit the database user privileges using `SHOW GRANTS` and revoke any unnecessary privileges using `REVOKE`.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** (Severity: **High**) - Limits what an attacker can see even with a compromised application component.
        *   **Unauthorized Data Modification/Deletion:** (Severity: **High**) - Limits what an attacker can change or delete.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Reduces the chance of an attacker gaining higher privileges within the database.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access/Modification/Deletion:** Risk significantly reduced. The impact of a compromise is confined to the specific functionality of the compromised user.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced, as fewer avenues for escalation exist.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   A separate read-only user exists for reporting.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The main application uses a single user with broad privileges.  **High Priority to Fix.** Create separate users for different modules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Connection Security (TLS/SSL) - Server-Side Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/connection_security__tlsssl__-_server-side_configuration.md)

*   **2. Connection Security (TLS/SSL) - Server-Side Configuration**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  Obtain a TLS/SSL certificate. Options include:
            *   **Self-signed:** For testing *only*. Not secure for production.
            *   **Trusted CA:** From a commercial Certificate Authority (e.g., Let's Encrypt). Recommended for production.
            *   **Internal CA:** If your organization has its own Certificate Authority.
        2.  Configure the MySQL server to *require* TLS/SSL. Edit the MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`, typically in `/etc/mysql/` or `/etc/my.cnf.d/`). Add or modify the following settings within the `[mysqld]` section:
            ```
            ssl-ca=/path/to/ca.pem  # Path to the CA certificate (if using a CA)
            ssl-cert=/path/to/server-cert.pem  # Path to the server's certificate
            ssl-key=/path/to/server-key.pem  # Path to the server's private key
            require_secure_transport=ON # Forces all connections to use TLS
            ```
        3.  Restart the MySQL server for the changes to take effect.
        4.  Verify the configuration:
            *   From a client machine, try connecting *without* TLS. It should fail.
            *   Connect with TLS and verify the certificate using a tool like `openssl s_client -connect dbhost:3306 -starttls mysql`.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** (Severity: **High**) - Prevents interception and modification of communication.
        *   **Eavesdropping:** (Severity: **High**) - Prevents attackers from listening to database traffic.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **MITM Attacks:** Risk reduced to **Negligible** (when combined with client-side certificate verification).
        *   **Eavesdropping:** Risk reduced to **Negligible**.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   TLS is enabled on the server, but `require_secure_transport` is likely OFF (needs verification).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Verify `require_secure_transport=ON` is set.  **Medium Priority.**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Auditing (MySQL Server Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/auditing__mysql_server_configuration_.md)

*   **3. Auditing (MySQL Server Configuration)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Choose an auditing method:**
            *   **General Query Log:** Logs *every* SQL statement. High performance impact. Useful for short-term debugging or targeted investigations.  *Not recommended for continuous use in production.*
            *   **Slow Query Log:** Logs queries that exceed a defined execution time (`long_query_time`). Lower performance impact. Good for identifying performance bottlenecks and potentially suspicious queries.
            *   **MySQL Enterprise Audit:** (Requires a commercial MySQL license) Provides advanced auditing features, including filtering, user activity monitoring, and compliance reporting.  Best option for comprehensive auditing.
            *   **MariaDB Audit Plugin:** (If using MariaDB, a fork of MySQL) A free and open-source alternative to MySQL Enterprise Audit.
        2.  **Configure the chosen method:**
            *   **General Query Log:**
                ```
                [mysqld]
                general_log=ON
                general_log_file=/path/to/general.log
                log_output=FILE  # Or TABLE (for logging to the mysql.general_log table)
                ```
            *   **Slow Query Log:**
                ```
                [mysqld]
                slow_query_log=ON
                slow_query_log_file=/path/to/slow.log
                long_query_time=1  # Log queries taking longer than 1 second (adjust as needed)
                log_output=FILE  # Or TABLE
                log_slow_admin_statements=ON # Log slow administrative statements
                log_queries_not_using_indexes=ON # Log queries that don't use indexes
                ```
            *   **MySQL Enterprise Audit / MariaDB Audit Plugin:**  Refer to the respective documentation for configuration details. These plugins offer extensive configuration options.
        3.  **Configure log rotation:**  Use a tool like `logrotate` (on Linux) to prevent log files from growing indefinitely.
        4.  **Secure the log files:**  Ensure that the log files are protected from unauthorized access and modification. Set appropriate file permissions.
        5.  **Regularly review the logs:**  Establish a process for reviewing the audit logs for suspicious activity.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Intrusion Detection:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Helps detect malicious activity.
        *   **Forensic Analysis:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Provides a record for investigations.
        *   **Compliance:** (Severity: **Low**) - May be required for compliance.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Intrusion Detection/Forensic Analysis:** Provides valuable information.
        *   **Compliance:** Helps meet requirements.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   No database auditing is enabled.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Enable the slow query log (at a minimum) and configure log rotation.  Consider a more comprehensive auditing solution if required.  **Medium Priority.**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable `multiStatements` (Server-Side - If Possible)](./mitigation_strategies/disable__multistatements___server-side_-_if_possible_.md)

*   **4. Disable `multiStatements` (Server-Side - If Possible)**

    *   **Description:**
        *   While primarily controlled by the client (via the DSN), some MySQL server configurations *might* have settings that globally disable or restrict multi-statement execution.  This is less common and less reliable than controlling it on the client-side, but it's worth checking.
        *   There isn't a single, universally reliable server-side setting to *completely* disable `multiStatements` for all clients. The client's DSN setting usually takes precedence.
        *   **However, you can investigate:**
            *   **Stored Procedures/Functions:** If you are using stored procedures or functions, ensure they are *not* designed in a way that could be vulnerable to SQL injection if `multiStatements` were enabled on the client. Review their code carefully.
            *   **User Permissions (Again):**  While not a direct disable, ensure that application users *do not* have privileges that would allow them to create or modify stored procedures or functions. This limits the potential impact if an attacker *did* manage to use `multiStatements`.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **SQL Injection (with `multiStatements`):** (Severity: **Critical**) - Reduces the potential impact of SQL injection if the client enables `multiStatements`.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **SQL Injection (with `multiStatements`):** Provides a small, additional layer of defense, but primarily relies on the client-side DSN setting.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Unknown. Needs investigation of stored procedures/functions (if any).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Review stored procedures/functions for potential vulnerabilities related to `multiStatements`. **Low Priority** (since the client-side setting is the primary control).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Segmentation (MySQL Server Placement)](./mitigation_strategies/network_segmentation__mysql_server_placement_.md)

*   **5. Network Segmentation (MySQL Server Placement)**
    *   **Description:**
        1.  Physically or logically separate the MySQL server from the application server and any public-facing networks.
        2.  Use a firewall (hardware or software) to *strictly* control access to the MySQL server.
        3.  **Allow only:**
            *   Connections from the application server's IP address(es) on the MySQL port (default: 3306).
            *   Connections from authorized administrative hosts (if necessary) on a *different* port (e.g., a dedicated management port), and ideally using SSH tunneling or a VPN.
        4.  **Block all other incoming connections.**
        5.  Regularly review and audit the firewall rules.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Database Server:** (Severity: **High**) - Prevents direct access from the internet or other compromised systems.
        *   **Lateral Movement:** (Severity: **High**) - Limits an attacker's ability to move from a compromised application server to the database.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access/Lateral Movement:** Risk significantly reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   The application and database servers are on the same subnet.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Move the database server to a separate, isolated network segment and configure firewall rules. **High Priority.**
