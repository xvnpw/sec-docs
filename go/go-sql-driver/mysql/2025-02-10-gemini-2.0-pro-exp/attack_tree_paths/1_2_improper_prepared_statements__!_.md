## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2 Improper Prepared Statements

### 4.1 Vulnerability Definition

In the context of `go-sql-driver/mysql`, "improper prepared statements" refer to situations where the developer *intends* to use prepared statements for security but implements them incorrectly, thereby negating the intended protection against SQL injection.  The core issue is the **misuse of placeholders** or **string formatting that incorporates user input directly into the SQL query string *before* it is prepared.**

The `go-sql-driver/mysql` library uses `?` as the placeholder character.  These placeholders are *only* meant to be substituted with *values*.  They cannot be used for:

*   Table names
*   Column names
*   SQL keywords (e.g., `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`)
*   Parts of operators (e.g., trying to build `LIKE` clauses piecemeal)

### 4.2 Code Pattern Analysis (Anti-Patterns)

Here are some common anti-patterns that lead to improper prepared statements:

**Anti-Pattern 1: String Formatting Before Preparation (Most Common)**

```go
userInput := r.FormValue("userInput")
query := fmt.Sprintf("SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%%%s%%'", userInput) // DANGEROUS!
rows, err := db.Query(query)
// ... handle rows and error ...
```

**Explanation:** The `fmt.Sprintf` function builds the entire query string *before* it's passed to `db.Query`.  The `userInput` is directly concatenated into the query, making it vulnerable to injection.  The database driver sees a fully formed query string, not a prepared statement template.

**Anti-Pattern 2:  Incorrect Placeholder Usage (Less Common, but Still Dangerous)**

```go
userInput := r.FormValue("userInput")
columnName := r.FormValue("columnName") // User controls column name!
query := "SELECT * FROM products WHERE ? = ?" // DANGEROUS!
rows, err := db.Query(query, columnName, userInput)
// ... handle rows and error ...
```

**Explanation:**  Placeholders cannot be used for column names.  This code attempts to dynamically select a column based on user input, which is a major security risk.  Even if `columnName` is validated against a whitelist, it's still a bad practice and can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Anti-Pattern 3:  Building SQL Keywords Dynamically**

```go
userInput := r.FormValue("userInput")
orderBy := r.FormValue("orderBy") // User controls ORDER BY clause!
query := "SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE ? ORDER BY " + orderBy // DANGEROUS!
rows, err := db.Query(query, "%"+userInput+"%")
// ... handle rows and error ...
```

**Explanation:**  The `ORDER BY` clause is constructed using string concatenation with user input.  An attacker could inject `name; DROP TABLE products; --` into `orderBy` to execute arbitrary SQL.

### 4.3 Exploitation Techniques

Let's illustrate exploitation with Anti-Pattern 1:

**Vulnerable Code:**

```go
userInput := r.FormValue("userInput")
query := fmt.Sprintf("SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%%%s%%'", userInput)
rows, err := db.Query(query)
// ...
```

**Exploit 1:  Bypass Authentication (if used in a login query)**

*   **`userInput`:**  `' OR '1'='1`
*   **Resulting Query:** `SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%' OR '1'='1%'`
*   **Effect:**  This query will likely return all products, bypassing any name-based filtering.  If this were a login query, it could allow an attacker to log in without a valid password.

**Exploit 2:  Data Exfiltration (UNION-based injection)**

*   **`userInput`:**  `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --`
*   **Resulting Query:** `SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --%'`
*   **Effect:**  This attempts to combine the results of the original query with a query that selects usernames and passwords from a `users` table.  The `--` comments out the rest of the original query.  The success of this depends on the number of columns matching between the `products` and `users` tables.

**Exploit 3:  Time-Based Blind SQL Injection**

*   **`userInput`:**  `' AND (SELECT SLEEP(5)) --`
*   **Resulting Query:** `SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%' AND (SELECT SLEEP(5)) --%'`
*   **Effect:**  This introduces a 5-second delay if the condition is true.  An attacker can use this to infer information bit by bit.  For example, they could test if the first character of an administrator's username is 'a', then 'b', etc., by observing the delay.

### 4.4 Impact Assessment

The impact of successful SQL injection through improper prepared statements is **very high**:

*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers can read sensitive data (passwords, credit card numbers, personal information) from the database.
*   **Data Modification:**  Attackers can alter data, potentially causing financial loss, reputational damage, or operational disruption.
*   **Data Deletion:**  Attackers can delete data, leading to data loss and service outages.
*   **Database Compromise:**  In some cases, attackers can gain control of the database server itself, potentially escalating to full system compromise.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can craft queries that consume excessive resources, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Regulatory Violations:**  Data breaches can lead to violations of regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA, resulting in fines and legal action.

### 4.5 Mitigation Strategies

The primary mitigation is to **correctly use prepared statements**:

**1.  Use Placeholders Correctly:**

```go
userInput := r.FormValue("userInput")
query := "SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE ?"
rows, err := db.Query(query, "%"+userInput+"%") // Correct!
// ... handle rows and error ...
```

**Explanation:**  The `?` placeholder is used *only* for the value being compared.  The wildcard characters (`%`) are concatenated with the *parameter* (`userInput`), not the query string itself.  This ensures that the database driver treats `userInput` as a literal value, preventing injection.

**2.  Validate and Sanitize Input (Defense in Depth):**

Even with prepared statements, it's good practice to validate and sanitize user input:

*   **Whitelist allowed characters:**  If you know the expected format of the input (e.g., an email address), enforce it.
*   **Limit input length:**  Prevent excessively long inputs that could be used for denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Escape special characters (if necessary):**  While prepared statements handle most escaping, you might need additional escaping for specific database functions or logging.

**3.  Avoid Dynamic SQL Generation:**

Do *not* build SQL queries dynamically based on user input, especially for table names, column names, or SQL keywords.  If you need to query different tables or columns based on user input, use a safe mechanism like a map of allowed values:

```go
allowedColumns := map[string]string{
    "name":  "name",
    "price": "price",
}

columnName := r.FormValue("columnName")
safeColumn, ok := allowedColumns[columnName]
if !ok {
    // Handle invalid column name (e.g., return an error)
    return
}

query := fmt.Sprintf("SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY %s", safeColumn) // Safe because safeColumn is from a whitelist
rows, err := db.Query(query)
// ...
```
**4. Use ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) - Optional, but Recommended:**

Consider using a well-vetted ORM like GORM or sqlc.  ORMs often handle prepared statements and parameter binding automatically, reducing the risk of manual errors.  However, it's *crucial* to understand how the ORM works and ensure it's configured securely.  Don't blindly trust an ORM without understanding its security implications.

**5.  Least Privilege Principle:**

Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary privileges.  Do *not* use a root or administrator account.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they successfully exploit a SQL injection vulnerability.

### 4.6 Detection Techniques

*   **Code Review:**  Manually inspect the code for any instances of string formatting or concatenation involving user input and SQL queries.  Look for `fmt.Sprintf`, `strings.Join`, and other string manipulation functions used in conjunction with database queries.
*   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., `go vet`, `golangci-lint` with appropriate linters) to automatically detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.  These tools can identify patterns of string formatting and database interactions that are indicative of risk.  Configure the tools to specifically look for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Dynamic Testing (Penetration Testing):**  Use automated scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) or manual penetration testing techniques to attempt to inject malicious SQL code into the application.  This helps to confirm the presence of vulnerabilities and assess their exploitability.  Test with a wide variety of injection payloads.
*   **Database Query Logging (with Caution):**  Enable query logging on the database server (temporarily, for testing purposes) to inspect the actual SQL queries being executed.  This can help you identify if user input is being incorporated into the query string in an unintended way.  **Be extremely careful with query logging in production, as it can expose sensitive data.**

### 4.7 False Positives/Negatives

*   **False Positives:**  Static analysis tools might flag code as vulnerable even if it's safe, especially if the code uses complex string manipulation or dynamic SQL generation that is properly sanitized.  Manual review is necessary to confirm false positives.
*   **False Negatives:**  Static analysis tools and scanners might miss vulnerabilities if the code uses unusual or obfuscated techniques to construct SQL queries.  Code review and penetration testing are essential to catch these cases.  ORMs can also introduce false negatives if they are misconfigured or have their own vulnerabilities.

## 5. Conclusion

Improper prepared statements represent a significant SQL injection risk in Go applications using `go-sql-driver/mysql`.  By understanding the common anti-patterns, exploitation techniques, and mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, developers can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this vulnerability.  A combination of secure coding practices, thorough code review, static analysis, and dynamic testing is crucial for ensuring the security of database interactions.  The use of an ORM can be beneficial, but it should not be considered a silver bullet and requires careful configuration and understanding.  Continuous vigilance and a proactive approach to security are essential for protecting applications from SQL injection attacks.
