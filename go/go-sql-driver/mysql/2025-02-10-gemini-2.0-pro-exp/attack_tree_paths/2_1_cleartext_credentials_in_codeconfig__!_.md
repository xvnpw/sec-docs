# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Cleartext Credentials in Code/Config

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the risks, implications, and mitigation strategies associated with storing database credentials in cleartext within the application's source code or configuration files, specifically when using the `go-sql-driver/mysql` library for database interaction in a Go application.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to eliminate this vulnerability.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Target:** Go applications utilizing the `go-sql-driver/mysql` library for MySQL database connectivity.
*   **Vulnerability:**  Cleartext storage of database credentials (username, password, connection string, including host, port, and database name).
*   **Locations:**
    *   Source code files (e.g., `.go` files).
    *   Configuration files (e.g., `.yaml`, `.json`, `.toml`, `.ini`, `.env` - *if unencrypted*).
    *   Build artifacts (e.g., compiled binaries, Docker images - *if credentials were embedded during build*).
    *   Version control history (e.g., Git commits).
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis does *not* cover other attack vectors related to database security, such as SQL injection, weak authentication mechanisms (beyond cleartext storage), or network-level vulnerabilities.  It also does not cover vulnerabilities in the `go-sql-driver/mysql` library itself.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Risk Assessment:**  Reiterate and expand upon the likelihood, impact, effort, skill level, and detection difficulty outlined in the original attack tree.
2.  **Technical Deep Dive:** Explain *how* this vulnerability manifests in the context of `go-sql-driver/mysql` and Go applications.  Provide code examples of vulnerable and secure configurations.
3.  **Impact Analysis:** Detail the specific consequences of exploiting this vulnerability, including potential data breaches, system compromise, and reputational damage.
4.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Provide detailed, practical, and prioritized recommendations for preventing and remediating this vulnerability.  This will include code examples and best practices.
5.  **Detection Techniques:** Describe methods for identifying instances of this vulnerability in existing codebases and configurations.
6.  **Tooling Recommendations:** Suggest specific tools that can assist in preventing, detecting, and managing this vulnerability.

## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1 Risk Assessment (Expanded)

*   **Likelihood: Medium (Trending Towards High):** While developers are increasingly aware of security best practices, the ease of hardcoding credentials for initial development and testing often leads to this vulnerability persisting into production.  The proliferation of cloud-based services and containerization increases the risk of accidental exposure.
*   **Impact: Very High (Catastrophic):**  Complete and immediate compromise of the database.  An attacker gains full read, write, and potentially administrative access.  This can lead to data theft, data modification, data destruction, denial of service, and potentially lateral movement within the network.
*   **Effort: Very Low:**  If the source code, configuration files, or build artifacts are accessible, extracting the credentials is trivial.  This can be achieved through unauthorized access to the repository, compromised developer workstations, exposed configuration files on web servers, or even through decompilation of binaries.
*   **Skill Level: Beginner:**  No specialized hacking skills are required.  Basic understanding of file systems and text editors is sufficient.
*   **Detection Difficulty: Easy (If Accessible):**  Simple text searches (e.g., `grep`, `ripgrep`) within the codebase and configuration files can quickly reveal hardcoded credentials.  However, detection becomes more difficult if the code is obfuscated or if the credentials are only present in build artifacts or version control history.

### 4.2 Technical Deep Dive (go-sql-driver/mysql)

The `go-sql-driver/mysql` library uses a Data Source Name (DSN) string to establish a connection to the MySQL database.  This DSN contains all the necessary connection parameters, including the username, password, host, port, and database name.

**Vulnerable Example (Hardcoded Credentials):**

```go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	_ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
)

func main() {
	// VULNERABLE: Credentials hardcoded in the source code!
	db, err := sql.Open("mysql", "user:password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/dbname")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	// ... database operations ...
	fmt.Println("Connected to the database!")
}
```

**Vulnerable Example (Unencrypted Config File):**

`config.yaml`:

```yaml
database:
  user: user
  password: password
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 3306
  dbname: dbname
```

```go
package main
// ... imports
func main() {
    //Read config.yaml
    // VULNERABLE: Credentials in plain text config file
    db, err := sql.Open("mysql", fmt.Sprintf("%s:%s@tcp(%s:%d)/%s", config.Database.User, config.Database.Password, config.Database.Host, config.Database.Port, config.Database.Dbname)
    // ...
}
```

In both of these examples, the credentials are readily available to anyone with access to the source code or the `config.yaml` file.

**Secure Example (Environment Variables):**

```go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"

	_ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
)

func main() {
	// Secure: Credentials read from environment variables.
	dbUser := os.Getenv("DB_USER")
	dbPass := os.Getenv("DB_PASS")
	dbHost := os.Getenv("DB_HOST")
	dbPort := os.Getenv("DB_PORT") // Could also be an integer and use strconv.Itoa
	dbName := os.Getenv("DB_NAME")

	dsn := fmt.Sprintf("%s:%s@tcp(%s:%s)/%s", dbUser, dbPass, dbHost, dbPort, dbName)
	db, err := sql.Open("mysql", dsn)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	// ... database operations ...
	fmt.Println("Connected to the database!")
}
```

This example retrieves the credentials from environment variables, which are set outside the application's code.  This is a significant improvement, as the credentials are not stored within the codebase itself.

### 4.3 Impact Analysis

The consequences of exploiting this vulnerability are severe and far-reaching:

*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers can steal sensitive data, including personally identifiable information (PII), financial records, intellectual property, and trade secrets.  This can lead to regulatory fines (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), legal action, and reputational damage.
*   **Data Modification/Destruction:**  Attackers can alter or delete data, causing data integrity issues, operational disruptions, and financial losses.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can overload the database server, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  The compromised database credentials can be used to access other systems within the network, potentially leading to a full system compromise.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A data breach can severely damage the organization's reputation, leading to loss of customer trust and business opportunities.
*   **Financial Loss:**  The costs associated with a data breach can be substantial, including incident response, legal fees, regulatory fines, and customer compensation.

### 4.4 Mitigation Strategies (Prioritized)

1.  **Never Store Credentials in Source Code or Unencrypted Configuration Files (Highest Priority):** This is the most fundamental rule.  Absolutely no exceptions.
2.  **Use Environment Variables:**  Store credentials as environment variables.  This is a widely supported and relatively secure method, especially when combined with proper access controls.
3.  **Use a Secure Configuration Management System:**
    *   **HashiCorp Vault:**  A robust solution for managing secrets, including database credentials.  Vault provides dynamic secrets, encryption, and auditing capabilities.
    *   **AWS Secrets Manager:**  A cloud-based service for storing and managing secrets in AWS environments.
    *   **Azure Key Vault:**  A cloud-based service for storing and managing secrets in Azure environments.
    *   **Google Cloud Secret Manager:** A cloud-based service for storing and managing secrets in Google Cloud environments.
    These systems provide centralized, secure storage and access control for sensitive information.
4.  **Ensure Proper File Permissions:**  If configuration files *must* be used (though strongly discouraged for credentials), ensure they have the most restrictive file permissions possible (e.g., `chmod 600` on Linux/macOS).  Only the application's user should have read access.
5.  **Regularly Rotate Credentials:**  Change database passwords frequently and automatically.  This limits the impact of a potential credential compromise.  Secrets management systems often provide automated credential rotation.
6.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant the database user only the necessary permissions.  Avoid using the `root` user or granting excessive privileges.
7.  **Code Reviews:**  Mandatory code reviews should specifically check for hardcoded credentials.
8.  **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):**  Use SAST tools to automatically scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities, including hardcoded credentials.
9.  **Secrets Scanning:** Use secrets scanning tools to detect secrets committed to version control systems.

### 4.5 Detection Techniques

*   **Manual Code Review:**  Carefully examine the codebase and configuration files for any instances of hardcoded credentials.
*   **Automated Code Scanning (SAST):**  Use SAST tools to automatically scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities, including hardcoded credentials.
*   **Regular Expression Searches:**  Use tools like `grep` or `ripgrep` to search for patterns that match typical credential formats (e.g., `password=`, `user:`, `@tcp(`).  Example:
    ```bash
    rg --hidden --no-ignore --type go "password=|user:|@tcp\("
    ```
*   **Secrets Scanning Tools:** Use tools designed to detect secrets in code repositories (see Tooling Recommendations below).
*   **Review Version Control History:**  Examine past commits to identify any instances where credentials may have been accidentally committed.
* **Binary Analysis:** In some cases, credentials might be embedded in compiled binaries. Decompilation tools can be used to inspect the binary for embedded strings. This is a more advanced technique and should be used with caution.

### 4.6 Tooling Recommendations

*   **SAST Tools:**
    *   **Semgrep:** A fast, open-source, static analysis tool that supports custom rules.  Excellent for finding hardcoded credentials.
