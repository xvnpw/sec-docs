## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1 (Untrusted Input to Query)

### 4.1 Vulnerability Explanation

SQL Injection occurs when an attacker can manipulate the structure or logic of a SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code through untrusted input.  The `go-sql-driver/mysql` library itself *does not* inherently protect against SQL Injection.  It provides the *tools* (parameterized queries) to prevent it, but it's the developer's responsibility to use them correctly.  If a developer uses string concatenation or interpolation to build SQL queries with user-provided data, the application becomes vulnerable.

The core issue is that the database cannot distinguish between legitimate parts of the query and attacker-supplied code when the query is built as a single string.  The attacker's input becomes part of the query's syntax, allowing them to alter its intended behavior.

### 4.2 Attack Vector Analysis

Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through various input channels:

*   **HTTP Request Parameters:**  The most common vector.  Data from `GET` parameters (query string), `POST` parameters (form data), and even HTTP headers (e.g., `User-Agent`, `Referer`) can be manipulated.
*   **API Calls:**  If the application exposes an API, input parameters to API endpoints are potential attack vectors.
*   **File Uploads:**  Filenames, metadata, or even the contents of uploaded files (if processed by the database) can be used for injection.
*   **Database-Stored Data:**  If data previously stored in the database (potentially from a different, less secure application) is used in subsequent queries without proper sanitization, it can lead to "second-order" SQL Injection.
*   **External Data Sources:** Data retrieved from external APIs, message queues, or other systems can be compromised and used for injection.

### 4.3 Exploitation Techniques

Here are some common SQL Injection techniques, categorized by their goal:

**A. Information Disclosure:**

*   **Error-Based SQL Injection:**  The attacker crafts input that causes the database to return error messages revealing information about the database structure, table names, column names, or even data.
    *   **Example:**  `' OR 1=1 --` (often used to bypass authentication)
    *   **Example (Error Forcing):** `' AND (SELECT 1/0) --` (division by zero to trigger an error)
*   **Union-Based SQL Injection:**  The attacker uses the `UNION` operator to combine the results of the original query with the results of a malicious query, allowing them to extract data from other tables.
    *   **Example:** `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --`
*   **Blind SQL Injection:**  The attacker doesn't see the results of the injected query directly (no error messages or data returned).  Instead, they infer information based on the application's behavior (e.g., response time, HTTP status codes).
    *   **Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection:**  The attacker asks a series of true/false questions by injecting conditions and observing whether the application's response changes.
        *   **Example:** `' AND (SELECT ASCII(SUBSTRING(database(),1,1)) > 100) --` (checks if the first character of the database name has an ASCII value greater than 100)
    *   **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:**  The attacker injects commands that cause the database to delay its response, allowing them to infer information based on the delay.
        *   **Example:** `' AND (SELECT SLEEP(5) WHERE 1=1) --` (causes a 5-second delay if the condition is true)

**B. Data Modification/Deletion:**

*   **Modifying Data:**  The attacker injects `UPDATE` statements to change data in the database.
    *   **Example:** `'; UPDATE users SET password = 'newpassword' WHERE username = 'admin'; --`
*   **Deleting Data:**  The attacker injects `DELETE` statements to remove data.
    *   **Example:** `'; DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1; --`
*   **Inserting Data:** The attacker injects `INSERT` statements.
    *   **Example:** `'; INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('hacker', 'pwned'); --`

**C. Database/System Compromise:**

*   **Executing System Commands (if the database user has sufficient privileges):**  Some database systems (e.g., older versions of MySQL) allow executing operating system commands through SQL functions (e.g., `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server, `system()` in some MySQL configurations).  This is extremely dangerous.
*   **Reading/Writing Files (if the database user has file access privileges):**  The attacker might be able to read sensitive files from the server or write malicious files (e.g., web shells).
*   **Gaining Database Administrator Privileges:**  The attacker might exploit vulnerabilities to escalate their privileges within the database.

### 4.4 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful SQL Injection attack can range from minor to catastrophic:

*   **Data Breach:**  Exposure of sensitive data (user credentials, personal information, financial data, etc.).
*   **Data Modification:**  Unauthorized changes to data, leading to data corruption, financial fraud, or reputational damage.
*   **Data Deletion:**  Loss of critical data, potentially causing business disruption or permanent data loss.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker can overload the database server with resource-intensive queries, making the application unavailable.
*   **Complete System Compromise:**  In the worst-case scenario, the attacker can gain control of the database server and potentially the entire system.
*   **Regulatory Violations:**  Data breaches can lead to violations of regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA, resulting in significant fines and legal consequences.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of customer trust and damage to the organization's reputation.

### 4.5 Mitigation Strategies

**A. Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements) - The Primary Defense:**

This is the *most effective* way to prevent SQL Injection.  Parameterized queries separate the SQL code from the data.  The database driver treats the parameters as *data*, not as part of the SQL command, preventing attackers from injecting code.

```go
// SECURE CODE
username := r.FormValue("username")
query := "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"
rows, err := db.Query(query, username) // username is treated as data
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
defer rows.Close()

// ... process rows ...
```

*   **How it works:** The `?` acts as a placeholder.  The `db.Query()` function (or `db.Exec()`, `db.QueryRow()`, etc.) takes the query string and the parameter values separately.  The driver sends the query with placeholders to the database server.  The server then prepares the query (parses and optimizes it) *without* the data.  Finally, the driver sends the parameter values, and the server executes the prepared query with the data, ensuring that the data is never interpreted as code.

*   **Multiple Parameters:** You can use multiple placeholders:

```go
query := "SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ? AND price < ?"
rows, err := db.Query(query, category, maxPrice)
```

*   **Named Parameters (MySQL Driver Specific):** The `go-sql-driver/mysql` driver supports named parameters, which can improve readability:

```go
query := "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = @username AND email = @email"
rows, err := db.Query(query,
    sql.Named("username", username),
    sql.Named("email", email),
)
```
**Important:** Named parameters are converted to positional `?` placeholders before being sent to the MySQL server. They are a client-side convenience, not a server-side feature.

**B. Input Validation and Sanitization (Defense-in-Depth):**

Even with parameterized queries, it's crucial to validate and sanitize all user input.  This provides an extra layer of defense and helps prevent other types of attacks.

*   **Validation:**  Check that the input conforms to the expected format, type, length, and range.  For example:
    *   **Data Type:**  Ensure that numeric input is actually a number, dates are valid dates, etc.
    *   **Length:**  Limit the length of strings to prevent buffer overflows or excessively long queries.
    *   **Format:**  Use regular expressions to enforce specific formats (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers).
    *   **Range:**  Check that numeric values are within acceptable bounds.
    *   **Whitelist:** If possible, define a whitelist of allowed values and reject anything that doesn't match.
*   **Sanitization:**  Remove or escape any potentially dangerous characters from the input.  However, *rely primarily on parameterized queries for SQL Injection prevention*.  Sanitization can be error-prone and is best used as a secondary defense.  Examples of sanitization (but again, *parameterized queries are the primary defense*):
    *   **Escaping:**  The `go-sql-driver/mysql` driver automatically handles escaping when using parameterized queries.  You generally *should not* manually escape data.
    *   **Encoding:**  Consider using HTML encoding or URL encoding if the data will be displayed in a web page or used in a URL.

**C. Least Privilege Principle:**

The database user account used by the application should have the *minimum* necessary privileges.  Don't use the `root` user or an account with administrative privileges.  Grant only the specific permissions required for the application to function (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` on specific tables).  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they successfully exploit a SQL Injection vulnerability.

**D. Error Handling:**

*   **Never expose raw database error messages to the user.**  These messages can reveal sensitive information about the database structure.  Instead, log the errors and display a generic error message to the user.
*   **Use a consistent error handling strategy throughout the application.**

**E. Web Application Firewall (WAF):**

A WAF can help detect and block SQL Injection attempts by analyzing incoming HTTP requests and filtering out malicious patterns.  However, a WAF should be considered a supplementary defense, not a replacement for secure coding practices.

**F. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**

Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection.

### 4.6 Code Examples

**Vulnerable Code (DO NOT USE):**

```go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"

	_ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
)

func main() {
	db, err := sql.Open("mysql", "user:password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/database")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	http.HandleFunc("/user", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		username := r.FormValue("username") // Untrusted input

		// VULNERABLE: Direct string concatenation
		query := "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'"
		rows, err := db.Query(query)
		if err != nil {
			// DO NOT expose raw error messages to the user!
			http.Error(w, "Internal Server Error", http.StatusInternalServerError)
			log.Println(err) // Log the error for debugging
			return
		}
		defer rows.Close()

		// ... (process rows - potentially vulnerable to data leakage if not handled carefully) ...
		fmt.Fprintln(w, "User data retrieved (vulnerable implementation)")
	})

	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

**Secure Code (Using Parameterized Queries):**

```go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"regexp"

	_ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
)

func main() {
	db, err := sql.Open("mysql", "user:password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/database")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	http.HandleFunc("/user", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		username := r.FormValue("username")

		// Input Validation (example - adjust as needed)
		if !isValidUsername(username) {
			http.Error(w, "Invalid username format", http.StatusBadRequest)
			return
		}

		// SECURE: Parameterized query
		query := "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"
		rows, err := db.Query(query, username)
		if err != nil {
			http.Error(w, "Internal Server Error", http.StatusInternalServerError)
			log.Println(err) // Log the error
			return
		}
		defer rows.Close()

		// ... (process rows securely) ...
		fmt.Fprintln(w, "User data retrieved (secure implementation)")
	})

	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}

// Example input validation function (using a regular expression)
func isValidUsername(username string) bool {
	// Allow alphanumeric characters and underscores, 3-20 characters long
	match, _ := regexp.MatchString("^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,20}$", username)
	return match
}

```

### 4.7 Testing and Detection

*   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., `go vet`, `gosec`) to identify potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities in your code.  These tools can detect patterns of string concatenation in SQL queries.
*   **Dynamic Analysis:** Use dynamic analysis tools (e.g., web application scanners, penetration testing tools) to actively test your application for SQL Injection vulnerabilities.  These tools send crafted requests to your application and analyze the responses for signs of injection.  Examples include:
    *   **OWASP ZAP:** A free and open-source web application security scanner.
    *   **Burp Suite:** A popular commercial web security testing tool.
    *   **sqlmap:** A powerful open-source tool specifically designed for detecting and exploiting SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Manual Code Review:**  Carefully review your code, paying close attention to how user input is handled in SQL queries.
*   **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests that specifically test the database interaction logic with various inputs, including potentially malicious ones.  Ensure that your tests cover different scenarios and edge cases.
* **Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing techniques to generate a large number of random or semi-random inputs and test your application's resilience to unexpected data.

### 4.8 Edge Cases and Considerations

*   **Stored Procedures:**  Even if you use stored procedures, you must still use parameterized queries *within* the stored procedure if it accepts user input.  Simply calling a stored procedure doesn't automatically prevent SQL Injection.
*   **Dynamic SQL within Stored Procedures:**  If your stored procedure uses dynamic SQL (building SQL queries as strings within the procedure), it's still vulnerable to SQL Injection if user input is incorporated into the dynamic SQL.  Use parameterized queries within the dynamic SQL as well.
*   **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) Libraries:**  ORMs can help prevent SQL Injection, but they are not a silver bullet.  You must still use the ORM's features correctly.  Some ORMs have had SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the past.  Always keep your ORM library up to date.
*   **Database-Specific Features:**  Be aware of any database-specific features or functions that might introduce SQL Injection vulnerabilities.  For example, some databases have functions that allow executing arbitrary SQL code.
*  **LIKE operator:** When using LIKE operator, you need to escape special characters like `%` and `_`. Parameterized queries will handle this escaping automatically.
* **Charset Issues:** Ensure consistent character sets are used throughout your application (client, connection, database) to prevent character encoding-related injection attacks.

## 5. Conclusion

SQL Injection is a serious and prevalent vulnerability.  By consistently using parameterized queries, validating and sanitizing user input, and following other security best practices, developers can effectively prevent SQL Injection attacks in Go applications using the `go-sql-driver/mysql` library.  Regular security testing and code reviews are essential to ensure that these defenses are implemented correctly and remain effective over time.  The "defense-in-depth" approach, combining multiple layers of security, is crucial for building robust and secure applications.
