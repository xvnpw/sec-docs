# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for go-sql-driver/mysql

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_parameterized_queries__prepared_statements_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify database interaction points:** Review your Go application code and find all places where SQL queries are executed using `database/sql` and `go-sql-driver/mysql`.
    2.  **Use Placeholders:** Instead of directly embedding user input into SQL query strings, use placeholders (`?`) within the query.
    3.  **Pass User Input as Arguments:** When executing queries with functions like `db.Query`, `db.Exec`, `stmt.Query`, or `stmt.Exec`, pass user-provided data as separate arguments *after* the query string. The `go-sql-driver/mysql` will handle escaping these arguments, preventing SQL injection.
    4.  **Example (Secure):**
        ```go
        userInput := "malicious' OR '1'='1"
        query := "SELECT * FROM items WHERE name = ?"
        rows, err := db.Query(query, userInput) // userInput is treated as data
        ```
    5.  **Test Implementation:** After converting to parameterized queries, test your application to confirm that SQL injection vulnerabilities are no longer present.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (Severity: High) - Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through user inputs, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High - Parameterized queries are highly effective in preventing SQL injection attacks when using `go-sql-driver/mysql`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Used in critical sections like authentication and data modification, but not consistently across all modules.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Inconsistent usage in reporting features and older parts of the codebase. Needs a project-wide audit and refactoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Secure Connections with TLS/SSL Encryption via Connection String](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_secure_connections_with_tlsssl_encryption_via_connection_string.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure MySQL Server for TLS:** Ensure your MySQL server is configured to support and preferably require TLS/SSL connections. This usually involves setting up server-side certificates.
    2.  **Modify `go-sql-driver/mysql` Connection String:**  When establishing a database connection in your Go application, modify the connection string to include TLS parameters.
    3.  **Enable TLS Parameter:** Add `tls=true` to your connection string. This enables basic TLS encryption.
    4.  **Optional: Server Certificate Verification:** For stronger security, enable server certificate verification. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks. You can configure this by specifying a CA certificate file in the connection string using parameters like `tls-ca=/path/to/ca.pem`.
    5.  **Example Connection String (TLS Enabled):**
        ```go
        dsn := "user:password@tcp(host:port)/dbname?tls=true" // Basic TLS
        dsnWithVerification := "user:password@tcp(host:port)/dbname?tls=true&tls-ca=/path/to/ca.pem" // TLS with server verification
        ```
    6.  **Test TLS Connection:** Verify that your application successfully connects to MySQL using TLS/SSL by monitoring network traffic or checking MySQL server logs.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Eavesdropping (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from intercepting and reading sensitive data transmitted between the application and the MySQL server over the network.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Severity: High) - Protects against attackers who might try to intercept and manipulate communication between your application and the MySQL server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Eavesdropping: High - TLS encryption effectively secures data in transit.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: High - Server certificate verification (when implemented) significantly reduces MitM risks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - TLS is enabled in production environments using `tls=true` in the connection string.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Server certificate verification (`tls-ca`) is not consistently enforced across all environments (development, staging, production).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Connection Pooling using `database/sql` features](./mitigation_strategies/implement_connection_pooling_using__databasesql__features.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize `database/sql` Pooling:** The `database/sql` package, which `go-sql-driver/mysql` works with, provides built-in connection pooling.
    2.  **Configure Pool Limits:** Use methods like `db.SetMaxIdleConns(n)`, `db.SetMaxOpenConns(m)`, and `db.SetConnMaxLifetime(t)` on your `sql.DB` object to configure the connection pool.
        *   `SetMaxIdleConns`: Sets the maximum number of idle connections in the pool.
        *   `SetMaxOpenConns`: Sets the maximum number of open connections to the database.
        *   `SetConnMaxLifetime`: Sets the maximum amount of time a connection may be reused.
    3.  **Tune Pool Parameters:** Adjust these parameters based on your application's load and MySQL server capacity to optimize performance and prevent resource exhaustion.
    4.  **Example Configuration:**
        ```go
        db, err := sql.Open("mysql", dsn)
        if err != nil { /* ... */ }
        db.SetMaxIdleConns(10)
        db.SetMaxOpenConns(100)
        db.SetConnMaxLifetime(time.Hour)
        ```
    5.  **Monitor Pool Performance:** Observe your application's performance and MySQL server load to ensure the connection pool is effectively managing connections and preventing issues.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Connection Exhaustion (Severity: Medium) - Prevents the application from overwhelming the MySQL server with excessive connection requests, which can lead to DoS.
    *   Performance Degradation (Severity: Medium) - Improves application performance by reusing connections and reducing the overhead of establishing new connections for each request.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Connection Exhaustion: Medium - Connection pooling helps to control connection usage and mitigate connection-based DoS risks.
    *   Performance Degradation: Medium - Improves application responsiveness and efficiency in database interactions.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Basic connection pooling is configured using `database/sql` methods.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Dynamic tuning of connection pool parameters based on application load and more sophisticated monitoring of pool metrics.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep `go-sql-driver/mysql` Library Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep__go-sql-drivermysql__library_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dependency Management:** Use Go modules or a similar dependency management tool to manage your project's dependencies, including `go-sql-driver/mysql`.
    2.  **Regular Updates:** Periodically check for new releases of the `go-sql-driver/mysql` library.
    3.  **Review Changelogs/Release Notes:** When updates are available, review the release notes or changelogs to understand what changes are included, especially bug fixes and security patches.
    4.  **Update Dependency:** Update your project's dependency on `go-sql-driver/mysql` to the latest stable version.
    5.  **Test After Update:** After updating, thoroughly test your application to ensure compatibility with the new driver version and to catch any potential regressions.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of `go-sql-driver/mysql` Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium) - Outdated driver versions may contain known vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit. Updates often include security fixes.
    *   Compatibility Issues (Severity: Low) - Keeping the driver updated can improve compatibility with newer Go versions and MySQL server versions, reducing potential unexpected issues.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of `go-sql-driver/mysql` Vulnerabilities: Medium - Reduces the risk of driver-specific vulnerabilities.
    *   Compatibility Issues: Low - Improves long-term stability and reduces potential compatibility problems.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Dependencies are generally kept up-to-date as part of the development process.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated dependency update checks and integration with CI/CD to automatically test after driver updates.
