### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving go-sql-driver/mysql

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries by injecting code into input fields or other data sources that are used to build database queries. The `go-sql-driver/mysql` library directly executes these crafted queries against the MySQL database.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could read sensitive data, modify or delete data, execute arbitrary commands on the database server, or potentially compromise the entire application and underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements:** This is the primary defense. The `database/sql` package, used with `go-sql-driver/mysql`, provides mechanisms for this.
        *   **Avoid string concatenation to build SQL queries with user input.**

*   **Threat:** Connection String Credential Exposure
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the database connection string, which contains sensitive information like the database hostname, username, and password. The `go-sql-driver/mysql` library uses this string to establish a connection. If this string is compromised, the attacker can directly connect to the database.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can directly connect to the database using the compromised credentials, bypassing application-level security measures. They can then perform any actions allowed by the compromised user, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application code.**
        *   **Store connection strings securely using environment variables, configuration files with restricted access, or dedicated secrets management solutions.**
        *   **Encrypt sensitive information in configuration files if used.**
        *   **Restrict access to configuration files and environment variables.**
        *   **Regularly rotate database credentials.**

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource-Intensive Queries
    *   **Description:** An attacker, potentially through a vulnerability like SQL injection that leverages the `go-sql-driver/mysql` to send the query, crafts and executes queries that consume excessive database resources (CPU, memory, I/O), leading to performance degradation or service unavailability.
    *   **Impact:** The database server becomes overloaded, causing slow response times or complete failure, impacting the application's availability and potentially other services relying on the same database.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement query timeouts on the database connection:** This can be configured when using the `go-sql-driver/mysql`.
        *   **Monitor database performance and identify potentially malicious queries.**
        *   **Optimize database schema and queries.**
        *   **Implement rate limiting on application requests to prevent excessive query load.**

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Database Connections
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the application and the MySQL database. If the connection established by `go-sql-driver/mysql` is not encrypted, attackers can eavesdrop on sensitive data transmitted in the queries and responses, or even modify queries in transit.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential data transmitted between the application and the database can be compromised. Attackers might be able to steal credentials, sensitive business data, or manipulate data by altering queries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always enable TLS encryption for database connections:** Configure the `go-sql-driver/mysql` to use TLS to encrypt communication with the MySQL server. This is typically done through connection string parameters.
        *   **Ensure the MySQL server is configured to enforce secure connections.**
        *   **Use secure network infrastructure.**

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation via SQL Injection (Database Context)
    *   **Description:** Through a SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can execute SQL commands with the privileges of the database user used by the application. The `go-sql-driver/mysql` is the mechanism through which these injected, potentially privileged commands are sent to the database. If this user has excessive privileges, the attacker can perform actions beyond the intended scope of the application.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can gain administrative control over the database, potentially leading to complete data compromise, service disruption, or the ability to further compromise the underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege for database users:** Grant the application's database user only the minimum necessary permissions required for its specific operations.
        *   **Implement robust SQL injection prevention measures:** As described in the SQL Injection threat section.
        *   **Regularly review and audit database user permissions.**
