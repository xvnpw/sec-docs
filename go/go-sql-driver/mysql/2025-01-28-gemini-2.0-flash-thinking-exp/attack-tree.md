## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit MySQL Protocol Weaknesses via Driver](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_mysql_protocol_weaknesses_via_driver.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** This path focuses on exploiting inherent weaknesses in the MySQL protocol itself, as interacted with by the `go-sql-driver/mysql`. This is distinct from driver-specific vulnerabilities, and more about how the application uses the driver to interact with MySQL.

    *   **2.1. SQL Injection (Classic MySQL Vulnerability) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **2.1.1. Identify Application Code Vulnerable to SQL Injection:**
                *   **Description:** Attacker analyzes application code to find places where user-controlled input is directly embedded into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
                *   **Examples:** String concatenation to build SQL queries, using user input directly in `WHERE` clauses, `ORDER BY` clauses, etc.
            *   **2.1.2. Craft Malicious SQL Payload:**
                *   **Description:** Attacker designs SQL code fragments that, when injected, will modify the intended query to perform malicious actions.
                *   **Examples:**
                    *   `' OR '1'='1` to bypass authentication or access control.
                    *   `UNION SELECT` to retrieve data from other tables.
                    *   Stacked queries (if supported by application and MySQL configuration) to execute multiple SQL statements.
                    *   Time-based or boolean-based blind SQL injection techniques to extract data even without direct output.
            *   **2.1.3. Inject Payload via Application Input:**
                *   **Description:** Attacker submits the crafted SQL payload through application input fields, URL parameters, HTTP headers, or any other user-controllable data that reaches the vulnerable code.
                *   **Examples:** Inputting malicious strings into login forms, search boxes, comment fields, API parameters.
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE] 2.1.4. Execute Arbitrary SQL Commands on MySQL Server:**
                *   **Description:**  Successful injection leads to the MySQL server executing the attacker's malicious SQL code as part of the application's query. This is the point of critical compromise.
                *   **Outcomes:** Data breach, data manipulation, authentication bypass, privilege escalation, denial of service.
            *   **2.1.5. Achieve:**
                *   **Description:**  The attacker's ultimate goals after successful SQL injection.
                *   **Examples:**
                    *   Data Breach: Stealing sensitive user data, financial information, personal details.
                    *   Data Manipulation: Modifying application data, defacing content, altering transactions.
                    *   Authentication Bypass: Logging in as other users or administrators without credentials.
                    *   Privilege Escalation: Gaining higher database privileges to perform more damaging actions.
                    *   Denial of Service: Executing resource-intensive queries to overload the database server.

    *   **2.2. Authentication Bypass/Weaknesses [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

            *   **2.2.1. Identify Weaknesses in MySQL Authentication Mechanisms:**
                *   **Description:** Attacker looks for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in how the application and MySQL server handle authentication.
                *   **Examples:**
                    *   Default MySQL credentials (e.g., root user with no password or default password).
                    *   Weak passwords used for MySQL accounts.
                    *   Outdated or weak authentication protocols enabled on the MySQL server (e.g., `mysql_native_password` instead of `caching_sha2_password`).
                    *   Lack of proper access control lists (ACLs) or firewall rules restricting access to the MySQL server.
            *   **2.2.2. Exploit Authentication Weakness:**
                *   **Description:** Attacker uses identified weaknesses to gain unauthorized access.
                *   **Examples:**
                    *   Brute-forcing weak passwords using password cracking tools.
                    *   Using default credentials if they haven't been changed.
                    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in outdated authentication protocols (less common but possible).
                    *   Network-based attacks if access to the MySQL port is not properly restricted.
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE] 2.2.3. Gain Unauthorized Access to MySQL Server:**
                *   **Description:** Successful exploitation of authentication weaknesses results in the attacker gaining direct access to the MySQL server, bypassing application-level security.
            *   **2.2.4. Compromise Application Data and Functionality:**
                *   **Description:** With direct access to the database, the attacker can directly manipulate data, extract information, or disrupt the application's functionality.

    *   **2.4. Abuse of MySQL Features via Driver (e.g., LOAD DATA INFILE, Stored Procedures) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **2.4.1. Identify Application Code that uses potentially dangerous MySQL features:**
                *   **Description:** Attacker analyzes application code and database schema to find usage of MySQL features that can be abused if not properly secured.
                *   **Examples:**
                    *   `LOAD DATA INFILE`:  Allows reading files from the MySQL server's file system.
                    *   Stored Procedures: Can execute code within the database server context, potentially with elevated privileges.
                    *   User-Defined Functions (UDFs):  Allow extending MySQL functionality with custom code (even more dangerous if attacker can create UDFs).
            *   **2.4.2. Exploit Application Logic or SQL Injection to control these features:**
                *   **Description:** Attacker uses application logic flaws or SQL injection vulnerabilities to manipulate the usage of these dangerous MySQL features.
                *   **Examples:**
                    *   SQL injection to modify the filename in a `LOAD DATA INFILE` statement to read arbitrary files.
                    *   SQL injection to execute stored procedures with malicious parameters or to call stored procedures that have vulnerabilities.
                    *   Exploiting application logic to trigger unintended execution of stored procedures or `LOAD DATA INFILE` operations.
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE] 2.4.3. Abuse Feature to:**
                *   **Description:**  Once control over these features is gained, the attacker abuses them to achieve malicious objectives.
                *   **Examples:**
                    *   Read sensitive files from the MySQL server's file system using `LOAD DATA INFILE`.
                    *   Execute malicious code within stored procedures, potentially gaining control over the database server or even the underlying operating system (if stored procedures have vulnerabilities or call external commands).
                    *   Gain unauthorized access or privileges within the database by manipulating stored procedures or UDFs.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Application Logic Flaws Exposed via Driver](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_application_logic_flaws_exposed_via_driver.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from flaws in the application's own logic, which are then exposed or amplified through its interaction with the MySQL database via the `go-sql-driver/mysql`.

    *   **3.4. Denial of Service via Application Logic & Driver [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **3.4.1. Application logic allows users to trigger resource-intensive database operations:**
                *   **Description:** Application design or implementation flaws allow users to initiate database queries or operations that consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, I/O).
                *   **Examples:**
                    *   Unfiltered search functionality that allows users to perform very broad or complex searches leading to full table scans.
                    *   Complex aggregation queries that are computationally expensive.
                    *   Bulk data operations (e.g., large imports/exports) that can be triggered repeatedly.
                    *   Poorly optimized queries that are inherently slow.
            *   **3.4.2. Attacker sends malicious requests to trigger these operations repeatedly:**
                *   **Description:** Attacker exploits the ability to trigger resource-intensive operations by sending a large number of malicious requests.
                *   **Examples:**
                    *   Automated scripts to repeatedly submit resource-intensive search queries.
                    *   Flooding the application with requests that trigger bulk data operations.
                    *   Exploiting API endpoints that initiate complex database tasks.
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE] 3.4.3. Overload database server and application resources:**
                *   **Description:**  The repeated execution of resource-intensive operations overwhelms the database server and potentially the application server, leading to performance degradation or complete service outage.
            *   **3.4.4. Cause application slowdown or unavailability:**
                *   **Description:** The ultimate outcome of the DoS attack, rendering the application unusable or severely impacting its performance.
