## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for MySQL Users](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_mysql_users.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1 (DevOps/Database Admin):** Create dedicated MySQL users for the application instead of using the `root` user or users with excessive privileges.
    *   **Step 2 (DevOps/Database Admin):** For each application user, grant only the minimum necessary privileges required for its specific functions. Use `GRANT` statements in MySQL to control permissions at the database and table level (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
    *   **Step 3 (DevOps/Database Admin):**  Avoid granting broad privileges like `GRANT ALL` or `SUPERUSER`.
    *   **Step 4 (Developers - Configuration):** Ensure the application is configured to connect to MySQL using these restricted user credentials.
    *   **Step 5 (Regular Review):** Periodically review and adjust user privileges as application requirements change, always adhering to the principle of least privilege.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Privilege Escalation (Medium to High Severity): If the application is compromised, a limited privilege user restricts the attacker's ability to perform broader damage within the database.
    *   Data Breach (Medium Severity): Limits the scope of data accessible if the application is compromised.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Privilege Escalation: Significant reduction. Limits the potential damage from a compromised application.
    *   Data Breach: Partial reduction. Reduces the amount of data immediately accessible upon initial compromise.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, implemented. A dedicated MySQL user with specific `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE` permissions is used for the application.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No missing implementation currently, but regular review of user privileges is needed as new features are added.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong MySQL User Passwords](./mitigation_strategies/strong_mysql_user_passwords.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1 (DevOps/Database Admin):** Generate strong, unique passwords for all MySQL users, especially those used by applications. Use password generators to create complex passwords.
    *   **Step 2 (DevOps/Database Admin):** Store MySQL credentials securely using environment variables, configuration files with restricted access, or secrets management solutions. **Never hardcode passwords in application code.**
    *   **Step 3 (Regular Rotation):** Implement a policy for regular password rotation for MySQL users, especially for critical application users.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity): Strong passwords make brute-force attacks against MySQL user accounts significantly harder.
    *   Credential Stuffing (Medium Severity): Unique passwords prevent attackers from using credentials compromised from other services to access the database.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Brute-Force Attacks: High reduction. Makes brute-force attacks impractical.
    *   Credential Stuffing: High reduction. Prevents reuse of compromised credentials.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, implemented. MySQL passwords are generated using a password manager and stored in environment variables on the application server.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Password rotation policy is not yet formally implemented and automated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable TLS/SSL Encryption for MySQL Connections](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tlsssl_encryption_for_mysql_connections.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1 (DevOps/Database Admin - MySQL Server):** Configure the MySQL server to enable and enforce TLS/SSL connections. This typically involves generating server certificates and configuring MySQL to use them.
    *   **Step 2 (Developers - Application Configuration):** Modify the Go application's MySQL connection string to enable TLS. This can be done by adding `tls=true` or `tls=skip-verify` (for testing/development, but avoid in production) to the connection string. For more secure setups, configure client certificates and CA certificates for mutual TLS.
    *   **Step 3 (DevOps/Network):** Ensure that network infrastructure (firewalls, load balancers) also supports and allows TLS encrypted traffic on the MySQL port.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Eavesdropping (High Severity): Protects sensitive data transmitted between the application and MySQL server from being intercepted by attackers on the network.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity): Prevents attackers from intercepting and manipulating communication between the application and MySQL server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Eavesdropping: High reduction. Encrypts data in transit, making eavesdropping ineffective.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: High reduction.  TLS provides authentication and encryption, making MITM attacks significantly harder.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, implemented in production and staging environments. Connection strings are configured with `tls=true`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Mutual TLS (client certificate authentication) is not yet implemented, only server-side TLS is enabled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Database Auditing (MySQL Side)](./mitigation_strategies/database_auditing__mysql_side_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1 (DevOps/Database Admin - MySQL Server):** Enable MySQL's audit logging features. This might involve installing and configuring an audit log plugin (e.g., `audit_log`).
    *   **Step 2 (DevOps/Database Admin - MySQL Server):** Configure the audit log to capture relevant events, such as connection attempts, failed login attempts, executed queries (especially `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`), and administrative actions.
    *   **Step 3 (Security Team/DevOps):** Implement a system for collecting, storing, and analyzing audit logs. Integrate with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems if available.
    *   **Step 4 (Security Team/DevOps):** Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activity, anomalies, and potential security incidents. Set up alerts for critical events.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Breaches (Medium to High Severity): Audit logs provide evidence of data breaches and can help in incident response and forensic analysis.
    *   Insider Threats (Medium Severity): Logs can detect and deter malicious actions by internal users with database access.
    *   Compliance Violations (Varies): Auditing is often required for compliance with security standards and regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Breaches: Partial reduction (detection and response). Helps in identifying and responding to breaches after they occur.
    *   Insider Threats: Partial reduction (detection and deterrence). Increases visibility into database activity.
    *   Compliance Violations: High reduction (compliance adherence). Helps meet audit and logging requirements.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Basic MySQL general query log is enabled, but not a dedicated audit log plugin with more granular control.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement a dedicated MySQL audit log plugin (like `audit_log`), configure it for relevant events, and integrate log analysis with a SIEM or centralized logging system.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits on MySQL Server](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_on_mysql_server.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1 (DevOps/Database Admin - MySQL Server):** Configure resource limits on the MySQL server side, such as `max_connections` in `my.cnf`, to prevent the server from being overwhelmed by excessive connection attempts.
    *   **Step 2 (DevOps/Database Admin - MySQL Server):** Configure other relevant MySQL server resource limits based on expected application load and server capacity (e.g., `innodb_buffer_pool_size`, `query_cache_size` - consider deprecation of query cache in newer versions).
    *   **Step 3 (Monitoring):** Monitor MySQL server resource usage (CPU, memory, connections, disk I/O) to identify potential bottlenecks and adjust resource limits as needed.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):  Excessive connection attempts or resource-intensive queries can exhaust database server resources, leading to performance degradation or service outages.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion: Significant reduction. Resource limits prevent resource exhaustion due to overload.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. MySQL server-side `max_connections` limit is set to a default value.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   MySQL server-side resource limits need to be more precisely tuned based on application requirements and server capacity.  More comprehensive monitoring of MySQL server resources is needed to inform optimal configuration.
