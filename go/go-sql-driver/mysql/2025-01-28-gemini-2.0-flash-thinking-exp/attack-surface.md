# Attack Surface Analysis for go-sql-driver/mysql

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via Unsanitized User Input](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_unsanitized_user_input.md)

*   **Description:** Application fails to sanitize user input when constructing SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code executed by MySQL.
*   **MySQL Contribution:** MySQL executes the injected SQL, leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation within the database.
*   **Example:**  Login bypass by injecting SQL into a username field, allowing access without proper authentication.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, authentication bypass, potential remote code execution on the database server.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  Always use `db.Prepare()` and `stmt.Exec()` to separate SQL code from user data, preventing MySQL from interpreting user input as code.
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs against expected formats *before* using them in any SQL query to limit injection possibilities.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via Vulnerable Stored Procedures](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_vulnerable_stored_procedures.md)

*   **Description:** Application utilizes stored procedures in MySQL that are themselves vulnerable to SQL injection, even if the application uses parameterized queries elsewhere.
*   **MySQL Contribution:** MySQL executes the vulnerable stored procedure code, enabling exploitation of injection flaws within the database logic itself.
*   **Example:** A stored procedure that dynamically builds SQL queries using string concatenation of parameters, making it susceptible to injection.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, authentication bypass, potential remote code execution on the database server (depending on stored procedure privileges).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Stored Procedure Design:** Develop stored procedures using parameterized queries *within* the stored procedure code itself.
    *   **Regular Stored Procedure Audits:** Conduct security code reviews and audits specifically for stored procedures to identify and fix injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Weak MySQL User Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_mysql_user_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**  MySQL database users, especially those used by the application, are configured with weak or default passwords.
*   **MySQL Contribution:** MySQL's authentication relies on these credentials. Weak passwords allow attackers to easily gain direct access to the MySQL server.
*   **Example:** Using common passwords like "password" or "123456" for the application's database user, making brute-force attacks feasible.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce Strong Passwords:** Implement and enforce strong password policies for all MySQL users, including application-specific users.
    *   **Password Complexity and Rotation:** Require complex passwords and consider regular password rotation.

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive MySQL User Privileges](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_mysql_user_privileges.md)

*   **Description:**  Application database users are granted excessive MySQL privileges beyond what is strictly necessary for the application to function.
*   **MySQL Contribution:** MySQL's privilege system controls access. Excessive privileges amplify the potential damage if the application or its database user is compromised.
*   **Example:** Granting `SUPERUSER` or `GRANT` privileges to the application's user when only `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` are required.
*   **Impact:**  Significant data breaches, complete database takeover, potential system-wide compromise if `SUPERUSER` privileges are abused.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the absolute minimum MySQL privileges required for the application user to perform its intended tasks.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control:** Utilize MySQL roles to manage permissions efficiently and apply least privilege principles.
    *   **Regular Privilege Reviews:** Periodically audit and review database user privileges to ensure they remain minimal and appropriate.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Connection String Management Exposing MySQL Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_connection_string_management_exposing_mysql_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**  MySQL connection strings, containing sensitive credentials, are stored insecurely, making them easily accessible to attackers.
*   **MySQL Contribution:** Connection strings provide the necessary information to access the MySQL server. Exposure directly compromises MySQL access control.
*   **Example:** Hardcoding MySQL username and password directly in application code or configuration files committed to version control.
*   **Impact:**  Direct unauthorized access to the MySQL database, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Environment Variables for Credentials:** Store MySQL credentials exclusively in environment variables, separate from application code and configuration files.
    *   **Secure Secrets Management:** Utilize dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and retrieve MySQL credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Known MySQL Server Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_known_mysql_server_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Running outdated MySQL server versions with publicly known and exploitable security vulnerabilities.
*   **MySQL Contribution:** The MySQL server software itself contains the vulnerabilities. Outdated versions are directly susceptible to attacks targeting these flaws.
*   **Example:** Using an old MySQL version vulnerable to a remote code execution exploit, allowing attackers to gain control of the MySQL server.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution on the MySQL server, denial of service, data breaches, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High** (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Proactive Patching and Updates:**  Maintain a rigorous schedule for patching and updating the MySQL server to the latest stable versions and security patches.
    *   **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement automated vulnerability scanning to regularly check the MySQL server for known vulnerabilities.
