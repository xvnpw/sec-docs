# Attack Surface Analysis for go-sql-driver/mysql

## Attack Surface: [Hardcoded Database Credentials](./attack_surfaces/hardcoded_database_credentials.md)

**Description:** Database credentials (username, password) are directly embedded within the application's source code or configuration files.

**How MySQL Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `go-sql-driver/mysql` library uses these credentials provided in the connection string to authenticate with the MySQL server. If these credentials are exposed, anyone with access to the code can connect to the database.

**Example:** `sql.Open("mysql", "user:password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/dbname")` where "user" and "password" are directly written in the code.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the database, including access to sensitive data, modification or deletion of data, and potentially using the database server as a pivot point for further attacks.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store credentials securely using environment variables.
* Utilize configuration management tools or secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
* Avoid committing credentials to version control systems.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Connection Strings](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_connection_strings.md)

**Description:** Database connection strings, including credentials, are stored in easily accessible or unencrypted locations (e.g., plain text configuration files, unprotected environment variables).

**How MySQL Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `go-sql-driver/mysql` relies on the connection string provided to establish a connection. If this string is compromised, the database is vulnerable.

**Example:** A `config.ini` file containing `database_url=user:password@tcp(host:port)/dbname`.

**Impact:** Similar to hardcoded credentials, leading to potential database compromise.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Encrypt configuration files containing connection strings.
* Use operating system-level access controls to restrict access to configuration files.
* Leverage secrets management systems for storing and retrieving connection details.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

**Description:** User-provided input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**How MySQL Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `go-sql-driver/mysql` executes the SQL queries provided by the application. If these queries are constructed insecurely, the driver will execute the injected malicious code against the MySQL database.

**Example:** `db.Query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + userInput + "'")` where `userInput` is not sanitized. An attacker could input `' OR '1'='1` to bypass authentication.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, privilege escalation within the database, and potentially command execution on the database server (depending on database configurations).

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Always use parameterized queries (prepared statements).** This is the primary defense against SQL injection.
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization.
* Follow the principle of least privilege for database users.
* Regularly update the `go-sql-driver/mysql` library to patch any potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Connection Configuration (Lack of TLS)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_connection_configuration__lack_of_tls_.md)

**Description:** Connections to the MySQL database are established without encryption (TLS/SSL), leaving data transmitted between the application and the database vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

**How MySQL Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `go-sql-driver/mysql` provides options to configure TLS for connections. If this is not enabled or configured correctly, the connection will be insecure.

**Example:** Connecting without specifying TLS configuration in the connection string.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted between the application and the database, including credentials and query results.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enforce TLS/SSL for database connections.** Configure the connection string to use TLS.
* Ensure the MySQL server is configured to accept only TLS connections.
* Validate the TLS certificate presented by the MySQL server to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying C Libraries](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_c_libraries.md)

**Description:** The `go-sql-driver/mysql` might rely on underlying C libraries for certain functionalities. Vulnerabilities in these libraries could indirectly affect the security of applications using the driver.

**How MySQL Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The driver acts as an interface to the MySQL server, and its underlying dependencies are part of its attack surface.

**Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in a C library used for network communication by the driver.

**Impact:** Potential for various security issues depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the underlying library, including remote code execution or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the `go-sql-driver/mysql` library to benefit from updates that address vulnerabilities in its dependencies.
* Monitor security advisories related to the driver and its dependencies.
* Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in dependencies.
