# Threat Model Analysis for go-sql-driver/mysql

## Threat: [SQL Injection](./threats/sql_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries and injects them through application inputs. The `go-sql-driver/mysql` then executes these malicious queries against the MySQL database due to the application's failure to properly sanitize or parameterize input before using it in SQL statements. The driver itself is the mechanism through which these malicious queries are sent and executed.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification or deletion of data, potentially even command execution on the database server depending on the database user's privileges.

**Affected Component:** `driver.Conn.Query`, `driver.Conn.Exec` (functions within the driver used to execute SQL queries).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   *Always* use parameterized queries (prepared statements) provided by the `database/sql` package when interacting with the `go-sql-driver/mysql`.
*   Avoid string concatenation for building SQL queries with user input.

## Threat: [Exposure of Database Credentials in Connection String](./threats/exposure_of_database_credentials_in_connection_string.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information like database credentials is included directly in the connection string that is passed to the `go-sql-driver/mysql`'s `Dial` function. If this connection string is exposed (e.g., hardcoded in source code, stored in insecure configuration files, logged inappropriately), attackers can obtain these credentials. The driver itself isn't vulnerable, but it relies on the security of the provided connection string.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, leading to data breaches or manipulation.

**Affected Component:** `driver.Dial` (the function within the driver used to establish a connection, which parses the connection string).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid storing connection strings directly in code or configuration files.
*   Utilize environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions to store and retrieve database credentials used by the `go-sql-driver/mysql`.
*   Ensure proper access controls on configuration files and environment variable storage.
*   Be cautious about logging connection strings.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Database Connection](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_database_connection.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the Go application and the MySQL server. If the application is configured to use an unencrypted connection (or if the driver's TLS configuration is incorrect or missing), the attacker can eavesdrop on or modify the communication, potentially stealing credentials or sensitive data being transmitted through the `go-sql-driver/mysql`.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, including database credentials and application data. Potential data manipulation if the attacker can modify the communication.

**Affected Component:** `driver.Dial` (the function within the driver used to establish a connection, including handling TLS configurations).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for connections established by the `go-sql-driver/mysql` to the MySQL server.
*   Configure the `go-sql-driver/mysql` to require secure connections using parameters like `tls=true` or by specifying a custom TLS configuration.
*   Ensure the MySQL server is configured to accept only encrypted connections.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `go-sql-driver/mysql`](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in__go-sql-drivermysql_.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities might be discovered in the `go-sql-driver/mysql` library itself. An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities if the application is using an outdated or vulnerable version of the driver. This could involve issues in how the driver handles data, parses responses, or manages connections.

**Impact:** Potential for various security issues depending on the nature of the vulnerability, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution within the application or potentially on the database server (depending on the vulnerability).

**Affected Component:** The `go-sql-driver/mysql` library itself (various modules and functions depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the `go-sql-driver/mysql` library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
*   Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to the library.
*   Implement dependency management practices to easily update libraries.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within MySQL due to Driver Misuse](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_mysql_due_to_driver_misuse.md)

**Description:** While less common, improper use of the `go-sql-driver/mysql` in combination with specific MySQL features and insufficient privilege management could potentially lead to unintended privilege escalation. For example, if the application constructs and executes dynamic SQL using the driver without proper authorization checks, and the connected user has some elevated privileges, this could be exploited.

**Impact:** An attacker could gain higher privileges within the database, allowing them to perform administrative tasks or access sensitive data they shouldn't have access to.

**Affected Component:** Interaction between the application's code using `driver.Conn.Exec` or `driver.Conn.Query` and MySQL's privilege system.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Adhere to the principle of least privilege for all database users.
*   Carefully review and validate any dynamic SQL generation performed using the driver.
*   Implement robust authorization checks within the application before executing any potentially privileged operations through the driver.
*   Avoid granting unnecessary administrative privileges to application users.
*   Regularly audit database user privileges and access patterns.
