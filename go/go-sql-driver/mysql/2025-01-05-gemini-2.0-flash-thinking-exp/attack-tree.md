## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via go-sql-driver/mysql [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_go-sql-drivermysql__critical_node_.md)

* This is the root goal and represents the successful compromise of the application through vulnerabilities related to the MySQL driver. Achieving this node means one or more of the underlying high-risk paths have been successfully exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerability via Driver [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_sql_injection_vulnerability_via_driver__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on the classic SQL Injection vulnerability, where an attacker injects malicious SQL code into an application's database query.
* **How:**
    * The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input.
    * This unsanitized input is directly incorporated into an SQL query string.
    * The `go-sql-driver/mysql` faithfully transmits this crafted, malicious SQL query to the MySQL server.
    * The MySQL server executes the injected SQL, potentially allowing the attacker to:
        * Bypass authentication and authorization.
        * Access sensitive data.
        * Modify or delete data.
        * Execute arbitrary commands on the database server (in some configurations).
* **Why High-Risk:** SQL injection is a well-understood and frequently exploited vulnerability. The driver acts as a direct conduit for these attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws via Driver [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws_via_driver__critical_node_.md)

* This path encompasses attacks that bypass or circumvent the application's authentication and authorization mechanisms through driver-related weaknesses.

    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Connection String Manipulation (if exposed or insecurely stored):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain access to the database credentials by finding the connection string in insecure locations.
        * **How:**
            * The application stores the database connection string (containing username, password, host, etc.) in a location accessible to attackers, such as:
                * Configuration files with insufficient permissions.
                * Version control systems without proper redaction.
                * Environment variables in insecure environments.
                * Log files.
            * An attacker retrieves this connection string.
            * The attacker can then directly connect to the database using the stolen credentials, bypassing application-level security.
        * **Why High-Risk:**  Exposed credentials provide a direct and easy path to database access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities related to the Driver [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities_related_to_the_driver__critical_node_.md)

* This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from insecure configurations of the `go-sql-driver/mysql` or the application's use of it.

    * **Application uses insecure driver configurations:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The application is configured in a way that weakens the security of the database connection.
        * **How:**
            * Developers might unintentionally or unknowingly use insecure configuration options provided by the driver.
            * This could include disabling security features, using weak encryption, or failing to properly validate server certificates.
            * These insecure configurations create opportunities for attackers to intercept or manipulate communication.

    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Using insecure connection parameters (e.g., weak encryption, disabled TLS verification - though the driver encourages secure defaults):**
        * **Attack Vector:** The connection to the MySQL server is not properly secured, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
        * **How:**
            * The application's connection string or driver configuration explicitly disables TLS encryption or uses weak encryption ciphers.
            * An attacker on the network can intercept the communication between the application and the MySQL server.
            * The attacker can potentially steal credentials, monitor data being exchanged, or even modify data in transit.
        * **Why High-Risk:**  Lack of encryption exposes sensitive data and credentials during transmission.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Denial of Service (DoS) via Driver [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__denial_of_service__dos__via_driver__critical_node_.md)

* This path focuses on attacks that aim to disrupt the availability of the application by overwhelming the database or the driver's resources.

    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Sending a large number of requests that overwhelm the driver's connection pool or resources:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The attacker floods the application with database requests, exhausting resources and preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.
        * **How:**
            * An attacker sends a large volume of connection requests to the MySQL server through the application.
            * This can exhaust the driver's connection pool, preventing the application from establishing new database connections.
            * The application may become unresponsive or crash due to its inability to access the database.
        * **Why High-Risk:** Relatively easy to execute and can cause significant disruption to service availability.
