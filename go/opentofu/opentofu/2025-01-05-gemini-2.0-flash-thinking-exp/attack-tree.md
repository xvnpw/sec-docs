## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via OpenTofu Exploitation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_opentofu_exploitation__critical_.md)

* **Compromise Application via OpenTofu Exploitation [CRITICAL]:**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. Success here means the application and potentially its underlying infrastructure are under the attacker's control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit OpenTofu Supply Chain Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_opentofu_supply_chain_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

* **Exploit OpenTofu Supply Chain Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
    * This category of attacks targets the process of obtaining and using OpenTofu and its dependencies. Success here can have a widespread impact, affecting multiple applications using the compromised components.

    * **Acquire and Distribute Malicious OpenTofu Binary [HIGH RISK]:**
        * **Target OpenTofu Release Channels/Mirrors:** An attacker attempts to compromise the official infrastructure used to build and distribute OpenTofu, replacing legitimate binaries with malicious ones. This requires significant resources and expertise.
        * **Trick User into Downloading Malicious Binary [HIGH RISK]:**
            * **Social Engineering/Phishing:** Attackers use deceptive tactics to trick developers or operators into downloading and using a fake, malicious OpenTofu binary from an unofficial source. This can be achieved through emails, messages, or compromised websites.

    * **Compromise OpenTofu Provider Dependencies [CRITICAL]:**
        * This focuses on the risk of malicious code being introduced through the providers that OpenTofu relies on to interact with infrastructure platforms.
        * **Inject Malicious Code into Provider Repository [HIGH RISK]:**
            * **Target Vulnerable Provider Development Practices:** An attacker attempts to compromise the source code repository of a provider, injecting malicious code that will be included in future releases. This requires exploiting weaknesses in the provider's security practices.
        * **Distribute Compromised Provider Binary [HIGH RISK]:**
            * **Exploit Lack of Verification in Provider Acquisition:** Attackers distribute modified provider binaries containing malicious code, exploiting weak or missing verification mechanisms in the process of obtaining and using provider binaries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit OpenTofu Configuration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_opentofu_configuration_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

* **Exploit OpenTofu Configuration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
    * This category focuses on weaknesses arising from how OpenTofu is configured, particularly concerning the management of sensitive information.

    * **Expose Sensitive Credentials in OpenTofu Configuration [CRITICAL]:**
        * **Hardcode Secrets in OpenTofu Files [HIGH RISK]:** Developers unintentionally embed sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or database credentials directly into `.tf` files, making them easily accessible if the files are compromised.
        * **Store Secrets in Unencrypted State Files [HIGH RISK]:** The OpenTofu state file, if not properly secured, can contain sensitive information in plain text, making it a valuable target for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit OpenTofu Execution Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_opentofu_execution_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Exploit OpenTofu Execution Vulnerabilities:**
    * This area covers vulnerabilities that can be exploited during the execution of OpenTofu plans.

    * **Abuse OpenTofu State Management:**
        * **Manipulate State File to Introduce Malicious Resources [HIGH RISK]:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the OpenTofu state file can modify it to introduce malicious infrastructure components that will be deployed by OpenTofu.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit OpenTofu Remote State Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_opentofu_remote_state_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

* **Exploit OpenTofu Remote State Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
    * This focuses on the security of the remote backend used to store the OpenTofu state file.

    * **Compromise Remote State Backend [CRITICAL]:**
        * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Storage Service (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage) [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers exploit security vulnerabilities in the cloud storage service used to store the remote state file to gain unauthorized access.
        * **Steal Access Credentials for Remote State Backend [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers obtain the credentials used to access the remote state backend, allowing them to read, modify, or delete the state file.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit OpenTofu Provider Interaction Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_opentofu_provider_interaction_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Exploit OpenTofu Provider Interaction Vulnerabilities:**
    * This category involves exploiting how OpenTofu interacts with its providers.

    * **Abuse Provider APIs with Stolen Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Leverage Exposed Credentials from Configuration or State:** Attackers use credentials obtained from configuration files or the state file to directly interact with the provider's API, performing unauthorized actions on the infrastructure. This path combines the likelihood of credential exposure with the potentially high impact of API abuse.
