# Threat Model Analysis for opentofu/opentofu

## Threat: [Use of Malicious OpenTofu Modules/Providers](./threats/use_of_malicious_opentofu_modulesproviders.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a seemingly legitimate but malicious OpenTofu module or provider to a public or private registry. A developer, unaware of the threat, uses this module in their configuration. The malicious code within the module executes with the privileges of OpenTofu, potentially provisioning backdoors, exfiltrating data from the infrastructure, or disrupting services during infrastructure creation or modification.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the managed infrastructure, data breaches, denial of service, financial loss due to resource misuse.

**Affected Component:** OpenTofu Module System, Provider Interface.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly vet and audit all third-party modules and providers before use.
*   Prefer well-established and maintained modules with a strong security track record and community.
*   Implement a process for reviewing module code changes and updates.
*   Consider using a private module registry with strict access controls and scanning capabilities.
*   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in module dependencies.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration Leading to Infrastructure Vulnerabilities](./threats/insecure_configuration_leading_to_infrastructure_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Developers unintentionally or intentionally create insecure infrastructure configurations using OpenTofu. This could involve overly permissive security groups, publicly accessible storage buckets, or insecure default settings for provisioned resources. The attacker exploits these misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or disrupt services.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, denial of service, compliance violations.

**Affected Component:** OpenTofu Configuration Language (HCL), Provider Resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement code reviews for all OpenTofu configurations, focusing on security best practices.
*   Utilize static analysis tools (e.g., Checkov, tfsec) to automatically identify potential security misconfigurations in OpenTofu code.
*   Follow security hardening guidelines and best practices for the specific infrastructure providers being used.

*   Regularly scan provisioned infrastructure for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

## Threat: [Compromise of the OpenTofu State File](./threats/compromise_of_the_opentofu_state_file.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the OpenTofu state file, which contains sensitive information about the managed infrastructure, including resource IDs, dependencies, and potentially even secrets if not handled properly. The attacker can use this information to understand the infrastructure layout, identify vulnerabilities, and launch targeted attacks. They might also manipulate the state file to disrupt or take control of the infrastructure.

**Impact:** Full understanding of the infrastructure by an attacker, enabling targeted attacks, resource manipulation, data exfiltration, and potential infrastructure destruction.

**Affected Component:** OpenTofu State Management, State Backend (e.g., local file, cloud storage).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store the state file in a secure, version-controlled backend with strong access controls and authentication.
*   Encrypt the state file at rest and in transit.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing the state backend.
*   Regularly back up the state file to ensure recoverability in case of compromise or corruption.
*   Monitor access to the state file for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [State File Corruption or Data Loss Leading to Infrastructure Issues](./threats/state_file_corruption_or_data_loss_leading_to_infrastructure_issues.md)

**Description:** The OpenTofu state file becomes corrupted due to software bugs, storage issues, or accidental modification. This leads to inconsistencies between the actual infrastructure and the recorded state, making it difficult or impossible to manage the infrastructure correctly. This can result in infrastructure drift, unexpected behavior, and potential outages.

**Impact:** Inability to manage infrastructure, infrastructure drift, unexpected behavior, potential service outages, difficulty in recovering from failures.

**Affected Component:** OpenTofu State Management, State Backend.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use a reliable and durable state backend with built-in redundancy and data integrity checks.
*   Implement state locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent modifications that could lead to corruption.
*   Regularly back up the state file.
*   Have well-defined procedures for recovering from state file corruption or loss.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in OpenTofu Configurations or State](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_opentofu_configurations_or_state.md)

**Description:** Developers accidentally or intentionally hardcode sensitive information (e.g., database passwords, API keys) directly into OpenTofu configurations or allow it to be stored in plain text within the state file. An attacker gaining access to these configurations or the state file can retrieve these secrets.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data, potential data breaches, escalation of privileges.

**Affected Component:** OpenTofu Configuration Language (HCL), OpenTofu State Management.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid storing secrets directly in OpenTofu configurations.
*   Utilize dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) and reference secrets dynamically within OpenTofu using data sources or provisioners.
*   Implement mechanisms to prevent secrets from being written to the state file (e.g., using the `sensitive = true` attribute).
*   Regularly scan configurations and state files for potential secret leaks.

## Threat: [Compromised Provider Credentials Used by OpenTofu](./threats/compromised_provider_credentials_used_by_opentofu.md)

**Description:** The credentials used by OpenTofu to authenticate and interact with infrastructure providers are compromised (e.g., leaked from a developer's machine, stored insecurely). An attacker can use these credentials to provision, modify, or delete infrastructure resources, potentially causing significant damage and disruption.

**Impact:** Unauthorized control over cloud resources, data breaches, resource hijacking, denial of service, financial losses due to unauthorized resource usage.

**Affected Component:** OpenTofu Provider Interface, Provider Authentication Mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting provider permissions to the credentials used by OpenTofu.
*   Securely store and manage provider credentials, avoiding hardcoding them in configurations.
*   Utilize temporary credentials or assume roles where possible.
*   Implement multi-factor authentication for accessing provider accounts.
*   Regularly rotate provider credentials.
*   Monitor API activity for suspicious behavior originating from the OpenTofu execution environment.
