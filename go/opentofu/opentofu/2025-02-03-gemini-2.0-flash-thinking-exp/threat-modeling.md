# Threat Model Analysis for opentofu/opentofu

## Threat: [State File Compromise](./threats/state_file_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the OpenTofu state file. This is directly related to OpenTofu's state management mechanism.  Compromise can occur through vulnerabilities in the state storage backend or insecure access controls around the state file itself, which is a core component of OpenTofu's operation. With access, attackers can read sensitive infrastructure information managed by OpenTofu and manipulate the state to disrupt or compromise infrastructure.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (sensitive infrastructure data exposed), Integrity breach (state file modified, leading to infrastructure inconsistencies or malicious changes), Availability breach (infrastructure disruption due to state manipulation), Potential Privilege Escalation (secrets in state file could lead to further compromise).
*   **OpenTofu Component Affected:** State Storage Backend, State Management Functionality
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Encrypt state files at rest and in transit using backend-specific encryption features or external encryption mechanisms.
    *   Utilize secure state storage backends with robust access control mechanisms (e.g., cloud storage with IAM, dedicated state management solutions).
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to the state storage backend, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
    *   Regularly audit access logs for the state storage backend and OpenTofu operations related to state.
    *   Consider using state locking to prevent unauthorized concurrent modifications.

## Threat: [Malicious Provider Plugin](./threats/malicious_provider_plugin.md)

**Description:** An attacker introduces a compromised or malicious OpenTofu provider plugin into the environment. This threat is directly tied to OpenTofu's plugin architecture. OpenTofu relies on providers to interact with infrastructure, and a malicious provider can subvert this core functionality. Once installed, the malicious plugin can execute arbitrary code during OpenTofu operations, potentially leading to complete infrastructure compromise.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (data exfiltration via plugin), Integrity breach (infrastructure modified maliciously), Availability breach (infrastructure disruption or denial of service), Potential Remote Code Execution on infrastructure resources (depending on plugin capabilities).
*   **OpenTofu Component Affected:** Provider Plugin System, Plugin Download and Installation Functionality
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Download provider plugins exclusively from the official OpenTofu Registry or trusted, verified sources.
    *   Verify the integrity of downloaded provider plugins using checksums or digital signatures provided by the official sources.
    *   Implement a plugin vetting process, including security scans and code reviews, before approving new plugins for use.
    *   Consider using a private provider registry to control and curate approved plugins within the organization.
    *   Utilize provider version pinning in OpenTofu configurations to ensure consistency and control over plugin updates.

## Threat: [Provider Credential Exposure in Configuration](./threats/provider_credential_exposure_in_configuration.md)

**Description:** Developers accidentally or intentionally hardcode provider credentials directly within OpenTofu configuration files. While credential exposure is a general security issue, it's directly relevant to OpenTofu because configurations are where provider credentials are *used* by OpenTofu to manage infrastructure. If these files are compromised, the credentials used by OpenTofu are exposed, granting attackers access to the managed infrastructure.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (access to infrastructure data), Integrity breach (unauthorized infrastructure modifications), Availability breach (infrastructure disruption), Potential Privilege Escalation (depending on the scope of compromised credentials).
*   **OpenTofu Component Affected:** Configuration Parsing, Variable Handling
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never hardcode credentials directly in OpenTofu configuration files.**
    *   Utilize secure credential management solutions such as environment variables, dedicated secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider secret managers), or OpenTofu's input variables with sensitive attributes.
    *   Implement secret scanning tools in CI/CD pipelines and developer workstations to automatically detect and prevent accidental commits of secrets in configuration files.

## Threat: [Infrastructure Misconfiguration due to Code Errors](./threats/infrastructure_misconfiguration_due_to_code_errors.md)

**Description:** Errors or oversights in OpenTofu configuration code lead to the deployment of insecure infrastructure.  This is directly related to the quality and security of OpenTofu configurations, which are the primary input for OpenTofu's infrastructure management.  While misconfiguration is a general issue, OpenTofu configurations are the *source* of infrastructure definition, making errors here directly impactful.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (data exposure due to misconfigurations), Integrity breach (unauthorized access and potential modifications), Availability breach (vulnerable services may be targeted for denial of service), Increased Attack Surface (misconfigurations create entry points for attackers).
*   **OpenTofu Component Affected:** Configuration Language, Resource Provisioning Logic
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement thorough code reviews for all OpenTofu configurations, focusing on security best practices and potential misconfigurations.
    *   Utilize static analysis tools (linters, security scanners like `tfsec`, `checkov`) to automatically detect common configuration errors and security vulnerabilities in OpenTofu code.
    *   Follow security hardening guidelines and best practices for infrastructure as code.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to OpenTofu Execution Environment](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_opentofu_execution_environment.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the environment where OpenTofu commands are executed.  This threat is directly relevant to OpenTofu's operational security.  The execution environment is where OpenTofu's CLI and core functions are invoked. Compromising this environment allows attackers to directly manipulate infrastructure via OpenTofu commands.
*   **Impact:** Integrity breach (unauthorized infrastructure modifications), Availability breach (infrastructure disruption or destruction), Potential for Sabotage (malicious infrastructure changes), Operational Disruption.
*   **OpenTofu Component Affected:** CLI Execution Environment, Remote Backend Access (if applicable)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to OpenTofu execution environments.
    *   Utilize Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict OpenTofu operations to authorized users and roles.
    *   Secure the underlying operating system and infrastructure of the OpenTofu execution environment (patching, hardening).
