# Attack Surface Analysis for opentofu/opentofu

## Attack Surface: [Hardcoded Secrets in Configurations](./attack_surfaces/hardcoded_secrets_in_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or certificates are directly embedded within OpenTofu configuration files.
*   **OpenTofu Contribution:** OpenTofu configurations define infrastructure and often require credentials to interact with cloud providers and services, making them a prime location for accidental hardcoding of secrets.
*   **Example:** A developer hardcodes an AWS access key and secret key directly into a `.tf` file to create an EC2 instance. This file is then committed to a public GitHub repository.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of cloud resources associated with the hardcoded credentials. Potential data breaches, unauthorized resource access, and financial losses due to resource misuse.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize Secret Management: Integrate OpenTofu with secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager).
    *   Environment Variables: Use environment variables to inject sensitive data into OpenTofu configurations at runtime.
    *   Avoid Committing Secrets: Never commit secrets to version control systems. Use `.gitignore` or similar mechanisms to prevent accidental commits.
    *   Secret Scanning: Implement automated secret scanning tools in CI/CD pipelines and development workflows to detect and prevent accidental secret commits.

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive Infrastructure Definitions](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_infrastructure_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** OpenTofu configurations define infrastructure with unnecessarily broad permissions, such as overly permissive IAM roles, security group rules, or network policies.
*   **OpenTofu Contribution:** OpenTofu directly controls infrastructure configuration, including access controls. Poorly defined configurations directly translate to security vulnerabilities in the deployed environment.
*   **Example:** An OpenTofu configuration creates an IAM role with `AdministratorAccess` policy attached to an EC2 instance, when the instance only requires read access to S3.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, lateral movement within the environment, data exfiltration, and unauthorized access to resources by attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in the infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Principle of Least Privilege:  Adhere to the principle of least privilege when defining infrastructure permissions. Grant only the necessary permissions required for resources to function.
    *   Regular Security Audits: Regularly review and audit OpenTofu configurations to identify and remediate overly permissive settings.
    *   Policy-as-Code: Implement policy-as-code tools (e.g., OPA, Sentinel) to enforce security best practices and prevent the deployment of overly permissive configurations.
    *   Code Reviews: Conduct thorough code reviews of OpenTofu configurations to identify potential security misconfigurations before deployment.

## Attack Surface: [State File Exposure](./attack_surfaces/state_file_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** OpenTofu state files, containing sensitive infrastructure information, are exposed or compromised due to insecure storage or access controls.
*   **OpenTofu Contribution:** State files are essential for OpenTofu's operation and contain a blueprint of the infrastructure, making their security critical.
*   **Example:** An OpenTofu state file is stored in a publicly accessible S3 bucket without encryption or access restrictions.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive infrastructure details, including resource IDs, attributes, and potentially secrets. Attackers can use this information to plan targeted attacks, understand infrastructure vulnerabilities, and potentially gain unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Remote Backends: Utilize secure and authenticated remote backends for state storage like AWS S3 with encryption and IAM policies, Azure Storage Account with access keys and encryption, or GCP Cloud Storage with IAM and encryption.
    *   State File Encryption: Encrypt state files at rest and in transit. Ensure the chosen backend supports encryption.
    *   Restrict Access to State Storage: Implement strict access controls to the state storage backend, limiting access to only authorized personnel and systems.
    *   Avoid Local State:  Minimize or eliminate the use of local state files, especially in production environments.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Modules](./attack_surfaces/malicious_modules.md)

*   **Description:** OpenTofu modules sourced from untrusted or compromised sources contain malicious code or configurations.
*   **OpenTofu Contribution:** OpenTofu's module system encourages code reuse, but also introduces the risk of relying on external, potentially malicious, code.
*   **Example:** A developer uses a public module from an untrusted registry that contains code to create a backdoor user account on deployed servers.
*   **Impact:** Backdoors in infrastructure, credential theft, data breaches, unauthorized access, and potential complete compromise of the managed environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Trusted Module Sources: Use modules only from trusted and reputable sources, such as official registries or verified private registries.
    *   Module Verification: Verify the integrity and security of modules before use. Review module code for suspicious or malicious components.
    *   Private Module Registries: Consider using private module registries to control and curate modules used within the organization.
    *   Module Code Reviews: Conduct code reviews of modules before incorporating them into configurations, especially for modules from external sources.

## Attack Surface: [Provider Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/provider_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist within OpenTofu providers (plugins that interact with external APIs).
*   **OpenTofu Contribution:** OpenTofu relies on providers to manage infrastructure. Provider vulnerabilities directly impact the security of the entire managed environment.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in a specific cloud provider's OpenTofu provider allows for unauthorized resource modification or data access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to managed resources, data breaches, denial of service, and potential compromise of the infrastructure managed by the vulnerable provider.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Providers Up-to-Date: Regularly update OpenTofu providers to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Use Trusted Providers:  Utilize providers from official and reputable sources. Be cautious with community or less-maintained providers.
    *   Provider Security Audits:  For critical infrastructure, consider performing security audits of provider code, especially for custom or less common providers.
    *   Monitor Provider Security Advisories: Stay informed about security advisories and vulnerability disclosures related to OpenTofu providers.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Execution Environment](./attack_surfaces/compromised_execution_environment.md)

*   **Description:** The environment where OpenTofu runs (developer workstations, CI/CD pipelines) is compromised, leading to unauthorized access and manipulation of OpenTofu operations.
*   **OpenTofu Contribution:** OpenTofu's security is dependent on the security of its execution environment. A compromised environment can directly lead to infrastructure compromise.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises a CI/CD pipeline server used to run OpenTofu. They then steal cloud provider credentials stored in the pipeline and modify OpenTofu configurations to deploy malicious infrastructure.
*   **Impact:** Credential theft, configuration tampering, malicious code injection into OpenTofu processes, and ultimately, complete compromise of the managed infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Execution Environments: Harden and secure all environments where OpenTofu is executed (developer workstations, CI/CD pipelines, automation servers).
    *   Strong Access Controls: Implement strong access controls to restrict access to OpenTofu execution environments and related credentials.
    *   Regular Security Patching: Regularly patch operating systems and software in execution environments to address known vulnerabilities.
    *   Endpoint Security: Deploy endpoint security solutions (e.g., EDR, antivirus) on execution environments.
    *   Secure CI/CD Pipelines: Secure CI/CD pipelines by following security best practices, including secure credential management, pipeline hardening, and access controls.

## Attack Surface: [OpenTofu Binary Compromise (Supply Chain)](./attack_surfaces/opentofu_binary_compromise__supply_chain_.md)
