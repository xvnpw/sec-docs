# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for opentofu/opentofu

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Version Pinning and Auditing (OpenTofu & Providers)](./mitigation_strategies/careful_version_pinning_and_auditing__opentofu_&_providers_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Rigorous control over OpenTofu and provider versions, combined with proactive vulnerability scanning of the configuration and dependencies.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`required_version` Constraint:**  In the main OpenTofu configuration (`.tf` files), use the `required_version` constraint within the `terraform` block to specify the exact OpenTofu version.  Example: `terraform { required_version = "= 1.6.2" }`.
    2.  **`required_providers` Block:**  Use the `required_providers` block to specify exact versions for *all* providers.  Example: `aws = { source = "hashicorp/aws"; version = "= 5.20.1" }`. Avoid version ranges unless thoroughly tested.
    3.  **Dependency Lock File:** Utilize and *enforce* the use of a dependency lock file (if supported by OpenTofu and your backend). This file records the exact provider versions used.  Ensure this file is committed to version control.
    4.  **OpenTofu-Specific Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a vulnerability scanner that *specifically* understands OpenTofu configurations and dependencies (including the lock file).  This is crucial to identify vulnerabilities in OpenTofu itself and its providers.  Generic dependency scanners may not be sufficient.
    5.  **Regular Audits (OpenTofu & Providers):**  Manually review release notes, changelogs, and security advisories for OpenTofu and all providers on a regular schedule. This is a manual check for issues missed by automated scanning.
    6.  **Controlled Upgrade Process:**  When upgrading OpenTofu or providers:
        *   Review changelogs and security advisories.
        *   Test in a non-production environment.
        *   Update the dependency lock file.
        *   Re-run vulnerability scans.
        *   Deploy to production only after successful testing.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (OpenTofu Core):** (Severity: High) - Reduces the risk of using a compromised OpenTofu version.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Providers):** (Severity: High) - Reduces the risk of using a compromised provider.
    *   **Inadvertent Incompatible Upgrades:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents upgrades to incompatible OpenTofu or provider versions.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities (OpenTofu & Providers):** (Severity: Variable) - Helps identify and address known vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Inadvertent Upgrades:** Risk almost eliminated.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced, requiring rapid attacker action.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `required_version` constraint in `main.tf`.
    *   Provider version pinning in `versions.tf`.
    *   Basic vulnerability scanning (but not OpenTofu-specific).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent dependency lock file usage.
    *   OpenTofu-specific vulnerability scanning (analyzing the lock file).
    *   Formal, scheduled manual audits.
    *   Fully documented and standardized upgrade process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Source Control for Modules and Input Validation (OpenTofu Modules)](./mitigation_strategies/source_control_for_modules_and_input_validation__opentofu_modules_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Using internally managed Git repositories for OpenTofu modules and rigorously validating all module inputs using OpenTofu's built-in features.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Internal Git Repositories:** Host all OpenTofu modules in private Git repositories that you control.  Avoid direct references to public registries.
    2.  **Code Review (Module Code):**  Mandatory code review for *all* changes to modules, focusing on security and input validation.
    3.  **Module Pinning (Git Ref):**  In your OpenTofu configurations, reference modules using specific Git commit hashes or tags.  Example: `source = "git::ssh://git@github.com/your-org/your-module.git?ref=v1.2.3"`.
    4.  **Input Variable Validation (OpenTofu `validation` blocks):**  Within each module, define input variables with:
        *   **`type` constraints:**  Specify the exact data type (string, number, bool, list(string), map(string), etc.).
        *   **`validation` blocks:**  Use OpenTofu's `validation` blocks to define custom validation rules using conditions and error messages.  Example:
            ```terraform
            variable "instance_type" {
              type = string
              validation {
                condition     = contains(["t3.micro", "t3.small", "t3.medium"], var.instance_type)
                error_message = "Invalid instance type. Must be one of: t3.micro, t3.small, t3.medium."
              }
            }
            ```
        *   **`nullable = false`:** For required variables, explicitly set `nullable = false` to prevent null values.
    5. **Sanitization (Within Module Logic):** If module inputs are used to construct commands or interact with external systems *within the module's logic*, sanitize the inputs using OpenTofu's built-in functions (e.g., `replace`, `regex`, `lower`) to prevent injection attacks. *This is less common, as providers usually handle this, but it's crucial if you're building custom logic.*

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Modules:** (Severity: High) - Reduces reliance on external module sources.
    *   **Module Vulnerabilities:** (Severity: Variable) - Helps identify vulnerabilities through code review.
    *   **Injection Attacks (via Module Inputs):** (Severity: High) - Prevents injection attacks through input validation and sanitization *within the module*.
    *   **Unexpected Module Behavior:** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces unexpected behavior due to invalid inputs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Modules:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Module Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced through proactive review.
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced through OpenTofu's validation features.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Risk reduced through clear input definitions.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Some modules are sourced internally.
    *   Basic input validation in some modules.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent internal sourcing for *all* modules.
    *   Mandatory code review process for modules.
    *   Comprehensive input validation using `validation` blocks in *all* modules.
    *   Consistent module pinning using Git commit hashes.
    *   Sanitization within module logic where necessary.

## Mitigation Strategy: [State Management with OpenTofu (Remote State, Locking, Encryption)](./mitigation_strategies/state_management_with_opentofu__remote_state__locking__encryption_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Securely managing the OpenTofu state file using OpenTofu's built-in features for remote state, locking, and encryption (via the backend).

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Remote State Backend:** Configure OpenTofu to use a remote state backend (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCS) *using OpenTofu's configuration*.  This is done within the `terraform` block:
        ```terraform
        terraform {
          backend "s3" {
            bucket = "your-state-bucket"
            key    = "path/to/your/state.tfstate"
            region = "your-region"
            encrypt = true  # Enable encryption (if supported by the backend)
          }
        }
        ```
    2.  **State Locking:** Ensure that state locking is enabled through the chosen backend's configuration *within OpenTofu*.  Most backends support this natively. This prevents concurrent modifications.
    3.  **Encryption (Backend-Specific):** Configure encryption at rest *through the backend configuration within OpenTofu*.  The specific options will depend on the backend (e.g., `encrypt = true` for S3, or specific KMS key settings).
    4. **Regular Backups and Disaster Recovery:** Implement a robust backup and disaster recovery plan for your remote state backend. Regularly test the restoration process.
    5. **Auditing State Access:** Enable audit logging on your remote state backend to track all access and modifications to the state file. Regularly review these logs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **State File Compromise:** (Severity: Critical) - Reduces the risk of unauthorized access to the state file.
    *   **Data Loss/Corruption:** (Severity: High) - Protects against accidental deletion or corruption.
    *   **Unauthorized Infrastructure Modification:** (Severity: Critical) - Limits unauthorized modifications through locking and access controls.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **State File Compromise:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Data Loss/Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Unauthorized Modification:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Using S3 as a remote backend (configured in OpenTofu).
    *   Encryption enabled (via S3 backend configuration).
    *   State locking enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Regular backup and recovery testing is not consistently performed.
    *   Audit logging is enabled on S3, but logs are not actively monitored.
