# Threat Model Analysis for opentofu/opentofu

## Threat: [State File Exposure](./threats/state_file_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the OpenTofu state file.  They might do this by exploiting a misconfigured S3 bucket, compromising a developer's workstation, finding the state file accidentally committed to a public Git repository, or gaining access to the CI/CD system's storage. The attacker can then read the state file, which contains details about the infrastructure.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of infrastructure details, including IP addresses, resource configurations, and potentially sensitive data (if secrets are improperly stored in the state). This information can be used to plan and execute further attacks on the infrastructure, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:**  OpenTofu State File (stored in a backend, e.g., local file, S3 bucket, OpenTofu Cloud, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a secure remote backend with strong access controls (e.g., S3 with IAM roles, OpenTofu Cloud with appropriate permissions).
        *   Enable encryption at rest and in transit for the state file.
        *   Never commit the state file to version control.
        *   Implement strict access control policies for the state file storage location.
        *   Use short-lived credentials for accessing the state file.
        *   Regularly audit access logs.
        *   *Do not* store secrets directly in the state file. Use a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

## Threat: [Malicious Module Usage](./threats/malicious_module_usage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious OpenTofu module to a public registry, or compromises a legitimate module.  A developer unknowingly uses this module in their OpenTofu configuration. The malicious module could contain code that creates backdoors, steals credentials, modifies resources in unintended ways, or exfiltrates data.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the infrastructure managed by OpenTofu.  This could range from subtle modifications that weaken security to complete control of the infrastructure by the attacker.  Data breaches, service disruption, and reputational damage are likely.
    *   **Affected Component:**  OpenTofu Modules (sourced from public or private registries).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet all third-party modules before use.  Examine the code, check the author's reputation, and search for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Use version pinning for modules (e.g., `version = "1.2.3"`) to prevent automatic updates to potentially compromised versions.
        *   Use a private module registry to control which modules are available and to enforce security policies.
        *   Implement a module review and approval process.
        *   Regularly scan modules for vulnerabilities using static analysis tools.
        *   Consider module signing to verify integrity.

## Threat: [Compromised Provider](./threats/compromised_provider.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises an OpenTofu provider (e.g., the AWS provider, Azure provider, etc.).  This could involve compromising the provider's source code repository, publishing a fake provider with the same name, or compromising the provider's signing key.  The compromised provider could then be used to manipulate infrastructure resources, steal credentials, or perform other malicious actions.
    *   **Impact:**  Similar to a malicious module, a compromised provider can lead to complete control of the infrastructure managed by that provider.  The attacker could create, modify, or delete resources, steal data, and disrupt services.
    *   **Affected Component:**  OpenTofu Providers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use only official providers from trusted sources (e.g., the official OpenTofu Registry).
        *   Verify the provider's checksum or signature before use.  OpenTofu provides mechanisms for this.
        *   Use version pinning for providers.
        *   Monitor for security advisories related to the providers you use.
        *   Consider using a private provider registry with strict access controls.

## Threat: [Unauthorized OpenTofu Execution](./threats/unauthorized_opentofu_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to execute OpenTofu commands (e.g., `tofu apply`, `tofu destroy`) with the credentials used by the development team or CI/CD system.  This could be achieved through a compromised developer workstation, stolen API keys, or a compromised CI/CD pipeline. The attacker can then modify or destroy infrastructure.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized modification or destruction of infrastructure.  This could lead to service outages, data loss, and significant operational disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:**  OpenTofu CLI, OpenTofu execution environment (developer workstations, CI/CD pipelines).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls and the principle of least privilege for who can execute OpenTofu commands.
        *   Use short-lived credentials (e.g., temporary IAM roles) for OpenTofu execution.
        *   Secure CI/CD pipelines with robust access controls and secrets management.
        *   Use multi-factor authentication for accessing systems that can execute OpenTofu.
        *   Implement "plan approval" workflows (e.g., using OpenTofu Cloud or Atlantis) to require manual review and approval before applying changes.
        *   Monitor OpenTofu execution logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [OpenTofu Binary Tampering](./threats/opentofu_binary_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker replaces the legitimate OpenTofu binary on a developer's workstation or CI/CD server with a malicious version.  This malicious binary could steal credentials, modify OpenTofu's behavior, or perform other malicious actions.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the OpenTofu execution environment.  The attacker could gain access to credentials, modify infrastructure in unexpected ways, and potentially gain access to the infrastructure itself.
    *   **Affected Component:**  OpenTofu CLI binary.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Download OpenTofu *only* from the official website (opentofu.org).
        *   Verify the downloaded binary's checksum against the official checksum published on the website.
        *   Use a secure package manager that verifies package integrity (if available for your platform).
        *   Regularly scan developer workstations and CI/CD servers for malware and unauthorized software.

## Threat: [Insecure `local-exec` or `remote-exec` Use](./threats/insecure__local-exec__or__remote-exec__use.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits poorly configured `local-exec` or `remote-exec` provisioners within an OpenTofu configuration.  This could involve injecting malicious commands through user-supplied variables or exploiting vulnerabilities in the commands being executed.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary code on the local machine (where OpenTofu is running) or on a remote resource.  This could lead to credential theft, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the system.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `local-exec` and `remote-exec` provisioners within OpenTofu configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   *Avoid* using `local-exec` and `remote-exec` whenever possible.  Use provider-specific resources or data sources instead.
        *   If these provisioners are absolutely necessary, carefully sanitize *all* inputs to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.  Treat all inputs as untrusted.
        *   Run commands with the least privilege necessary.
        *   Avoid exposing sensitive information in the output of these commands.
        *   Use the `sensitive = true` argument for any outputs that might contain secrets.
