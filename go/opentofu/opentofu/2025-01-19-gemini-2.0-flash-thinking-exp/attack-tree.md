## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit OpenTofu Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_opentofu_configuration__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Inject Malicious Code/Configuration:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attack on OpenTofu Modules/Providers [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   An attacker compromises a widely used OpenTofu module repository.
        *   The attacker injects malicious code into a popular provider plugin.
        *   When the application's OpenTofu configuration uses these compromised components, the malicious code executes during infrastructure provisioning or updates, potentially granting the attacker control.
    *   **Directly Modify OpenTofu Configuration Files [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   The attacker gains unauthorized access to the repository storing OpenTofu files.
        *   The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline deploying OpenTofu changes.
        *   The attacker directly modifies the configuration files to introduce malicious resources or alter existing ones, leading to vulnerable infrastructure or backdoors.
*   **Manipulate Resource Definitions [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   The attacker introduces backdoors into provisioned infrastructure (e.g., opens ports, creates rogue users) by modifying resource definitions.
    *   The attacker provisions insecure resources (e.g., publicly accessible databases without authentication) through manipulated definitions.
*   **Exfiltrate Sensitive Information from Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   The attacker accesses credentials, API keys, or other secrets stored in plain text or poorly secured variables within the configuration files.
    *   The attacker leverages OpenTofu's state management to access sensitive data about the infrastructure exposed in the configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit OpenTofu State Management [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_opentofu_state_management__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Compromise the State Backend [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the storage backend (e.g., S3 bucket misconfiguration, database injection).
    *   The attacker gains unauthorized access to the state backend credentials.
*   **Manipulate the State File [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   The attacker injects malicious resource configurations into the state file.
    *   The attacker deletes or corrupts the state, leading to infrastructure inconsistencies or outages.
    *   The attacker modifies resource attributes in the state to bypass security controls.
*   **Exfiltrate Sensitive Information from the State [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   The attacker accesses credentials, API keys, or other secrets stored within the state file.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit OpenTofu Provider Plugins [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_opentofu_provider_plugins__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Manipulate Provider Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   The attacker steals or compromises the credentials used by OpenTofu to interact with cloud providers or services.
    *   The attacker leverages insecure credential management practices within OpenTofu or the provider to obtain credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit OpenTofu Binary/Installation:](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_opentofu_binaryinstallation.md)

*   **Compromise the OpenTofu Binary [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   The attacker replaces the legitimate OpenTofu binary with a malicious one.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Local Environment of OpenTofu Execution [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_local_environment_of_opentofu_execution__high_risk_path_.md)

*   The attacker gains access to the machine running OpenTofu and manipulates its environment variables or configurations.
*   The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the operating system or other software on the OpenTofu execution machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Remote Backends (if used) [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_remote_backends__if_used___high_risk_path_.md)

*   The attacker steals or compromises API keys or tokens used for backend access.
