# Threat Model Analysis for opentofu/opentofu

## Threat: [Compromise of the OpenTofu State File](./threats/compromise_of_the_opentofu_state_file.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the OpenTofu state file (.tfstate) can obtain detailed information about the infrastructure, including resource IDs, configurations, and potentially sensitive attributes. This information can be used to plan further attacks, understand the system's weaknesses, or even directly manipulate the infrastructure if they gain write access.

**Impact:**  Infrastructure reconnaissance, potential for targeted attacks, unauthorized modification or deletion of resources, and exposure of sensitive configuration details.

**Affected Component:** OpenTofu State File (.tfstate)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store the state file in a secure, versioned backend with access controls (e.g., AWS S3 with encryption and IAM policies, Azure Blob Storage with access tiers and RBAC, Google Cloud Storage with encryption and IAM).
*   Encrypt the state file at rest and in transit.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the state backend.
*   Regularly back up the state file.
*   Consider using remote state locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent modifications and potential corruption.

## Threat: [Use of Malicious or Compromised Providers](./threats/use_of_malicious_or_compromised_providers.md)

**Description:** An attacker could create or compromise an OpenTofu provider and distribute it through unofficial channels or by compromising official channels. If a user unknowingly uses this malicious provider, it could execute arbitrary code on the machine running OpenTofu or provision infrastructure with backdoors or vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the infrastructure being managed, data exfiltration, deployment of malicious resources, and potential for lateral movement within the environment.

**Affected Component:** OpenTofu Providers

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only use officially verified and trusted OpenTofu providers.
*   Verify the integrity of provider binaries using checksums or signatures.
*   Be cautious when using community-developed providers and thoroughly review their code.
*   Implement a process for vetting and approving new providers before use.
*   Monitor provider updates and security advisories.

## Threat: [Injection Vulnerabilities in Provider Configurations](./threats/injection_vulnerabilities_in_provider_configurations.md)

**Description:** If OpenTofu configurations dynamically generate provider arguments based on external input without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious code or commands. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the target infrastructure during resource provisioning or management.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution on managed infrastructure, privilege escalation, data manipulation, and service disruption.

**Affected Component:** OpenTofu Provider Configurations, OpenTofu Language (HCL)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid dynamically generating provider arguments based on untrusted input.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any external data used in provider configurations.
*   Use parameterized queries or similar techniques when interacting with external systems.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring provider credentials.

## Threat: [Insufficient Permissions for OpenTofu Execution](./threats/insufficient_permissions_for_opentofu_execution.md)

**Description:** If the user or service account running OpenTofu has overly broad permissions on the target infrastructure, an attacker who compromises this account could perform actions beyond the intended scope, potentially leading to significant damage.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized modification or deletion of critical infrastructure components, privilege escalation, and potential for widespread service disruption.

**Affected Component:** OpenTofu Execution Environment, Provider Authentication

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to the OpenTofu execution environment.
*   Use dedicated service accounts with specific roles and permissions for OpenTofu operations.
*   Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to OpenTofu.
*   Utilize features like assume roles (in cloud environments) to further restrict permissions.
