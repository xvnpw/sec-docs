# Attack Surface Analysis for opentofu/opentofu

## Attack Surface: [Compromised State File](./attack_surfaces/compromised_state_file.md)

**Description:** The OpenTofu state file, managed by OpenTofu, stores the current configuration of your infrastructure. If compromised, attackers can gain insights or manipulate it *through OpenTofu*.

**How OpenTofu Contributes:** OpenTofu is the sole manager and consumer of this state file, making its security paramount to OpenTofu's operational integrity.

**Example:** An attacker gains read access to an unencrypted state file that OpenTofu relies on. They can then understand the infrastructure managed by OpenTofu and potentially craft attacks targeting those specific resources.

**Impact:** Infrastructure visibility for attackers, potential for targeted attacks based on discovered information, manipulation of infrastructure in subsequent `tofu apply` operations *executed by OpenTofu*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement encryption at rest for the state file storage location, ensuring OpenTofu interacts with encrypted data.
* Enforce strict access controls on the state file storage, limiting access to authorized personnel and systems that need to interact with OpenTofu.
* Utilize remote backends that offer built-in security features and access control mechanisms specifically designed for OpenTofu state storage.

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Configuration Files (HCL)](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_configuration_files__hcl_.md)

**Description:** OpenTofu uses HCL files to define infrastructure. Maliciously crafted files can exploit vulnerabilities *within OpenTofu's parsing or provider interactions*.

**How OpenTofu Contributes:** OpenTofu's core functionality involves parsing and executing these HCL files to provision and manage infrastructure. Vulnerabilities in this process are direct attack vectors.

**Example:** An attacker submits a pull request with a modified HCL file that leverages a vulnerable provider resource, causing OpenTofu to execute arbitrary commands on the target infrastructure during a `tofu apply`.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on infrastructure *via OpenTofu*, unauthorized resource creation or modification *through OpenTofu*, denial of service through resource exhaustion triggered by OpenTofu.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement code review processes for all OpenTofu configuration changes before they are processed by OpenTofu.
* Utilize static analysis tools to scan HCL files for potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that could be exploited by OpenTofu.
* Restrict write access to OpenTofu configuration repositories to authorized personnel who understand the security implications for OpenTofu.
* Regularly update OpenTofu and its providers to patch known vulnerabilities that could be exploited through malicious HCL.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised or Malicious Providers/Provisioners](./attack_surfaces/compromised_or_malicious_providersprovisioners.md)

**Description:** OpenTofu relies on providers to interact with cloud platforms and provisioners to execute commands. Compromised or malicious ones can lead to significant damage *when used by OpenTofu*.

**How OpenTofu Contributes:** OpenTofu's architecture inherently relies on these external components to perform its core functions. The security of these components directly impacts OpenTofu's security.

**Example:** An attacker compromises a less popular provider used by OpenTofu and injects malicious code that exfiltrates credentials or creates backdoors when OpenTofu uses this provider during a `tofu apply`.

**Impact:** Credential theft *from OpenTofu's interactions*, unauthorized access to cloud resources *via OpenTofu*, remote code execution on target infrastructure *initiated by OpenTofu*, data breaches resulting from actions performed by compromised providers through OpenTofu.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use only well-established and reputable providers with strong security track records when configuring OpenTofu.
* Pin provider versions in your OpenTofu configuration to avoid unexpected updates with vulnerabilities that OpenTofu might utilize.
* Regularly audit the providers used in your OpenTofu configurations.
* Be cautious when using community-maintained or less popular providers with OpenTofu.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in OpenTofu Binaries and Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_opentofu_binaries_and_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Like any software, OpenTofu itself can have vulnerabilities in its code or its dependencies that can be directly exploited.

**How OpenTofu Contributes:** Running the OpenTofu binary is essential for infrastructure management. Vulnerabilities within this binary directly expose the system to risk.

**Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific version of OpenTofu allows for remote code execution if OpenTofu processes a specially crafted HCL file or interacts with a malicious provider.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the machine running OpenTofu, denial of service of OpenTofu itself, information disclosure from the OpenTofu process.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep OpenTofu updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches released by the OpenTofu project.
* Regularly scan the OpenTofu installation and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
* Follow security best practices for the operating system and environment where the OpenTofu binary is executed.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Remote Backends for State Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_remote_backends_for_state_storage.md)

**Description:** Using insecure remote backends for storing the OpenTofu state can expose sensitive infrastructure information *managed by OpenTofu*.

**How OpenTofu Contributes:** OpenTofu's ability to store state remotely introduces the risk of the backend's security impacting OpenTofu's overall security.

**Example:** Using an S3 bucket for the OpenTofu state without enabling encryption or proper access controls, making the state file accessible to unauthorized individuals who can then understand the infrastructure managed by OpenTofu.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the state file, potential for infrastructure visibility and manipulation *that can be enacted through OpenTofu*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Choose remote backends that offer robust security features like encryption at rest and in transit for OpenTofu state data.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing the remote backend used by OpenTofu.
* Regularly review and audit the security configuration of the remote backend used for OpenTofu state.

## Attack Surface: [Local Execution Environment Compromise](./attack_surfaces/local_execution_environment_compromise.md)

**Description:** If the machine running OpenTofu is compromised, attackers can leverage this to manipulate infrastructure *through the compromised OpenTofu installation*.

**How OpenTofu Contributes:** OpenTofu is executed on a local machine or within a CI/CD pipeline, making the security of this environment directly impact the security of OpenTofu's operations.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to a developer's workstation and uses their OpenTofu installation and credentials to make unauthorized changes to the production infrastructure.

**Impact:** Unauthorized infrastructure changes *executed via the compromised OpenTofu installation*, credential theft of credentials used by OpenTofu, potential for widespread disruption initiated through OpenTofu.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong security measures on the machines where OpenTofu is executed, including endpoint security, regular patching, and strong authentication.
* Follow the principle of least privilege for user accounts and permissions on these machines that interact with OpenTofu.
* Utilize secure CI/CD pipelines with proper access controls and isolated environments for OpenTofu execution.
