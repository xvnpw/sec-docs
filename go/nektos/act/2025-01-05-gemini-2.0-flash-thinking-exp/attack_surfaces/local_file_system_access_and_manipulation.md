## Deep Analysis of Local File System Access and Manipulation Attack Surface in `act`

As a cybersecurity expert working with the development team, I've conducted a deep analysis of the "Local File System Access and Manipulation" attack surface within the context of our application using `act`. This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the risks, potential attack vectors, and robust mitigation strategies.

**Expanding on the Description:**

The core issue lies in the inherent capability of workflows executed by `act` to interact directly with the host machine's file system. This interaction, while necessary for certain workflow functionalities (like accessing source code or build artifacts), creates a significant attack surface when untrusted or malicious workflows are executed. The problem isn't just about reading files; it extends to creating, modifying, and deleting files and directories, potentially impacting the host system's integrity and confidentiality.

**Deep Dive into How `act` Contributes:**

`act`'s contribution to this attack surface is multifaceted:

* **Mimicking GitHub Actions Runners:**  `act` is designed to emulate the execution environment of GitHub Actions runners. This includes providing workflows with a working directory mapped to the local file system. While this is its primary purpose for local testing, it inherently grants file system access.
* **Direct File System Mapping:** Unlike cloud-based runners with isolated environments, `act` by default directly maps the user's file system into the workflow's execution context (typically a Docker container). This means the workflow's container has the same file system permissions as the user running `act`.
* **Lack of Built-in Sandboxing:**  While `act` utilizes Docker containers for workflow execution, these containers are not inherently designed for robust security isolation against malicious code with file system access. The default Docker configuration doesn't prevent a container from accessing the host's file system if the user running `act` has the necessary permissions.
* **Workflow Logic and Actions:** Workflows themselves are sequences of actions, often involving shell scripts or pre-built actions. These actions can contain arbitrary code that interacts with the file system. `act` executes these actions as defined, without inherent safeguards against malicious file system operations.
* **Input from External Sources:** Workflows can be triggered by various events or accept inputs. If these inputs are not properly validated, they can be manipulated to construct malicious file paths, leading to path traversal vulnerabilities.

**Detailed Examples of Exploitation:**

Beyond the initial examples, let's explore more detailed scenarios:

* **Credential Harvesting:**
    * **Reading SSH Keys:**  `act` could be used to execute a workflow that reads `~/.ssh/id_rsa` or other private keys, allowing an attacker to impersonate the user on other systems.
    * **Accessing Browser Data:**  Workflows could target browser profile directories to extract cookies, saved passwords, or browsing history.
    * **Reading Configuration Files:**  Many applications store sensitive information like API keys or database credentials in configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `.config`). A malicious workflow could easily access these.
* **Backdoor Installation and Persistence:**
    * **Writing to Startup Directories:**  Workflows could write malicious scripts to directories like `~/.config/autostart` (Linux) or the Startup folder (Windows), ensuring the script executes upon the user's next login.
    * **Modifying Shell Configuration:**  Adding malicious aliases or functions to files like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` can compromise future shell sessions.
    * **Planting Cron Jobs:**  On Linux systems, workflows could add malicious entries to the user's crontab to schedule the execution of arbitrary commands.
    * **Overwriting Critical System Files (with sufficient permissions):** While less likely with standard user privileges, if `act` is run with elevated permissions, malicious workflows could potentially overwrite critical system files, leading to system instability or denial of service.
* **Data Exfiltration:**
    * **Copying Sensitive Documents:**  Workflows could search for and copy sensitive documents from the user's home directory or other accessible locations to a remote server controlled by the attacker.
    * **Archiving and Uploading Data:**  Compressing and uploading entire directories containing sensitive information is a straightforward attack.
* **Denial of Service:**
    * **Filling Disk Space:**  A malicious workflow could create a large number of files or repeatedly write data to fill up the user's disk space, causing system instability.
    * **Deleting Important Files:**  While risky for the attacker, a workflow could attempt to delete critical files or directories, rendering the user's system unusable.
* **Supply Chain Attacks (if using community workflows):**
    * If the application utilizes community-provided workflows, a compromised workflow could exploit this attack surface on the developer's machine during local testing with `act`.

**Impact Assessment:**

The impact of successful exploitation of this attack surface can be severe:

* **Data Breach and Confidentiality Loss:**  Exposure of sensitive personal data, financial information, intellectual property, or trade secrets.
* **Account Compromise:**  Stealing credentials can lead to unauthorized access to other systems and services.
* **Persistent Compromise:**  Backdoors and malicious scripts can allow attackers to maintain long-term access to the user's system.
* **Reputational Damage:**  If the attack originates from a developer's machine during testing, it can reflect poorly on the development team and the application.
* **Financial Loss:**  Costs associated with incident response, data recovery, legal ramifications, and loss of business.
* **Operational Disruption:**  Malicious activities can disrupt the developer's workflow and potentially impact the development process.
* **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Failure to protect sensitive data can lead to fines and legal action.

**Reinforcing the Risk Severity:**

The "High" risk severity is justified due to:

* **Ease of Exploitation:**  Writing workflows that interact with the file system is relatively simple.
* **Potential for Significant Damage:**  The impact of successful exploitation can be severe, as outlined above.
* **Likelihood of Occurrence:**  Developers often run `act` with their regular user accounts, which typically have broad file system access. Untrusted workflows, even accidentally, can pose a significant threat.
* **Difficulty in Detection:**  Malicious file system operations can be difficult to detect without proper monitoring and logging.

**Comprehensive Mitigation Strategies:**

Beyond the initial recommendations, here's a more detailed breakdown of mitigation strategies:

**1. Enhanced Principle of Least Privilege:**

* **Dedicated User Account:**  Run `act` under a dedicated user account specifically created for this purpose. This account should have minimal permissions necessary to execute workflows and access only the required project files.
* **Restricted File System Permissions:**  Carefully configure file system permissions for the dedicated user account, limiting access to sensitive directories and files. Use tools like `chmod` and `chown` effectively.
* **Avoid Running `act` as Root/Administrator:**  Never run `act` with elevated privileges unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.

**2. Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:**

* **Strict Validation:**  If workflows accept file paths as input, implement rigorous validation to ensure they conform to expected patterns and do not contain malicious characters or path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
* **Path Canonicalization:**  Use functions that resolve symbolic links and normalize paths to prevent attackers from bypassing validation checks.
* **Avoid Direct Shell Interpretation of User Input:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly passing user-provided file paths to shell commands. Use safer alternatives or sanitize the input thoroughly.

**3. Containerization and Isolation Enhancements:**

* **Custom Docker Images:**  Instead of relying on default images, create custom Docker images for workflow execution with hardened security configurations. This can include removing unnecessary tools and limiting user privileges within the container.
* **Mounting Specific Volumes:**  Instead of mounting the entire user's home directory, explicitly mount only the necessary project directories and files into the container. This limits the workflow's access to other parts of the file system.
* **Read-Only Mounts:**  Where possible, mount volumes as read-only to prevent workflows from modifying files on the host system.
* **Utilize Security Contexts:**  Leverage Docker's security context options (e.g., `userns-remap`) to further isolate the container's user namespace from the host.

**4. Workflow Security Best Practices:**

* **Code Review for Workflows:**  Treat workflow definitions and any embedded scripts as code that requires security review. Look for potential vulnerabilities related to file system access.
* **Vet Third-Party Actions:**  Exercise caution when using community-provided GitHub Actions within workflows. Ensure they are from trusted sources and review their code for malicious behavior.
* **Static Analysis Tools:**  Explore using static analysis tools that can scan workflow definitions and scripts for potential security issues.
* **Principle of Least Privilege for Workflow Actions:**  Design workflows and actions to only request the necessary file system permissions.

**5. Monitoring and Logging:**

* **File System Auditing:**  Enable file system auditing on the host machine to track file access and modification attempts by the user running `act`. This can help detect suspicious activity.
* **Logging within Workflows:**  Implement logging within workflows to record file system operations.
* **Centralized Logging:**  Send logs to a centralized logging system for analysis and alerting.

**6. Network Isolation (Indirect Mitigation):**

* While not directly related to file system access, network isolation can limit the impact of a compromise by preventing data exfiltration to external servers.

**7. Education and Awareness:**

* Educate developers about the risks associated with local file system access in `act` and promote secure workflow development practices.

**8. Incident Response Plan:**

* Develop an incident response plan to address potential security breaches resulting from malicious workflow execution. This plan should include steps for identifying, containing, and remediating the incident.

**Conclusion:**

The "Local File System Access and Manipulation" attack surface in applications using `act` presents a significant security risk. Understanding the mechanisms by which `act` facilitates this access and the potential attack vectors is crucial for implementing effective mitigation strategies. By adopting a layered security approach that combines the principle of least privilege, robust input validation, enhanced containerization, secure workflow development practices, and diligent monitoring, we can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation and protect our development environment and sensitive data. Continuous vigilance and proactive security measures are essential to mitigate this inherent risk.
