## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Exploit Malicious Workflow Content](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_malicious_workflow_content.md)

* Attack Vector: Supplying a malicious workflow file directly.
    * Description: An attacker provides a workflow file containing malicious code to be executed by `act`. This could happen if a developer unknowingly uses a compromised workflow from an untrusted source or if an attacker gains access to the system where workflows are stored.
    * Potential Actions: The malicious workflow could execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, exfiltrate information, or modify application files.
* Attack Vector: Injecting malicious content into an existing workflow.
    * Description: An attacker gains unauthorized access to the application's repository or the system where workflow files are stored and modifies an existing workflow to include malicious code.
    * Potential Actions: Similar to supplying a malicious workflow, the injected code could perform various malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE Execute Malicious Actions within Workflow](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_execute_malicious_actions_within_workflow.md)

* Attack Vector: Executing arbitrary commands on the host system.
    * Description: A workflow step uses the `run` command or a similar mechanism to execute shell commands on the system where `act` is running. If the workflow is malicious or contains vulnerabilities, an attacker can inject commands to compromise the host.
    * Potential Actions: Installing backdoors, creating new user accounts, accessing and modifying files, and launching further attacks.
* Attack Vector: Accessing sensitive data on the host system.
    * Description: A malicious workflow reads sensitive information stored on the host system, such as environment variables containing credentials, configuration files, or database connection strings.
    * Potential Actions: Obtaining credentials for further access, exposing sensitive business data.
* Attack Vector: Exfiltrating data from the host system.
    * Description: A malicious workflow sends sensitive data from the host system to an external server controlled by the attacker.
    * Potential Actions: Data breaches, intellectual property theft.
* Attack Vector: Modifying application files.
    * Description: A malicious workflow modifies the application's source code, configuration files, or other critical files.
    * Potential Actions: Injecting backdoors, altering application logic, causing denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE Exploit Vulnerabilities within `act` Itself](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_vulnerabilities_within__act__itself.md)

* Attack Vector: Command Injection in `act`.
    * Description: A vulnerability exists within the `act` codebase where user-provided input is improperly sanitized and used in the execution of system commands. An attacker can provide crafted input that injects malicious commands to be executed by the underlying shell.
    * Potential Actions: Gaining control over the `act` process, potentially escalating privileges and compromising the host system directly, bypassing workflow restrictions.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Exfiltrate Data from Host](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exfiltrate_data_from_host.md)

* Description: A malicious workflow sends sensitive data from the host system to an external server controlled by the attacker.
    * Potential Actions: Data breaches, intellectual property theft.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE Execute Arbitrary Commands on Host](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_execute_arbitrary_commands_on_host.md)

* Description: A workflow step uses the `run` command or a similar mechanism to execute shell commands on the system where `act` is running. If the workflow is malicious or contains vulnerabilities, an attacker can inject commands to compromise the host.
    * Potential Actions: Installing backdoors, creating new user accounts, accessing and modifying files, and launching further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE Access Sensitive Data on Host](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_access_sensitive_data_on_host.md)

* Description: A malicious workflow reads sensitive information stored on the host system, such as environment variables containing credentials, configuration files, or database connection strings.
    * Potential Actions: Obtaining credentials for further access, exposing sensitive business data.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE Modify Application Files](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_modify_application_files.md)

* Description: A malicious workflow modifies the application's source code, configuration files, or other critical files.
    * Potential Actions: Injecting backdoors, altering application logic, causing denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE Command Injection in `act`](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_command_injection_in__act_.md)

* Description: A vulnerability exists within the `act` codebase where user-provided input is improperly sanitized and used in the execution of system commands. An attacker can provide crafted input that injects malicious commands to be executed by the underlying shell.
    * Potential Actions: Gaining control over the `act` process, potentially escalating privileges and compromising the host system directly, bypassing workflow restrictions.
