Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path for `act`.

## Deep Analysis: `act` Attack Tree Path - Malicious GitHub Actions Marketplace Action

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the threat posed by malicious GitHub Actions Marketplace actions to users of `act`, identify specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited, propose concrete mitigation strategies, and assess the residual risk after mitigation.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for both `act` developers and users.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack path described: **1.3.2 Use GitHub Actions Marketplace Actions with Malicious Version**.  We will consider:

*   The entire lifecycle of a GitHub Action from creation/compromise to execution within `act`.
*   The specific mechanisms `act` uses to fetch and execute actions.
*   The trust assumptions made by `act` and its users regarding Marketplace actions.
*   The potential impact of a successful attack on the user's system and any connected systems (e.g., CI/CD pipelines).
*   Existing and potential mitigation strategies.
*   The limitations of `act` in detecting and preventing this attack.

We will *not* cover:

*   Other attack vectors against `act` (e.g., vulnerabilities in `act`'s core code unrelated to action execution).
*   Attacks that do not involve malicious Marketplace actions.
*   General GitHub Actions security best practices unrelated to `act`.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of techniques:

1.  **Code Review:** We will examine relevant sections of the `act` source code (from the provided repository: [https://github.com/nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act)) to understand how actions are fetched, validated (or not), and executed.  This will be the core of our analysis.
2.  **Threat Modeling:** We will use the STRIDE model (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to systematically identify potential threats related to this attack path.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** We will identify specific weaknesses in `act`'s handling of actions that could be exploited.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:** We will evaluate existing security controls and propose new ones to reduce the likelihood and impact of the attack.
5.  **Residual Risk Assessment:** We will assess the remaining risk after implementing the proposed mitigations.
6.  **Documentation Review:** We will review `act`'s documentation to identify any warnings or best practices related to using Marketplace actions.
7.  **Experimentation (if feasible):**  If time and resources permit, we may attempt to create a proof-of-concept malicious action and test its execution within `act` in a controlled environment.  This is *not* a penetration test, but a controlled experiment to validate our understanding.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

**2.1. Attack Scenario Breakdown:**

Let's break down the attack scenario step-by-step, focusing on how `act` interacts with the malicious action:

1.  **Attacker Action:** The attacker either:
    *   **Creates a new malicious action:**  They develop a GitHub Action that appears legitimate but contains hidden malicious code.  This code could be in the action's entry point script, dependencies, or even in seemingly innocuous configuration files.
    *   **Compromises an existing action:**  They gain unauthorized access to the repository of a legitimate action and inject malicious code.  This could be through stolen credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities in the action's dependencies, or social engineering.
2.  **Publication:** The attacker publishes the malicious (or compromised) action to the GitHub Actions Marketplace.
3.  **User Workflow:** A user creates or modifies a GitHub Actions workflow that uses the malicious action.  This is often done by referencing the action using its name and a version tag (e.g., `actions/checkout@v3`).  The user may be unaware of the malicious nature of the action.
4.  **`act` Execution:** The user runs `act` to execute the workflow locally.
5.  **Action Fetching:** `act` parses the workflow file and identifies the required actions.  It then needs to retrieve the action's code.  *This is a critical point for analysis.*  How does `act` fetch the action? Does it:
    *   **Directly download from the Marketplace?**  If so, what URL does it use?  Is there any validation of the downloaded content?
    *   **Clone the action's repository?**  If so, does it verify the repository's integrity (e.g., using Git signatures)?  Does it check out a specific tag or commit?
    *   **Use a local cache?**  If so, how is the cache populated and updated?  Is there any mechanism to detect if a cached action has been tampered with?
6.  **Action Execution:** `act` executes the action's code within a Docker container.  *Another critical point.*  What are the permissions and capabilities of this container?  Can the malicious code:
    *   **Access the host filesystem?**
    *   **Access network resources?**
    *   **Interact with other containers?**
    *   **Modify the `act` environment itself?**
7.  **Malicious Payload:** The malicious code within the action executes, achieving the attacker's objectives.  This could include:
    *   **Stealing secrets:**  Accessing environment variables or files containing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials).
    *   **Modifying code:**  Tampering with the user's codebase or build artifacts.
    *   **Installing malware:**  Deploying backdoors or other malicious software on the user's system.
    *   **Lateral movement:**  Using the compromised system to attack other systems on the network.
    *   **Denial of service:**  Disrupting the user's workflow or system.

**2.2. STRIDE Threat Modeling:**

Applying the STRIDE model to this attack path:

*   **Spoofing:** The attacker spoofs a legitimate action by publishing a malicious action with a similar name or by compromising an existing action. `act` may not adequately verify the authenticity of the action.
*   **Tampering:** The attacker tampers with the action's code to inject malicious functionality. `act` may not have sufficient mechanisms to detect or prevent this tampering.
*   **Repudiation:** The attacker may be able to perform malicious actions without leaving clear evidence of their involvement, especially if they compromise an existing action. `act`'s logging and auditing capabilities may be insufficient.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The malicious action can access and exfiltrate sensitive information from the user's environment, including secrets, source code, and build artifacts. `act` may not adequately isolate the action's execution environment.
*   **Denial of Service:** The malicious action can disrupt the user's workflow or system by consuming resources, deleting files, or causing crashes. `act` may not have robust resource limits or error handling.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** The malicious action may be able to gain elevated privileges within the Docker container or even on the host system, potentially leading to a full system compromise. `act`'s container configuration and security policies are crucial here.

**2.3. Vulnerability Analysis (Based on Code Review - Hypothetical Examples):**

*This section requires actual code review of `act`.  The following are hypothetical examples based on common vulnerabilities in similar tools.*

*   **Vulnerability 1: Insufficient Action Verification:** `act` might download actions directly from the GitHub API or clone repositories without verifying the integrity of the downloaded code.  For example, it might not check Git signatures or use checksums to ensure that the action hasn't been tampered with.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker could publish a malicious action, and `act` would download and execute it without any warning.
*   **Vulnerability 2: Lack of Container Isolation:** `act` might run actions in Docker containers with overly permissive configurations.  For example, it might mount the host filesystem into the container, allowing the malicious action to access and modify files outside the container.
    *   **Exploitation:** A malicious action could read or write to sensitive files on the host system, potentially gaining access to secrets or modifying the user's codebase.
*   **Vulnerability 3: Insecure Dependency Management:** `act` might not properly handle dependencies of actions.  If an action relies on a vulnerable or malicious package, `act` might unknowingly install and execute it.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker could compromise a popular action dependency and use it to inject malicious code into any action that uses it.
*   **Vulnerability 4: Trusting User-Provided Input:** `act` might blindly trust user-provided input when determining which actions to execute.  For example, it might allow users to specify arbitrary action paths or versions without validation.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker could trick a user into running a malicious action by providing a crafted workflow file or command-line arguments.
*   **Vulnerability 5: Lack of Input Sanitization:** `act` might not properly sanitize input passed to actions.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker could craft malicious input that exploits vulnerabilities in the action's code, leading to code execution or other unintended behavior.
* **Vulnerability 6: No Action Pinning by Default:** `act` might not, by default, encourage or enforce pinning actions to specific commit SHAs. Using tags (like `@v3`) is vulnerable because tags can be moved.
    * **Exploitation:** An attacker who compromises a repository can move a tag to point to a malicious commit, and users of `act` who are using that tag will unknowingly execute the malicious code.

**2.4. Mitigation Analysis:**

Here are potential mitigations, categorized by their effectiveness and feasibility:

**High Effectiveness, High Feasibility:**

*   **Mitigation 1: Action Pinning by Commit SHA:**  `act` should strongly encourage (or even enforce) pinning actions to specific commit SHAs instead of tags.  This prevents attackers from moving tags to point to malicious commits.  `act` could:
    *   Issue warnings when tags are used.
    *   Provide a command-line option to automatically convert tags to SHAs.
    *   Document this best practice prominently.
*   **Mitigation 2: Action Verification (Checksums/Signatures):** `act` should verify the integrity of downloaded actions using checksums or digital signatures.  This could involve:
    *   Downloading a checksum file alongside the action and verifying it.
    *   Using Git's built-in signature verification capabilities if cloning repositories.
    *   Maintaining a local database of trusted action checksums.
*   **Mitigation 3: Enhanced Container Isolation:** `act` should run actions in Docker containers with the most restrictive possible configurations.  This includes:
    *   Using read-only mounts for the host filesystem whenever possible.
    *   Limiting network access.
    *   Dropping unnecessary capabilities.
    *   Using a non-root user inside the container.
    *   Employing security profiles like seccomp or AppArmor.

**Medium Effectiveness, Medium Feasibility:**

*   **Mitigation 4: Action Allowlisting/Denylisting:** `act` could allow users to specify a list of trusted actions (allowlist) or a list of known malicious actions (denylist).  This would prevent the execution of untrusted or known-bad actions.
*   **Mitigation 5: Static Analysis of Action Code:** `act` could perform static analysis of action code before execution to identify potential security vulnerabilities.  This could involve using linters, security scanners, or custom rules.
*   **Mitigation 6: Runtime Monitoring:** `act` could monitor the behavior of actions at runtime to detect suspicious activity.  This could involve using system call monitoring, network traffic analysis, or other security tools.

**Low Effectiveness, High Feasibility:**

*   **Mitigation 7: User Education:** `act`'s documentation should clearly warn users about the risks of using untrusted Marketplace actions and provide guidance on how to choose safe actions.
*   **Mitigation 8: Improved Logging and Auditing:** `act` should log detailed information about action execution, including the action's source, version, and any errors or warnings encountered. This can aid in post-incident analysis.

**2.5. Residual Risk Assessment:**

Even with all the proposed mitigations in place, some residual risk will remain:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  There is always a risk of zero-day vulnerabilities in `act` itself, in Docker, or in the underlying operating system.
*   **Sophisticated Attackers:**  A highly skilled attacker might be able to bypass some of the security controls, especially if they can exploit vulnerabilities in the action's dependencies or in the user's environment.
*   **User Error:**  Users might make mistakes, such as accidentally using an untrusted action or misconfiguring security settings.
* **Supply Chain Attacks on Dependencies:** Even if the action itself is verified, its dependencies might be compromised.  This is a broader problem that requires solutions like Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) and dependency vulnerability scanning.

**2.6. Recommendations:**

1.  **Prioritize Action Pinning:** Implement strong encouragement or enforcement of action pinning to commit SHAs. This is the most impactful and readily achievable mitigation.
2.  **Implement Action Verification:** Add checksum or signature verification to ensure the integrity of downloaded actions.
3.  **Strengthen Container Isolation:** Review and tighten the Docker container configurations used by `act` to minimize the attack surface.
4.  **Investigate Allowlisting/Denylisting:** Consider adding support for action allowlists or denylists to give users more control over which actions can be executed.
5.  **Improve Documentation:** Clearly document the risks of using Marketplace actions and provide clear guidance on secure usage.
6.  **Consider Static Analysis:** Explore the feasibility of integrating static analysis tools to detect potential vulnerabilities in action code.
7.  **Enhance Logging:** Improve logging to provide more detailed information about action execution for auditing and incident response.
8. **Dependency Management:** Explore ways to integrate with dependency scanning tools to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in action dependencies.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the threat posed by malicious GitHub Actions Marketplace actions to users of `act`. By implementing the recommended mitigations, the `act` project can significantly reduce the risk of this attack vector and improve the overall security of the tool.  Continuous monitoring and adaptation to new threats are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
