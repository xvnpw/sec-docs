Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the use of `nektos/act` and following the requested structure.

## Deep Analysis: Symlink Attack to Replace Workflow File (Attack Tree Path 1.3.3)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanics, feasibility, impact, and mitigation strategies for a symlink attack targeting workflow files used by `nektos/act`.  We aim to determine how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability, what the consequences would be, and how to effectively prevent or detect such an attack.  We also want to assess the *realistic* likelihood of this attack succeeding, given the typical usage of `act`.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Target:**  Workflow files (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) used by `nektos/act` to simulate GitHub Actions locally.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Symlink attacks (symbolic link manipulation).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  We assume the attacker has *some* level of access to the file system where `act` is being run.  We will explore different levels of access and their implications.  We *do not* assume root access initially, as that would trivialize the attack.
*   **`act` Context:**  We will consider how `act`'s design and execution environment influence the vulnerability and potential mitigations.  This includes its use of Docker containers.
*   **Exclusions:**  We will not delve into vulnerabilities within GitHub Actions itself (the cloud service), only how `act`'s local simulation might be abused.  We also won't cover general system hardening beyond what's directly relevant to this specific attack.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Technical Research:**  We will review the `act` source code (available on GitHub), relevant documentation, and general information on symlink attacks.
2.  **Scenario Analysis:**  We will construct realistic scenarios where this attack might be attempted, considering different attacker access levels and `act` usage patterns.
3.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Exploration (Hypothetical):**  We will *hypothetically* outline the steps for a PoC, without actually executing malicious code.  This is to demonstrate the attack's feasibility.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  We will analyze the potential consequences of a successful attack, including code execution, data exfiltration, and denial of service.
5.  **Mitigation and Detection Recommendations:**  We will propose concrete steps to prevent and detect this type of attack, considering both `act`-specific and general security best practices.
6.  **Risk Assessment:** We will provide a final risk assessment, considering both the likelihood and impact of the attack.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.3.3 (Symlink Attack)

#### 2.1. Understanding `nektos/act` and Workflow Files

`nektos/act` is a tool that allows developers to run GitHub Actions workflows locally.  It achieves this by:

*   **Parsing Workflow Files:**  `act` reads YAML files located in the `.github/workflows/` directory of a repository. These files define the steps, jobs, and actions to be executed.
*   **Using Docker:**  `act` heavily relies on Docker containers to provide isolated environments that mimic the GitHub Actions runners.  It pulls Docker images specified in the workflow file (or uses default images) and executes commands within these containers.
*   **Mounting Volumes:**  `act` mounts the repository's directory (including `.github/workflows/`) into the Docker container.  This is crucial for the attack, as it's how the workflow files become accessible within the container.

#### 2.2. Symlink Attack Mechanics

A symbolic link (symlink) is a special type of file that acts as a pointer to another file or directory.  In a symlink attack, the attacker manipulates symlinks to trick a program into accessing or modifying a file it didn't intend to.

In the context of `act`, the attack would work as follows:

1.  **Attacker Gains Access:** The attacker needs *some* way to modify the file system where the repository and its `.github/workflows/` directory reside.  This could be through:
    *   **Compromised User Account:**  The attacker gains access to a user account that has write permissions to the repository.
    *   **Vulnerable Application:**  Another application running on the same system has a vulnerability (e.g., a file upload vulnerability in a web server) that allows the attacker to write files.
    *   **Shared Development Environment:**  In a poorly configured shared development environment, one user might be able to modify files belonging to another user.
    *   **Insider Threat:** A malicious developer with legitimate access to the repository.

2.  **Create Malicious Workflow:** The attacker creates a malicious workflow file (e.g., `malicious.yml`) containing commands they want to execute.  This file could, for example:
    *   Exfiltrate secrets (environment variables) from the container.
    *   Run arbitrary commands on the host system (if the container is misconfigured or has vulnerabilities).
    *   Modify other files within the repository.

3.  **Replace Legitimate Workflow with Symlink:**  The attacker *deletes* a legitimate workflow file (e.g., `build.yml`) and replaces it with a symbolic link pointing to their malicious workflow file (`malicious.yml`).  The command might look like this (assuming the attacker is in the `.github/workflows/` directory):
    ```bash
    rm build.yml
    ln -s malicious.yml build.yml
    ```

4.  **Trigger `act`:** The attacker (or an unsuspecting user) runs `act`, either explicitly or as part of a development workflow (e.g., a pre-commit hook).

5.  **`act` Executes Malicious Workflow:**  `act` reads the symlink (`build.yml`), follows it to `malicious.yml`, and executes the malicious commands within the Docker container.

#### 2.3. Hypothetical Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Outline

1.  **Setup:**
    *   A repository with a legitimate workflow file (`.github/workflows/build.yml`).
    *   An `act` installation.
    *   A user account with write access to the repository (but *not* root access).

2.  **Malicious Workflow (`malicious.yml`):**
    ```yaml
    name: Malicious Workflow
    on: [push]
    jobs:
      exfiltrate:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Exfiltrate Secrets
            run: |
              echo "GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" > /tmp/secrets.txt
              # Further steps to send /tmp/secrets.txt to the attacker
    ```

3.  **Symlink Creation:**
    ```bash
    cd .github/workflows/
    rm build.yml
    ln -s malicious.yml build.yml
    ```

4.  **Execution:**
    ```bash
    act
    ```

5.  **Expected Result:**  `act` would execute the `malicious.yml` workflow, potentially exposing the `GITHUB_TOKEN` (or other secrets).

#### 2.4. Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful symlink attack on `act` can be severe:

*   **Code Execution:**  The attacker can execute arbitrary code within the Docker container.  If the container is misconfigured (e.g., running as root, having unnecessary capabilities, or having access to the host's Docker socket), this could lead to code execution on the *host* system.
*   **Secret Exfiltration:**  Workflow files often use secrets (e.g., API keys, deployment credentials).  The attacker can steal these secrets, potentially gaining access to other systems and services.
*   **Data Modification/Destruction:**  The attacker could modify or delete files within the repository, disrupting development workflows or causing data loss.
*   **Denial of Service:**  The attacker could create a workflow that consumes excessive resources, preventing legitimate workflows from running.
*   **Lateral Movement:** If the compromised `act` environment has access to other systems (e.g., through network shares or SSH keys), the attacker could use this access to move laterally within the network.

#### 2.5. Mitigation and Detection Recommendations

Several layers of defense are necessary to mitigate this vulnerability:

*   **1. Least Privilege:**
    *   **User Permissions:**  Ensure that user accounts have only the minimum necessary permissions to the repository and the file system.  Avoid granting unnecessary write access.
    *   **Docker Container Configuration:**
        *   **Run as Non-Root:**  Configure Docker containers to run as a non-root user *within* the container.  `act`'s documentation should be consulted for best practices.
        *   **Limit Capabilities:**  Use Docker's `--cap-drop` option to remove unnecessary capabilities from the container.
        *   **Read-Only File Systems:**  Mount parts of the file system as read-only where possible.  This can be challenging with `act`'s need to mount the repository, but consider mounting *other* parts of the container's file system as read-only.
        *   **Avoid Mounting Docker Socket:**  Do *not* mount the host's Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) into the container unless absolutely necessary.  This would give the container full control over Docker on the host.

*   **2. File System Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**
    *   Implement a FIM solution to monitor changes to critical files and directories, including `.github/workflows/`.  This can detect the unauthorized deletion and creation of symlinks.  Tools like `auditd` (Linux), `Tripwire`, or commercial security solutions can be used.

*   **3. Secure Development Practices:**
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Require code reviews for all changes to workflow files.  This can help catch malicious or accidental modifications.
    *   **Pre-Commit Hooks:**  Use pre-commit hooks to run security checks *before* committing changes to the repository.  These hooks could include checks for symlinks in the `.github/workflows/` directory.
    *   **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:**  Do not hardcode secrets directly in workflow files.  Use `act`'s secret management features (which mimic GitHub Actions secrets) or environment variables.

*   **4. `act`-Specific Considerations:**
    *   **`--no-workflow-recursive`:** While not a direct mitigation for symlinks, the `--no-workflow-recursive` flag in `act` prevents it from recursively searching for workflow files. This can limit the scope of potential attacks if the attacker can only modify files in a subdirectory.
    *   **Review `act` Updates:**  Stay informed about updates and security advisories for `act`.  The developers may introduce features or fixes that address this type of vulnerability.
    *   **Consider Alternatives (if feasible):** In high-security environments, consider whether the benefits of using `act` outweigh the risks.  If possible, test workflows directly on GitHub Actions (perhaps using a dedicated testing repository).

*   **5. Detection:**
    *   **Log Monitoring:** Monitor system logs for suspicious file system activity, such as the creation of symlinks in unexpected locations.
    *   **Security Audits:**  Regularly conduct security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

#### 2.6. Risk Assessment

*   **Likelihood:** Medium.  While the attack requires file system access, this is not uncommon in development environments, especially with compromised user accounts, vulnerable applications, or insider threats. The increasing use of CI/CD and local testing tools like `act` expands the attack surface.
*   **Impact:** High.  Successful exploitation can lead to code execution, secret exfiltration, and significant disruption to development workflows.  The potential for escalation to the host system makes the impact even greater.

**Overall Risk:** High.  The combination of a medium likelihood and high impact results in a high overall risk.  This vulnerability should be addressed with a multi-layered approach, combining secure configuration, monitoring, and secure development practices.

### 3. Conclusion

The symlink attack against `act` workflow files is a serious vulnerability that requires careful attention.  By understanding the attack mechanics, implementing appropriate mitigations, and maintaining a strong security posture, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of this attack succeeding.  The key is to minimize the attacker's ability to create symlinks in the first place and to limit the damage they can do if they succeed.  Regular security reviews and updates to `act` and its dependencies are crucial for maintaining a secure development environment.
