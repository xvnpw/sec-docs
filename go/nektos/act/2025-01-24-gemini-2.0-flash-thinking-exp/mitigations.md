# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nektos/act

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Resource Limits for `act` Containers](./mitigation_strategies/implement_resource_limits_for__act__containers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure Docker to enforce resource limits on containers spawned by `act`. This can be done using Docker Compose files (if using `act` with Docker Compose) or through Docker command-line options when running `act` directly.
    2.  Set limits for CPU usage (e.g., `--cpus="1"`), memory usage (e.g., `--memory="512m"`), and disk I/O (using `blkio-weight` or similar).
    3.  These limits prevent a malicious or poorly written action from consuming excessive resources on the host machine, potentially causing denial-of-service or impacting other processes during `act` execution.
    4.  Test and adjust resource limits based on the expected resource consumption of your workflows to avoid hindering legitimate action execution within `act`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) on Host (High Severity): A malicious action run by `act` could intentionally or unintentionally consume all available CPU, memory, or disk I/O on the host machine, making it unresponsive or unusable.
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):  Runaway actions executed by `act` could exhaust system resources, impacting the performance and stability of the development environment where `act` is running.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) on Host: High - Significantly reduces the risk of DoS caused by actions run through `act` by limiting the resources an action can consume, preventing resource monopolization.
    *   Resource Exhaustion: High - Prevents resource exhaustion during `act` execution by enforcing boundaries on resource usage, ensuring fair resource allocation for `act` and other host processes.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Resource limits are not currently configured for `act` containers.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Resource limits need to be implemented in our `act` execution setup. This could involve creating a Docker Compose configuration for `act` or scripting the `act` execution with Docker command-line options to include resource constraints.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dedicated Environment for `act` Execution](./mitigation_strategies/dedicated_environment_for__act__execution.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Set up a dedicated virtual machine (VM) or containerized development environment specifically for running `act`.
    2.  Isolate this environment from your primary development machine and sensitive data. This dedicated environment is solely for `act` and its dependencies.
    3.  This dedicated environment acts as a sandbox for `act`, containing potential risks associated with running untrusted actions locally using `act`.
    4.  If a malicious action compromises the `act` environment, the impact is limited to this isolated environment and does not directly affect your main development system or sensitive data outside of the `act` sandbox.
    5.  Regularly refresh or rebuild this dedicated environment to further minimize persistent risks associated with prolonged `act` usage.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Host System Compromise (Medium - High Severity): Prevents malicious actions run by `act` from directly compromising your primary development machine and accessing sensitive data or development tools outside of the dedicated `act` environment.
    *   Lateral Movement (Medium Severity): Limits the potential for lateral movement from a compromised `act` environment to other systems or networks, as the `act` environment is isolated.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Host System Compromise: High - Significantly reduces the risk of compromising the primary development machine by isolating `act` execution to a dedicated environment.
    *   Lateral Movement: Medium - Limits the potential for lateral movement by containing risks within the dedicated `act` environment.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some developers use VMs for development, but not specifically enforced for `act` execution.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to establish a clear recommendation or requirement for using dedicated environments for `act` execution, especially when testing untrusted actions with `act`. Provide guidance and tooling to easily set up such environments specifically for `act`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to Sensitive Host Resources for `act`](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to_sensitive_host_resources_for__act_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When running `act`, carefully consider the volumes and bind mounts used to share host directories with `act` containers. This is configured when invoking `act` commands.
    2.  Avoid mounting sensitive host directories (e.g., home directories, configuration files, secrets) into `act` containers unless absolutely necessary for the specific workflows being tested with `act`.
    3.  If host access is required for `act`, mount directories as read-only whenever possible using Docker volume options (e.g., `-v host_path:container_path:ro` when running `act`).
    4.  Limit host access for `act` to the specific directories needed by the actions being tested and avoid broad access to the entire file system when using `act`.
    5.  Regularly review and audit volume mounts used with `act` to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege and minimize the scope of host access granted to `act` containers.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Exfiltration (Medium - High Severity): Malicious actions run by `act` could access and exfiltrate sensitive data from mounted host directories if not properly restricted during `act` execution.
    *   Host File System Manipulation (Medium - High Severity): If write access is granted to host directories when running `act`, malicious actions could modify or delete files on the host system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Exfiltration: High - Significantly reduces the risk of data exfiltration by limiting access to sensitive host data when using `act`.
    *   Host File System Manipulation: High - Prevents malicious actions from modifying the host file system by restricting write access through volume mounts during `act` execution.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers are generally aware of volume mounts when using `act`, but there are no strict guidelines or automated checks to prevent mounting sensitive directories when running `act`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to establish clear guidelines on volume mounts for `act` execution, emphasizing least privilege and read-only access. Implement code review processes to check for excessive or insecure volume mounts in workflow configurations and `act` execution scripts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Sanitize Environment Variables Passed to `act`](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_sanitize_environment_variables_passed_to__act_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Carefully review environment variables passed to `act` using the `-e` flag or `.env` files when running `act`.
    2.  Avoid exposing sensitive information or credentials through environment variables passed to `act` unless absolutely necessary and securely managed using dedicated secret management solutions specifically for `act` testing.
    3.  Sanitize environment variables before passing them to `act` to prevent injection vulnerabilities if actions process these variables during `act` execution.
    4.  Be aware that environment variables passed to `act` can be logged or exposed in action outputs within the `act` environment, so avoid passing highly sensitive data through them if possible.
    5.  Prefer using GitHub Actions secrets for managing sensitive credentials in actual GitHub Actions environments. For local testing with `act`, consider secure secret management alternatives designed for local development.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Secret Exposure (High Severity): Sensitive credentials or secrets passed as environment variables to `act` could be accidentally logged, exposed, or exfiltrated by malicious actions run by `act`.
    *   Environment Variable Injection (Medium Severity): If actions processed by `act` process environment variables without proper sanitization, they could be vulnerable to injection attacks within the `act` execution context.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Secret Exposure: High - Significantly reduces the risk of secret exposure when using `act` by promoting careful review and minimizing the use of environment variables for sensitive data.
    *   Environment Variable Injection: Medium - Mitigates injection vulnerabilities within `act` execution by emphasizing sanitization and secure handling of environment variables passed to `act`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers are generally advised against hardcoding secrets, but there are no automated checks or strict guidelines for environment variable usage with `act`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to establish clear guidelines on environment variable usage with `act`, emphasizing secure secret management and sanitization. Implement code review processes to check for insecure environment variable usage in workflow configurations and `.env` files used with `act`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Isolation for `act` Execution (if applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/network_isolation_for__act__execution__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  In scenarios where network access is not strictly required for local testing with `act`, consider running `act` in a network-isolated environment.
    2.  This can be achieved by disabling network access for the Docker containers spawned by `act` using Docker network configurations (e.g., `--network=none` when running `act`).
    3.  Network isolation prevents actions run by `act` from making unintended network connections, accessing external resources, or exfiltrating data over the network during local testing.
    4.  This mitigation is most effective when testing actions with `act` that do not require external network communication. For actions that need network access when tested with `act`, carefully consider the necessity and scope of network permissions.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Exfiltration via Network (Medium Severity): Prevents malicious actions run by `act` from exfiltrating data over the network if network access is not required for local testing.
    *   Unintended Network Connections (Medium Severity): Prevents actions run by `act` from making unintended connections to external resources or services, potentially exposing internal systems or data during local testing.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Exfiltration via Network: Medium - Reduces the risk of network-based data exfiltration when using `act` by isolating `act` containers from the network.
    *   Unintended Network Connections: Medium - Prevents unintended network communication during `act` execution, limiting potential attack vectors.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Network isolation is not currently configured for `act` execution.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to provide guidance and options for running `act` in network-isolated environments when network access is not required for testing. This could involve documenting Docker network configurations for `act` usage and providing examples.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Review and Audit `act` Configurations](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_review_and_audit__act__configurations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Periodically review your `act` configurations, including command-line arguments, `.actrc` files, workflow definitions used with `act`, and any scripts used to run `act`.
    2.  Audit these configurations to ensure they adhere to security best practices and minimize potential risks associated with `act` usage.
    3.  Check for insecure configurations, excessive permissions granted to `act`, unnecessary features enabled in `act` or its configurations, or outdated settings related to `act`.
    4.  Regular audits help identify and address configuration drift in `act` setup and ensure that security measures for `act` remain effective over time.
    5.  Document your `act` configuration and audit process to maintain consistency and facilitate future reviews of `act` security settings.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Configuration Drift (Low - Medium Severity): Over time, `act` configurations can drift away from secure defaults, potentially introducing vulnerabilities in how `act` is used.
    *   Misconfiguration (Low - Medium Severity): Incorrect or insecure configurations of `act` can create security weaknesses that could be exploited during local workflow testing.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Configuration Drift: Medium - Prevents configuration drift in `act` setup by establishing a regular review process, ensuring `act` configurations remain secure.
    *   Misconfiguration: Medium - Reduces the risk of misconfiguration of `act` by proactively auditing and identifying potential issues in `act` settings.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. No formal process for regularly reviewing and auditing `act` configurations.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to establish a schedule and process for regularly reviewing and auditing `act` configurations. This could be integrated into existing security review processes or performed as a dedicated task focused on `act` security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Dedicated Secret Management Solutions for `act` (if needed)](./mitigation_strategies/use_dedicated_secret_management_solutions_for__act___if_needed_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Avoid hardcoding secrets directly in workflow files, `.env` files, or command-line arguments used with `act`.
    2.  If you need to test workflows that require secrets locally using `act`, consider using dedicated secret management solutions like `direnv`, `chamber`, `Vault`, or cloud-based secret managers specifically for `act` testing.
    3.  These tools allow you to securely store and inject secrets into the `act` environment without exposing them in plain text when running `act`.
    4.  Configure `act` to retrieve secrets from these secret management solutions during workflow execution, ensuring `act` integrates with the chosen secret management tool.
    5.  Ensure that the secret management solution itself is properly secured and access is controlled, adding another layer of security to your `act` testing setup.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Secret Exposure in Configuration (High Severity): Hardcoding secrets in configuration files or command-line arguments used with `act` directly exposes them and increases the risk of accidental leakage or compromise during `act` usage.
    *   Version Control Secret Leakage (High Severity): Accidental commits of secrets to version control systems related to `act` configurations can lead to long-term secret exposure and compromise.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Secret Exposure in Configuration: High - Significantly reduces the risk of secret exposure when using `act` by avoiding hardcoding and using dedicated secret management.
    *   Version Control Secret Leakage: High - Prevents accidental commits of secrets related to `act` by using external secret management and avoiding storing secrets in configuration files used with `act`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. We are currently relying on `.env` files or environment variables for local testing secrets with `act`, which is not ideal for security.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to evaluate and implement a dedicated secret management solution for local testing with `act`. Provide guidance and documentation for developers on using secure secret management practices specifically for `act` testing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep `act` Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep__act__updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Regularly update the `act` tool to the latest version.
    2.  New versions of `act` may include security patches, bug fixes, and improvements that address potential vulnerabilities or security weaknesses in the `act` tool itself.
    3.  Monitor the `act` project's release notes and security advisories for information about security-related updates for `act`.
    4.  Establish a process for regularly checking for and applying `act` updates to ensure you are using the most secure version of `act`.
    5.  Consider using a package manager or automation tools to simplify the `act` update process, ensuring timely updates for `act`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in `act` Tool (Medium - High Severity): Outdated versions of `act` may contain known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actions or attackers targeting the `act` tool itself.
    *   Tool Exploitation (Medium Severity): Vulnerabilities in `act` could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the host system or manipulate workflow execution initiated by `act`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in `act` Tool: High - Reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in `act` by ensuring the tool is up-to-date with security patches.
    *   Tool Exploitation: Medium - Minimizes the potential for tool exploitation by addressing vulnerabilities and improving the security of `act` itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers are generally encouraged to use the latest `act` version, but there is no enforced update policy or automated update process for `act`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to establish a policy for regularly updating `act` and potentially automate the update process for development environments to ensure consistent and timely updates of `act`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Download `act` from Official Sources](./mitigation_strategies/download__act__from_official_sources.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Download `act` binaries only from the official GitHub repository (`https://github.com/nektos/act`) or trusted distribution channels (e.g., package managers from reputable sources) that are known to distribute official `act` builds.
    2.  Avoid downloading `act` from unofficial websites, file sharing platforms, or untrusted sources, as these sources may distribute compromised or malicious versions of the `act` tool.
    3.  Verify the authenticity and integrity of downloaded `act` binaries using checksums or digital signatures provided by the official maintainers (if available) on the official `act` GitHub repository.
    4.  Educate developers about the importance of downloading `act` from official sources to prevent using compromised versions of `act`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Compromised `act` Binary (High Severity): Downloading `act` from untrusted sources increases the risk of using a compromised binary that could contain malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities specifically targeting `act` users.
    *   Supply Chain Attacks (High Severity): Malicious actors could distribute compromised `act` binaries through unofficial channels as part of a supply chain attack targeting `act` distribution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromised `act` Binary: High - Significantly reduces the risk of using a compromised `act` binary by ensuring downloads are from official and trusted sources.
    *   Supply Chain Attacks: High - Minimizes the risk of supply chain attacks targeting `act` distribution by relying on official channels for obtaining `act`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers are generally aware of downloading from GitHub, but there are no strict enforcement mechanisms or automated checks to ensure `act` is always downloaded from official sources.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to establish a clear policy for downloading `act` only from official sources. Provide guidance and links to official download locations in documentation and training materials for `act` usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify `act` Binary Integrity (if possible)](./mitigation_strategies/verify__act__binary_integrity__if_possible_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  After downloading the `act` binary from official sources, verify its integrity using checksums (e.g., SHA256) or digital signatures provided by the maintainers (if available) on the official `act` GitHub repository.
    2.  Compare the checksum of the downloaded `act` binary with the official checksum published on the `act` GitHub repository or official distribution channels.
    3.  Binary verification ensures that the downloaded `act` binary has not been tampered with or corrupted during download and that it is the authentic binary from the official `act` maintainers.
    4.  This step adds an extra layer of security against compromised `act` binaries and supply chain attacks targeting the `act` tool.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Compromised `act` Binary (High Severity): Even when downloading `act` from official sources, there is a small chance of binary tampering during download or distribution. Binary verification mitigates this risk for `act`.
    *   Supply Chain Attacks (High Severity): Verifying `act` binary integrity provides an additional layer of defense against sophisticated supply chain attacks that might compromise even official distribution channels of `act`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromised `act` Binary: High - Further reduces the risk of using a compromised `act` binary by verifying its integrity after download.
    *   Supply Chain Attacks: High - Provides an additional layer of defense against sophisticated supply chain attacks targeting `act` by ensuring binary authenticity of the `act` tool.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Binary integrity verification is not currently performed after downloading `act`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement a process for verifying `act` binary integrity after download. This requires documenting the official checksums or signatures for `act` and providing instructions on how to perform verification for `act` binaries.
