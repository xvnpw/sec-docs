# Threat Model Analysis for nektos/act

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via `act`](./threats/privilege_escalation_via__act_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in `act`'s code or execution logic could be exploited by a malicious actor to gain elevated privileges on the local system or within the Docker environment where `act` is running. This could involve bypassing security checks within `act` or exploiting flaws in how `act` interacts with the Docker daemon. An attacker might craft specific workflows or inputs to `act` that trigger these vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive data on the host system, ability to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges, potential for persistent backdoor installation, complete control over the local machine used for development or CI/CD.
*   **Affected Component:** `act` core code, `act` execution logic, `act`'s interaction with Docker API and runtime environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep `act` updated to the latest version.** Security updates often patch discovered vulnerabilities that could lead to privilege escalation. Regularly check for new releases and apply updates promptly.
    *   **Monitor security advisories for `act`.** Stay informed about known vulnerabilities and recommended mitigations by subscribing to security mailing lists or monitoring the `act` project's security channels (if any).
    *   **Run `act` with least privileges whenever possible.** Avoid running `act` as root or with unnecessary administrative privileges. If possible, configure your environment to execute `act` under a less privileged user account.
    *   **Carefully review `act`'s execution environment and dependencies.** Understand the security implications of the environment where `act` is running and any external libraries or components it relies on.
    *   **Report any suspected vulnerabilities in `act` to the project maintainers immediately.** Responsible disclosure helps the community and maintainers address security issues promptly and prevent potential exploitation.
    *   **Consider using security scanning tools to analyze `act`'s codebase for potential vulnerabilities.** While this might be more relevant for `act` developers, users with sufficient technical expertise could also perform or commission security audits.
