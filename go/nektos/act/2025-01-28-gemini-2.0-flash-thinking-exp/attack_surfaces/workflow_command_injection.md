## Deep Analysis: Workflow Command Injection in `act`

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the **Workflow Command Injection** attack surface within the context of `act`. This involves:

*   **Understanding the mechanics:**  Delving into *how* `act` processes and executes workflow commands, specifically identifying the points where user-controlled input can influence command construction.
*   **Assessing the risk:**  Evaluating the potential impact and severity of command injection vulnerabilities when using `act` for local workflow execution.
*   **Providing actionable mitigation strategies:**  Expanding upon the initial mitigation suggestions and offering comprehensive, practical guidance for developers to prevent and minimize the risk of command injection in their workflows when used with `act`.
*   **Raising awareness:**  Highlighting the importance of secure workflow design and the potential security implications of using tools like `act` without proper precautions.

Ultimately, the goal is to empower developers to use `act` securely by providing them with a clear understanding of the command injection attack surface and the necessary knowledge to mitigate it effectively.

### 2. Scope of Analysis

This deep analysis will focus specifically on the **Workflow Command Injection** attack surface as described in the provided context. The scope includes:

*   **`act`'s role in enabling the attack surface:**  Analyzing how `act`'s functionality of executing workflow commands locally directly contributes to the potential for command injection.
*   **Workflow YAML parsing and execution:** Examining how `act` interprets the `run` steps and other command-executing directives within workflow YAML files.
*   **User-controlled input vectors:** Identifying the various sources of user-controlled input that can be injected into workflow commands during `act` execution. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Environment variables (e.g., `INPUT_*`, `GITHUB_*`).
    *   Workflow inputs defined in `workflow_dispatch` or `repository_dispatch` events.
    *   Outputs from previous workflow steps or actions.
*   **Impact scenarios:**  Exploring the potential consequences of successful command injection, ranging from information disclosure to complete system compromise, specifically within the context of a developer's local machine or the `act` execution environment (Docker container).
*   **Mitigation techniques:**  Analyzing the effectiveness of the suggested mitigation strategies (input sanitization, parameterization, code review) and proposing additional or refined techniques.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Security vulnerabilities within `act`'s codebase itself (e.g., buffer overflows, arbitrary code execution in `act`'s core logic).
*   Broader security issues related to GitHub Actions platform security or the security of actions themselves.
*   Denial-of-service attacks against `act` or the host system that are not directly related to command injection.
*   Specific vulnerabilities in third-party actions used within workflows (unless directly contributing to the command injection attack surface within the `act` context).

### 4. Deep Analysis of Workflow Command Injection Attack Surface

#### 4.1. Technical Details: How `act` Enables Command Injection

`act` is designed to simulate the execution of GitHub Actions workflows locally.  It achieves this by:

1.  **Parsing Workflow YAML:** `act` reads and parses the workflow YAML files (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) in a repository. This includes identifying `jobs`, `steps`, and the commands defined within `run` steps.
2.  **Environment Variable Handling:** `act` sets up an environment that mimics the GitHub Actions environment, including predefined environment variables (e.g., `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, `GITHUB_ACTION_PATH`) and user-defined environment variables (e.g., `INPUT_*`, `secrets`).
3.  **Command Execution:** When `act` encounters a `run` step, it interprets the specified command.  Crucially, `act` uses a shell (typically `bash` in Linux environments, `pwsh` in Windows) to execute these commands. This shell execution is where the command injection vulnerability arises.
4.  **Variable Substitution:** Before executing the command, the shell performs variable substitution. If the command string contains variables (e.g., `$INPUT_BRANCH_NAME`, `${INPUT_BRANCH_NAME}`), the shell replaces these variables with their corresponding values from the environment.

**The Vulnerability Point:**

The core vulnerability lies in the **uncontrolled substitution of user-provided input into shell commands**. If a workflow author directly embeds user-controlled input (like environment variables or workflow inputs) into a `run` command *without proper sanitization or escaping*, an attacker who can influence this input can inject malicious shell commands.

**Example Breakdown:**

Consider the example: `run: echo "Branch name is $INPUT_BRANCH_NAME"`

*   **Workflow Author's Intent:**  Display the branch name provided as input.
*   **`act`'s Execution:** `act` will pass this string to the shell. If `INPUT_BRANCH_NAME` is set to `malicious-branch`, the shell executes: `echo "Branch name is malicious-branch"`.
*   **Vulnerability:** If a malicious actor can set `INPUT_BRANCH_NAME` to something like `vulnerable-branch"; rm -rf / #`, the shell will execute:
    ```bash
    echo "Branch name is vulnerable-branch"; rm -rf / # "
    ```
    The semicolon (`;`) acts as a command separator in bash, allowing the execution of `rm -rf /` after the `echo` command. The `#` comments out the rest of the original command, preventing syntax errors.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors and Scenarios

Several attack vectors can be exploited to inject commands in `act` workflows:

*   **Workflow Inputs (`inputs`):** Workflows can define inputs that can be provided when triggering the workflow manually (`workflow_dispatch`) or via repository events (`repository_dispatch`). If these inputs are used in `run` commands without sanitization, they become direct injection points.

    **Scenario:** A workflow takes an input `TARGET_DIR` and uses it in a `run` command like `run: cp -r source $TARGET_DIR`. An attacker could set `TARGET_DIR` to `/tmp; malicious_command; #` to inject commands.

*   **Environment Variables (`env` context, `INPUT_*` variables):** Workflows can access environment variables, including those set by GitHub Actions (`GITHUB_*`) and custom environment variables (especially `INPUT_*` variables passed as workflow inputs).  If these variables are used unsafely in commands, they are vulnerable.

    **Scenario:** A workflow uses `env.COMMIT_MESSAGE` in a `run` command: `run: echo "Commit message: $COMMIT_MESSAGE"`. If an attacker can influence the commit message (e.g., in a pull request), they can inject commands.

*   **Action Outputs:** Actions can produce outputs that are then used in subsequent steps of the workflow. If an action's output is derived from user-controlled input and is not sanitized before being used in a `run` command, it can lead to injection.

    **Scenario:** A custom action takes user input and outputs a filename. This filename is then used in a `run` command in the workflow: `run: cat ${{ steps.my-action.outputs.filename }}`. If the action doesn't sanitize the filename and an attacker can control the input to the action, they can inject commands via the filename output.

*   **Indirect Injection via Configuration Files:** In some cases, workflows might generate configuration files based on user input and then execute commands that process these files. If the configuration file parsing is vulnerable to injection, and the file content is influenced by user input, indirect command injection can occur.

    **Scenario:** A workflow generates a `config.ini` file based on `INPUT_SETTINGS` and then runs a command `run: process_config config.ini`. If `process_config` is vulnerable to injection through the `config.ini` file format, and `INPUT_SETTINGS` is user-controlled, injection is possible.

#### 4.3. Impact Assessment

The impact of successful command injection in `act` can be **Critical**, as highlighted in the initial description. The potential consequences include:

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute any command they want on the developer's machine or within the Docker container used by `act`. This is the most direct and severe impact.
*   **Data Theft and Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive files, environment variables, and other data on the system. This could include source code, credentials, secrets, and personal information.
*   **System Compromise:** Attackers can modify system files, install malware, create backdoors, and potentially gain persistent access to the developer's machine or the execution environment.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can execute commands that crash the system, consume resources, or disrupt the developer's workflow.
*   **Lateral Movement (in simulated CI/CD):** While `act` is local, if developers are using it to test CI/CD workflows, a successful injection could reveal vulnerabilities that would be exploitable in the actual CI/CD environment. This can be considered a form of "pre-production" lateral movement discovery.
*   **Supply Chain Implications (if workflows are shared):** If vulnerable workflows are shared or used as templates, the vulnerability can propagate to other developers and projects, creating a supply chain risk.

**Risk Severity: Critical** is justified because command injection allows for complete control over the execution environment, leading to potentially catastrophic consequences.

#### 4.4. Detailed Mitigation Strategies and Best Practices

The initially provided mitigation strategies are crucial, but we can expand and detail them further:

1.  **Input Sanitization in Workflows (Essential):**

    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Inputs:**  Only request necessary inputs and clearly define their expected format and purpose. Avoid accepting overly broad or unstructured inputs.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Implement strict validation rules for all user-controlled inputs *within the workflow definition itself*. This can be done using scripting languages within actions or custom actions.
        *   **Example (Bash in `run` step):**
            ```yaml
            steps:
              - name: Validate Branch Name
                id: validate_branch
                run: |
                  BRANCH_NAME="${{ github.event.inputs.branch_name }}"
                  # Sanitize: Allow only alphanumeric and hyphens
                  SANITIZED_BRANCH_NAME=$(echo "$BRANCH_NAME" | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9-]//g')
                  if [[ "$BRANCH_NAME" != "$SANITIZED_BRANCH_NAME" ]]; then
                    echo "::error::Invalid branch name. Only alphanumeric and hyphens allowed."
                    exit 1
                  fi
                  echo "::set-output name=sanitized_name::$SANITIZED_BRANCH_NAME"
              - name: Use Sanitized Branch Name
                run: echo "Branch name is ${{ steps.validate_branch.outputs.sanitized_name }}"
            ```
    *   **Encoding/Escaping:**  If direct sanitization is complex, consider encoding or escaping user inputs before using them in commands. However, this is often less robust than proper sanitization and should be used cautiously.

2.  **Parameterization in Workflows (Highly Recommended):**

    *   **Avoid String Concatenation:**  Never directly concatenate user inputs into shell command strings.
    *   **Use Action Features for Parameterization:** Leverage features of actions or scripting languages within actions that allow for safe parameter passing to commands.
    *   **Example (Using an Action with Parameterization):** Instead of `run: git checkout $INPUT_BRANCH_NAME`, use a dedicated action that handles branch checkout safely:
        ```yaml
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
            with:
              ref: ${{ github.event.inputs.branch_name }} # Parameterized input
        ```
    *   **Scripting Languages for Complex Logic:** For complex command construction, use scripting languages (like Python, Node.js) within actions or `run` steps. Scripting languages often provide safer ways to execute commands and handle user input.

3.  **Code Review of Workflows (Essential):**

    *   **Treat Workflows as Code:**  Workflows are code and should be subject to the same security scrutiny as application code.
    *   **Dedicated Security Review:**  Incorporate security reviews of workflow definitions into the development process, especially when workflows handle user input or sensitive operations.
    *   **Automated Workflow Security Scanning:** Explore tools (if available) that can automatically scan workflow YAML files for potential command injection vulnerabilities or insecure patterns.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Workflow Execution Environment:**

    *   **Run `act` in Isolated Environments:**  Execute `act` within Docker containers or virtual machines to limit the potential damage if command injection occurs. This isolates the host system from direct compromise.
    *   **Restrict Permissions:**  When running `act` in containers, configure the container runtime to limit the privileges of the `act` process. Avoid running `act` as root within containers if possible.

5.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Workflow Outputs (Defense in Depth):**

    *   While less directly related to command injection, if workflows generate web content or outputs that are displayed in a browser, consider implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities that might arise from injected content.

6.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**

    *   Periodically audit workflows and conduct penetration testing (even on local `act` executions) to proactively identify and address potential command injection vulnerabilities.

#### 4.5. Recommendations for Developers Using `act`

*   **Assume User Input is Malicious:** Always treat user-controlled input (workflow inputs, environment variables, action outputs derived from user input) as potentially malicious.
*   **Prioritize Parameterization:** Favor parameterized commands and actions over string concatenation when dealing with user input in workflows.
*   **Implement Strict Input Validation:**  Validate and sanitize all user-controlled inputs within your workflow definitions.
*   **Regularly Review Workflows for Security:**  Incorporate workflow security reviews into your development workflow.
*   **Run `act` in Isolated Environments:** Use Docker containers or VMs to isolate `act` execution and limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Stay Updated on Security Best Practices:**  Continuously learn about secure coding practices for workflows and GitHub Actions.

By understanding the mechanics of Workflow Command Injection in `act` and implementing these mitigation strategies and best practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk and use `act` more securely for local workflow testing and development.
