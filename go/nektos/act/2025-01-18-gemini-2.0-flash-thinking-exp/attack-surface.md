# Attack Surface Analysis for nektos/act

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Workflow Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_workflow_injection.md)

* **Description:** Malicious Workflow Injection
    * **How `act` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `act` directly interprets and executes the commands defined within the workflow files located in the `.github/workflows` directory. If an attacker gains the ability to modify these files, `act` will faithfully execute the injected malicious code during its run.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies a workflow file to include a step that executes a command to delete critical system files when `act` is invoked.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system where `act` is running, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data loss, credential theft, or the installation of malware.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust access controls and authentication mechanisms for the repository to prevent unauthorized modifications to workflow files.
        * Enforce mandatory code reviews for all changes to workflow files before they are merged.
        * Utilize branch protection rules to restrict direct pushes to main branches and require pull requests.
        * Consider using a dedicated and isolated environment for running `act`, especially in CI/CD pipelines, to limit the impact of potential compromises.

## Attack Surface: [Execution of Untrusted Code Facilitated by `act`](./attack_surfaces/execution_of_untrusted_code_facilitated_by__act_.md)

* **Description:** Execution of Untrusted Code Facilitated by `act`
    * **How `act` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `act` is designed to execute the commands and scripts specified within the steps of a GitHub Actions workflow. If these steps instruct the system to download and execute external scripts or binaries from untrusted sources without proper verification, `act` will directly facilitate this execution, regardless of the potential risks.
    * **Example:** A workflow step uses `curl` or `wget` to download a script from an external, potentially malicious server and then executes it using `bash` or `python`. `act` will execute these commands as instructed.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the machine running `act`, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, the installation of backdoors, or participation in botnets.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly scrutinize all commands and scripts within workflow definitions, paying close attention to any instructions that involve downloading and executing external code.
        * Avoid downloading and executing external scripts unless absolutely necessary and only from highly trusted and verifiable sources.
        * Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of downloaded scripts, such as using checksums (e.g., SHA256 hashes) and verifying signatures.
        * Employ static analysis tools to scan workflow files for potentially dangerous commands and patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerable Docker Images Used by `act`](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerable_docker_images_used_by__act_.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting Vulnerable Docker Images Used by `act`
    * **How `act` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `act` often relies on Docker images to create isolated environments for running workflow jobs. If the specified Docker images are outdated or contain known security vulnerabilities, these vulnerabilities can be exploited during the local execution of workflows by `act`.
    * **Example:** A workflow specifies an outdated Docker image that has a known vulnerability allowing for container escape. When `act` uses this image, a malicious workflow could leverage this vulnerability to execute code on the host system outside of the container.
    * **Impact:** Container escape, allowing malicious code to execute directly on the host system where `act` is running, potentially leading to full system compromise and data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Prioritize the use of official and well-maintained Docker images from reputable sources.
        * Implement regular scanning of Docker images for known vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy or Clair.
        * Ensure that the base images and dependencies within the Docker images used by `act` are kept up to date with the latest security patches.
        * Consider using minimal and hardened Docker images to reduce the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Direct Exploitation of Vulnerabilities within `act`](./attack_surfaces/direct_exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_within__act_.md)

* **Description:** Direct Exploitation of Vulnerabilities within `act`
    * **How `act` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** As a software application itself, `act` may contain security vulnerabilities in its code. If these vulnerabilities exist, an attacker could potentially exploit them directly to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code in the context of the `act` process.
    * **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in `act`'s parsing logic for workflow files. An attacker crafts a specially designed workflow file that triggers this overflow, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the system running `act`.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running `act`, potentially leading to system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep `act` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
        * Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues related to `act`.
        * Consider the security practices of the `act` project and its maintainers.
        * If critical vulnerabilities are discovered and not promptly addressed, consider using alternative tools or implementing compensating controls.
