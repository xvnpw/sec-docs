### 4. Deep Analysis of Path Traversal Vulnerabilities

#### 4.1 Understanding `act`'s File Handling

`act` operates by simulating GitHub Actions locally. This involves parsing workflow definitions (typically in YAML format) and executing the defined steps. Many actions within these workflows involve interacting with the file system, such as:

*   **Checking out code:**  Actions like `actions/checkout` download repository code to the local file system.
*   **Accessing files defined in the workflow:**  Workflows might specify files to be used as input or output for various steps.
*   **Running scripts:**  Workflow steps often execute shell scripts or other programs that interact with the file system.
*   **Artifact handling:**  Actions for uploading and downloading artifacts involve file system operations.

The core of the vulnerability lies in how `act` interprets and processes file paths specified within the workflow definitions or by the actions being executed. If `act` doesn't properly sanitize or validate these paths, a malicious workflow could provide paths that escape the intended project directory.

#### 4.2 Potential Attack Vectors

A malicious actor could craft a workflow designed to exploit path traversal vulnerabilities in `act` through various means:

*   **Manipulating `uses` directives:** If `act` fetches actions from external sources and those actions contain file system operations, a compromised or malicious action could attempt path traversal.
*   **Exploiting file paths in workflow steps:**  Workflow steps that involve file operations (e.g., copying, moving, reading, writing files) could be manipulated to target arbitrary locations. Examples include:
    *   Using relative paths with `..` to navigate up the directory structure (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`).
    *   Providing absolute paths to access files outside the project directory.
    *   Potentially exploiting symbolic links if `act` doesn't properly resolve them.
*   **Leveraging environment variables:**  If workflow steps use environment variables to construct file paths, a malicious workflow could manipulate these variables to inject path traversal sequences.
*   **Exploiting vulnerabilities in specific actions:**  Third-party actions used within the workflow might themselves contain vulnerabilities that `act` inadvertently exposes if it doesn't properly sandbox their file system access.

**Example Attack Scenario:**

Consider a workflow step that copies a file:

```yaml
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Copy sensitive file
        run: cp input.txt /tmp/output.txt
```

A malicious workflow could manipulate the `input.txt` path to access sensitive files:

```yaml
jobs:
  malicious:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Attempt Path Traversal
        run: cp ../../../../../home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa /tmp/stolen_key
```

If `act` doesn't properly sanitize the path `../../../../../home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa`, it could potentially copy the developer's private SSH key to the `/tmp` directory.

#### 4.3 Impact Assessment (Detailed)

Successful exploitation of a path traversal vulnerability in `act` can have severe consequences:

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Files:**  Attackers could gain access to sensitive files on the developer's machine, including:
    *   Configuration files containing API keys, database credentials, and other secrets (e.g., `.env` files).
    *   SSH private keys, allowing unauthorized access to other systems.
    *   Browser history, cookies, and other personal data.
    *   Source code of other projects or sensitive documents.
*   **Modification of System Files:**  Malicious workflows could potentially modify critical system files, leading to:
    *   System instability or denial of service.
    *   Privilege escalation if writable system files are targeted.
    *   Installation of malware or backdoors.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Stolen sensitive data could be exfiltrated from the developer's machine.
*   **Supply Chain Risks:** If developers are using `act` to test or build components that are later deployed, a compromised workflow could inject malicious code or configurations into those components, leading to supply chain attacks.

The severity of the impact is amplified by the fact that `act` is typically run with the privileges of the developer executing it. This means that a successful path traversal attack can operate with the same level of access as the developer.

#### 4.4 Technical Deep Dive

Path traversal vulnerabilities arise when an application uses user-supplied input (in this case, file paths within workflow definitions or action code) to construct file system paths without proper validation and sanitization. Common causes include:

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:**  Failing to check for and remove malicious path components like `..`.
*   **Lack of Canonicalization:**  Not converting file paths to their canonical (absolute and normalized) form, which can hide malicious components.
*   **Direct Use of User Input in File System APIs:**  Passing user-controlled strings directly to file system functions without sanitization.

Given that `act` is written in Go, developers need to be particularly mindful of how Go's `os` and `path/filepath` packages are used. Functions like `os.Open`, `os.Create`, `os.ReadFile`, and `filepath.Join` need to be used carefully to avoid introducing path traversal vulnerabilities.

**Potential areas within `act`'s codebase to investigate for vulnerabilities:**

*   **Workflow parsing logic:** How `act` interprets file paths specified in the YAML workflow files.
*   **Action execution engine:** How `act` handles file operations requested by individual actions.
*   **Artifact handling mechanisms:**  The code responsible for uploading and downloading artifacts.
*   **Code related to checking out repositories:**  The logic used by actions like `actions/checkout`.

#### 4.5 Evaluation of Existing Mitigation Strategies

The initially suggested mitigation strategies are important first steps:

*   **Ensure `act` is updated to the latest version:** This is crucial as developers of `act` likely address reported vulnerabilities in newer releases. Staying up-to-date ensures that known path traversal issues are patched.
*   **Avoid using or trusting workflows from unknown or untrusted sources:** This significantly reduces the risk of encountering malicious workflows designed to exploit vulnerabilities. However, even seemingly benign workflows from trusted sources could be compromised.
*   **Report any suspected path traversal vulnerabilities in `act` to the developers:**  Responsible disclosure helps the `act` development team identify and fix vulnerabilities, benefiting the entire community.

**Limitations of these strategies:**

*   **Reliance on User Vigilance:**  Avoiding untrusted workflows depends on the user's ability to identify potentially malicious code, which can be challenging.
*   **Zero-Day Exploits:**  Even with the latest version, new, undiscovered vulnerabilities (zero-day exploits) can still exist.

#### 4.6 Recommendations for Development Team

To further mitigate the risk of Path Traversal vulnerabilities, the development team should implement the following measures:

*   **Implement Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Strictly validate all file paths:**  Implement checks to ensure that file paths stay within the intended project directory.
    *   **Sanitize input:** Remove or escape potentially malicious path components like `..`.
    *   **Use allow-lists instead of block-lists:** Define allowed directories and file patterns instead of trying to block all possible malicious patterns.
*   **Utilize Secure File Handling APIs:**
    *   **Prefer `filepath.Clean`:**  Use `filepath.Clean` in Go to normalize file paths and remove redundant separators and `..` elements.
    *   **Use `filepath.Abs`:** Convert relative paths to absolute paths to ensure consistent interpretation.
    *   **Implement chroot-like behavior:**  Consider using mechanisms to restrict file access to a specific directory, preventing access to files outside that boundary.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  When executing workflow steps or actions, operate with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running `act` with elevated privileges if possible.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough security audits of the `act` codebase, focusing on file handling logic. Implement regular code reviews with a security focus.
*   **Implement Security Testing:**
    *   **Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing techniques to automatically generate and test various file path inputs to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Employ SAST tools to automatically scan the codebase for potential path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST):**  Develop test workflows that specifically attempt path traversal attacks to verify the effectiveness of implemented mitigations.
*   **Consider Sandboxing or Containerization:** Explore options for running workflow steps within isolated environments (e.g., containers) to limit the impact of potential path traversal vulnerabilities. This could involve leveraging existing containerization technologies or implementing custom sandboxing mechanisms.
*   **Educate Users:** Provide clear documentation and warnings to users about the risks of running untrusted workflows and the importance of keeping `act` updated.
