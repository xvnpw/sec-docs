# Threat Model Analysis for nektos/act

## Threat: [Malicious Workflow Definitions](./threats/malicious_workflow_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker (or a compromised developer account) introduces a crafted workflow definition containing malicious commands or actions. When `act` executes this workflow locally, the attacker's commands are run on the developer's machine *by `act`*. This could involve downloading and executing malware, accessing sensitive files, or modifying system configurations.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the developer's local machine, including data loss, malware infection, and potential access to sensitive credentials or intellectual property stored locally, *directly caused by `act` executing the malicious workflow*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Workflow Parser module (responsible for reading and interpreting the `.github/workflows/*.yml` files within `act`), Job Execution module (responsible for running the steps defined in the workflow *by `act`*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review all workflow definitions before executing them with `act`.
        *   Only execute workflows from trusted sources and repositories *with `act`*.
        *   Implement code review processes for workflow changes before using them with `act`.
        *   Use static analysis tools to scan workflow definitions for potential malicious patterns before using them with `act` locally.
        *   Educate developers about the risks of executing untrusted workflows *with `act`*.

## Threat: [Exposure of Secrets in Local Environment](./threats/exposure_of_secrets_in_local_environment.md)

*   **Description:** `act` needs access to secrets defined in the GitHub repository or environment variables to simulate workflow execution. If `act` logs these secrets during execution (e.g., in verbose mode or error messages) or stores them insecurely in temporary files, an attacker with access to the developer's machine could retrieve them *due to `act`'s behavior*.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials (API keys, passwords, tokens) that could be used to compromise other systems or services *due to `act`'s handling of secrets*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Secret Management module (responsible for handling and accessing secrets within `act`), Logging module (responsible for outputting execution information *by `act`*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid running `act` in verbose mode when handling sensitive secrets.
        *   Ensure `act`'s logging configuration does not expose secret values.
        *   Regularly audit `act`'s temporary files and directories for potential secret leaks.
        *   Use secure secret management practices within workflows, even during local testing with `act`.
        *   Educate developers about the risks of secret exposure during local development with `act`.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Docker Images](./threats/vulnerable_docker_images.md)

*   **Description:** `act` relies on Docker images to simulate the GitHub Actions environment. If the Docker images used by `act` (either the base runner image or action-specific images) contain known vulnerabilities, these vulnerabilities could be exploited during workflow execution on the developer's machine *through `act`'s Docker interaction*. This could lead to container escape, privilege escalation within the container, or other forms of compromise.
    *   **Impact:** Potential compromise of the developer's local machine if a container escape vulnerability is exploited *via `act`'s Docker execution*. Compromise of the simulated environment, potentially affecting the integrity of local testing *performed by `act`*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docker Interaction module (responsible for pulling and running Docker images *within `act`*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure `act` is configured to use up-to-date and trusted Docker images.
        *   Regularly update the Docker images used by `act`.
        *   Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy or Snyk before using them with `act`.
        *   Consider using minimal and hardened Docker images for workflow execution with `act`.

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Workflow Commands](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_workflow_commands.md)

*   **Description:** GitHub Actions allows workflows to interact with the runner environment through specific commands (e.g., `::add-path::`, `::set-output::`). If `act` doesn't properly sanitize or validate these commands, a malicious workflow could potentially execute arbitrary code on the host system *through `act`'s command processing* by crafting malicious command strings.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution on the developer's local machine, leading to system compromise *due to a flaw in `act`'s command handling*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Workflow Command Processing module (responsible for interpreting and executing special workflow commands *within `act`*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure `act` is updated to the latest version, which should include fixes for known command injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Avoid using or trusting workflows from unknown or untrusted sources *with `act`*.
        *   Report any suspected command injection vulnerabilities in `act` to the developers.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `act` Tool Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__act__tool_itself.md)

*   **Description:** The `act` tool itself might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., in its YAML parsing, Docker interaction, or command handling) that could be exploited by a malicious workflow or an attacker with access to the developer's machine *through the `act` application*.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or other forms of compromise depending on the nature of the vulnerability *within `act`*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various core modules of `act`, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `act` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor the `act` project for reported security vulnerabilities and updates.
        *   Be cautious about running `act` versions with known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious workflow could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in `act`'s file system access to read or write files outside the intended project directory *via `act`'s file handling mechanisms*. This could allow access to sensitive files on the developer's machine or the modification of critical system files.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files on the developer's machine, potential modification of system files leading to instability or compromise *due to a flaw in `act`'s file access control*.
    *   **Affected Component:** File System Access module (responsible for handling file operations within the workflow execution *by `act`*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure `act` is updated to the latest version, which should include fixes for known path traversal vulnerabilities.
        *   Avoid using or trusting workflows from unknown or untrusted sources that perform file system operations *when using `act`*.
        *   Report any suspected path traversal vulnerabilities in `act` to the developers.
