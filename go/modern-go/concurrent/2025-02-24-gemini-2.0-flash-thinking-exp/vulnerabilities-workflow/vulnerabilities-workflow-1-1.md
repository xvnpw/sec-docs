### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Information Disclosure via Panic Logs

- Description:
    1. An application utilizes the `concurrent.UnboundedExecutor` to manage goroutines for concurrent tasks.
    2. Within the application, a goroutine is initiated using `executor.Go`, and this goroutine's handler function processes user-provided input.
    3. A malicious user crafts a specific input designed to trigger a panic within the handler function during processing.
    4. When the panic occurs, the `concurrent` library's `HandlePanic` function is invoked to manage the error. By default, `HandlePanic` is configured to log the panic message and the associated stack trace using the `ErrorLogger`.
    5. The `ErrorLogger`, by default, is set to output to `os.Stderr`. If the application's environment captures `os.Stderr` and redirects it to a log file or a centralized logging system, the panic information is recorded in these logs.
    6. Should these logs be stored in a location accessible to an attacker, whether due to misconfiguration, weak access controls, or exposure through a web interface, the attacker can access and review them.
    7. If the panic message or the stack trace inadvertently contains sensitive information – such as file paths, database connection strings, internal identifiers, or portions of the user's malicious input itself – this information is then disclosed to the attacker through the accessible logs.

- Impact:
    Information Disclosure. A successful exploit can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. This information may include internal application details, system paths, configuration data, or even fragments of user input that triggered the panic. The severity depends on the sensitivity of the leaked information and the context of the application. In some scenarios, leaked information can be leveraged for further attacks.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    The `concurrent` library itself does not implement specific mitigations to prevent information disclosure via panic logs. It offers the `HandlePanic` function as a customizable handler for panics and uses `ErrorLogger` for logging, but the default behavior logs panic details including the stack trace. The library relies on the application developer to configure logging securely and to ensure that handler functions do not inadvertently expose sensitive data in panic messages.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Documentation Enhancement: The `concurrent` library's documentation should include a clear warning about the security implications of panic handling, specifically regarding the potential for information disclosure through logs. It should advise developers to carefully consider what information might be included in panic messages and stack traces, especially when processing user input, and to configure logging securely.
    - Best Practices Guidance: Providing best practices for using `HandlePanic` securely would be beneficial. This could include suggesting sanitization or filtering of panic messages before logging in security-sensitive applications. Although, automatic sanitization by the library might be too opinionated and reduce debugging utility.
    - Consider alternative default logging behavior: While logging stack traces is valuable for debugging, the default `HandlePanic` could potentially be modified to offer a more security-conscious default, perhaps by logging less verbose information by default, or providing an option to disable stack trace logging in production environments. However, this might reduce the utility of panic handling for developers. A documentation-focused mitigation is likely more appropriate for a library like this.

- Preconditions:
    1. The target application uses the `concurrent.UnboundedExecutor` to manage goroutines that process user-provided input.
    2. The application's goroutine handler function is susceptible to panics when processing specific, potentially malicious, user inputs.
    3. The application's logging configuration captures the output of `os.Stderr` (or the configured `ErrorLogger`'s output) and stores it in a location that is accessible to external attackers.
    4. The panic messages or stack traces generated by the application in response to malicious input contain sensitive information.

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/unbounded_executor.go`
    - Function: `UnboundedExecutor.Go(handler func(ctx context.Context))`
    - Within the `Go` function, a `defer recover()` block is used to handle panics within the executed goroutine:
      ```go
      go func() {
          defer func() {
              recovered := recover()
              if recovered != nil {
                  if executor.HandlePanic == nil {
                      HandlePanic(recovered, funcName) // Invokes default HandlePanic if executor-specific handler is not set
                  } else {
                      executor.HandlePanic(recovered, funcName) // Invokes custom HandlePanic if set
                  }
              }
              ...
          }()
          handler(executor.ctx) // The user-provided handler function is executed here
      }()
      ```
    - File: `/code/unbounded_executor.go`
    - Variable: `HandlePanic`:
      ```go
      // HandlePanic logs goroutine panic by default
      var HandlePanic = func(recovered interface{}, funcName string) {
          ErrorLogger.Println(fmt.Sprintf("%s panic: %v", funcName, recovered)) // Logs panic message
          ErrorLogger.Println(string(debug.Stack()))                               // Logs stack trace
      }
      ```
      The default `HandlePanic` function formats a panic message including the function name and the recovered value, and then logs the full stack trace using `ErrorLogger`.
    - File: `/code/log.go`
    - Variable: `ErrorLogger`:
      ```go
      // ErrorLogger is used to print out error, can be set to writer other than stderr
      var ErrorLogger = log.New(os.Stderr, "", 0) // Default ErrorLogger is configured to write to os.Stderr
      ```
      By default, `ErrorLogger` is initialized to write to `os.Stderr`. This standard error stream is often captured by logging systems in production environments.

- Security test case:
    1. **Setup a vulnerable application:** Create a simple Go application that uses the `concurrent` library. This application should have an endpoint (e.g., an HTTP endpoint) that, when accessed, triggers the execution of a goroutine using `concurrent.UnboundedExecutor`. The handler function for this goroutine should be designed to process a user-provided input string.  Specifically, make the handler function panic if the input string is equal to a predefined malicious string (e.g., "sensitive_input"). When the panic occurs, ensure the panic value includes the malicious input string itself to simulate the leakage of user-provided data.

    2. **Configure logging:** Configure the application's logging such that `os.Stderr` is redirected to a file that can be accessed after the test. For example, in a development environment, simply redirecting stderr output to a file within the application's directory would suffice. In a more realistic scenario, this would represent application logs being stored in a centralized logging system or a shared file system with potential access by attackers.

    3. **Trigger the panic:** As an attacker, send a request to the application's endpoint with the malicious input string ("sensitive_input"). This input should cause the goroutine's handler function to panic.

    4. **Access and examine logs:** After triggering the panic, access the log file to which `os.Stderr` is redirected.

    5. **Verify information disclosure:** Examine the log file's contents. Confirm that the log file contains an error entry logged by `HandlePanic`. Verify that this log entry includes:
        - The panic message, which should contain the malicious input string ("sensitive_input") or some derivative of it, demonstrating that user-provided data is included in the panic log.
        - A stack trace, which could potentially reveal internal application paths or function names, adding to the information disclosed.

    By successfully completing these steps, you can demonstrate that a malicious user can trigger a panic in an application using the `concurrent` library and potentially cause sensitive information to be logged and disclosed if the application's logging is not securely configured and if panic messages are not carefully handled. This test case validates the information disclosure vulnerability via panic logs.
