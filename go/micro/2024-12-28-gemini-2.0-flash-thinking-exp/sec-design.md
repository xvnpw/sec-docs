### 3.1. Core Components

*   **API Gateway ("API Gateway"):** The intelligent entry point for all external requests targeting the microservices.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Request routing, load balancing, authentication, authorization, TLS termination, request transformation, and potentially rate limiting, circuit breaking, and observability.
    *   **Functionalities:**  Receives client requests, identifies the target service, authenticates and authorizes the request, and forwards it to an appropriate service instance.
*   **Service Registry ("Service Registry"):**  A distributed database that maintains a real-time inventory of available service instances and their network locations.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Service registration, deregistration, health checking, and providing service discovery information to clients.
    *   **Functionalities:** Allows service instances to register their availability, monitors their health, and provides APIs for other components to query for available service endpoints.
*   **Broker ("Broker"):**  An asynchronous messaging system enabling decoupled communication between services using a publish/subscribe pattern.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Message routing, delivery guarantees (depending on the implementation), and message persistence (optional).
    *   **Functionalities:**  Receives messages published by services, routes them to interested subscribers based on topics, and ensures reliable delivery.

    *   **Responsibilities:** Storing, managing, and providing configuration data to services. Supporting different configuration sources and formats.
    *   **Functionalities:** Provides an API for services to request their configuration, supports versioning and rollback of configurations, and can push configuration updates to services.
*   **Auth ("Auth"):**  Provides authentication and authorization capabilities for both external clients and internal services.
    *   **Responsibilities:** User management, authentication (verifying identity), authorization (granting access), token issuance and verification, and policy enforcement.
    *   **Functionalities:**  Authenticates users and services, issues access tokens (e.g., JWT), verifies the validity of tokens, and enforces access control policies based on roles or permissions.
*   **Runtime ("Runtime"):**  Manages the lifecycle of service instances, including deployment, scaling, updates, and health monitoring.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Deploying new service instances, scaling existing instances based on demand, performing rolling updates, and monitoring service health.
    *   **Functionalities:** Interacts with underlying infrastructure (e.g., container orchestrators) to manage the deployment and scaling of services.
*   **CLI ("CLI"):**  A command-line interface for developers and operators to interact with and manage the Micro platform.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Providing commands for service management (e.g., deploy, scale, restart), viewing logs, inspecting service status, and managing platform configurations.
    *   **Functionalities:**  Offers a set of commands to interact with the various components of the Micro platform, simplifying management tasks.
*   **Service Instance ("Service Instance"):**  An individual running instance of a microservice built using the Micro framework.
    *   **Responsibilities:**  Implementing specific business logic, registering with the Service Registry, communicating with other services, and reporting health status.
    *   **Functionalities:**  Receives requests, processes them according to its business logic, and interacts with other platform components for service discovery, configuration, and communication.

## 4. Data Flow

This section describes the typical data flows within the Micro platform with more detail.

### 4.1. Client Request to Service

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Client"
        C["Client Application"]
    end
    subgraph "Micro Platform"
        AG["API Gateway"]
        SR["Service Registry"]
        SVC["Service Instance"]
    end

    C -- "1. Request (e.g., HTTP)" --> AG
    AG -- "2. Identify Target Service" --> AG
    AG -- "3. Lookup Service Endpoint" --> SR
    SR -- "4. Service Endpoint(s)" --> AG
    AG -- "5. Forward Request" --> SVC
    SVC -- "6. Process Request" --> SVC
    SVC -- "7. Response" --> AG
    AG -- "8. Response" --> C
```

1. The **Client Application** sends a request (e.g., HTTP) to the **API Gateway**.
2. The **API Gateway** analyzes the request (e.g., path, headers) to identify the target service.
3. The **API Gateway** queries the **Service Registry** to find the network location(s) of available instances of the target service.
4. The **Service Registry** returns the network address(es) of the available **Service Instance(s)**.
5. The **API Gateway** selects an appropriate **Service Instance** (potentially using load balancing algorithms) and forwards the request.
6. The selected **Service Instance** processes the request based on its business logic.
7. The **Service Instance** sends a response back to the **API Gateway**.
8. The **API Gateway** forwards the response back to the **Client Application**.

### 4.2. Service Registration

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Micro Platform"
        SR["Service Registry"]
        SVC["Service Instance"]
    end

    SVC -- "1. Startup, Send Registration Request" --> SR
    SR -- "2. Store Service Information" --> SR
    SR -- "3. Acknowledge Registration" --> SVC
```

1. A **Service Instance** starts up and sends a registration request to the **Service Registry**, including its name, version, endpoints, health check information, and metadata.
2. The **Service Registry** receives the registration request and stores the service's information in its registry.
3. The **Service Registry** sends an acknowledgment back to the **Service Instance**, confirming successful registration.

### 4.3. Inter-Service Communication (Synchronous)

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Micro Platform"
        SVC1["Service Instance A"]
        SR["Service Registry"]
        SVC2["Service Instance B"]
    end

    SVC1 -- "1. Lookup Service B Endpoint" --> SR
    SR -- "2. Service B Endpoint(s)" --> SVC1
    SVC1 -- "3. Send Request to Service B" --> SVC2
    SVC2 -- "4. Process Request" --> SVC2
    SVC2 -- "5. Response" --> SVC1
```

1. **Service Instance A** needs to communicate synchronously with **Service Instance B**.
2. **Service Instance A** queries the **Service Registry** for the network location(s) of **Service Instance B**.
3. The **Service Registry** returns the network address(es) of **Service Instance B**.
4. **Service Instance A** sends a request directly to **Service Instance B** (typically using HTTP or gRPC).
5. **Service Instance B** processes the request and sends a response back to **Service Instance A**.

### 4.4. Inter-Service Communication (Asynchronous)

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Micro Platform"
        SVC1["Service Instance A"]
        BR["Broker"]
        SVC2["Service Instance B"]
    end

    SVC1 -- "1. Publish Message to Topic" --> BR
    BR -- "2. Route Message to Subscribers" --> BR
    SVC2 -- "3. Receive Message" --> BR
```

1. **Service Instance A** wants to asynchronously notify other services about an event.
2. **Service Instance A** publishes a message to a specific topic on the **Broker**.
3. The **Broker** receives the message and routes it to all **Service Instance(s)** that have subscribed to that topic (e.g., **Service Instance B**). **Service Instance B** then receives the message.

### 4.5. Configuration Retrieval

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Micro Platform"
        SVC["Service Instance"]
        CF["Config"]
    end

    SVC -- "1. Request Configuration" --> CF
    CF -- "2. Retrieve Configuration" --> CF
    CF -- "3. Return Configuration" --> SVC
```

1. A **Service Instance** needs its configuration settings, typically during startup or when configuration changes are detected.
2. The **Service Instance** sends a request to the **Config** service, identifying itself and the configuration it needs.
3. The **Config** service retrieves the relevant configuration from its storage.
4. The **Config** service returns the configuration data to the requesting **Service Instance**.
