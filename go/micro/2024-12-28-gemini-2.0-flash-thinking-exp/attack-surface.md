Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving `micro/micro`, with high and critical risk severity:

* **Unencrypted Inter-Service Communication**
    * **Description:** Communication between microservices within the `micro/micro` ecosystem is not encrypted.
    * **How Micro Contributes:** While `micro/micro` supports secure communication (e.g., gRPC with TLS), it might not be enforced by default or properly configured by developers using the framework. The framework's flexibility can lead to developers overlooking secure transport configurations.
    * **Example:** Sensitive data exchanged between two microservices (e.g., user credentials, financial information) is intercepted by an attacker on the network.
    * **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data theft, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enforce TLS/mTLS:** Configure `micro/micro` services to use TLS for all inter-service communication. Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication between services. This often involves configuring `micro/micro`'s transport options.
        * **Secure Transport Configuration:** Ensure the underlying transport (e.g., gRPC) is configured to enforce encryption within the `micro/micro` service definitions.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Review service configurations within the `micro/micro` context to ensure TLS is enabled and properly configured.

* **Insecure API Gateway Configuration**
    * **Description:** The API Gateway, often used with `micro/micro` to expose services to external clients, is misconfigured, leading to vulnerabilities.
    * **How Micro Contributes:** `micro/micro` provides tools and patterns for building API Gateways. Misconfigurations in routing, authentication, or authorization within this gateway, often implemented using `micro/micro`'s features, directly expose backend services.
    * **Example:** The API Gateway, built using `micro/micro`'s components, lacks proper authentication, allowing unauthorized access to backend services. Alternatively, path traversal vulnerabilities in the gateway's routing logic, defined within `micro/micro`, allow access to unintended resources.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality, potential for data breaches, service disruption.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Enforce authentication for all external requests handled by the `micro/micro` API Gateway and implement granular authorization rules to control access to specific endpoints.
        * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input received by the `micro/micro` API Gateway to prevent injection attacks.
        * **Secure Routing Configuration:** Carefully configure routing rules within the `micro/micro` API Gateway to prevent unintended exposure of internal services.
        * **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement rate limiting and throttling within the `micro/micro` API Gateway to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

* **Vulnerabilities in Micro CLI and Management Tools**
    * **Description:** Security vulnerabilities in the `micro` CLI or other management tools could allow attackers to compromise the entire microservice environment.
    * **How Micro Contributes:** The `micro` CLI is a central tool for managing and deploying `micro/micro` applications. Vulnerabilities inherent in the CLI's code or dependencies directly impact the security of the `micro/micro` ecosystem.
    * **Example:** A command injection vulnerability in the `micro` CLI allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the microservices when a developer uses a malicious command or input.
    * **Impact:** Full control over the microservice infrastructure, data breaches, service disruption.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep CLI Tools Updated:** Ensure the `micro` CLI and other management tools are updated to the latest versions with security patches provided by the `micro/micro` project.
        * **Secure Access to Management Tools:** Restrict access to the `micro` CLI and management interfaces to authorized personnel only.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Participate in or review security audits of the `micro/micro` management tools and their usage.
