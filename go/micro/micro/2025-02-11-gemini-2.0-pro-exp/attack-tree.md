## Attack Tree Path: [[G] === [A1] === [A1.1] Auth Bypass on Gateway](./attack_tree_paths/_g__===__a1__===__a1_1__auth_bypass_on_gateway.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker successfully bypasses the authentication mechanisms implemented at the Micro API Gateway. This could be due to flaws in the authentication logic, weak or default credentials, improper session management, or vulnerabilities in the authentication libraries used.
*   **Techniques:**
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in authentication libraries (e.g., JWT libraries).
    *   Forging authentication tokens (e.g., JWTs).
    *   Credential stuffing (using stolen credentials from other breaches).
    *   Brute-force attacks (if weak passwords are used).
    *   Session hijacking (stealing valid session tokens).
    *   Exploiting misconfigured authentication flows (e.g., improper redirect handling).
*    **Example:** An attacker finds a vulnerability in the JWT validation logic of the gateway, allowing them to craft a valid-looking JWT with arbitrary claims, granting them administrative access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[G] === [A1] === [A1.2] DoS on Gateway (Resource Exhaustion)](./attack_tree_paths/_g__===__a1__===__a1_2__dos_on_gateway__resource_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker overwhelms the Micro API Gateway with requests, consuming its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and making it unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Techniques:**
    *   Volumetric attacks (flooding the gateway with a large volume of requests).
    *   Application-layer attacks (targeting specific endpoints or functionalities with complex requests).
    *   Algorithmic complexity attacks (exploiting vulnerabilities that cause excessive resource consumption for specific inputs).
    *   Slowloris attacks (holding connections open for extended periods).
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a botnet to send a massive number of HTTP requests to the gateway, exhausting its connection pool and preventing legitimate users from accessing services.

## Attack Tree Path: [[G] === [A1] === [A1.3] Inject Malicious Requests (e.g., gRPC)](./attack_tree_paths/_g__===__a1__===__a1_3__inject_malicious_requests__e_g___grpc_.md)

*    **Description:** The attacker crafts malicious requests, specifically targeting the gRPC protocol used by Micro, to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying services. This leverages the gateway's role as a proxy, passing the malicious requests to the backend.
*    **Techniques:**
    *   Fuzzing gRPC endpoints with malformed data.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in gRPC libraries or the application's handling of gRPC messages.
    *   Injecting malicious payloads into gRPC message fields.
    *   Using gRPC-specific attack tools.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers a vulnerability in how a backend service parses a specific gRPC message field. They craft a malicious gRPC request that exploits this vulnerability, leading to remote code execution on the service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[G] === [A2] === [A2.1] Bypass Auth in Services](./attack_tree_paths/_g__===__a2__===__a2_1__bypass_auth_in_services.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker bypasses the authentication mechanisms of individual Micro services. This is particularly dangerous if services rely solely on the gateway for authentication.
*   **Techniques:**
    *   Directly accessing service endpoints (if they are exposed and not properly protected).
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the service's authentication logic (similar to A1.1, but targeting a specific service).
    *   Reusing authentication tokens obtained from other compromised services (if token validation is not properly scoped).
*   **Example:** A service relies entirely on the gateway for authentication and doesn't perform its own checks.  An attacker who bypasses the gateway (A1.1) gains direct access to the service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[G] === [A2] === [A2.3] Leverage Misconfigured Service Permissions (e.g., Leaked Secrets)](./attack_tree_paths/_g__===__a2__===__a2_3__leverage_misconfigured_service_permissions__e_g___leaked_secrets_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits misconfigured service permissions or leaked secrets (API keys, database credentials, etc.) to gain unauthorized access to resources.
*   **Techniques:**
    *   Finding exposed secrets in code repositories, configuration files, or environment variables.
    *   Exploiting overly permissive service accounts or roles.
    *   Using leaked credentials to access databases, cloud services, or other resources.
*   **Example:** A developer accidentally commits a database password to a public code repository. An attacker finds the password and uses it to access the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [[G] === [A3] === [A3.1] mTLS Failure (If Not Used) (MITM)](./attack_tree_paths/_g__===__a3__===__a3_1__mtls_failure__if_not_used___mitm_.md)

*   **Description:** If mutual TLS (mTLS) is not implemented, an attacker who gains access to the network can intercept and manipulate communication between Micro services (Man-in-the-Middle attack).
*   **Techniques:**
    *   ARP spoofing (on local networks).
    *   DNS hijacking.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in network devices.
    *   Compromising a host within the network.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises a Kubernetes node within the cluster where the Micro services are running. They use this compromised node to intercept traffic between services, stealing sensitive data or injecting malicious commands.
