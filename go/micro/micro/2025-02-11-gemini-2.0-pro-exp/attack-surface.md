# Attack Surface Analysis for micro/micro

## Attack Surface: [1. Service Registry Poisoning/Spoofing (via `micro`'s Registry Abstraction)](./attack_surfaces/1__service_registry_poisoningspoofing__via__micro_'s_registry_abstraction_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the service discovery mechanism, which `micro` directly manages through its registry abstraction, to redirect traffic or disrupt service communication.
*   **How `micro` Contributes:** `micro`'s core service discovery relies on its internal registry interface.  The framework's handling of service registration and lookup is the direct attack point.  This is *not* just about securing the underlying registry (e.g., etcd), but how `micro` *uses* it.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in how `micro` interacts with etcd (e.g., insufficient validation of responses) to register a malicious service, even if etcd itself has ACLs.
*   **Impact:** Data theft, service disruption, man-in-the-middle attacks, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Client-Side Service Validation:** Implement robust client-side validation within the `micro` application code.  Verify service identities using certificates or signatures *before* establishing RPC connections, regardless of the registry's response.  This is crucial for mitigating attacks that bypass registry-level security.
    *   **Secure Registry Interaction:** Ensure `micro`'s own interaction with the registry is secure.  Use TLS for communication with the registry *from within the micro client*.  Validate registry responses for expected formats and data.
    *   **Registry-Specific Security:** While the focus is on `micro`, also ensure the underlying registry (etcd, Consul, etc.) is properly secured with authentication, authorization, and network segmentation.

## Attack Surface: [2. Unauthorized Inter-Service Communication (via `micro`'s RPC)](./attack_surfaces/2__unauthorized_inter-service_communication__via__micro_'s_rpc_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass external security and directly access internal services using `micro`'s RPC mechanism, exploiting a lack of service-to-service authorization within the `micro` framework.
*   **How `micro` Contributes:** `micro`'s core RPC functionality is the *direct* means of communication between services.  The framework's handling of RPC requests and responses, and its enforcement (or lack thereof) of authorization, is the key vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A service built with `micro` fails to implement any authentication checks within its RPC handlers.  An attacker, having compromised another service, uses `micro`'s RPC to call this vulnerable service directly.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, remote code execution (RCE) within internal services.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Service-to-Service Authentication (within `micro`):** Implement authentication *within* the `micro` service handlers (e.g., using `micro`'s middleware or wrappers).  Use JWTs, mTLS, or other strong authentication mechanisms for *every* RPC call.  Do *not* rely solely on network-level security.
    *   **Fine-Grained Authorization (within `micro`):** Implement authorization logic *within* the `micro` service handlers to control which services can call which methods with what parameters.  Use a policy-based approach (e.g., defining roles and permissions).
    *   **Input Validation (within `micro` Handlers):**  Strictly validate *all* inputs to `micro` RPC handlers, even from other internal services.  Use well-defined schemas and reject any unexpected data.

## Attack Surface: [3. API Gateway Bypass (Exploiting `micro api`)](./attack_surfaces/3__api_gateway_bypass__exploiting__micro_api__.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers circumvent the `micro api` gateway's security, directly accessing backend services that `micro` routes through the gateway.
*   **How `micro` Contributes:** The `micro api` component is a core part of the framework, acting as the entry point for external requests.  Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations *within* the `micro api` code are the direct attack vector.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers a flaw in how the `micro api` handles authentication tokens, allowing them to forge a valid token and bypass the gateway's security checks, directly accessing a `micro` service.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized actions, privilege escalation, similar to unauthorized inter-service communication.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure `micro api` Configuration:** Thoroughly review and audit the `micro api`'s configuration, paying close attention to routing rules, authentication settings, and any custom handlers.
    *   **Input Validation (within `micro api`):** Implement strict input validation *within* the `micro api` component itself, checking headers, query parameters, and request bodies before routing requests to backend `micro` services.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the `micro api` component updated to the latest version to patch any security vulnerabilities in the `micro` codebase itself.
    * **Hardening the gateway:** Use secure coding practices when developing custom handlers or plugins for the `micro api`.

## Attack Surface: [4. Message Broker Exploitation (via `micro broker`)](./attack_surfaces/4__message_broker_exploitation__via__micro_broker__.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers compromise the message broker used by `micro broker` to intercept, inject, or disrupt messages, exploiting vulnerabilities in how `micro` interacts with the broker.
*   **How `micro` Contributes:** The `micro broker` component is the framework's abstraction for asynchronous communication.  The way `micro` publishes and subscribes to messages, and its handling of message security, is the direct vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A `micro` service using `micro broker` doesn't encrypt sensitive data in messages. An attacker gains access to the message broker and can read the unencrypted data.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, disruption of business processes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Message Handling (within `micro`):** Implement message encryption and integrity checks *within* the `micro` services that use `micro broker`.  Use TLS for communication with the broker.
    *   **Broker-Specific Security:** Ensure the underlying message broker (e.g., NATS, RabbitMQ) is properly secured, but also focus on how `micro` *uses* the broker.
    *   **Access Control (within `micro`):** Define clear access policies within your `micro` application code for which services can publish and subscribe to which topics.

## Attack Surface: [5. Insecure Configuration and Secrets Management (via `micro config`)](./attack_surfaces/5__insecure_configuration_and_secrets_management__via__micro_config__.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how `micro config` loads, stores, or manages configuration data, potentially exposing secrets.
*   **How `micro` Contributes:** `micro config` is the framework's built-in configuration management system.  If it loads secrets insecurely, or if its own access controls are weak, it becomes a direct attack vector.
*   **Example:**  A `micro` service uses `micro config` to load a database password from a plain-text file, and that file is accidentally exposed due to a misconfiguration in the service's deployment.
*   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, data breaches, unauthorized access to external services.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **External Secrets Management:**  Do *not* rely solely on `micro config` for secrets.  Use a dedicated secrets management system (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) and integrate it with `micro`.  `micro config` should only handle non-sensitive configuration.
    *   **Secure `micro config` Usage:** If using `micro config` for *any* configuration (even non-sensitive), ensure it's used securely.  Validate the source of configuration data, and implement access controls if the configuration source supports it.
    *   **Environment Variables (with `micro`):**  Use environment variables, read by `micro` at runtime, to inject secrets, rather than storing them in files managed by `micro config`.
