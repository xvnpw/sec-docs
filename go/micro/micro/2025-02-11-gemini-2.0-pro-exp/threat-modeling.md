# Threat Model Analysis for micro/micro

## Threat: [Service Impersonation via Registry Manipulation](./threats/service_impersonation_via_registry_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains write access to the service registry (e.g., Consul, etcd, or the built-in mDNS) used by `micro`. They register a malicious service with the same name as a legitimate service, or they modify an existing service entry to point to their malicious instance. This is possible due to compromised registry credentials, a vulnerability in the registry itself, or insufficient access controls.
*   **Impact:** Requests intended for the legitimate service are routed to the attacker's malicious service. The attacker can steal data, inject malicious code, disrupt service functionality, or launch further attacks.  This undermines the core service discovery mechanism of `micro`.
*   **Affected Micro Component:** Service Registry (Consul, etcd, mDNS, or any custom registry implementation). Specifically, the registration and discovery mechanisms within the `registry` package of `micro`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Registry Authentication & Authorization:** Implement robust authentication (strong passwords, multi-factor authentication) and authorization (RBAC) for the service registry. Restrict write access.
    *   **Registry Hardening:** Secure the registry server itself. Follow best practices for securing the underlying OS and the registry software (Consul, etcd). Keep the registry software updated.
    *   **Service Identity Verification (mTLS):** Enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) between *all* services. This ensures services authenticate each other before communication, preventing impersonation even if the registry is compromised. Utilize `micro`'s built-in mTLS support.
    *   **Service Discovery Validation:** Implement client-side checks to verify the identity of discovered services (e.g., comparing the service's certificate against a known good certificate).
    *   **Registry Auditing:** Enable detailed auditing on the service registry to track all registration and modification events. Monitor for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Inter-Service Message Tampering](./threats/inter-service_message_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the network between services using `micro`. They intercept and modify messages exchanged between services. This could involve altering request parameters, response data, or control messages, exploiting the lack of encryption or integrity checks in the communication.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, incorrect service behavior, unauthorized actions, and potential for further exploitation. The integrity of inter-service communication, a core aspect of `micro`'s operation, is compromised.
*   **Affected Micro Component:** Inter-service communication channels (typically using gRPC or HTTP). The `client` and `server` packages in `micro` are directly involved, as well as any underlying transport mechanisms used.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory mTLS:** Enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) for *all* inter-service communication. This encrypts the communication and verifies the identity of both client and server. Use `micro`'s built-in mTLS support.
    *   **Message Signing:** Implement message signing (e.g., digital signatures) to ensure message integrity. This allows the receiving service to verify that the message has not been tampered with. This is typically done at the application level or via a service mesh, but impacts how services interact through `micro`.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Service Registry Overload](./threats/denial_of_service_via_service_registry_overload.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the service registry used by `micro` (Consul, etcd, mDNS) with a large number of registration, deregistration, or discovery requests. This overwhelms the registry, making it unavailable.
*   **Impact:** Services are unable to discover each other, leading to widespread service disruption. New service instances cannot be registered, and existing services cannot update their status. This directly impacts `micro`'s ability to function as a distributed system.
*   **Affected Micro Component:** Service Registry (Consul, etcd, mDNS, or any custom registry). The `registry` package's API endpoints are the primary target.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting (Registry):** Implement rate limiting on the service registry's API to restrict requests from a single source.
    *   **Resource Quotas:** Configure resource quotas (memory, CPU) for the service registry.
    *   **Highly Available Registry:** Deploy the service registry in a highly available configuration (e.g., a cluster of Consul or etcd servers).
    *   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Monitor the service registry's resource usage and performance. Set up alerts for potential DoS attacks.

## Threat: [Sidecar Proxy Compromise](./threats/sidecar_proxy_compromise.md)

* **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the `micro` sidecar proxy (or any other sidecar used in conjunction with `micro`) to gain control of the proxy. This could be due to a software bug, misconfiguration, or weak credentials.  The sidecar is a key component in many `micro` deployments.
* **Impact:** The attacker can intercept, modify, or redirect traffic to and from the associated service. They could also potentially gain access to the host system or other services, depending on the sidecar's privileges. This directly impacts the security and functionality of services managed by `micro`.
* **Affected Micro Component:** The `micro` sidecar proxy (or any other sidecar proxy used).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Regular Updates:** Keep the sidecar proxy software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    * **Least Privilege:** Run the sidecar with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running it as root.
    * **Secure Configuration:** Configure the sidecar securely, following best practices.
    * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the sidecar and its associated service.
    * **Monitoring:** Monitor the sidecar's logs and resource usage.
    * **Container Security:** If running in containers, use container security best practices.
