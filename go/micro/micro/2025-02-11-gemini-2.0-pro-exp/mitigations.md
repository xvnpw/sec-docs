## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `micro` Service Registry Interactions](./mitigation_strategies/secure__micro__service_registry_interactions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure `micro` Service Registry Interactions

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **`micro` Registry Configuration:** Within your `micro` service code and configuration (e.g., using `micro.Registry(...)` options), explicitly configure the connection to your chosen service registry (Consul, etcd, etc.).
        2.  **TLS for Registry Communication:** Use the `micro` API to enable TLS for *all* communication between your services and the registry.  This involves providing the paths to the necessary certificate, key, and CA certificate files within the `micro` configuration.  Example (Go):
            ```go
            import (
                "github.com/micro/go-micro/v2/registry"
                "github.com/micro/go-micro/v2/registry/consul" // Or etcd, etc.
            )

            r := consul.NewRegistry(
                registry.Addrs("your-consul-address:8500"),
                registry.Secure(true), // Enable TLS
                registry.TLSConfig(&tls.Config{...}), // Provide TLS config
            )
            ```
        3.  **Authentication Credentials (if applicable):** If your registry requires authentication (e.g., Consul with ACLs), provide the necessary credentials (tokens, username/password) through the `micro` registry configuration.  Use environment variables or a secure configuration store, *not* hardcoded values.
        4.  **Registry-Specific Options:** Utilize any registry-specific options provided by the `micro` registry plugins (e.g., Consul, etcd) to further enhance security.  This might include setting timeouts, retry policies, or health check configurations.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Service Registration/Discovery (High Severity):** Prevents rogue services from registering or discovering legitimate services if the registry itself is compromised.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks against Registry (High Severity):** TLS encryption prevents eavesdropping and tampering with registry communication initiated by `micro`.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access to service discovery information managed by `micro`.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Service Registration/Discovery:** Risk reduced significantly (90-95%) when combined with registry-level security.  `micro`'s configuration enforces secure interaction.
        *   **MitM Attacks against Registry:** Risk reduced significantly (95-99%).  TLS encryption via `micro`'s configuration makes MitM extremely difficult.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%) when combined with registry-level authentication.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Example: TLS is enabled for Consul communication in `services/foo/main.go` using `micro.Registry` options.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Example: Authentication credentials for Consul are currently hardcoded.  We need to use environment variables.  We haven't explored all registry-specific security options.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce mTLS using `micro`](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_mtls_using__micro_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce mTLS using `micro`

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **`micro` Client and Server Configuration:** Within each `micro` service, use the `micro.Client(...)` and `micro.Server(...)` options to configure mTLS.  This involves:
            *   Specifying the paths to the service's certificate, private key, and the CA certificate.
            *   Enabling client-side certificate verification.
            *   Enabling server-side requirement for client certificates.
        2.  **Consistent Configuration:** Ensure that *all* `micro` services are consistently configured to use mTLS.  Any service not using mTLS will be unable to communicate.
        3.  **Example (Go):**
            ```go
            import (
                "github.com/micro/go-micro/v2"
                "crypto/tls"
            )

            // Server-side
            srv := micro.NewService(
                micro.Name("my.service"),
                micro.Version("latest"),
                micro.Server(
                    server.NewServer(
                        server.TLSConfig(&tls.Config{...}), // Provide TLS config with certs
                        server.RequireClientCert(), // Require client certs
                    ),
                ),
            )

            // Client-side (in another service)
            client := micro.NewService(
                micro.Client(
                    client.NewClient(
                        client.TLSConfig(&tls.Config{...}), // Provide TLS config with certs
                    ),
                ),
            )
            ```

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Service Impersonation (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from impersonating legitimate services, even if the registry is compromised.  `micro` enforces mutual authentication.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks between Services (High Severity):** Ensures that all inter-service communication managed by `micro` is encrypted and authenticated.
        *   **Unauthorized Service Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized services from communicating with legitimate services via `micro`.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Service Impersonation:** Risk reduced significantly (95-99%).  `micro`'s mTLS enforcement makes impersonation extremely difficult.
        *   **MitM Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (95-99%).  `micro`'s mTLS provides strong encryption and authentication.
        *   **Unauthorized Service Access:** Risk reduced significantly (95-99%).  Only services with valid certificates, verified by `micro`, can communicate.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Example: mTLS is partially implemented.  `micro.Server` and `micro.Client` options are used in `services/auth/main.go` and `services/user/main.go`, but not consistently across all services.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Example: We need to ensure consistent mTLS configuration across *all* `micro` services.  We also need to integrate with a certificate management system for automated renewal and revocation (this is not directly a `micro` feature, but is essential for mTLS).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `micro` API Gateway Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure__micro__api_gateway_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure `micro` API Gateway Configuration

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **`micro` API Configuration:** If you are using the `micro` API gateway (`micro api`), carefully configure its routing rules, authentication, and authorization mechanisms *using the provided `micro` flags and configuration options*.
        2.  **Authentication Handlers:** Use `micro`'s built-in authentication handlers (or create custom handlers) to integrate with your chosen authentication provider (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0).  Configure these handlers *within the `micro api` command*.  Example:
            ```bash
            micro api --handler=rpc --enable_rpc_auth=true --rpc_auth_public_key="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY" --rpc_auth_private_key="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
            ```
        3.  **Routing Rules:** Define precise routing rules to map incoming requests to the appropriate backend `micro` services.  Avoid overly permissive rules that could expose internal services unintentionally. Use the `--api_handler` and `--api_namespace` flags to control routing.
        4.  **TLS for Gateway:** Ensure that the `micro` API gateway itself is configured to use TLS for incoming client connections.  This is typically done using flags like `--api_tls_cert_file` and `--api_tls_key_file`.
        5. **CORS Configuration:** If your API is accessed from web browsers, configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) appropriately using the `--enable_cors` and related flags.  Restrict the allowed origins to only those that are trusted.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** `micro`'s authentication handlers prevent unauthorized access to backend services through the gateway.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Careful routing rules prevent unintended exposure of internal services.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks against Gateway (High Severity):** TLS configuration for the gateway itself protects client communication.
        * **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Misconfiguration (Medium Severity):** Proper CORS configuration prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced significantly (90-95%) when authentication handlers are correctly configured within `micro`.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%) with well-defined routing rules in the `micro` API configuration.
        *   **MitM Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (95-99%) with TLS enabled on the `micro` API gateway.
        * **CORS Misconfiguration:** Risk reduced significantly (90-95%) with proper CORS configuration.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Example: Basic routing rules are defined for the `micro api`.  TLS is enabled for the gateway.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Example: We need to implement a robust authentication handler (e.g., JWT) using `micro`'s authentication features.  CORS configuration is not yet implemented.  Routing rules need to be reviewed and refined.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `micro` Sidecar/Proxy](./mitigation_strategies/secure__micro__sidecarproxy.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure `micro` Sidecar/Proxy

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **`micro` Proxy Configuration:** If you are using the `micro` sidecar proxy (`micro sidecar`), configure it securely using the provided command-line flags and environment variables.
        2.  **TLS for Proxy:** Ensure that the `micro` proxy is configured to use TLS for all communication, both inbound and outbound.  Use the `--proxy_tls_cert_file`, `--proxy_tls_key_file`, and `--proxy_tls_ca_file` flags.
        3.  **Address Binding:** Carefully configure the address and port that the proxy listens on (`--proxy_address`).  Avoid binding to overly permissive addresses (e.g., `0.0.0.0`) unless absolutely necessary.
        4. **Upstream Configuration:** Configure the upstream services that the proxy connects to using the `--proxy_upstream` flag. Ensure that these upstream services are also secured (e.g., with mTLS).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** TLS configuration for the proxy ensures secure communication.
        *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Secure configuration and network policies (external to `micro`) prevent unauthorized access to the proxy.
        *   **Proxy Vulnerabilities (High to Medium Severity):** Keeping the `micro` proxy software up-to-date mitigates the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **MitM Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (95-99%) with TLS enabled on the `micro` proxy.
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%) when combined with network policies (though network policies are not a direct `micro` feature).
        *   **Proxy Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced moderately (50-70%) by keeping the `micro` proxy software updated.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Example: Basic TLS configuration is in place for the `micro` proxy.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Example: We need to review and refine the proxy's address binding and upstream configuration. We also need to ensure regular updates of the proxy software (though updates themselves are not a `micro` configuration).
