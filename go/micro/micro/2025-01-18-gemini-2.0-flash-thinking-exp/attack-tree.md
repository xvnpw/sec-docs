## Attack Tree Path: [Register Malicious Service (via Lack of Authentication on Registry Updates):](./attack_tree_paths/register_malicious_service__via_lack_of_authentication_on_registry_updates_.md)

An attacker can exploit the lack of authentication on the service registry to register a malicious service with the same name as a legitimate one. This will cause other services to mistakenly communicate with the attacker's service, potentially leading to data interception, manipulation, or service disruption. The effort is low, and the impact can be high.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Existing Service Registrations (via Lack of Authorization on Registry Updates):](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_existing_service_registrations__via_lack_of_authorization_on_registry_updates_.md)

An attacker can exploit the lack of authorization on the service registry to modify the endpoint information of existing legitimate services. This allows them to redirect traffic intended for legitimate services to their own malicious services, leading to similar consequences as registering a malicious service. The effort is low to medium, and the impact is high.

## Attack Tree Path: [Spoof Service Identity (via Lack of Mutual TLS or Weak/Missing Authentication Tokens):](./attack_tree_paths/spoof_service_identity__via_lack_of_mutual_tls_or_weakmissing_authentication_tokens_.md)

Without proper mutual TLS or strong authentication tokens, an attacker can impersonate a legitimate service. This allows them to gain unauthorized access to other services, potentially accessing sensitive data or triggering unauthorized actions. The effort is medium, and the impact is high.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (via Unencrypted Communication Channels):](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle_attacks__via_unencrypted_communication_channels_.md)

If inter-service communication is not encrypted (e.g., not using mTLS), an attacker can intercept the traffic between services. This allows them to eavesdrop on sensitive data being exchanged and potentially modify the communication, leading to data breaches or manipulation. The effort is medium, and the impact is high.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization (via vulnerabilities in the API Gateway):](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization__via_vulnerabilities_in_the_api_gateway_.md)

Attackers can exploit various vulnerabilities in the API gateway's authentication logic, insecure configurations, or lack of input validation to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to protected endpoints. This can expose sensitive data and functionality. The effort varies from low to high depending on the specific vulnerability, and the impact is high.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Configuration Data (via insecure storage or lack of access control):](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_configuration_data__via_insecure_storage_or_lack_of_access_control_.md)

If configuration secrets are stored insecurely or access to configuration sources is not properly controlled, attackers can easily retrieve sensitive information like database credentials or API keys. This can lead to a complete compromise of backend systems. The effort is low to medium, and the impact is critical.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Configuration Parameters (via lack of authentication/authorization on updates):](./attack_tree_paths/modify_configuration_parameters__via_lack_of_authenticationauthorization_on_updates_.md)

If configuration updates are not properly authenticated or authorized, an attacker can modify configuration settings to alter service behavior. This can be used to introduce vulnerabilities, disrupt services, or gain further access. The effort is low to medium, and the impact is high.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized Access to Control Plane (via weak/default credentials or lack of authentication):](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_access_to_control_plane__via_weakdefault_credentials_or_lack_of_authentication_.md)

Exploiting weak or default credentials or the lack of authentication on the control plane grants attackers administrative access to the entire Micro infrastructure. This allows them to perform any administrative action, including deploying malicious services, altering configurations, and potentially taking down the entire application. The effort is low, and the impact is critical.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Control Plane Functionality:](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_control_plane_functionality.md)

Once an attacker has gained access to the control plane (through the previous high-risk path), they can use legitimate control plane commands for malicious purposes. This could include deploying rogue services, reconfiguring existing services to be vulnerable, or exfiltrating information. The effort is medium, and the impact is critical.
