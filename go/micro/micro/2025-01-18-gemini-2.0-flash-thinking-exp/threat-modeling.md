# Threat Model Analysis for micro/micro

## Threat: [Malicious Service Registration](./threats/malicious_service_registration.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Service Registration
    *   **Description:** An attacker leverages the Micro/Micro service discovery mechanism to register a rogue service with the same name as a legitimate service. When other services attempt to discover and communicate with the legitimate service, they are instead directed to the attacker's service. The attacker can then intercept requests, steal data, or inject malicious responses.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, disruption of service functionality, potential for further attacks by compromising inter-service communication.
    *   **Affected Component:** Service Registry (registration functionality)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement service authentication and authorization for service registration within the Micro/Micro framework.
        *   Utilize secure registration protocols (e.g., leveraging mTLS for registry communication if supported by the deployment environment).
        *   Regularly monitor the service registry for unexpected or suspicious registrations using Micro/Micro's observability features or external monitoring tools.
        *   Implement mechanisms within the application to verify the identity of services during discovery based on metadata provided by the Micro/Micro registry.

## Threat: [Service Registry Data Tampering](./threats/service_registry_data_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** Service Registry Data Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the underlying storage or API of the Micro/Micro service registry (e.g., etcd, Consul) and modifies the metadata associated with services, such as their endpoints or health status. This can lead to misdirection of traffic, denial of service, or the execution of code on unintended services.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, incorrect routing of requests within the Micro/Micro ecosystem, potential for remote code execution if endpoints are maliciously altered, data integrity issues within the service registry.
    *   **Affected Component:** Service Registry (data storage and modification, potentially interacting with underlying storage like etcd or Consul)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls and authentication for accessing and modifying the service registry's underlying data store, independent of Micro/Micro.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data stored in the service registry's backing store.
        *   Utilize audit logging provided by the underlying service registry implementation to track changes.
        *   Consider using a distributed and replicated service registry for increased resilience against tampering.

## Threat: [Insecure Inter-Service Communication (Eavesdropping)](./threats/insecure_inter-service_communication__eavesdropping_.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Inter-Service Communication (Eavesdropping)
    *   **Description:** Communication between microservices managed by Micro/Micro is not properly encrypted. An attacker on the network can eavesdrop on the traffic facilitated by Micro/Micro's RPC framework and intercept sensitive data being exchanged between services, such as authentication tokens, user data, or business-critical information.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data transmitted via Micro/Micro's communication mechanisms, potential for identity theft or further attacks using intercepted credentials.
    *   **Affected Component:** RPC Framework (transport layer used by Micro/Micro)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS (Transport Layer Security) for all inter-service communication managed by Micro/Micro. Configure Micro/Micro to require TLS.
        *   Ensure proper certificate management and validation is configured within the Micro/Micro environment.
        *   Avoid transmitting sensitive data in request parameters; use request bodies with encryption when using Micro/Micro's RPC.

## Threat: [Insecure Inter-Service Communication (Man-in-the-Middle)](./threats/insecure_inter-service_communication__man-in-the-middle_.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Inter-Service Communication (Man-in-the-Middle)
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between two microservices managed by Micro/Micro and can not only eavesdrop but also modify the messages in transit before forwarding them to the intended recipient. This can lead to data corruption, unauthorized actions triggered through Micro/Micro's RPC, or the injection of malicious payloads.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise within the Micro/Micro service mesh, unauthorized modification of data or system state through manipulated RPC calls, potential for remote code execution if malicious payloads are injected via Micro/Micro's communication.
    *   **Affected Component:** RPC Framework (transport layer used by Micro/Micro)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) for inter-service communication within the Micro/Micro framework, ensuring both the client and server authenticate each other. Configure Micro/Micro to enforce mTLS.
        *   Implement message signing or encryption at the application layer on top of Micro/Micro's RPC to verify integrity and authenticity, providing an additional layer of security.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access via CLI Tools](./threats/unauthorized_access_via_cli_tools.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access via CLI Tools
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Micro/Micro CLI tools with legitimate or compromised credentials. They can then use the CLI to manage and potentially compromise the application's infrastructure managed by Micro/Micro, such as deploying malicious services, modifying service configurations within Micro/Micro, or accessing sensitive information exposed through CLI commands.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application and its infrastructure managed by Micro/Micro, data breaches through access to service information or logs, service disruption through malicious deployments or configuration changes.
    *   **Affected Component:** CLI Tools (authentication and authorization within the Micro/Micro ecosystem)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the Micro/Micro CLI tools.
        *   Use role-based access control (RBAC) within the Micro/Micro environment to limit the actions users can perform with the CLI.
        *   Securely store and manage CLI credentials used to interact with the Micro/Micro platform.
        *   Audit CLI usage to detect suspicious activity within the Micro/Micro management plane.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Exploitation](./threats/malicious_plugin_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An application utilizes a malicious or vulnerable plugin within the Micro/Micro framework's plugin system. An attacker can exploit vulnerabilities in these plugins to gain unauthorized access to the Micro/Micro platform or the services running within it, potentially executing arbitrary code or compromising the application's functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the plugin's capabilities and the vulnerabilities present, including data breaches, remote code execution within the Micro/Micro environment, and denial of service affecting services managed by Micro/Micro.
    *   **Affected Component:** Plugin System (plugin loading and execution within Micro/Micro)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit all third-party plugins before integrating them with the Micro/Micro framework.
        *   Implement a secure plugin loading mechanism within Micro/Micro with proper sandboxing and permission controls to limit plugin capabilities.
        *   Regularly update plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Minimize the number of plugins used and only install necessary ones within the Micro/Micro environment.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data
    *   **Description:** Configuration files or environment variables used by Micro/Micro components or services managed by Micro/Micro contain sensitive information (e.g., database credentials used by services, API keys for external services, secrets for inter-service authentication). If these are not properly protected, they can be accessed by unauthorized individuals.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials used within the Micro/Micro ecosystem, allowing attackers to access databases, external services, or other protected resources used by the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration Management (how Micro/Micro services and components are configured)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files or environment variables used by Micro/Micro services.
        *   Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) and integrate them with your Micro/Micro deployment.
        *   Encrypt sensitive configuration data at rest and in transit, especially when managed by Micro/Micro's configuration mechanisms.
        *   Implement strict access controls on configuration files and environment variables used by Micro/Micro components.
