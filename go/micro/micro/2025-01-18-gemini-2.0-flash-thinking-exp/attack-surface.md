# Attack Surface Analysis for micro/micro

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Service Registry Access](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_service_registry_access.md)

**Description:**  Unauthorized access to the service registry allows attackers to view, modify, or delete service registrations.

**How Micro Contributes:** Micro's central registry is a critical component for service discovery. If the registry's access controls are weak or non-existent, it becomes a prime target. Micro's default setup might not enforce strong authentication on registry operations.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the registry and registers a malicious service with the same name as a legitimate one. Subsequent requests intended for the legitimate service are routed to the attacker's service, potentially leading to data theft or manipulation.

**Impact:** Service disruption, data breaches, man-in-the-middle attacks, and the introduction of malicious services into the application ecosystem.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement strong authentication and authorization for registry access. Micro supports different registry implementations, ensure the chosen one is configured with proper access controls (e.g., using ACLs or RBAC).
- Use secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS) for communication with the registry.
- Regularly audit registry access logs.
- Consider using a dedicated, hardened registry instance.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Unauthorised Broker Communication](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_unauthorised_broker_communication.md)

**Description:** Lack of proper authentication and authorization on the message broker allows attackers to publish or subscribe to arbitrary topics.

**How Micro Contributes:** Micro's broker facilitates asynchronous communication between services. If the broker isn't secured, attackers can inject malicious messages or eavesdrop on sensitive data being exchanged. Micro's default broker setup might not enforce authentication.

**Example:** An attacker publishes a malicious message to a topic that triggers a vulnerable service to perform an unintended action, such as deleting data or executing arbitrary code. Alternatively, they subscribe to a topic containing sensitive user data and exfiltrate it.

**Impact:** Data breaches, service disruption, manipulation of application state, and potential for remote code execution if a subscribing service is vulnerable.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Enable and enforce authentication and authorization on the broker. Micro supports various broker implementations; configure them to require authentication for publishing and subscribing.
- Use secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS) for broker connections.
- Implement message signing or encryption to ensure message integrity and confidentiality.
- Restrict topic access based on service roles and permissions.

## Attack Surface: [API Gateway Route Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/api_gateway_route_manipulation.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the API gateway's routing configuration allow attackers to redirect traffic to malicious endpoints or bypass security controls.

**How Micro Contributes:** Micro's API gateway acts as the entry point for external requests. If the routing rules are not carefully managed or if there are vulnerabilities in how routes are defined or processed, attackers can exploit this.

**Example:** An attacker manipulates the routing configuration (if access is compromised) or exploits a vulnerability in the gateway's route matching logic to redirect requests intended for a secure endpoint to a malicious service that logs credentials or injects malicious content.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to backend services, and the ability to serve malicious content to users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Secure access to the API gateway's configuration. Implement strong authentication and authorization for managing routes.
- Carefully validate and sanitize route definitions. Avoid using user-supplied input directly in route definitions.
- Implement robust input validation and sanitization at the gateway level.
- Regularly review and audit API gateway routing configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Inter-Service Communication (RPC)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_inter-service_communication__rpc_.md)

**Description:** Lack of authentication and authorization between microservices allows unauthorized services to invoke methods on other services.

**How Micro Contributes:** Micro promotes a microservices architecture where services communicate via RPC. If these internal communications are not secured, it creates an opportunity for malicious services or compromised services to attack others.

**Example:** A compromised service or a rogue service within the network can directly call methods on a sensitive service (e.g., a payment processing service) without proper authorization, potentially leading to unauthorized transactions.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized actions, and the potential for cascading failures across the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for inter-service communication. This ensures both the client and server authenticate each other.
- Use a service mesh (like Istio, which integrates well with Micro) to enforce authentication and authorization policies between services.
- Implement robust authorization checks within each service to verify the identity and permissions of the calling service.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Micro Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_micro_plugins.md)

**Description:**  Security flaws in third-party or custom plugins used with Micro can introduce vulnerabilities into the application.

**How Micro Contributes:** Micro's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality. However, if these plugins are not developed securely or contain known vulnerabilities, they can be exploited.

**Example:** A poorly written plugin has a vulnerability that allows for remote code execution. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain control of the Micro instance or the underlying server.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the Micro instance and potentially the underlying infrastructure, data breaches, and service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Thoroughly vet and audit all third-party plugins before using them.
- Follow secure coding practices when developing custom plugins.
- Keep plugins up-to-date with the latest security patches.
- Implement a mechanism for isolating or sandboxing plugins to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Micro CLI or Web UI without Proper Authentication](./attack_surfaces/exposed_micro_cli_or_web_ui_without_proper_authentication.md)

**Description:**  If the Micro CLI or Web UI is accessible without strong authentication, attackers can gain administrative control over the Micro instance.

**How Micro Contributes:** Micro provides a CLI and a Web UI for managing and monitoring the platform. If these interfaces are exposed without proper authentication, they become a direct entry point for attackers.

**Example:** An attacker accesses the unsecured Micro Web UI and uses it to deploy malicious services, reconfigure the system, or access sensitive information.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Micro instance, including the ability to deploy malicious code, access sensitive data, and disrupt services.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the Micro CLI and Web UI.
- Restrict access to these interfaces to trusted networks or individuals.
- Use HTTPS to encrypt communication with the Web UI.
- Regularly review and audit access logs for the CLI and Web UI.
