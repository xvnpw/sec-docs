## 5. Data Flow Details (Security Enhanced)

The typical request flow and asynchronous communication flows described previously are still valid, but now with a stronger emphasis on security at each step.  Every communication channel should be considered for encryption (TLS/mTLS), and every component interaction should be subject to authentication and authorization.

## 6. Technology Stack Overview (Security Considerations)

The technology stack choices have significant security implications. Choosing secure and well-maintained technologies is crucial.  For example:

*   **Protocol Buffers:**  Efficient and well-defined serialization format, reducing parsing vulnerabilities compared to less structured formats.
*   **Pluggable Components:**  While offering flexibility, pluggable components introduce the risk of vulnerabilities in the chosen implementations. Careful selection and security assessment of pluggable components are essential.  For example, choosing a well-vetted and actively maintained message broker like RabbitMQ or Kafka is preferable to a less mature or unmaintained option.

*   **Secrets Management:**  Use Kubernetes Secrets or external secrets management solutions to securely manage secrets. Enable encryption at rest for Secrets.
*   **Image Security Scanning:**  Integrate image scanning into CI/CD pipelines to identify vulnerabilities in container images before deployment.
*   **Audit Logging:**  Enable Kubernetes audit logging to track API activity and detect suspicious behavior.
