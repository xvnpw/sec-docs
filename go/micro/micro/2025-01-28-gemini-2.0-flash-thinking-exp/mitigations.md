# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for micro/micro

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Authentication and Authorization for Service Registration and Discovery within `micro`](./mitigation_strategies/implement_authentication_and_authorization_for_service_registration_and_discovery_within__micro_.md)

### Description:
1.  **Leverage `micro` Registry Authentication Plugins:** Explore and utilize `micro`'s plugin ecosystem for registry authentication.  This might involve plugins for Consul ACLs, Etcd authentication, or custom authentication mechanisms.
2.  **Configure `micro server` with Authentication Flags:**  When starting the `micro server`, use flags to enable and configure authentication for service registration and discovery.  Refer to `micro server` documentation for available flags related to registry authentication.
3.  **Modify Microservice Code to Handle Authentication:** Ensure microservices are configured to authenticate with the registry during startup and discovery processes. This might involve setting environment variables or configuration files that `micro` libraries use to handle authentication.
4.  **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using `micro` Features or Plugins:** If `micro` or its registry plugins support RBAC, define roles and permissions to control which services can register and discover other services.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   Unauthorized Service Registration via `micro server` or direct registry access (High Severity) - Malicious actors using `micro` tools or directly interacting with the registry to register rogue services.
*   Unauthorized Service Discovery by compromised `micro` services (Medium Severity) - Compromised services within the `micro` ecosystem gaining unauthorized knowledge of other services.
*   Service Registry Manipulation via `micro` commands (High Severity) - Attackers using compromised `micro` control plane access to manipulate service registry data.

### Impact:
*   Unauthorized Service Registration: High Risk Reduction
*   Unauthorized Service Discovery: Medium Risk Reduction
*   Service Registry Manipulation: High Risk Reduction

### Currently Implemented:
No specific `micro` level authentication or authorization is implemented for service registration and discovery. Reliance is on network security and basic infrastructure access control.

### Missing Implementation:
`micro server` is not configured with registry authentication. Microservices are not explicitly authenticating during registration or discovery within the `micro` framework. `micro` RBAC features (if available via plugins or core) are not utilized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure the `micro api` Gateway with Robust Authentication and Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/secure_the__micro_api__gateway_with_robust_authentication_and_authorization.md)

### Description:
1.  **Utilize `micro api` Authentication Middleware:**  Leverage `micro api`'s middleware capabilities to implement authentication.  This can involve writing custom middleware or using existing middleware plugins for protocols like JWT, OAuth 2.0, or API Keys.
2.  **Configure `micro api` with Authentication Flags:**  Explore `micro api` command-line flags or configuration options to enable and configure built-in authentication mechanisms if available.
3.  **Implement Authorization Logic within `micro api` Middleware:**  Extend or create middleware in `micro api` to enforce authorization policies. This can involve checking user roles or permissions against API endpoint access requirements.
4.  **Secure `micro api` Configuration Files:**  Ensure `micro api` configuration files (if used) are securely stored and accessed, protecting any sensitive credentials or configuration parameters.

### Description:
1.  **Configure `micro` Services for gRPC with TLS:**  `micro` services often use gRPC for communication. Configure gRPC servers and clients within `micro` services to use TLS encryption.
2.  **Enable mTLS in `micro` gRPC Configuration:**  Extend the TLS configuration to enable mutual TLS, requiring both client and server to present certificates for authentication during the TLS handshake.
3.  **Utilize `micro` Service Discovery with mTLS Context:**  Ensure that when services discover each other through `micro`'s service discovery, the connection context includes the necessary mTLS certificates and configuration.
4.  **Manage Certificates within `micro` Deployment:**  Establish a secure process for generating, distributing, and rotating TLS certificates for `micro` services. Consider using tools that integrate with `micro` deployments (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets, Vault).

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Inter-Service Communication within `micro` (High Severity) - Eavesdropping and manipulation of data exchanged between `micro` services.
*   Service Impersonation within the `micro` ecosystem (High Severity) - Malicious services or attackers impersonating legitimate `micro` services.

### Impact:
*   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Inter-Service Communication: High Risk Reduction
*   Service Impersonation: High Risk Reduction

### Currently Implemented:
TLS encryption is enabled for external access via API Gateway, but not for internal `micro` service communication.

### Missing Implementation:
mTLS is not configured for gRPC communication between `micro` services. `micro` services are not currently authenticating each other using certificates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting and Throttling at the `micro api` Gateway](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_and_throttling_at_the__micro_api__gateway.md)

### Description:
