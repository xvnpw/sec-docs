# Threat Model Analysis for micro/micro

## Threat: [Service Registry Poisoning](./threats/service_registry_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the service registry (e.g., Consul, Etcd) to register malicious service endpoints or modify legitimate ones. This could redirect service requests intended for a genuine service to a rogue service controlled by the attacker. The attacker could then intercept sensitive data, disrupt service functionality, or launch further attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, data compromise, unauthorized access to services and data, potential for lateral movement within the system.
    *   **Affected Micro Component:** Service Registry (Consul, Etcd, Kubernetes DNS - interaction managed by micro)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for all registry access.
        *   Use TLS/SSL encryption for communication between services and the registry.
        *   Regularly audit the service registry for unauthorized or suspicious entries.
        *   Employ network segmentation to restrict access to the registry from untrusted networks.
        *   Utilize registry access control lists (ACLs) to limit who can register and modify service entries.

## Threat: [Service Registry Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/service_registry_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could overwhelm the service registry with a flood of requests, exploiting vulnerabilities in the registry software, or simply exhausting its resources. This could lead to the registry becoming unavailable, disrupting service discovery and causing cascading failures across the microservices application as services can no longer locate each other.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, application unavailability, cascading failures across services.
    *   **Affected Micro Component:** Service Registry (Consul, Etcd, Kubernetes DNS - interaction managed by micro)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling for access to the service registry.
        *   Ensure the registry infrastructure is highly available, resilient, and scalable.
        *   Monitor registry performance and availability proactively.
        *   Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms for the service registry.

## Threat: [Unencrypted Inter-Service Communication](./threats/unencrypted_inter-service_communication.md)

*   **Description:** If TLS/SSL is not enabled for inter-service communication within `micro/micro`, an attacker positioned on the network could eavesdrop on the traffic between services. This allows them to intercept sensitive data being transmitted, such as user credentials, personal information, or business-critical data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive information, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks to modify data in transit.
    *   **Affected Micro Component:**  `micro/micro` runtime, communication libraries (gRPC, HTTP handlers)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce TLS/SSL:** Mandate TLS/SSL for all inter-service communication within the `micro/micro` application.
        *   **Configure `micro/micro` for TLS:** Properly configure `micro/micro` and its underlying communication libraries to use TLS/SSL by default.
        *   **Mutual TLS (mTLS):** Consider implementing mTLS for stronger authentication and authorization between services.

## Threat: [Service Impersonation/Spoofing](./threats/service_impersonationspoofing.md)

*   **Description:** Without proper authentication between services, a malicious service or attacker could impersonate a legitimate service. This allows them to send requests to other services as if they were a trusted component, potentially gaining unauthorized access to data or triggering actions they should not be permitted to perform.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to services and data, data manipulation, potential for privilege escalation and further attacks.
    *   **Affected Micro Component:** `micro/micro` runtime, service-to-service communication mechanisms
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Service Authentication:** Use robust service-to-service authentication mechanisms like API keys, JWTs, or mTLS.
        *   **Authorization Policies:** Define and enforce clear authorization policies to control access between services.
        *   **Least Privilege Principle:** Grant each service only the necessary permissions to interact with other services.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Audit service communication patterns and access controls.

## Threat: [API Gateway Misconfiguration](./threats/api_gateway_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:**  An incorrectly configured API Gateway (Micro API) can expose internal services directly to the internet without proper security controls. Misconfigured routing rules, lack of input validation, or disabled security features can create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to bypass intended security measures and access backend services directly.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal services, data breaches, potential for service disruption or compromise of backend systems.
    *   **Affected Micro Component:** Micro API (API Gateway module)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Configuration Review:** Thoroughly review and test API Gateway configurations before deployment and after any changes.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only expose necessary services and endpoints through the API Gateway.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization at the API Gateway to prevent injection attacks.
        *   **Regular Penetration Testing:** Conduct penetration testing to identify and remediate API Gateway misconfigurations.

## Threat: [API Gateway Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./threats/api_gateway_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the API Gateway's authentication or authorization mechanisms could allow attackers to bypass security controls. This could be due to flaws in the authentication logic, weak password policies, or vulnerabilities in the underlying authentication libraries. Successful bypass allows attackers to access protected services without valid credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal services, data breaches, potential for complete compromise of backend systems.
    *   **Affected Micro Component:** Micro API (API Gateway module), Authentication/Authorization middleware
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication Mechanisms:** Implement robust authentication methods at the API Gateway (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect).
        *   **Centralized Authorization:** Utilize a centralized authorization service or policy engine for consistent access control.
        *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically focused on the API Gateway's authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   **Keep Authentication Libraries Updated:** Ensure that all authentication and authorization libraries used by the API Gateway are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
