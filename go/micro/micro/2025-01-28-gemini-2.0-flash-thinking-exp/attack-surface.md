# Attack Surface Analysis for micro/micro

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Service Registry](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_service_registry.md)

*   **Description:** Lack of proper authentication and authorization on the service registry, which is essential for `micro` service discovery, allows unauthorized access and modification of service metadata.
*   **Micro Contribution:** `micro`'s core functionality *relies* on a service registry (Consul, etcd, Kubernetes).  If this registry, which `micro` is configured to use, is unsecured, it directly impacts the security of the entire `micro` ecosystem. `micro`'s service discovery mechanism is immediately vulnerable if the registry is compromised.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits the lack of authentication on a Consul registry used by a `micro` application. They register a malicious service under the same name as a legitimate microservice. When other `micro` services use `micro`'s service discovery to find and communicate with the intended service, they are instead directed to the attacker's malicious service, enabling data interception or service disruption.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, data interception, data manipulation, complete compromise of microservices architecture.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Authentication and Authorization:**  Configure the service registry (Consul, etcd, Kubernetes) to enforce authentication and authorization for all access. This is crucial for securing the foundation of `micro`'s service discovery.
    *   **Use TLS Encryption:** Encrypt communication between `micro` services and the service registry using TLS. This protects sensitive service metadata during discovery and registration processes within the `micro` framework.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to `micro` services and administrative users accessing the registry. Limit access based on the principle of least privilege to minimize the impact of compromised accounts within the `micro` environment.

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Broker Communication](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_broker_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between `micro` services via the message broker is not encrypted, allowing for eavesdropping and message manipulation during inter-service communication facilitated by `micro`.
*   **Micro Contribution:** `micro`'s asynchronous communication model heavily utilizes a message broker (NATS, RabbitMQ, Kafka).  If this communication channel, which `micro` manages for inter-service messaging, is unencrypted, it directly exposes sensitive data exchanged between `micro` services. `micro`'s default setup might not enforce encryption, requiring developers to explicitly configure it.
*   **Example:** `micro` services are configured to communicate using NATS without TLS. An attacker on the network intercepts messages exchanged between `micro` services via the broker. These messages contain sensitive business data or authentication tokens being passed between services within the `micro` application.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data theft, message manipulation, potential for replay attacks impacting the integrity of `micro` service interactions.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable TLS Encryption:** Configure the message broker (NATS, RabbitMQ, Kafka) and explicitly configure `micro` services to use TLS encryption for all broker communication. This is essential for securing inter-service communication within the `micro` framework.
    *   **Mutual TLS (mTLS):** Consider using mTLS for stronger authentication and authorization between `micro` services communicating via the broker. This adds an extra layer of security to `micro`'s inter-service communication.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the message broker and `micro` services network to reduce the attack surface and limit potential eavesdropping points. This complements encryption by limiting physical access to the communication channels used by `micro`.

## Attack Surface: [API Gateway Bypass due to Misconfiguration (Micro API)](./attack_surfaces/api_gateway_bypass_due_to_misconfiguration__micro_api_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured routing rules in the `micro api` gateway component allow attackers to bypass the gateway and directly access backend `micro` services, circumventing intended security controls.
*   **Micro Contribution:** `micro api` *is* the API Gateway component provided by the `micro` framework. Misconfigurations in its routing, which is a core feature of `micro api`, directly lead to this attack surface.  The flexibility of `micro api` routing can become a vulnerability if not meticulously configured.
*   **Example:**  `micro api` is set up to route `/api/orders` to the `orders-service`. However, a misconfiguration in the `micro api` routing rules, perhaps due to a wildcard or overly permissive path matching, allows a request to `/orders-service/debug/metrics` to bypass the intended gateway security and directly reach the `orders-service` internal metrics endpoint, exposing sensitive operational data.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of backend `micro` services, circumvention of security controls implemented at the `micro api` gateway, unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities within `micro` services.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Routing Rules in Micro API:** Define precise and restrictive routing rules within the `micro api` configuration. Ensure only intended paths are exposed and correctly routed to backend `micro` services.
    *   **Regular Configuration Review of Micro API:** Regularly review and audit `micro api` configurations to identify and correct any misconfigurations or overly permissive rules that could lead to bypass vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for API Exposure:** Only expose necessary endpoints through the `micro api` gateway. Restrict direct access to backend `micro` services and internal endpoints.
    *   **Input Validation at Micro API Gateway:** Implement robust input validation at the `micro api` gateway level to filter out potentially malicious requests before they are routed to backend `micro` services.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Credential Management with `micro` CLI](./attack_surfaces/insecure_credential_management_with__micro__cli.md)

*   **Description:** Storing or handling credentials for the `micro` CLI insecurely can lead to unauthorized access and management of the entire `micro` services infrastructure.
*   **Micro Contribution:** The `micro` CLI is the primary tool for interacting with and managing `micro` services. Compromising `micro` CLI credentials directly grants access to manage and potentially disrupt the entire `micro` application environment.  `micro` CLI's security is directly tied to how users manage the credentials it uses.
*   **Example:** A developer stores registry credentials in plain text within a `micro` CLI configuration file. This file is inadvertently exposed (e.g., through a backup or insecure file sharing). An attacker obtains these credentials and uses the `micro` CLI to deregister critical services, causing a denial of service for the entire `micro` application.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to `micro` services infrastructure, service disruption, data manipulation, potential for complete compromise of the `micro` environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials in Micro CLI Configurations:** Never hardcode credentials directly in `micro` CLI configuration files or scripts.
    *   **Use Environment Variables or Secrets Management for Micro CLI:** Store `micro` CLI credentials as environment variables or utilize dedicated secrets management tools (like HashiCorp Vault) and securely access them when using the `micro` CLI.
    *   **Secure Access to Micro CLI Environments:** Restrict access to machines where the `micro` CLI is installed and used. Implement strong user authentication and authorization for these environments.
    *   **Regularly Rotate Micro CLI Credentials:** Rotate credentials used with the `micro` CLI on a regular schedule to limit the window of opportunity in case of credential compromise.
