### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Micro

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the `micro/micro` framework.

*   **Threat:** Service Registry Spoofing
    *   **Description:** A malicious actor could leverage the `go-micro` client library's service registration functionality to register a fake service with the same name as a legitimate service in the service registry. The API Gateway or other services, using `go-micro` for service discovery, might then mistakenly route traffic to the malicious service, allowing the attacker to intercept requests, steal data, or perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, service disruption, potential compromise of other services.
    *   **Affected Component:** Service Registry (interaction via `go-micro`), Service Registration functionality within `go-micro`, Service Discovery within `go-micro`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize the built-in security features of the chosen service registry (e.g., Consul ACLs, Etcd RBAC) and configure `go-micro` to enforce these.
        *   Implement strong authentication for service registration within the `go-micro` service code. Services should authenticate themselves to the registry using secure credentials managed by `go-micro`'s plugins or custom solutions.
        *   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for service registration and discovery, leveraging `go-micro`'s transport and registry plugins.
        *   Implement mechanisms for verifying the identity and integrity of registered services beyond basic name matching.

*   **Threat:** Insecure CLI Credential Management
    *   **Description:** If the credentials used by the `micro` CLI (which is part of the `micro/micro` project) are stored insecurely (e.g., in plain text files, default passwords), an attacker could compromise these credentials and gain control over the application's infrastructure managed by `micro`.
    *   **Impact:** Full infrastructure compromise, ability to deploy malicious services, data manipulation, service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** `micro` CLI, configuration files used by the `micro` CLI.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store `micro` CLI credentials securely using credential management tools or secrets managers, integrating with `micro`'s configuration mechanisms.
        *   Avoid storing credentials directly in `micro` configuration files.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for `micro` CLI access, if supported by the authentication provider used with `micro`.
        *   Regularly rotate `micro` CLI credentials.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Service Deployment via Compromised CLI
    *   **Description:** An attacker who has compromised the `micro` CLI (part of the `micro/micro` project) could use its deployment functionalities to deploy malicious services into the infrastructure managed by `micro`. These services could be designed to steal data, disrupt operations, or launch attacks against other systems.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, service disruption, lateral movement within the infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Component:** `micro` CLI, Service Deployment functionality within `micro`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the `micro` CLI as described above.
        *   Implement code review and security scanning processes for all service deployments initiated through the `micro` CLI.
        *   Utilize container image scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in images deployed via `micro`.
        *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) within the `micro` environment to restrict who can deploy services.

*   **Threat:** Lack of Transport Layer Security for Inter-Service Communication (using `go-micro`)
    *   **Description:** If services communicate with each other using the `go-micro` client library without enabling TLS, an attacker could eavesdrop on network traffic between services. They could intercept sensitive data like user credentials, API keys, or business-critical information being exchanged through `go-micro`'s communication mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data exfiltration, potential compromise of user accounts or internal systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** `go-micro` client library, Transport implementations within `go-micro` (e.g., gRPC, HTTP).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure the `go-micro` transport (e.g., gRPC, HTTP) to use TLS for all inter-service communication.
        *   Utilize mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication between services using `go-micro`'s transport options.
        *   Ensure proper certificate management and rotation for services using `go-micro`.

*   **Threat:** API Gateway Authentication/Authorization Bypass due to Misconfiguration (involving `go-api`)
    *   **Description:** If the API Gateway, potentially built using `go-api` (part of the `micro/micro` ecosystem), is misconfigured, attackers might be able to bypass authentication or authorization checks. This could allow unauthorized access to internal services and their functionalities exposed through the gateway.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality, potential for data manipulation or service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** API Gateway (specifically authentication and authorization middleware or handlers within `go-api`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test the API Gateway's authentication and authorization configurations.
        *   Utilize well-vetted and secure authentication and authorization middleware provided by `go-api` or integrate with established identity providers.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring access controls on the API Gateway.
        *   Regularly audit the API Gateway's configuration for potential vulnerabilities.
