# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for micro/micro

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Service Registry Access](./mitigation_strategies/secure_service_registry_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Registry Authentication:** Configure your chosen service registry backend (Consul, Etcd, Kubernetes) to enforce authentication. `micro/micro` services will need to provide credentials to interact with the registry. Refer to your registry backend's documentation for specific authentication methods (ACL tokens for Consul, RBAC for Kubernetes, etc.).
    2.  **Configure Micro Client with Authentication:** When initializing the registry client in your `micro/micro` services, provide the necessary authentication credentials. This might involve setting environment variables or configuration options that `micro/micro` uses to authenticate with the registry. For example, with Consul, you might need to set `MICRO_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` and `MICRO_REGISTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`.
    3.  **Restrict Registry Network Access:** Ensure the service registry is not publicly accessible.  Restrict network access to the registry to only the necessary microservices and administrative components within your infrastructure. Use firewalls or network policies to enforce these restrictions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Service Registration (Severity: High): Malicious services or actors registering themselves in the registry, potentially disrupting service discovery and routing within the `micro/micro` application.
    *   Unauthorized Service Discovery (Severity: Medium): Unauthorized parties gaining access to the service registry and discovering the topology and endpoints of your microservices, potentially revealing sensitive information about your application architecture.
    *   Registry Data Tampering (Severity: High): Unauthorized modification or deletion of service registry data, leading to service outages, incorrect routing, or denial of service within the `micro/micro` application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Service Registration: High reduction - Prevents rogue services from interfering with the `micro/micro` service mesh.
    *   Unauthorized Service Discovery: Moderate reduction - Limits exposure of internal service details to unauthorized entities.
    *   Registry Data Tampering: High reduction - Protects the integrity and reliability of service discovery, a core function of `micro/micro`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Consul registry is used with ACL tokens enabled. `MICRO_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` and `MICRO_REGISTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` are set in service deployment configurations.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  More granular access control policies within Consul based on service identity are not fully implemented. Currently, a single token is used for all services, limiting fine-grained authorization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enhance Inter-Service Communication Security with Mutual TLS (mTLS) in Micro Transport](./mitigation_strategies/enhance_inter-service_communication_security_with_mutual_tls__mtls__in_micro_transport.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate TLS Certificates for Services:** Create TLS certificates and private keys for each `micro/micro` service.  These certificates will be used for service identity and encryption. Consider using a Certificate Authority (CA) for easier management.
    2.  **Configure Micro Transport for TLS with Certificates:**  Configure the `micro/micro` transport layer (gRPC or HTTP) to use TLS and specify the paths to the service's certificate and private key. This is typically done through `micro/micro` configuration options or environment variables. For example, using gRPC transport, you might configure TLS options when creating the gRPC server and client.
    3.  **Enable Client Certificate Verification (mTLS):** Configure the server-side transport in each `micro/micro` service to require and verify client certificates. This ensures that only services presenting valid certificates (i.e., other authorized `micro/micro` services) can establish connections.
    4.  **Enforce TLS for All Internal Communication:** Ensure that all service-to-service communication within your `micro/micro` application is configured to use TLS and mTLS. Disable or restrict non-TLS communication channels to enforce secure communication.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Service Communication (Severity: High): Attackers intercepting communication between `micro/micro` services to eavesdrop on data or inject malicious payloads.
    *   Service Impersonation within Microservices (Severity: High): Malicious services or compromised components impersonating legitimate `micro/micro` services to gain unauthorized access or disrupt operations within the application.
    *   Data Eavesdropping on Inter-Service Traffic (Severity: High): Sensitive data transmitted between `micro/micro` services being intercepted and read by unauthorized parties on the network.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: High reduction - Makes MITM attacks on inter-service communication significantly more difficult within the `micro/micro` environment.
    *   Service Impersonation: High reduction - Prevents unauthorized services from impersonating legitimate ones within the `micro/micro` ecosystem.
    *   Data Eavesdropping: High reduction - Encrypts communication between `micro/micro` services, protecting data in transit.
*   **Currently Implemented:** TLS is enabled for gRPC transport using self-signed certificates in development environments. Basic configuration for TLS is present in `micro.yaml` transport settings.
*   **Missing Implementation:** mTLS with client certificate verification is not fully enforced in production `micro/micro` services. Certificate management and rotation for `micro/micro` services are manual and not automated. Production-ready certificate infrastructure (like a proper CA) is not yet in place for `micro/micro` mTLS.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Control Plane Components (Micro API, CLI, Web UI) Access](./mitigation_strategies/secure_control_plane_components__micro_api__cli__web_ui__access.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict Network Access:** Ensure that the `micro/micro` API, CLI, and Web UI are not exposed to the public internet.  Restrict network access to these control plane components to only authorized administrators and development teams, ideally within a secure internal network or VPN. Use firewalls or network policies to enforce these restrictions.
    2.  **Enforce Strong Authentication for Control Plane Access:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms for accessing the `micro/micro` API, CLI, and Web UI. This should include strong passwords and consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.  Utilize `micro/micro`'s built-in authentication features if available, or integrate with an external identity provider.
    3.  **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Control Plane Operations:** Configure RBAC for the `micro/micro` control plane to limit administrative privileges.  Assign roles to administrators and developers based on their responsibilities, granting only the necessary permissions to manage and operate the `micro/micro` platform.
    4.  **Audit Control Plane Activity:** Enable and regularly review audit logs for the `micro/micro` API, CLI, and Web UI. Monitor these logs for any unauthorized or suspicious administrative actions, configuration changes, or access attempts.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Control Plane (Severity: High): Attackers gaining unauthorized access to the `micro/micro` API, CLI, or Web UI, allowing them to manage and control the microservices infrastructure, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    *   Privilege Escalation via Control Plane (Severity: High): Attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in the `micro/micro` control plane to escalate their privileges and gain administrative control over the microservices environment.
    *   Malicious Configuration Changes (Severity: High): Unauthorized administrators or compromised accounts making malicious configuration changes through the control plane, disrupting services, altering routing, or introducing vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Control Plane: High reduction - Prevents external attackers and unauthorized internal users from managing the `micro/micro` platform.
    *   Privilege Escalation via Control Plane: Moderate to High reduction - RBAC and strong authentication reduce the risk of privilege escalation by limiting access and enforcing least privilege.
    *   Malicious Configuration Changes: High reduction - Audit logs and RBAC help detect and prevent unauthorized or malicious configuration changes.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic network restrictions are in place to limit access to the `micro/micro` Web UI to internal networks. Password-based authentication is used for Web UI access.
*   **Missing Implementation:** MFA is not enabled for control plane access. RBAC for control plane operations is not fully implemented. Audit logging for control plane activities is basic and needs enhancement for comprehensive security monitoring.
