# Attack Surface Analysis for micro/micro

## Attack Surface: [Registry Data Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/registry_data_manipulation.md)

* **Description:** Unauthorized modification of service registration information within the `micro/micro` registry.
* **How Micro Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Micro's service discovery *directly relies* on the central registry. If this registry, a core component of `micro/micro`, lacks proper access controls, anyone can potentially register, deregister, or modify service metadata.
* **Example:** An attacker uses the `micro` CLI or directly interacts with the registry API to register a service with the same name as a legitimate service but points to a malicious endpoint. Subsequent requests intended for the legitimate service, routed by `micro`'s service discovery, are directed to the attacker's service.
* **Impact:** Service disruption, redirection of traffic to malicious services, information disclosure through manipulated metadata.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strong authentication and authorization for registry access (e.g., using access control lists or a dedicated authentication service integrated with `micro`).
    * Use TLS to encrypt communication with the registry, a feature configurable within `micro`.
    * Regularly audit registry data for suspicious changes, potentially using `micro`'s observability features if available.

## Attack Surface: [Message Broker Message Injection/Spoofing](./attack_surfaces/message_broker_message_injectionspoofing.md)

* **Description:** Injecting malicious or forged messages into the message broker used by `micro/micro` services.
* **How Micro Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Micro's asynchronous communication *directly utilizes* a message broker. If the broker, as configured and used by `micro`, lacks proper security, attackers can inject messages that are processed by other services.
* **Example:** An attacker injects a message into a topic that triggers a vulnerable service (managed by `micro`) to perform an unintended action. An attacker spoofs a message to appear as if it came from a trusted service within the `micro` ecosystem, bypassing authorization checks.
* **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions within `micro` services, denial of service, potential command execution on consuming services.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement authentication and authorization for publishing and subscribing to broker topics/queues, configuring this within `micro`'s broker integration.
    * Use message signing or encryption, potentially leveraging `micro`'s message handling capabilities.
    * Configure the broker to restrict access based on service identity, aligning with `micro`'s service identity management.

## Attack Surface: [API Gateway Improper Routing and Access Control](./attack_surfaces/api_gateway_improper_routing_and_access_control.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting misconfigured routing rules or insufficient access controls in the `micro/micro` API Gateway.
* **How Micro Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `micro` API Gateway acts as the *primary entry point* for external requests into the microservices. Incorrect configuration within the gateway directly exposes internal services or allows unauthorized access.
* **Example:** An API Gateway route defined within `micro` is configured to bypass authentication for a sensitive internal service. An attacker manipulates the request path to access an unintended internal endpoint exposed through the `micro` gateway.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal services managed by `micro`, data breaches, potential for further exploitation of backend systems.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms in the API Gateway (e.g., JWT validation, OAuth 2.0), configuring this within the `micro` API Gateway settings.
    * Carefully define and review routing rules within the `micro` API Gateway configuration to ensure they only expose intended endpoints.
    * Enforce the principle of least privilege for API access through the `micro` gateway.
    * Implement rate limiting and request validation in the `micro` API Gateway to prevent abuse and protect backend services.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Inter-Service Communication (gRPC/HTTP)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_inter-service_communication__grpchttp_.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from insecure communication between `micro/micro` services.
* **How Micro Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Micro *facilitates and often defaults to* inter-service communication using gRPC or HTTP. The framework's configuration directly influences the security of these communications.
* **Example:** Services managed by `micro` communicate over unencrypted HTTP, allowing an attacker on the network to eavesdrop on sensitive data exchanged between services. A service does not properly authenticate incoming requests from other services within the `micro` ecosystem.
* **Impact:** Data breaches, man-in-the-middle attacks targeting communication between `micro` services, unauthorized access to service functionalities.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Enforce TLS encryption for all inter-service communication (gRPC and HTTP), configuring this within `micro`'s service communication settings.
    * Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for strong authentication between services managed by `micro`.
    * Use secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, JWTs) for service-to-service communication within the `micro` environment.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable or Malicious Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_or_malicious_plugins.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in or introducing malicious `micro/micro` plugins.
* **How Micro Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Micro's plugin architecture *directly allows* extending functionality. However, the security of these plugins is critical, and vulnerabilities or malicious code within them directly impacts the `micro` environment.
* **Example:** A plugin for `micro` has a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited. An attacker installs a malicious plugin within the `micro` installation that steals sensitive data or compromises the system.
* **Impact:** System compromise within the `micro` environment, data breaches, unauthorized access and control over `micro` managed resources.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Carefully vet and audit any third-party plugins before installation within the `micro` ecosystem.
    * Implement a mechanism for verifying the integrity and authenticity of plugins used by `micro`.
    * Apply the principle of least privilege to plugin permissions within `micro`.
    * Regularly update plugins used by `micro` to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure CLI Access and Usage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_cli_access_and_usage.md)

* **Description:** Unauthorized access to or misuse of the `micro/micro` command-line interface (CLI).
* **How Micro Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `micro` CLI *provides direct administrative control* over the entire `micro` ecosystem. If not properly secured, it can be used for highly damaging malicious purposes.
* **Example:** An attacker gains access to the `micro` CLI and deploys a malicious service into the `micro` environment. An administrator uses the `micro` CLI on an untrusted machine, exposing credentials used to manage the `micro` platform.
* **Impact:** System compromise of the `micro` platform, deployment of malicious code within the `micro` environment, unauthorized configuration changes affecting all `micro` services.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Restrict access to the `micro` CLI to authorized users and systems.
    * Implement strong authentication for `micro` CLI access.
    * Avoid storing `micro` CLI credentials directly in scripts or configuration files.
    * Regularly audit `micro` CLI usage.
