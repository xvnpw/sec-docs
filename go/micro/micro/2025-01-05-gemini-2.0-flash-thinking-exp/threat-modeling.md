# Threat Model Analysis for micro/micro

## Threat: [Unsecured Inter-Service Communication](./threats/unsecured_inter-service_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could perform Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks by intercepting network traffic between microservices. They could eavesdrop on sensitive data being exchanged, such as API keys, user credentials, or business-critical information. This is possible if the `go-micro/transport` layer is not configured to use TLS.
*   **Impact:** Confidential data breaches, unauthorized access to services, and potential manipulation of data in transit.
*   **Affected Component:** `go-micro/transport` (the underlying communication layer).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure the `go-micro/transport` options to enforce TLS for all inter-service communication. Utilize the `tls` package within Go to configure secure connections.
    *   Consider using a service mesh solution that integrates with `go-micro` and provides automatic TLS encryption and management.

## Threat: [Service Registry Manipulation](./threats/service_registry_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the service registry interface provided by `go-micro/registry` or the underlying registry implementation (e.g., Consul, Etcd) to register malicious services or alter the addresses of legitimate services. This could involve injecting false endpoints for critical services through the `Register` function of the registry interface.
*   **Impact:** Redirection of traffic to rogue services, leading to data theft, manipulation, or denial of service. Attackers could impersonate legitimate services to gather sensitive information.
*   **Affected Component:** `go-micro/registry` interface and its implementations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the underlying service registry (e.g., Consul, Etcd) with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. This is external to `go-micro` but crucial.
    *   If the `go-micro/registry` implementation allows for it, implement access control lists (ACLs) to restrict who can register and discover services.
    *   Monitor the service registry for unauthorized changes or registrations.

## Threat: [Service Impersonation via Lack of Mutual Authentication](./threats/service_impersonation_via_lack_of_mutual_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** Without mutual authentication enforced at the `go-micro/transport` level, a malicious service could falsely claim the identity of a legitimate service when connecting. This allows it to interact with other services without proper authorization, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or triggering unauthorized actions.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, privilege escalation, and potential compromise of other services within the application.
*   **Affected Component:** `go-micro/transport` and its authentication mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for inter-service communication by configuring the `go-micro/transport` with appropriate TLS certificates and verification settings.
    *   Utilize secure service identities and certificate management that integrate with `go-micro`.

## Threat: [API Gateway as a Single Point of Failure and Attack](./threats/api_gateway_as_a_single_point_of_failure_and_attack.md)

*   **Description:** The API gateway, often built using `go-micro/api`, acts as the entry point for external requests. If vulnerabilities exist within the `go-micro/api` implementation or its handlers, an attacker could gain access to internal services and potentially sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Complete application compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** `go-micro/api` package and its handlers.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Harden the API gateway implementation, ensuring proper input validation and secure handling of requests within the `go-micro/api` handlers.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization middleware within the `go-micro/api` framework for all requests.
    *   Regularly update the `go-micro/api` library and its dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insufficient Rate Limiting and Throttling at the Gateway](./threats/insufficient_rate_limiting_and_throttling_at_the_gateway.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can overwhelm the API gateway built with `go-micro/api` and backend services with a large number of requests, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This can exploit the request handling capabilities of `go-micro/api`.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, degraded performance, and potential financial losses.
*   **Affected Component:** `go-micro/api` request handling logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting and throttling middleware within the `go-micro/api` framework to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given timeframe.
    *   Consider using external rate limiting services in conjunction with the `go-micro/api` gateway.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information like database credentials or API keys might be stored insecurely within the configuration mechanisms used by `go-micro` services, such as environment variables or configuration files loaded by libraries used within the services. While not directly a `go-micro` vulnerability, its configuration patterns can contribute to this.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to external services, and complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration loading and management patterns within `go-micro` services.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files or environment variables used by `go-micro` services.
    *   Utilize secure secret management solutions and integrate them with your `go-micro` services.

## Threat: [Compromised Micro CLI Tools](./threats/compromised_micro_cli_tools.md)

*   **Description:** If a developer's machine with access to the `micro` CLI tools is compromised, an attacker can use these tools to interact with the service registry (`go-micro/registry`), deploy malicious services, or reconfigure the application.
*   **Impact:** Malicious code injection, service disruption, and potential data breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** `micro` CLI tool and its interaction with the service registry and other `go-micro` components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong security practices for developer machines, including up-to-date security software and strong passwords.
    *   Restrict access to production environments and credentials used by the `micro` CLI.
    *   Use multi-factor authentication for accessing sensitive development and deployment tools, including those used with the `micro` CLI.
    *   Regularly audit the usage of the `micro` CLI and related tools.
