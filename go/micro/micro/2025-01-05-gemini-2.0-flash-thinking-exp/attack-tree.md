## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Micro Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_micro_core_vulnerabilities.md)

**Objective:** To leverage security flaws within the core components of the Micro framework itself.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Identify Vulnerable Micro Component:**  The attacker first needs to identify a specific component (API Gateway, Registry, Broker) that has a known or potential vulnerability. This often involves reconnaissance, scanning, and reviewing public vulnerability databases.
    *   **Exploit Identified Vulnerability:** This is the core of the attack. Depending on the vulnerability, this could involve:
        *   **Code Injection:** Injecting malicious code into input fields or configuration settings that are processed by the vulnerable component, leading to arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Exploiting flaws in the component's privilege management to gain higher-level access and control over the Micro infrastructure.
        *   **Data Manipulation:**  Directly altering critical data within the Micro components, such as the service registry or message broker, to disrupt service discovery or communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Inter-Service Communication](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_inter-service_communication.md)

**Objective:** To compromise the communication channels between microservices.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Intercept Inter-Service Communication:**  Gaining access to the network traffic between services.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** Intercepting and potentially modifying communication between two services without their knowledge. This is often facilitated by:
            *   **Lack of TLS Encryption:** If communication is not encrypted, attackers can easily sniff sensitive data like credentials or business logic.
            *   **Compromised Network Infrastructure:** If the network itself is compromised, attackers can position themselves to intercept traffic.
    *   **Impersonate a Service:**  An attacker pretends to be a legitimate service to interact with other services. This often requires:
        *   Obtaining valid service credentials or tokens through compromise or weak security practices.
    *   **Register a Malicious Service:**  An attacker registers a fake service with the service registry to intercept traffic intended for a legitimate service. This is particularly effective if:
        *   There's a lack of authentication or authorization controls on the service registry.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Micro's API Gateway](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_micro's_api_gateway.md)

**Objective:** To exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the API Gateway, the entry point for external requests.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Identify Exposed API Endpoints:** Reconnaissance to find publicly accessible API endpoints.
    *   **Exploit Gateway Vulnerabilities or Misconfigurations:**
        *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass:** Circumventing the gateway's security checks to access protected resources without proper credentials.
        *   **Input Validation Weaknesses:** Sending malicious payloads through the gateway that are not properly validated, potentially leading to attacks on backend services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Micro's Message Broker](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_micro's_message_broker.md)

**Objective:** To gain unauthorized access to the message broker and manipulate inter-service communication.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Access the Message Broker:**  Gaining entry to the broker, potentially through exploiting authentication weaknesses or network access.
    *   **Manipulate Messages:** Once inside, the attacker can:
        *   **Inject Malicious Messages:**  Send crafted messages to trigger unintended actions in subscribing services.
        *   **Modify Existing Messages:** Alter the content of messages in transit, disrupting business logic or injecting malicious data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Insecure Defaults or Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_insecure_defaults_or_configurations.md)

**Objective:** To exploit common security oversights related to default settings and weak configurations.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Identify Insecure Default Settings:**  Often easily found in documentation or through basic reconnaissance.
    *   **Exploit Weak Configurations:**
        *   **Default Credentials:** Using default usernames and passwords for Micro components, providing immediate access.
        *   **Insecure Secrets Management:**  Finding sensitive credentials stored insecurely, allowing for broader system compromise.
