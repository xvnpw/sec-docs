## Deep Analysis: Insecure Handling of Metadata in RPC Calls (go-micro)

This document provides a deep analysis of the threat "Insecure Handling of Metadata in RPC Calls" within the context of applications built using the `go-micro` framework. We will explore the mechanics of the threat, its potential impact, and provide detailed recommendations for mitigation.

**1. Understanding the Threat:**

The core of this threat lies in the trust placed on metadata transmitted alongside RPC calls in `go-micro`. While metadata is intended to provide contextual information about a request, its inherent mutability and the lack of default integrity or authenticity checks within `go-micro` make it a prime target for malicious manipulation.

**1.1. How Metadata Works in `go-micro`:**

* **Transmission:** When a `go-micro` client makes an RPC call, it can attach metadata as a key-value map. This metadata is serialized and transmitted alongside the request payload.
* **Access on the Server:** The receiving `go-micro` server can access this metadata within its handler functions through the `context.Context`. The `metadata.FromContext(ctx)` function retrieves this metadata map.
* **Intended Use Cases:** Metadata is commonly used for:
    * **Tracing and Logging:** Including request IDs or correlation IDs.
    * **Contextual Information:** Passing user roles, permissions, or tenant IDs.
    * **Feature Flags or Configuration:**  Dynamically influencing service behavior.

**1.2. The Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises when a service relies on this readily modifiable metadata for critical decisions, such as:

* **Authorization:** Granting access based on a "role" or "permission" value in the metadata.
* **Data Filtering:** Selecting data based on a "tenant-id" from the metadata.
* **Conditional Logic:**  Executing different code paths based on metadata flags.

Without proper validation, an attacker can intercept and modify the metadata associated with an RPC call, or even craft malicious calls with forged metadata from the outset.

**2. Detailed Analysis of the Threat:**

**2.1. Mechanism of Attack:**

1. **Interception (Man-in-the-Middle):** An attacker positioned between the client and server could intercept the RPC call. They can then inspect and modify the metadata before forwarding the request.
2. **Malicious Client:** An attacker controlling a client application can directly craft RPC calls with arbitrary metadata. This is particularly concerning if the client is exposed or compromised.
3. **Compromised Service:** If a service within the microservice architecture is compromised, it can make malicious RPC calls to other services with forged metadata.

**2.2. Attack Vectors:**

* **Inter-Service Communication:**  If services within the `go-micro` ecosystem rely on metadata for authorization between themselves, a compromised service can impersonate others.
* **External Clients:** If external clients (e.g., web applications, mobile apps) can directly interact with `go-micro` services, attackers can manipulate metadata from their applications.
* **Internal Network Exploitation:** An attacker gaining access to the internal network could intercept and modify RPC calls between services.

**2.3. Root Cause:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is the **implicit trust** placed on the incoming metadata by the receiving service. `go-micro` provides the mechanism to transmit metadata, but it doesn't enforce any inherent security measures like signing or encryption by default. It is the responsibility of the application developer to implement these safeguards.

**2.4. Specific Code Examples (Illustrative):**

**Vulnerable Server Handler:**

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/micro/go-micro/v2/metadata"
)

type Greeter struct{}

func (g *Greeter) Hello(ctx context.Context, req *HelloRequest, rsp *HelloResponse) error {
	md, ok := metadata.FromContext(ctx)
	if ok {
		role, ok := md["role"]
		if ok && role == "admin" { // Relying solely on metadata for authorization
			rsp.Greeting = "Hello Admin, " + req.Name
			return nil
		}
	}
	rsp.Greeting = "Hello Guest, " + req.Name
	return nil
}
```

**Malicious Client Crafting Forged Metadata:**

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/micro/go-micro/v2/client"
	"github.com/micro/go-micro/v2/metadata"
)

func main() {
	service := client.NewService()
	greeter := NewGreeterService("greeter", service.Client())

	// Crafting a request with forged "role" metadata
	ctx := metadata.NewContext(context.Background(), map[string]string{"role": "admin"})
	rsp, err := greeter.Hello(ctx, &HelloRequest{Name: "Attacker"}, client.WithRetries(0))
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println("Response:", rsp.Greeting) // Potentially gets "Hello Admin, Attacker"
}
```

**Mitigated Server Handler (Basic Validation):**

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/micro/go-micro/v2/metadata"
)

type Greeter struct{}

func (g *Greeter) Hello(ctx context.Context, req *HelloRequest, rsp *HelloResponse) error {
	md, ok := metadata.FromContext(ctx)
	if ok {
		role, ok := md["role"]
		if ok {
			// Proper validation and authorization logic
			if isValidAdminRole(role) {
				rsp.Greeting = "Hello Admin, " + req.Name
				return nil
			}
		}
	}
	rsp.Greeting = "Hello Guest, " + req.Name
	return nil
}

func isValidAdminRole(role string) bool {
	// Implement robust authorization logic here, potentially checking against a database or external service
	return role == "admin" // This is still a basic example, more robust checks are needed
}
```

**3. Impact Assessment (Detailed):**

The impact of this vulnerability can be significant, potentially leading to:

* **Authorization Bypass:** Attackers can gain access to resources or functionalities they are not authorized to use by forging metadata that grants them elevated privileges.
* **Impersonation:** Attackers can impersonate legitimate users or services by manipulating metadata that identifies the caller. This can lead to unauthorized actions being attributed to the impersonated entity.
* **Data Manipulation:**  If metadata is used to influence data retrieval or processing, attackers can manipulate it to access or modify data they shouldn't. For example, changing a "tenant-id" to access another tenant's data.
* **Privilege Escalation:** By forging metadata, an attacker with limited privileges can potentially escalate their access to perform actions reserved for administrators or other privileged roles.
* **Data Breaches:**  Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, resulting in data breaches and compliance violations.
* **Reputation Damage:** Security breaches resulting from this vulnerability can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization.
* **Denial of Service (Indirect):** While not a direct DoS attack, manipulating metadata could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or resource exhaustion in the receiving service.

**4. Affected Go-Micro Components (Elaborated):**

* **`go-micro/metadata`:** This package is directly responsible for handling metadata. It provides functions to set and retrieve metadata from the context. The vulnerability lies in the fact that this package doesn't inherently provide mechanisms for verifying the integrity or authenticity of the metadata.
* **`go-micro/client`:** The client-side component is affected because it's the point where metadata is initially set and transmitted. Attackers controlling the client can manipulate the metadata before sending the request.
* **`go-micro/server`:** The server-side component is affected because it receives and processes the metadata. The vulnerability manifests when the server relies on this potentially malicious metadata without proper validation.

**5. Comprehensive Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Mandatory Validation:**  Always validate all incoming metadata within the service handler. Do not assume its integrity.
    * **Data Type Checks:** Ensure metadata values are of the expected data type.
    * **Whitelist Validation:**  Validate metadata values against a predefined whitelist of acceptable values.
    * **Sanitization:**  Sanitize metadata to remove any potentially malicious characters or code.
* **Avoid Sole Reliance on Metadata for Authorization:**
    * **Dedicated Authorization Service:** Implement a separate, robust authorization service that handles authentication and authorization decisions. Pass necessary identifiers (e.g., user ID, session token) in metadata and use the authorization service to verify them.
    * **Token-Based Authentication:** Utilize established authentication mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and pass the token in the metadata or headers. Verify the signature and claims of the token on the server-side.
    * **Mutual TLS (mTLS):** For inter-service communication, implement mTLS to establish secure and authenticated connections between services. This provides strong identity verification at the transport layer.
* **Signed or Encrypted Metadata:**
    * **Digital Signatures:** Sign the metadata on the client-side using a private key and verify the signature on the server-side using the corresponding public key. This ensures the integrity and authenticity of the metadata.
    * **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive metadata to prevent eavesdropping and modification during transit. Decrypt the metadata on the server-side.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that services only have access to the metadata they absolutely need. Avoid passing unnecessary or sensitive information in metadata.
* **Secure Communication Channels:** Use HTTPS for all communication between clients and services to protect metadata from eavesdropping during transit.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities related to metadata handling.
* **Centralized Validation Logic:**  Consider creating reusable functions or middleware to handle metadata validation consistently across all services. This reduces code duplication and ensures consistent security practices.
* **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement rate limiting and throttling to mitigate potential abuse by malicious clients sending numerous requests with forged metadata.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging to track the metadata associated with requests. Monitor for suspicious patterns or attempts to manipulate metadata.

**6. Recommendations for the Development Team:**

* **Code Review Guidelines:** Establish clear code review guidelines that specifically address the secure handling of metadata in `go-micro` handlers. Emphasize the importance of validation and avoiding reliance on unvalidated metadata for critical decisions.
* **Security Training:** Provide developers with training on common security vulnerabilities, including insecure handling of metadata, and best practices for secure development with `go-micro`.
* **Establish Secure Metadata Handling Patterns:** Define and promote secure patterns for handling metadata within the application architecture. This could involve creating helper functions or libraries for common validation and authorization tasks.
* **Document Metadata Usage:** Clearly document the purpose and expected format of all metadata used within the application. This helps developers understand the potential security implications and implement appropriate safeguards.
* **Implement Automated Security Testing:** Integrate automated security testing tools into the development pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities related to metadata handling.
* **Consider a Security Framework:** Explore using a dedicated security framework or library that provides built-in mechanisms for secure authentication, authorization, and metadata handling within a microservice architecture.
