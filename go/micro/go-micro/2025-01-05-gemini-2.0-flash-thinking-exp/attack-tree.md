*   **Manipulate Service Discovery (High-Risk Path):** Attackers target the mechanism by which services locate each other.
    *   **Exploit Lack of Authentication/Authorization on Registry Registration (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):** If the service registry doesn't require proper authentication or authorization for service registration, anyone can register services, including malicious ones.
    *   **Exploit Lack of Authentication/Authorization on Registry Unregistration (Critical Node):** Similar to registration, lack of authorization allows unauthorized removal of service entries, leading to denial of service.
    *   **Intercept and Modify Registry Responses (High-Risk Path):** An attacker on the network path could intercept responses from the registry and modify them before they reach the requesting service, redirecting traffic.
