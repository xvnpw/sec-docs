# Threat Model Analysis for micro/go-micro

## Threat: [Registry Poisoning](./threats/registry_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the service registry and registers malicious service endpoints. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the registry's authentication or authorization mechanisms, or compromising the credentials of a legitimate service interacting with the `go-micro` registry client. Once registered, these malicious endpoints can be discovered by other services using `go-micro`'s service discovery.
*   **Impact:** Legitimate services attempting to communicate with the intended service may be redirected to the attacker's malicious endpoint. This can lead to data exfiltration, manipulation of data, or the execution of arbitrary code within the calling service's context, facilitated by `go-micro`'s RPC mechanisms.
*   **Affected Go-Micro Component:**
    *   `go-micro/registry`: Specifically the functions responsible for service registration and discovery.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for registry updates.
    *   Use secure communication channels (TLS/HTTPS) for all interactions with the registry through `go-micro`.
    *   Regularly audit the registry for unexpected or unauthorized service registrations.
    *   Consider using a registry with built-in access control features and role-based access control (RBAC).

## Threat: [Service Impersonation via Registry Manipulation](./threats/service_impersonation_via_registry_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker registers a service with the same name as a legitimate service in the registry. This could be achieved if the registry lacks proper validation or if the attacker compromises credentials used for service registration via `go-micro`.
*   **Impact:** When other services attempt to discover and communicate with the legitimate service using `go-micro`'s discovery, they might inadvertently connect to the attacker's impersonating service. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive data meant for the legitimate service, or the attacker's service performing actions on behalf of the legitimate service through `go-micro`'s RPC.
*   **Affected Go-Micro Component:**
    *   `go-micro/registry`: Specifically the service registration and discovery mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication for service registration and updates through `go-micro`.
    *   Utilize mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service communication initiated by `go-micro` clients to verify the identity of the connecting service beyond just the service name.
    *   Implement checks on service metadata beyond just the name within `go-micro` to differentiate legitimate services.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) against the Registry](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__against_the_registry.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the service registry with a large number of registration or deregistration requests, potentially exploiting how `go-micro` clients interact with the registry. This could be done by compromising multiple service instances using `go-micro` to generate a high volume of requests.
*   **Impact:** The registry becomes overloaded and unresponsive, preventing legitimate services using `go-micro` from registering or discovering other services. This can lead to a complete breakdown of communication within the microservices architecture.
*   **Affected Go-Micro Component:**
    *   `go-micro/registry`: The core registry service and its handling of registration and deregistration requests initiated by `go-micro`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on registry registration and deregistration endpoints.
    *   Implement resource management and capacity planning for the registry infrastructure.
    *   Consider using a highly available and scalable registry implementation.
    *   Implement authentication and authorization to limit which `go-micro` instances can register or deregister services.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on RPC Calls](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_rpc_calls.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between two microservices if the `go-micro` transport is not properly secured. This could involve eavesdropping on network traffic between services using the default or configured transport.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can eavesdrop on sensitive data being exchanged between services using `go-micro`'s RPC mechanisms, potentially including credentials, personal information, or business-critical data. They might also be able to modify the communication, leading to data corruption or unauthorized actions.
*   **Affected Go-Micro Component:**
    *   `go-micro/transport`: The underlying transport mechanism used for RPC calls (e.g., gRPC, HTTP) configured within `go-micro`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security) for all inter-service communication within `go-micro`. Configure `go-micro` to use secure transport options by default.
    *   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication and encryption within `go-micro`'s transport layer.

## Threat: [Broker Message Injection](./threats/broker_message_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the message broker and publishes malicious messages to topics that services using `go-micro` for subscriptions are listening to. This could be due to weak broker authentication or compromised credentials used by `go-micro`'s broker client.
*   **Impact:** Services subscribing to the affected topic using `go-micro` will receive and potentially process the malicious messages. This could lead to incorrect data processing, application errors, or even security vulnerabilities if the messages contain malicious payloads.
*   **Affected Go-Micro Component:**
    *   `go-micro/broker`: The message broker component responsible for publishing and subscribing to messages via `go-micro`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for publishing messages to the broker.
    *   Use secure communication channels (e.g., TLS) for communication between `go-micro` and the message broker.
    *   Validate and sanitize all incoming messages received through `go-micro` before processing them.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Metadata in RPC Calls](./threats/insecure_handling_of_metadata_in_rpc_calls.md)

*   **Description:** `go-micro` allows passing metadata with RPC calls. If services rely on this metadata for authorization or other critical decisions without proper validation within their `go-micro` handlers, attackers could manipulate this metadata.
*   **Impact:** Attackers could forge metadata to bypass authorization checks implemented in `go-micro` handlers, impersonate other users or services, or influence the behavior of the receiving service in unintended ways.
*   **Affected Go-Micro Component:**
    *   `go-micro/metadata`: The component responsible for handling metadata in RPC calls within `go-micro`.
    *   `go-micro/client`: When setting metadata.
    *   `go-micro/server`: When retrieving and processing metadata in handler functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and validate all incoming metadata within `go-micro` service handlers before using it for critical decisions.
    *   Avoid relying solely on metadata for authorization within `go-micro`. Implement robust authorization mechanisms that are not easily spoofed.
    *   Consider using signed or encrypted metadata to ensure its integrity and authenticity when using `go-micro`.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** If custom middleware is developed for `go-micro` without proper security considerations, it could introduce vulnerabilities such as logging sensitive information from `go-micro` requests/responses, allowing bypasses of `go-micro` security checks, or introducing new attack vectors within the `go-micro` request lifecycle.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, attackers could gain unauthorized access, exfiltrate data handled by `go-micro`, or disrupt the application's functionality.
*   **Affected Go-Micro Component:**
    *   `go-micro/server`: The middleware implementation within the `go-micro` server.
    *   Custom middleware code interacting with `go-micro` request/response objects.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be High or Critical depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom middleware for `go-micro`.
    *   Thoroughly review and test custom middleware for potential vulnerabilities within the `go-micro` context.
    *   Avoid storing or logging sensitive information in `go-micro` middleware unless absolutely necessary and with proper security measures.
