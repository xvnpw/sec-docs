### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving go-micro

This list details potential security threats with high or critical severity that directly involve the `go-micro` framework.

*   **Threat:** Registry Poisoning
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the service registry (e.g., Consul, Etcd). They register malicious service endpoints or modify existing ones to point to attacker-controlled services. When legitimate `go-micro` services perform service discovery using the `go-micro/registry` component, they may connect to the malicious endpoints.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches (sensitive data sent to attacker), service disruption (traffic redirected to non-functional services), man-in-the-middle attacks (attacker intercepts and modifies communication).
    *   **Affected go-micro Component:** `go-micro/registry` (specifically the service discovery function and interaction with the underlying registry implementation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the registry.
        *   Use network segmentation to restrict access to the registry.
        *   Enable audit logging on the registry to detect unauthorized modifications.
        *   Use secure communication (TLS) between `go-micro` services and the registry.
        *   Regularly monitor the registry for unexpected changes.

*   **Threat:** Broker Message Interception and Eavesdropping
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts messages being transmitted through the message broker (e.g., NATS, RabbitMQ, Kafka). If the communication channel managed by the `go-micro/broker` component is not encrypted, the attacker can read the contents of the messages.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (sensitive data within messages is exposed).
    *   **Affected go-micro Component:** `go-micro/broker` (specifically the message publishing and subscription mechanisms and interaction with the underlying broker implementation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS encryption for communication between `go-micro` services and the broker, configuring the `go-micro/broker` options accordingly.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data within the message payload before publishing using the `go-micro/broker` API.

*   **Threat:** Broker Message Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts messages being transmitted through the message broker and modifies their content before they reach the intended recipient. This can happen if the communication managed by `go-micro/broker` is not secured.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise (receiving service processes modified, potentially malicious data), potential for unauthorized actions.
    *   **Affected go-micro Component:** `go-micro/broker` (specifically the message publishing and subscription mechanisms and interaction with the underlying broker implementation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS encryption for communication between `go-micro` services and the broker (provides some integrity protection at the transport level).
        *   Implement message signing (e.g., using HMAC or digital signatures) at the application level before publishing messages using the `go-micro/broker` API.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Transport Configuration (No TLS)
    *   **Description:** The transport layer used for synchronous communication between `go-micro` services (e.g., gRPC or HTTP) is not configured to use TLS encryption. This allows attackers to eavesdrop on and potentially modify communication between services utilizing the `go-micro/transport` component.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data integrity compromise, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Affected go-micro Component:** `go-micro/transport` (specifically the configuration and usage of the underlying transport implementation like gRPC or HTTP).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always configure `go-micro` services to use TLS for inter-service communication by setting the appropriate transport options.
        *   Enforce TLS at the transport layer configuration within the `go-micro` application setup.

*   **Threat:** Missing or Weak Service Authentication
    *   **Description:** `go-micro` services do not properly authenticate the identity of other services making requests. This allows malicious services or unauthorized actors to impersonate legitimate services and perform actions they are not authorized for, bypassing security measures intended to be implemented using `go-micro`'s client and server components.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected go-micro Component:** `go-micro/client` and `go-micro/server` (specifically the middleware or interceptors used for authentication).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for strong service-to-service authentication, leveraging `go-micro`'s transport options and potentially custom wrappers.
        *   Use API keys or tokens for authentication and authorization, implementing checks within `go-micro` handlers or interceptors.
        *   Consider using a service mesh that integrates with `go-micro` and handles authentication and authorization policies.

*   **Threat:** Missing or Weak Service Authorization
    *   **Description:** Even if `go-micro` services are authenticated, the authorization mechanisms are insufficient or missing. This allows authenticated services to access resources or perform actions they are not permitted to, despite authentication being handled by `go-micro`.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected go-micro Component:** `go-micro/client` and `go-micro/server` (specifically the middleware or interceptors used for authorization).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) within `go-micro` service handlers or interceptors.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege in service design and authorization logic.
        *   Use policy enforcement points within `go-micro` to control access to resources.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Interceptors/Plugins
    *   **Description:** A developer or attacker introduces a malicious interceptor or plugin that is loaded by a `go-micro` service. This malicious code, leveraging the extensibility of `go-micro`, can perform arbitrary actions, including stealing secrets, logging sensitive data, or disrupting service functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the affected service, potential for lateral movement within the application.
    *   **Affected go-micro Component:** `go-micro/server` and `go-micro/client` (specifically the interceptor and plugin loading mechanisms).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and audit all third-party interceptors and plugins used with `go-micro`.
        *   Implement code signing and verification for interceptors and plugins.
        *   Restrict the ability to load external interceptors and plugins in production environments.
