# Threat Model Analysis for micro/go-micro

## Threat: [Malicious Service Registration](./threats/malicious_service_registration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker registers a rogue service with the `go-micro` service registry.  The attacker's service impersonates a legitimate service. Clients using `go-micro`'s `client.Client` then unknowingly connect to the malicious service. The attacker could exploit a weakness in how `go-micro` interacts with the registry, or provide crafted metadata that bypasses checks.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, command injection, denial of service, man-in-the-middle attacks, complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Go-Micro Component:** `Registry` interface and its implementations (how `go-micro` interacts with the registry). The `client.Client` is directly affected as it uses the registry to discover services.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Registry Interaction Security:**  Ensure `go-micro`'s interaction with the registry uses secure protocols (TLS) and validates registry responses.
    *   **Service Identity Verification:** Implement a mechanism within `go-micro` (e.g., using middleware or custom wrappers) to verify the identity of services *beyond* just their name retrieved from the registry. This could involve cryptographic signatures or tokens. The `client.Client` should perform this verification.
    *   **Input Validation (Registry Data):**  `go-micro` should rigorously sanitize and validate all service metadata received from the registry before using it.
    *   **Go-Micro Configuration:** Review and harden `go-micro`'s configuration related to registry interaction, ensuring secure defaults and disabling any insecure features.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Service Access (Bypassing Go-Micro Auth)](./threats/unauthorized_service_access__bypassing_go-micro_auth_.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious or compromised service calls another service using `go-micro`'s `client.Client` without proper authorization. The attacker bypasses `go-micro`'s intended access controls (if any are configured), potentially gaining access to sensitive data or functionality. This focuses on vulnerabilities *within* `go-micro`'s handling of authentication and authorization.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized actions, privilege escalation, potential for system compromise.
*   **Affected Go-Micro Component:** `client.Client` (for making calls), `server.Server` (for handling calls), and any custom `go-micro` middleware or wrappers that implement authentication/authorization. The `auth` package, if used, is directly affected.  Focus is on the *correct usage and implementation* of these components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Proper `auth` Package Use:** If using `go-micro`'s `auth` package, ensure it's correctly configured and integrated into both the client and server.
    *   **Custom Middleware:** If implementing custom authentication/authorization middleware, ensure it's robust, follows security best practices, and is thoroughly tested.
    *   **Context Propagation:** Ensure that authentication and authorization information is properly propagated through the call chain using `context.Context` *within* `go-micro`.
    *   **Input Validation (within Go-Micro):**  Even with authentication, `go-micro`'s service handlers should validate all input received from other services.
    *   **Go-Micro Configuration (Auth):** Review and harden `go-micro`'s configuration related to authentication and authorization.

## Threat: [Message Interception (Eavesdropping within Go-Micro Transport)](./threats/message_interception__eavesdropping_within_go-micro_transport_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between services facilitated by `go-micro`. This focuses on vulnerabilities *within* `go-micro`'s transport layer, such as a failure to properly enable or configure TLS, or a vulnerability in the TLS implementation used by `go-micro`.
*   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality, data breaches, potential for credential theft.
*   **Affected Go-Micro Component:** `transport.Transport` interface and its implementations (e.g., `http.Transport`, `grpc.Transport`). The `client.Client` and `server.Server` are indirectly affected, specifically how they use the `Transport`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce TLS (Go-Micro Config):** Ensure that `go-micro` is configured to *require* TLS for all inter-service communication.  Do not allow unencrypted traffic.
    *   **Strong Cipher Suites (Go-Micro Config):** Configure `go-micro`'s `transport.Transport` to use strong cipher suites and protocols (e.g., TLS 1.3).
    *   **Certificate Validation (Go-Micro Implementation):** Ensure that `go-micro`'s `client.Client` properly validates server certificates, and `server.Server` validates client certificates (in the case of mTLS). This is a critical implementation detail within `go-micro`.
    *   **Go-Micro Transport Plugin Review:** Carefully review the chosen `transport.Transport` implementation for any known security issues or configuration weaknesses.

## Threat: [Message Tampering (within Go-Micro Transport/Codec)](./threats/message_tampering__within_go-micro_transportcodec_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and modifies messages exchanged between services using `go-micro`. This focuses on vulnerabilities *within* `go-micro`'s transport or codec layers, such as a failure to provide integrity protection or a vulnerability in the serialization/deserialization process.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions, system compromise, incorrect application behavior.
*   **Affected Go-Micro Component:** `transport.Transport` interface and its implementations. The `codec.Codec` interface is also *directly* relevant, as it handles message serialization/deserialization. The `client.Client` and `server.Server` are indirectly affected.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **TLS (for Integrity - Go-Micro Config):** As with eavesdropping, enforcing TLS via `go-micro`'s configuration provides integrity protection.
    *   **Secure Codec Implementation:** Ensure the `codec.Codec` implementation used by `go-micro` is secure and does not introduce vulnerabilities during serialization/deserialization. Avoid custom codecs unless thoroughly vetted.
    *   **Message Signing (within Go-Micro):** Implement message signing using a cryptographic signature scheme *within go-micro* (e.g., using middleware). The sender signs the message, and the receiver verifies the signature.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Go-Micro Plugins](./threats/misconfigured_go-micro_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** `go-micro` plugins (for service discovery, transport, codecs, etc.) are misconfigured, introducing vulnerabilities *specific to how go-micro uses them*. For example, a misconfigured transport plugin might disable TLS, or a misconfigured registry plugin might skip crucial validation steps. This focuses on the *interaction* between `go-micro` and its plugins.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely, but can lead to any of the other high/critical threats.
*   **Affected Go-Micro Component:** Any plugin (`registry.Registry`, `transport.Transport`, `broker.Broker`, `codec.Codec`, `client.Client`, `server.Server`, `selector.Selector`, etc.) â€“ specifically, how `go-micro` *uses* and *configures* these plugins.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin and misconfiguration)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Documentation Review (Go-Micro Specifics):** Thoroughly review `go-micro`'s documentation for each plugin used, paying close attention to security-related configuration options.
    *   **Secure Defaults (Go-Micro):**  Ensure `go-micro` is configured to use secure defaults for all plugins whenever possible.
    *   **Configuration Validation (within Go-Micro):** Implement checks *within your go-micro application* to validate plugin configurations at startup.
    *   **Go-Micro Plugin Selection:** Choose well-maintained and reputable `go-micro` plugins.

## Threat: [Insecure Selector Strategy (within Go-Micro)](./threats/insecure_selector_strategy__within_go-micro_.md)

* **Threat:** Insecure Selector Strategy (within Go-Micro)

    * **Description:** An attacker manipulates the service selection process *within go-micro* to direct traffic to a malicious instance. This could be done by influencing the selection algorithm (e.g., if it's predictable or based on externally controllable factors) or by exploiting a vulnerability in `go-micro`'s selector implementation.
    * **Impact:** Traffic redirection to a malicious service instance, leading to data breaches, command execution, or denial of service.
    * **Affected Go-Micro Component:** `selector.Selector` interface and its implementations (e.g., `registry.Selector`, `cache.Selector`, `roundrobin.Selector`, `random.Selector`). The `client.Client` uses the selector, so it's directly affected by how `go-micro` implements and uses the selector.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Robust Strategies (Go-Micro Config):** Configure `go-micro` to use robust, well-vetted selection strategies like `random.Selector` or `roundrobin.Selector`. Avoid custom strategies unless thoroughly reviewed for security.
        * **Avoid Predictability (Go-Micro Implementation):** Ensure `go-micro`'s selection process is not predictable or easily influenced by external factors.
        * **Go-Micro Selector Plugin Review:** Carefully review the chosen `selector.Selector` implementation for any known security issues.
        * **Service Identity Verification (Combined with Selection):** Combine `go-micro`'s selection with strong service identity verification (e.g., mTLS) to ensure that even if the selector is compromised, the client still connects to a legitimate service.

## Threat: [Outdated `go-micro` Version](./threats/outdated__go-micro__version.md)

* **Threat:** Outdated `go-micro` Version

    * **Description:** Using an outdated version of the `go-micro` framework itself that contains known security vulnerabilities *within the framework's code*.
    * **Impact:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in `go-micro`, leading to system compromise, data breaches, or other attacks.
    * **Affected Go-Micro Component:** The entire `go-micro` framework.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Regularly update `go-micro` to the latest stable version.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use Go modules to manage and update `go-micro` and its dependencies.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning (Go-Micro Specific):** Use a vulnerability scanner that specifically targets Go applications and can identify known vulnerabilities in `go-micro`.
        *   **Security Advisories:** Monitor security advisories for `go-micro`.
