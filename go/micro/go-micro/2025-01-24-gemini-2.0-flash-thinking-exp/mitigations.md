# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for micro/go-micro

## Mitigation Strategy: [Service Registration and Discovery Validation within Go-Micro](./mitigation_strategies/service_registration_and_discovery_validation_within_go-micro.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Service Identity Verification during Registration using Go-Micro Features:** Leverage `go-micro`'s service registration process to incorporate identity verification. This can be done by:
        *   **Custom Registration Handlers:**  Extend `go-micro`'s registration process with custom handlers that verify service identity before allowing registration. This could involve checking for a pre-shared secret or validating a cryptographic signature provided by the service during registration.
        *   **Metadata Validation at Registry Client:** Within your `go-micro` service's registration code, add logic to validate the response from the service registry after registration attempts. Ensure the registry confirms successful registration and the returned metadata is as expected.
    2.  **Validate Service Metadata during Discovery in Go-Micro Clients:** When a `go-micro` client discovers a service, implement validation of the service metadata retrieved from the registry.
        *   **Interceptor-Based Validation:** Create `go-micro` client interceptors that, upon service discovery, fetch and validate the metadata associated with the discovered service. This validation should check if the service name, version, and endpoints match expected values.
        *   **Fail-Fast on Validation Failure:** If metadata validation fails during discovery, the `go-micro` client should fail to connect to the service and log an error, preventing communication with potentially malicious or incorrect services.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Service Impersonation (High Severity):** Malicious services could register themselves as legitimate services, potentially intercepting traffic intended for the real service.
        *   **Data Injection via Metadata (Medium Severity):** Attackers could manipulate service metadata in the registry if not validated, potentially leading to misdirection of traffic or exploitation of services consuming this metadata.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Service Impersonation:** Risk reduced significantly (High Impact) by ensuring only verified services are considered legitimate.
        *   **Data Injection via Metadata:** Risk reduced (Medium Impact) by preventing the use of potentially tampered metadata.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic service name validation might be implicitly done by `go-micro` during service lookup, but explicit identity verification and metadata validation are not implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Implement custom registration handlers or extend registration logic in `go-micro` services for identity verification.
        *   Develop `go-micro` client interceptors to validate service metadata upon discovery.
        *   Define clear validation rules for service metadata based on application requirements.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Mutual TLS (mTLS) for Go-Micro Service-to-Service Communication](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_mutual_tls__mtls__for_go-micro_service-to-service_communication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Go-Micro Transports for mTLS:** Utilize `go-micro`'s transport options to enable mTLS. This involves:
        *   **gRPC Transport Configuration:** If using the gRPC transport (default or common), configure `grpc.Transport` options within `go-micro` to load service certificates, private keys, and the CA certificate for verifying peer certificates.
        *   **HTTP Transport Configuration:** If using the HTTP transport, configure `http.Transport` options similarly to load certificates and enable TLS with client authentication.
    2.  **Set `Secure` Option in Go-Micro Client and Server:** When creating `go-micro` clients and servers, explicitly set the `Secure(true)` option. This ensures that the configured TLS transport is enforced for all communication.
    3.  **Distribute Certificates to Go-Micro Services:** Ensure that each `go-micro` service has access to its own certificate and private key, as well as the CA certificate needed to verify other services' certificates. Use secure methods for certificate distribution (e.g., secrets management systems).
    4.  **Disable Non-TLS Transports (If Possible):** If security is paramount, consider disabling or restricting the use of non-TLS transports within your `go-micro` application to enforce encrypted communication.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):** mTLS, when configured in `go-micro`, prevents attackers from intercepting and eavesdropping on communication between services using `go-micro`'s transport layer.
        *   **Service Spoofing/Impersonation (High Severity):** mTLS ensures that `go-micro` services are communicating with authenticated and authorized counterparts, preventing malicious service impersonation at the transport level.
        *   **Eavesdropping (High Severity):** mTLS encrypts all communication handled by `go-micro`'s transport, protecting sensitive data exchanged between services.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (High Impact) for inter-service communication managed by `go-micro`.
        *   **Service Spoofing/Impersonation:** Risk reduced significantly (High Impact) at the transport layer for `go-micro` services.
        *   **Eavesdropping:** Risk reduced significantly (High Impact) for data transmitted via `go-micro` communication.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   TLS might be used for external service communication outside of `go-micro`, but mTLS is not configured within `go-micro`'s transport layer for inter-service calls.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Configure `go-micro`'s gRPC or HTTP transport options to enable mTLS with appropriate certificates and keys.
        *   Set `Secure(true)` option for all `go-micro` clients and servers.
        *   Establish a certificate management process for `go-micro` services.
        *   Update deployment configurations to include certificate paths and enable mTLS in `go-micro` services.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authentication and Authorization using Go-Micro Interceptors](./mitigation_strategies/authentication_and_authorization_using_go-micro_interceptors.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Authentication Interceptors in Go-Micro:** Create `go-micro` interceptors (both client and server-side) to handle authentication for inter-service calls.
        *   **JWT Verification Interceptor:** Develop a server-side interceptor that extracts JWTs from request headers, verifies their signature and validity, and authenticates the calling service based on the token's claims.
        *   **Token Injection Interceptor:** Create a client-side interceptor that retrieves a JWT for the calling service and injects it into the request headers before sending the request to another `go-micro` service.
    2.  **Implement Authorization Interceptors in Go-Micro:** Build `go-micro` server-side interceptors to enforce authorization policies.
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Interceptor:** Develop an interceptor that checks the roles or permissions of the authenticated service (obtained from the JWT) and compares them against the required roles for accessing the requested service endpoint.
        *   **Policy-Based Authorization Interceptor:** Implement an interceptor that evaluates more complex authorization policies based on attributes of the request, the calling service, and the target service.
    3.  **Apply Interceptors Globally or Per-Service in Go-Micro:** Configure `go-micro` to apply these authentication and authorization interceptors either globally to all services or selectively to specific services or endpoints based on security requirements.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Services (High Severity):** `go-micro` interceptors enforce authentication and authorization, preventing unauthorized services from accessing protected endpoints within other `go-micro` services.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Authorization interceptors in `go-micro` limit access based on roles or policies, reducing the risk of compromised services gaining elevated privileges.
        *   **Data Breaches due to Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** By controlling access at the `go-micro` service level, interceptors protect sensitive data from unauthorized inter-service access.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Services:** Risk reduced significantly (High Impact) by enforcing authentication and authorization within `go-micro` communication flow.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced (Medium Impact) by implementing fine-grained access control using `go-micro` interceptors.
        *   **Data Breaches due to Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced significantly (High Impact) by securing inter-service communication at the application level using `go-micro` features.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic API keys might be used outside of `go-micro`, but no interceptor-based authentication or authorization is implemented within `go-micro` itself.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Develop `go-micro` client and server interceptors for JWT-based authentication.
        *   Implement `go-micro` server interceptors for role-based or policy-based authorization.
        *   Configure `go-micro` services to use these interceptors globally or selectively.
        *   Establish a mechanism for issuing and managing JWTs for `go-micro` services.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization at Go-API Gateway](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_at_go-api_gateway.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Validation Rules for Go-API Endpoints:** For each API endpoint exposed through `go-api`, define comprehensive input validation rules. This includes validating request headers, query parameters, request body (based on content type), and path parameters.
    2.  **Implement Go-API Middleware for Input Validation:** Utilize `go-api`'s middleware capabilities to implement input validation logic.
        *   **Custom Middleware Functions:** Develop custom middleware functions in Go that can be plugged into `go-api` to perform validation checks based on defined rules. These middleware functions can inspect the incoming request and reject invalid requests.
        *   **Leverage Validation Libraries:** Integrate Go validation libraries within the middleware to simplify the validation process and handle various data types and formats.
    3.  **Configure Go-API to Reject Invalid Requests:** Ensure that the validation middleware in `go-api` is configured to reject requests that fail validation. Return appropriate HTTP error codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request) and informative error messages to clients.
    4.  **Logging of Validation Failures in Go-API:** Configure `go-api` to log all input validation failures. This logging is crucial for security monitoring, debugging, and identifying potential attack attempts.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Injection Attacks (SQL Injection, Command Injection, etc.) (High Severity):** Input validation in `go-api` prevents injection attacks from reaching backend services by filtering malicious input at the gateway level.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity):** `go-api` gateway-level validation can reduce the risk of XSS by sanitizing or rejecting potentially malicious input before it reaches backend services.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** `go-api` input validation can help prevent certain types of DoS attacks by rejecting malformed or oversized requests early at the gateway.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (High Impact) by filtering malicious input at the `go-api` gateway.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Risk reduced (Medium Impact) by sanitizing or rejecting potentially malicious input at the `go-api` gateway.

        *   Develop custom middleware functions for `go-api` to perform input validation.
        *   Define validation rules for all API endpoints exposed through `go-api`.
        *   Configure `go-api` to use the validation middleware and reject invalid requests.
        *   Set up logging for validation failures in `go-api`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection in Go-API Gateway](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_ddos_protection_in_go-api_gateway.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Go-API Middleware for Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting in `go-api` using middleware.
        *   **Custom Rate Limiting Middleware:** Develop custom middleware in Go that can be integrated into `go-api` to enforce rate limits based on IP address, client identifier, or API endpoint.
        *   **Leverage Rate Limiting Libraries:** Use existing Go rate limiting libraries within the middleware to simplify the implementation of rate limiting algorithms (e.g., token bucket, leaky bucket).
    2.  **Configure Rate Limit Policies in Go-API:** Define rate limit policies within the `go-api` configuration or middleware. Specify limits per time window, burst limits, and actions to take when limits are exceeded (e.g., throttling, rejection).
    3.  **Implement Throttling or Blocking in Go-API Middleware:** Configure the rate limiting middleware in `go-api` to either throttle requests (delay them) or block requests (reject them with an error response) when rate limits are exceeded.
    4.  **Consider Go-API Integration with WAF/DDoS Services:** For more advanced DDoS protection, explore integrating `go-api` with a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or dedicated DDoS mitigation service. This might involve using `go-api` as a reverse proxy in front of a WAF or utilizing WAF/DDoS protection features offered by cloud providers.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks (High Severity):** Rate limiting in `go-api` prevents attackers from overwhelming backend services with excessive requests, ensuring service availability.
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting at the `go-api` gateway can slow down brute-force attacks against authentication endpoints or other sensitive resources exposed through the gateway.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** `go-api` rate limiting prevents malicious or unintentional overuse of application resources by controlling request rates at the gateway.
