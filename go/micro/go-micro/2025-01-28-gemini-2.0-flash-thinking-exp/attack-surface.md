# Attack Surface Analysis for micro/go-micro

## Attack Surface: [Registry Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/registry_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:**  Manipulation of the service registry, leading to redirection of service requests to malicious endpoints.

    *   **Go-Micro Contribution:** `go-micro` relies on the registry for service discovery.  A compromised registry directly impacts `go-micro`'s ability to route requests securely.

    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises the Consul registry and modifies the endpoint for the "authentication" service to point to a malicious server.  When other `go-micro` services attempt to authenticate users, they are unknowingly sending credentials to the attacker's server.

    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, Data Theft, Unauthorized Access, Service Disruption.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Registry Access:**  Enforce strong authentication and authorization for registry access. Use ACLs or RBAC provided by the registry (e.g., Consul ACLs, Etcd RBAC).
        *   **Registry Encryption:** Encrypt communication between `go-micro` services and the registry using TLS.
        *   **Regular Auditing:** Monitor registry access logs for suspicious activity and regularly audit registry configurations.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant minimal necessary permissions to services interacting with the registry.

## Attack Surface: [Transport Protocol Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/transport_protocol_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within the transport protocols used by `go-micro` for inter-service communication (e.g., gRPC, HTTP).

    *   **Go-Micro Contribution:** `go-micro` utilizes transport protocols. Vulnerabilities in these protocols directly affect the security of `go-micro` applications.

    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the gRPC library used by `go-micro` allows for a crafted request to trigger a buffer overflow, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the service.

    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure, Service Compromise.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Secure and Updated Transports:**  Utilize well-maintained and secure transport protocol implementations.
        *   **Dependency Updates:** Regularly update `go-micro` and its transport protocol dependencies (e.g., gRPC Go library) to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation within `go-micro` service handlers to mitigate potential protocol-level exploits.
        *   **Security Audits:** Conduct security audits focusing on inter-service communication and transport protocol interactions.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities during the deserialization of data exchanged between `go-micro` services, potentially leading to code execution.

    *   **Go-Micro Contribution:** `go-micro` relies on serialization/deserialization for message handling. Insecure deserialization practices within services can be exploited.

    *   **Example:** A `go-micro` service deserializes data received from another service without proper validation. A vulnerability in the deserialization process allows an attacker to craft a malicious payload that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code on the receiving service.

    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Service Compromise, Data Corruption.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Safe Deserialization Practices:** Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly. If necessary, sanitize and validate data *before* deserialization.
        *   **Use Secure Serialization Formats:** Prefer serialization formats less prone to vulnerabilities (e.g., Protocol Buffers with well-defined schemas) and use well-vetted libraries.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation *after* deserialization within service handlers to catch and reject malicious data.
        *   **Security Audits:** Review serialization and deserialization logic within `go-micro` services for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Mutual TLS (mTLS) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) for Inter-Service Communication](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_mutual_tls__mtls__or_transport_layer_security__tls__for_inter-service_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Unencrypted communication between `go-micro` services, allowing for eavesdropping and Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

    *   **Go-Micro Contribution:**  `go-micro`'s default configuration might not enforce TLS/mTLS. Developers must explicitly configure secure communication.

    *   **Example:** `go-micro` services communicate over unencrypted HTTP. An attacker on the network can intercept sensitive data like authentication tokens or business data exchanged between services.

    *   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, Data Breaches.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce TLS/mTLS:** Configure `go-micro` services to use TLS for all inter-service communication. Implement mTLS for stronger authentication and mutual verification.
        *   **Certificate Management:** Implement secure certificate generation, storage, and rotation for TLS/mTLS.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate microservices within secure network segments as an additional layer of defense.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Service-to-Service Authentication and Authorization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_service-to-service_authentication_and_authorization.md)

*   **Description:**  Weak or missing authentication and authorization mechanisms between `go-micro` services, allowing unauthorized access.

    *   **Go-Micro Contribution:** While `go-micro` provides building blocks, secure service-to-service authentication and authorization are developer responsibilities within the `go-micro` framework.

    *   **Example:** A `go-micro` order service directly calls a payment service without proper authentication. An attacker compromising the order service could then make unauthorized calls to the payment service, potentially manipulating transactions.

    *   **Impact:** Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement, Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Functionality and Data.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Service-to-Service Authentication:** Use robust authentication methods like JWTs, API keys, or mTLS client certificates to verify service identities.
        *   **Implement Authorization:** Enforce authorization policies based on service identity and roles to control access to specific endpoints and actions.
        *   **Least Privilege Principle:** Grant services only the necessary permissions to interact with other services.
        *   **Regular Security Reviews:** Review and update authentication and authorization policies as services evolve.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations in Go-Micro and Plugins](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations_in_go-micro_and_plugins.md)

*   **Description:**  Using insecure default settings in `go-micro` core or its plugins that are not suitable for production environments.

    *   **Go-Micro Contribution:** `go-micro` and its plugins might have default configurations that prioritize ease of initial setup over production security.

    *   **Example:**  A `go-micro` service exposes a debugging endpoint with sensitive information enabled by default, accessible without authentication.

    *   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Unauthorized Access, Potential System Compromise.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Review Default Configurations:** Thoroughly review default configurations of `go-micro` and all used plugins.
        *   **Harden Configurations:**  Override insecure defaults with secure production-ready settings. Disable or secure unnecessary features and endpoints.

        *   **Configuration Management:** Use configuration management tools to enforce secure configurations consistently across environments.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Go-Micro Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_go-micro_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities present in third-party libraries that `go-micro` directly or indirectly depends upon.

    *   **Go-Micro Contribution:** `go-micro` relies on a set of Go libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can introduce security risks into `go-micro` applications.

    *   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a widely used logging library that `go-micro` depends on. Applications using vulnerable versions of `go-micro` become susceptible to exploitation.

    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure, Data Breaches, Service Compromise.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Management:** Utilize Go modules or similar dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies.
