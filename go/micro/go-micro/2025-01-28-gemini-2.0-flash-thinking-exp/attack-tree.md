```

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Registry Authentication Weakness (if enabled) (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_registry_authentication_weakness__if_enabled___high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Name:** Registry Authentication Bypass via Weak Credentials
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Description:** Attacker attempts to gain access to the service registry by exploiting weak, default, or leaked credentials. If the registry uses authentication, but it's poorly configured or uses easily guessable credentials, attackers can compromise it.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for registry access.
        *   Avoid default credentials and change them immediately upon deployment.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication for registry access.
        *   Regularly audit registry access logs for suspicious activity.
        *   Consider certificate-based authentication for stronger security.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Inject Malicious Service Information (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/2__inject_malicious_service_information__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Name:** Registry Poisoning via Malicious Service Registration
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if registry access gained)
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Description:** Once the attacker gains access to the registry (e.g., through authentication bypass), they can register a malicious service with an endpoint they control. When legitimate services attempt to discover and communicate with the intended service, they might be redirected to the attacker's malicious service, leading to data theft, service disruption, or further compromise.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Secure registry access as described above.
        *   Implement service registration validation and authorization to prevent unauthorized service registration.
        *   Monitor registry for unexpected or suspicious service registrations.
        *   Use mutual TLS for service-to-registry communication to ensure authenticity.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Network Sniffing (if unencrypted) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/3__network_sniffing__if_unencrypted___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Name:** Broker/Transport Eavesdropping via Network Sniffing
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if no TLS)
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Broker), High (Transport - potential credential theft)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Description:** If communication between services and the broker, or between services directly (transport), is not encrypted using TLS/SSL, an attacker on the same network can use network sniffing tools to capture network traffic and eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all broker connections.**
        *   **Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all inter-service communication (transport).**
        *   Implement network segmentation to limit the attacker's network access.

    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Description:** Similar to registry authentication bypass, attackers can attempt to bypass broker authentication by using weak, default, or leaked credentials. Successful bypass allows unauthorized access to the message broker.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for broker access.
        *   Avoid default credentials and change them immediately upon deployment.
        *   Implement access control lists (ACLs) to restrict broker access.
        *   Regularly audit broker access logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Broker Authorization Bypass (if enabled) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/6__broker_authorization_bypass__if_enabled___high-risk_path_.md)

    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Description:** Even if authentication is in place, if the broker or services do not implement proper message signing and verification, an attacker with access to the broker (or even network access) might be able to forge messages and send them as if they originated from a legitimate service.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement message signing and verification mechanisms.
        *   Use access control lists (ACLs) to restrict message publishing and subscription permissions.
        *   Consider using broker features for message integrity and authenticity.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Send Malicious Messages to Services (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/7__send_malicious_messages_to_services__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Name:** Message Injection/Spoofing leading to Service Compromise
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if message injection possible)
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Description:** If message injection or spoofing is successful, attackers can send malicious messages to services. These messages can be crafted to exploit service logic flaws, cause denial of service, manipulate data, or trigger other malicious actions within the services.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Prevent message injection and spoofing by implementing strong authentication, authorization, and message signing (as mentioned above).
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization in service handlers to prevent processing of malicious messages.
        *   Design services to be resilient to unexpected or malicious input.
