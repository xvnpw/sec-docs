# Attack Surface Analysis for micro/go-micro

## Attack Surface: [Registry Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/registry_poisoning.md)

**Description:** A malicious actor registers fake service instances with the service discovery registry.

**How go-micro Contributes:** `go-micro` relies on a central registry (like Consul, Etcd, or Kubernetes) for service discovery. If this registry lacks proper authentication and authorization for registration, anyone can register services, directly impacting how `go-micro` services discover each other.

**Example:** An attacker registers a fake "payment" service with a malicious endpoint. When a legitimate service using `go-micro`'s service discovery tries to call the "payment" service, it might connect to the attacker's endpoint, leading to data theft or manipulation.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, redirection of sensitive operations to malicious endpoints.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement authentication and authorization for service registration in the chosen registry.
*   Use a private or secured registry accessible only to authorized services.
*   Implement service verification mechanisms within `go-micro` services to ensure the authenticity of discovered services before communication.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Inter-Service Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_inter-service_communication.md)

**Description:** Communication between microservices is not encrypted, allowing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

**How go-micro Contributes:** `go-micro` supports various transports (e.g., gRPC, HTTP). If TLS/SSL is not explicitly configured within the `go-micro` transport options, communication happens in plain text.

**Example:** Sensitive data like user credentials or financial information is transmitted between `go-micro` services over an unencrypted gRPC connection, allowing an attacker on the network to intercept and read this data.

**Impact:** Data breach, man-in-the-middle attacks, compromise of sensitive information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Always configure TLS/SSL for all inter-service communication using `go-micro`'s transport options (e.g., setting `Secure: true` in transport options).
*   Enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication between `go-micro` services.
*   Regularly review `go-micro` transport configurations to ensure security settings are enabled.

## Attack Surface: [Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/serializationdeserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the serialization format used for inter-service communication.

**How go-micro Contributes:** `go-micro` defaults to Protocol Buffers (protobuf), but allows using other codecs by setting the `ContentType` option in requests. Vulnerabilities in the chosen codec's deserialization process can lead to remote code execution or other issues when a `go-micro` service receives malicious payloads.

**Example:** A `go-micro` service using a vulnerable version of a JSON serialization library receives a crafted JSON payload that exploits a deserialization flaw, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the service's machine.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep the serialization libraries used by `go-micro` updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Carefully evaluate and choose serialization formats for `go-micro` communication, considering their security implications.
*   Implement input validation and sanitization within `go-micro` service handlers even before deserialization where possible.

## Attack Surface: [API Gateway Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/api_gateway_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configured routes or security settings in the `go-micro` API gateway expose internal services or functionalities unintentionally.

**How go-micro Contributes:** `go-micro` provides an API gateway component. Misconfiguration of routing rules defined within the gateway, authentication middleware not properly configured, or lack of rate limiting can create vulnerabilities directly within the `go-micro` ecosystem.

**Example:** An API gateway route in a `go-micro` application is configured to directly expose an internal service's endpoint without proper authentication, allowing unauthorized external access to sensitive data or operations.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breach, exposure of internal functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring API gateway routes in `go-micro`.
*   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms at the `go-micro` API gateway level using middleware or handlers.
*   Regularly review and audit `go-micro` API gateway configurations.
*   Implement rate limiting and other security measures within the `go-micro` API gateway to prevent abuse.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Service Authentication/Authorization](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_service_authenticationauthorization.md)

**Description:** `go-micro` services can communicate with each other without proper authentication or authorization checks.

**How go-micro Contributes:** While `go-micro` provides mechanisms for authentication (e.g., using the `client.Auth` and `server.Auth` options), developers need to explicitly implement and enforce these checks in their service handlers. If not implemented, any `go-micro` service can call any other `go-micro` service.

**Example:** A "reporting" `go-micro` service can call the "user management" `go-micro` service's endpoint to delete user accounts without proper authorization checks, leading to unauthorized data modification.

**Impact:** Data manipulation, unauthorized access, privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement authentication and authorization checks for all inter-service communication using `go-micro`'s provided mechanisms or custom solutions.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege, granting `go-micro` services only the necessary permissions.
*   Use a consistent authentication and authorization strategy across all `go-micro` services.
