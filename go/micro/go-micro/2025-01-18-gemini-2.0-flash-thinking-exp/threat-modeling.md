# Threat Model Analysis for micro/go-micro

## Threat: [Registry Poisoning](./threats/registry_poisoning.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `go-micro` service registry. They might register malicious service endpoints with the same name as legitimate services, or modify the addresses of existing services to point to attacker-controlled infrastructure. This could be achieved by exploiting weak authentication on the registry or vulnerabilities in the registry's API exposed by `go-micro`'s registry interface.
    * **Impact:** Clients attempting to connect to legitimate services are redirected to malicious endpoints, potentially leading to data theft, manipulation, or denial of service.
    * **Affected go-micro Component:** `registry` package, specifically the functions responsible for service registration and lookup.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization for all registry operations using `go-micro`'s authentication mechanisms or integrating with external authentication providers.
        * Use secure communication channels (e.g., TLS) between services and the registry, configuring `go-micro`'s transport options accordingly.
        * Regularly audit the registry for unexpected or unauthorized entries.
        * Consider using a registry with built-in access control mechanisms and ensure `go-micro` is configured to utilize them.

## Threat: [Insecure Inter-Service Communication](./threats/insecure_inter-service_communication.md)

* **Description:** Communication between microservices managed by `go-micro` is not encrypted. An attacker on the network could eavesdrop on the traffic, intercepting sensitive data being exchanged, such as user credentials, API keys, or business data. This exploits the lack of enforced encryption within `go-micro`'s transport layer.
    * **Impact:** Confidential information is exposed, potentially leading to data breaches, identity theft, or unauthorized access to resources.
    * **Affected go-micro Component:** `transport` package, specifically the underlying transport implementation (e.g., gRPC, HTTP) configured within `go-micro`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enforce the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security) for all inter-service communication by configuring `go-micro`'s transport options to use secure connections.
        * Properly configure TLS certificates and ensure they are regularly updated.
        * Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication between services, leveraging `go-micro`'s authentication features in conjunction with transport security.

## Threat: [Codec Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/codec_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** The codec used for message serialization and deserialization (e.g., Protocol Buffers, JSON) within `go-micro` has vulnerabilities. An attacker could send a specially crafted message that, when deserialized by a service, leads to a crash, denial of service, or even remote code execution. This exploits flaws in the codec's parsing logic as used by `go-micro`.
    * **Impact:** Service disruption, potential compromise of individual services, or even the entire application.
    * **Affected go-micro Component:** `codec` package and the specific codec implementation being used within `go-micro`'s service definitions.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep the codec libraries used by `go-micro` up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        * Implement input validation even after deserialization within `go-micro` service handlers to catch unexpected or malicious data.
        * Consider using codecs with known security properties and a strong security track record when defining `go-micro` service contracts.

## Threat: [Message Tampering](./threats/message_tampering.md)

* **Description:** An attacker intercepts messages in transit between `go-micro` managed services and modifies their content before they reach the intended recipient. This could be done if inter-service communication is not properly secured by `go-micro`'s transport layer.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions performed by services based on the modified messages, or manipulation of application logic.
    * **Affected go-micro Component:** `transport` package and potentially custom interceptors within `go-micro`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enforce the use of TLS within `go-micro` to prevent interception.
        * Implement message signing or encryption within `go-micro` service logic or using interceptors to ensure message integrity and authenticity.

## Threat: [Insecure Custom Interceptors](./threats/insecure_custom_interceptors.md)

* **Description:** Developers implement custom interceptors within `go-micro` that contain security vulnerabilities. For example, an interceptor might incorrectly handle authentication provided by `go-micro`, bypass authorization checks, or leak sensitive information in logs.
    * **Impact:** Weakening of the overall security posture, potential for unauthorized access, or information disclosure.
    * **Affected go-micro Component:** `client` and `server` packages, specifically the interceptor functionality provided by `go-micro`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly review and test all custom interceptor logic.
        * Follow secure coding practices when developing interceptors within the `go-micro` framework.
        * Ensure interceptors correctly handle errors and exceptions.

## Threat: [Weak Authentication Configuration](./threats/weak_authentication_configuration.md)

* **Description:** The built-in authentication mechanisms in `go-micro` are not configured securely. This could involve using default or weak secrets, insecure hashing algorithms, or not properly validating authentication tokens provided by `go-micro`'s auth package.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can easily bypass authentication and impersonate legitimate services or users.
    * **Affected go-micro Component:** `auth` package.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use strong, randomly generated secrets for authentication within `go-micro`.
        * Choose secure authentication algorithms and protocols supported by `go-micro`.
        * Regularly rotate authentication keys and secrets managed by `go-micro`.
        * Properly configure the `auth` middleware and ensure it is applied to all relevant services within the `go-micro` application.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Registry Overload](./threats/denial_of_service_via_registry_overload.md)

* **Description:** An attacker floods the `go-micro` service registry with a large number of requests (e.g., service registrations or lookups), overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable. This exploits the registry interaction mechanisms provided by `go-micro`.
    * **Impact:** Services are unable to discover each other, leading to application downtime and failure of inter-service communication.
    * **Affected go-micro Component:** `registry` package.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement rate limiting and request throttling on the registry, potentially using `go-micro`'s middleware capabilities.
        * Ensure the registry infrastructure is resilient and scalable.
        * Monitor registry performance and resource utilization.
