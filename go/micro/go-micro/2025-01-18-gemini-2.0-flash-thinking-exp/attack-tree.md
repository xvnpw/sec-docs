## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Service Discovery Mechanism (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_service_discovery_mechanism__critical_node_.md)

**Attacker's Goal:** To manipulate the service discovery process to redirect communication to a malicious service or disrupt legitimate service interactions.
*   **Key Critical Node:** Exploit Registry Vulnerability (e.g., lack of authentication/authorization for registration) **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits the lack of proper authentication or authorization controls on the service registry. This allows them to register a malicious service with the same name or a similar name to a legitimate service.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the specific registry implementation and its security configuration. If default settings are used or security best practices are not followed, the likelihood increases.
    *   **Impact:** Moderate - Can lead to service disruption as legitimate services might connect to the malicious service. Data interception or manipulation is possible depending on the malicious service's actions.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Requires understanding the registry's API and how to register services. Readily available tools might exist for common registry implementations.
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate - Basic understanding of APIs and networking concepts is required.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate - Requires monitoring the service registry for unexpected registrations or changes. Anomaly detection based on service registration patterns can be helpful.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Inter-Service Communication (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_inter-service_communication__critical_node_.md)

**Attacker's Goal:** To intercept, manipulate, or disrupt communication between microservices to gain unauthorized access, exfiltrate data, or cause service failures.
*   **Key High-Risk Node:** Exploit Lack of TLS Encryption (if not enforced) **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If TLS encryption is not enforced for inter-service communication, attackers on the network can eavesdrop on the traffic, potentially capturing sensitive data in transit.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High - Depends on the organization's security practices and whether TLS enforcement is a standard policy.
    *   **Impact:** Significant - Exposes all communication in plaintext, including potentially sensitive data like authentication tokens, user credentials, and business data.
    *   **Effort:** Minimal - Passive interception using readily available network sniffing tools.
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Beginner - Basic understanding of networking and packet capture is sufficient.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy - Can be detected with network monitoring tools that identify unencrypted traffic.
*   **Key High-Risk Node:** Message Injection
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious payloads into service calls. This can exploit vulnerabilities in the receiving service's input validation or processing logic, potentially leading to code execution or data manipulation.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the robustness of input validation and sanitization implemented by the receiving services.
    *   **Impact:** Significant - Can lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or unauthorized modifications.
    *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires understanding the service's API and identifying potential injection points. Crafting effective payloads might require more skill.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires understanding of common injection vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, SQL injection if applicable within the service logic).
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Difficult - Requires deep inspection of message content and potentially behavioral analysis to detect malicious patterns.
*   **Key High-Risk Node:** Exploit Codec Vulnerabilities
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers send maliciously crafted data that exploits vulnerabilities in the codec used for message serialization and deserialization (e.g., deserialization attacks). Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution on the receiving service.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium - Depends on the specific codec being used and whether known vulnerabilities exist. Keeping codec libraries up-to-date is crucial for mitigation.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Can lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the affected service.
    *   **Effort:** High - Requires deep understanding of the codec's implementation and potential vulnerabilities. Crafting effective exploits often requires advanced skills and research.
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert - Requires expertise in software vulnerability research and exploitation techniques.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Difficult - Deserialization attacks often occur at a low level and can be challenging to detect with traditional security monitoring tools. Requires specialized security solutions and deep understanding of the application's internal workings.
