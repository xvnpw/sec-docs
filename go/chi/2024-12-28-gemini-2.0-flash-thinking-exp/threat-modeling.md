## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving `go-chi/chi`

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Middleware Bypass** | An attacker finds a way to circumvent one or more middleware functions in the `chi` middleware chain. This could be due to vulnerabilities in middleware logic **or flaws in how `chi`'s middleware chaining is implemented or configured**, allowing attackers to bypass security checks by crafting specific requests or exploiting ordering issues. | Circumvention of security controls (authentication, authorization, input validation), leading to unauthorized access or actions. | `chi.Mux` (middleware chaining) | Critical | Thoroughly review and test all middleware functions. **Ensure middleware is correctly ordered and that `chi`'s middleware handling logic is not exploitable.** Avoid relying solely on middleware for critical security checks. Ensure all routes that require specific middleware are correctly configured within `chi`. |
| **Middleware Resource Exhaustion DoS** | An attacker triggers a route that executes a poorly written middleware function that consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory, network) without proper limits. **This is exacerbated by `chi`'s handling of requests and execution of the middleware chain.** Repeated requests can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service. | Application slowdown or complete denial of service due to resource exhaustion within middleware. | `chi.Mux` (request handling, middleware execution) | High | Implement resource limits and timeouts within middleware functions. Monitor middleware performance and resource usage. Ensure middleware handles errors and potential resource leaks gracefully. **Consider `chi`'s request handling limits and timeouts as well.** |
| **Route Hijacking/Shadowing** | An attacker crafts requests that match an unintended route due to ambiguous or overlapping route definitions. **This directly exploits `chi`'s route matching algorithm and the order of route registration.** This can happen by exploiting the order of route registration or overly broad route patterns defined within `chi.Mux`. | Unauthorized access to resources, execution of unintended handlers, potential data manipulation or disclosure. | `chi.Mux` (route matching logic) | High | Define routes with clear and non-overlapping patterns. **Be extremely mindful of the order of route registration within `chi.Mux`.** Use more specific routes where needed. Leverage `chi.Mux.Mount()` for clear separation of sub-routers. Test route matching with various inputs to ensure intended behavior within `chi`. |
