Here are the high and critical attack surfaces directly involving `go-chi/chi`:

*   **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal via Wildcards
    *   **Description:**  Using wildcard routes (`/*`) without proper sanitization of the captured path segment can allow attackers to access unintended files or resources on the server.
    *   **How Chi Contributes:** Chi's syntax for wildcard routes (`/*`) makes it easy to define such routes, and the captured path segment is readily available to the handler.
    *   **Example:** A route defined as `/files/*filepath` and a request like `/files/../../etc/passwd`. If the handler directly uses `filepath` to access the file system, it can lead to reading sensitive files.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, access to sensitive files, potential for command execution if the accessed file is executable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize the captured path segment before using it to access resources.
        *   Use allow-lists of allowed paths or filenames instead of relying on blacklists.
        *   Avoid directly using the captured path segment for file system operations; use secure file access methods.

*   **Attack Surface:** Parameter Injection via Path Parameters
    *   **Description:**  Path parameters extracted by Chi (e.g., `/users/{userID}`) can be used to inject unexpected values if not properly validated and sanitized in the handler.
    *   **How Chi Contributes:** Chi provides a straightforward way to define and extract path parameters using curly braces in the route definition and the `chi.URLParam()` function.
    *   **Example:** A route `/users/{id}` where the `id` parameter is directly used in a database query without sanitization. An attacker could provide a malicious `id` value to perform SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:**  Various injection attacks (SQL injection, command injection, etc.), depending on how the parameter is used in the handler.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all path parameters before using them in any operations.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Avoid directly executing commands based on path parameters without proper validation.

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious or Vulnerable Middleware
    *   **Description:**  Chi's middleware chaining mechanism means that any middleware added to the chain has the potential to introduce vulnerabilities if it's malicious or contains security flaws.
    *   **How Chi Contributes:** Chi's core design relies on middleware for request processing, making it a central point for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A logging middleware that inadvertently logs sensitive request data, or a custom authentication middleware with a bypass vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, data manipulation, authentication bypass, application compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability in the middleware).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet all middleware used in the application, including third-party libraries.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom middleware.
        *   Regularly update middleware dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Incorrect Middleware Ordering
    *   **Description:** The order in which middleware is added to the Chi router is crucial. Incorrect ordering can lead to security bypasses or unexpected behavior.
    *   **How Chi Contributes:** Chi executes middleware in the order they are added to the router.
    *   **Example:** Placing an authorization middleware *after* an authentication middleware. This could allow unauthenticated requests to reach the authorization middleware, potentially leading to bypasses if the authorization logic isn't robust enough.
    *   **Impact:** Security bypasses, unintended access to resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully plan the order of middleware execution, ensuring that security-related middleware (authentication, authorization) is placed early in the chain.
        *   Document the intended middleware order and its rationale.

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposure of Vulnerable Sub-applications (Mounting)
    *   **Description:** Chi's `Mount` function allows mounting other handlers or routers at specific paths. If a mounted application has its own vulnerabilities, Chi effectively exposes those vulnerabilities to the main application's attack surface.
    *   **How Chi Contributes:** Chi's `Mount` function facilitates the integration of other HTTP handlers and routers.
    *   **Example:** Mounting an older, unpatched application at `/legacy` which contains known security flaws.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the mounted application, potentially leading to compromise of the main application or access to shared resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerabilities in the mounted application).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that any applications or handlers mounted using `chi.Mount` are secure and regularly updated.
        *   Consider isolating mounted applications if they are not fully trusted.
