# Threat Model Analysis for urfave/cli

## Threat: [Command Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/command_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Command Injection Vulnerabilities
*   **Description:**
    *   Attacker crafts malicious input for command-line arguments or flags.
    *   Application *incorrectly* uses `urfave/cli` parsed input to construct and execute external commands via the system shell (e.g., using `os/exec` with shell execution).
    *   Due to lack of proper sanitization of `urfave/cli` input, attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the executed shell command.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Full system compromise if the application runs with elevated privileges.
    *   **High:** Data breach, data modification, or data deletion.
    *   **High:** Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **CLI Component Affected:**
    *   Application's logic that constructs and executes external commands (developer-implemented), directly using arguments and flags parsed by `urfave/cli` (`cli.Args`, `cli.Flags`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (if command execution is involved and input from `urfave/cli` is not properly handled before command construction).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Shell Execution:**  Best practice is to use `exec.Command` with separate arguments, directly passing slices of strings, to avoid shell interpretation of metacharacters. This prevents the shell from processing injected commands.
    *   **Input Sanitization and Escaping (Avoid if possible):** If shell execution is absolutely unavoidable, extremely carefully sanitize and escape user input *obtained from `urfave/cli`* before incorporating it into shell commands. This is complex and error-prone, so avoiding shell execution is strongly preferred.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges. Even if command injection occurs, the impact is limited by the application's user privileges.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal Vulnerabilities
*   **Description:**
    *   Attacker provides manipulated file paths as command-line arguments or flags *parsed by `urfave/cli`* (e.g., using `../`).
    *   Application uses these paths, obtained directly from `urfave/cli` parsing, to access files without proper validation.
    *   Due to lack of validation of paths provided via `urfave/cli`, attacker can access files outside the intended directory or restricted areas.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files.
    *   **High:** Information disclosure of potentially critical data.
    *   **Medium to High:** Potential for further exploitation if accessed files contain sensitive data or configuration that can be leveraged for other attacks.
*   **CLI Component Affected:**
    *   Application's logic that handles file paths obtained from `urfave/cli` arguments or flags (developer-implemented), directly using `cli.Args` or `cli.Flags`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if the application handles file paths from `urfave/cli` input and file access controls are insufficient).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Path Validation and Sanitization:**
        *   **Canonicalization:** Immediately after obtaining file paths from `urfave/cli`, convert them to their canonical form using `filepath.Clean` (or similar functions in other languages) to resolve symbolic links and remove redundant path separators, mitigating basic traversal attempts.
        *   **Restrict Access to Allowed Directories:** Implement strict checks to ensure that accessed files are within a predefined allowed directory or a set of allowed directories. Verify paths *after obtaining them from `urfave/cli`* and before file access, using functions like `filepath.Dir` and `strings.HasPrefix` in Go to confirm paths are within allowed boundaries.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (File System):** Run the application with minimal file system permissions. Only grant the application access to the directories and files it absolutely needs to function, limiting the scope of potential path traversal exploitation.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities in `urfave/cli` and its dependencies
*   **Description:**
    *   `urfave/cli` library itself or its dependencies contain known security vulnerabilities.
    *   Application uses a vulnerable version of `urfave/cli` or its dependencies.
    *   Attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to directly compromise the application *through the `urfave/cli` library*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Application compromise, potentially leading to remote code execution if a vulnerability in `urfave/cli` allows it.
    *   **High:** Denial of Service (DoS) if a vulnerability in `urfave/cli` can be triggered by specific input or actions.
    *   **High:** Information disclosure if a vulnerability in `urfave/cli` allows access to sensitive data.
*   **CLI Component Affected:**
    *   `urfave/cli` library code itself.
    *   Dependencies of `urfave/cli` library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies, can be Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability in `urfave/cli` or its dependencies).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use Go modules or a similar dependency management tool to precisely track and manage dependencies, including `urfave/cli`.
    *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:**  Proactively and regularly update `urfave/cli` and *all* its dependencies to the latest versions. This is crucial for patching known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate vulnerability scanning tools into your development and CI/CD pipelines to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in `urfave/cli` and its dependencies.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases specifically for `urfave/cli` and its Go ecosystem dependencies to stay informed about newly discovered threats and necessary updates.
