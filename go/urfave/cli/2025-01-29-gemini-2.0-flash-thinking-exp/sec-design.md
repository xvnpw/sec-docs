# BUSINESS POSTURE

The urfave/cli repository provides a simple, fast, and fun package for building command line apps in Go. It is designed to make command-line interface development easier and more enjoyable for Go developers.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Simplify command-line application development in Go.
- Provide a robust and feature-rich library for parsing command-line arguments and options.
- Offer a developer-friendly API that is easy to learn and use.
- Ensure the library is performant and efficient.
- Maintain the library's stability and reliability for widespread adoption.
- Foster a community around the library to encourage contributions and improvements.

Business Risks:
- Vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited by applications using it, leading to security issues in those applications.
- Poorly designed or implemented features could lead to instability or unexpected behavior in applications using the library.
- Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to the library becoming outdated or unusable.
- Incompatibility with future versions of Go or other dependencies could break existing applications.
- Security vulnerabilities introduced through dependencies or build process.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Code review process for contributions (inferred from typical open-source project practices).
- security control: Unit and integration testing (inferred from typical software development practices).
- security control: Dependency management using `go.mod` and `go.sum` to track and verify dependencies.
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in dependencies that are not directly controlled by the project.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated static application security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
- security control: Implement dependency vulnerability scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
- security control: Regularly update dependencies to incorporate security patches.
- security control: Consider fuzz testing to identify potential input validation vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a CLI library itself. Authentication is typically handled by the applications built using the library.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to a CLI library itself. Authorization is typically handled by the applications built using the library based on parsed commands and options.
- Input Validation: The library must perform robust input validation to prevent vulnerabilities such as command injection or unexpected behavior due to malformed input. This is critical as the library is designed to parse user-provided command-line arguments.
- Cryptography: Not a primary requirement for a CLI parsing library. Cryptographic functionalities would be implemented by applications using the library if needed. However, if the library provides any utilities that involve handling sensitive data (e.g., parsing configuration files with secrets), secure handling of cryptographic keys and data should be considered.

## DEPLOYMENT

Deployment of a library like `urfave/cli` is not about deploying the library itself, but rather deploying applications that *use* the library. CLI applications built with `urfave/cli` can be deployed in various ways depending on their purpose and target environment. Common deployment methods include:

- **Standalone Executables:** Compiling the Go application into a single executable binary that can be distributed and run on target operating systems. This is the most common deployment method for CLI tools.
- **Containerized Deployment (Docker):** Packaging the CLI application within a Docker container for consistent execution across different environments. This is suitable for more complex applications or when environment isolation is required.
- **Package Managers (OS-specific):** Distributing the CLI application through operating system package managers (e.g., apt, yum, brew) for easier installation and updates on specific platforms.
- **Cloud Functions/Serverless:** In some cases, CLI-like functionality can be adapted and deployed as serverless functions in cloud environments, triggered by events or API calls.

For simplicity, let's focus on the **Standalone Executables** deployment scenario.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Development and maintenance of the `urfave/cli` library itself.
- Usage of the `urfave/cli` library by developers to build CLI applications.
- Distribution and consumption of CLI applications built with `urfave/cli`.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
- Source code of the `urfave/cli` library: High sensitivity. Compromise could lead to vulnerabilities being introduced into the library and propagated to many applications.
- Build artifacts (library packages, executables): Medium sensitivity. Integrity is important to ensure users are downloading and using legitimate and uncompromised versions.
- Dependency information: Low to Medium sensitivity. Knowing dependencies can help attackers identify potential vulnerabilities, but this information is often publicly available.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- What is the process for reviewing and merging code contributions, especially from external contributors?
- Are there any specific security considerations or threat models that have been previously considered for `urfave/cli`?

Assumptions:
- The project aims to follow secure coding practices in general software development.
- Code contributions are reviewed before being merged, although the depth and rigor of security-focused reviews are unknown.
- The project relies on the Go language's inherent security features and standard library security.
- The primary users of this design document are interested in understanding the security posture of applications built using `urfave/cli`, and potentially the library itself.
- The business posture is focused on providing a useful and reliable tool for the Go developer community, with security being an important but potentially secondary consideration compared to functionality and ease of use for a library of this nature.
