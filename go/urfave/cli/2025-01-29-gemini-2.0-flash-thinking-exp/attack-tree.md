## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Command Injection](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__command_injection.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. This is a critical node because successful command injection can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **High-Risk Paths leading to Command Injection:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Pass unsanitized arguments to shell commands (e.g., `os/exec.Command`):**
        *   **How it works:** The application takes user-provided arguments (from CLI arguments, flags, or subcommand arguments) and directly passes them to shell commands without proper sanitization or escaping.
        *   **Example:**  If the application executes `os/exec.Command("/bin/sh", "-c", "process_file " + userInput)` and `userInput` is crafted as `; rm -rf /`, the attacker can execute `rm -rf /` on the system.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** High likelihood due to common programming errors, critical impact leading to full system compromise, low effort for exploitation, and intermediate skill level required.
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Pass unsanitized flag values to shell commands:**
        *   **How it works:** Similar to argument injection, but the vulnerability lies in how flag values are handled when passed to shell commands.
        *   **Example:** Application uses a flag `--output-dir` and executes `os/exec.Command("/bin/sh", "-c", "create_output --dir=" + outputDirFlag)`.  If `outputDirFlag` is `; malicious_command`, it's injected.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Same risk profile as argument injection.
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Pass subcommand arguments unsanitized to shell commands:**
        *   **How it works:**  When using subcommands, arguments provided to subcommands can also be vulnerable if not sanitized before shell execution.
        *   **Example:**  `app subcommand process --file <filename>`. If `<filename>` is unsanitized and used in a shell command within the `process` subcommand logic.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Same risk profile as argument and flag injection.
    *   **[ACTION] Leverage `urfave/cli` features for unintended command execution (e.g., misconfigured `BashComplete`):**
        *   **How it works:**  `urfave/cli` allows custom bash completion. If this feature is misconfigured or the completion script itself is vulnerable, it can be exploited to execute commands during tab completion.
        *   **Example:** A malicious completion script could execute commands when a user tries to autocomplete a command or argument.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Lower likelihood due to less common usage of custom completion and misconfiguration requirement, but critical impact if exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Path Traversal](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__path_traversal.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to access files or directories outside of the intended scope by manipulating file or directory paths provided as input.
*   **High-Risk Paths leading to Path Traversal:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Provide relative paths in arguments to access files outside intended scope:**
        *   **How it works:** The application accepts file paths as arguments and uses them to access files. If relative paths like `../../sensitive_file` are not properly validated and sanitized, attackers can traverse up the directory structure to access sensitive files.
        *   **Example:**  `app process --input ../../etc/passwd`. If the application reads the file specified by `--input` without path validation, it can read `/etc/passwd`.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Medium likelihood due to common oversight in path handling, medium/high impact leading to data breaches, low effort, and beginner skill level.
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Provide relative paths in arguments to access directories outside intended scope:**
        *   **How it works:** Similar to file path traversal, but targeting directories. Attackers can access or list contents of directories outside the intended scope.
        *   **Example:** `app list --dir ../../sensitive_dir`. If the application lists files in the directory specified by `--dir` without validation, it can list contents of `sensitive_dir`.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Similar risk profile to file path traversal.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Denial of Service (DoS) via Input](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__denial_of_service__dos__via_input.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities to cause a denial of service by providing malicious input that exhausts application resources or crashes the application.
*   **High-Risk Paths leading to DoS:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Provide excessively large input arguments/flags that consume memory during processing:**
        *   **How it works:**  Providing extremely large arguments or flag values can cause the application to allocate excessive memory, leading to memory exhaustion and DoS.
        *   **Example:** `app process --data <very_large_string>`. If the application loads the `--data` string into memory without limits, it can crash due to OOM.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Medium likelihood, medium impact (application DoS), low effort, beginner skill level.
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Provide input that triggers computationally expensive operations (e.g., complex regex, infinite loops in processing):**
        *   **How it works:** Crafting input that triggers computationally intensive operations within the application logic can lead to CPU exhaustion and DoS.
        *   **Example:** If the application uses a regex to validate input, providing a specially crafted string that causes catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine can lead to CPU spikes.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Medium likelihood, medium impact (application DoS), low effort, beginner/intermediate skill level.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Application Logic Flaws Exposed via CLI](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_application_logic_flaws_exposed_via_cli.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Exploiting flaws in the application's business logic that are accessible or exposed through the CLI interface.
*   **High-Risk Paths related to Application Logic Flaws:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Craft specific CLI commands and arguments to bypass intended application logic or access restricted functionalities:**
        *   **How it works:**  Attackers analyze the CLI commands and arguments to find combinations that bypass intended access controls, business rules, or workflows within the application.
        *   **Example:**  A CLI might have commands for "user" and "admin".  By carefully crafting commands or arguments, a regular user might be able to access admin functionalities.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Medium likelihood (depends on application complexity), medium/high impact (unauthorized access, data manipulation), medium effort, intermediate skill level.
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Use CLI commands to manipulate data in unintended ways, leading to data corruption or unauthorized modification:**
        *   **How it works:**  Attackers use CLI commands in sequences or with specific arguments to manipulate data in ways not intended by the application developers, leading to data corruption, integrity issues, or unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Example:**  A CLI might have commands to "create" and "update" data. By using these commands in a specific order or with crafted data, an attacker might be able to corrupt data relationships or modify data they shouldn't be able to.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Medium likelihood (depends on application logic and data handling), medium/high impact (data integrity issues, financial loss), medium effort, intermediate skill level.
