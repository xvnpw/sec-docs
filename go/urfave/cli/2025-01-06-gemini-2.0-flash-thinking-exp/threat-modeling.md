# Threat Model Analysis for urfave/cli

## Threat: [Malicious Input via Flags and Arguments](./threats/malicious_input_via_flags_and_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides crafted command-line arguments or flag values containing shell commands, escape sequences, or excessively long strings. The `urfave/cli` library, without proper handling within the application's action, passes this input, potentially leading to command injection, buffer overflows, or unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Command injection could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Buffer overflows can lead to crashes or potentially remote code execution.
    *   **Affected `urfave/cli` Component:** `cli.Flag` interface, specifically the parsing and handling of flag values before they are passed to the application's `Action` function. The `Args` function is also relevant.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Environment Variable Manipulation Leading to Configuration Changes](./threats/environment_variable_manipulation_leading_to_configuration_changes.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with control over the environment variables can modify variables that are explicitly linked to `urfave/cli` flags using the `EnvVar` option. This can alter the application's configuration as interpreted by `urfave/cli`.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can change critical application settings, such as API keys or feature flags, if these are configured through environment variables linked to `urfave/cli` flags, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected `urfave/cli` Component:** The `cli.EnvVar` option within the `cli.Flag` definition, which directly connects environment variables to flag values.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Abuse of Hook Functions for Malicious Actions](./threats/abuse_of_hook_functions_for_malicious_actions.md)

*   **Description:** `urfave/cli` allows defining `Before` and `After` hook functions. If these hooks are not carefully implemented or if they rely on external data that can be manipulated (even indirectly through `urfave/cli` input), attackers might be able to inject malicious code or actions into the application's execution flow.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the application, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected `urfave/cli` Component:** `cli.App`'s `Before` and `After` hooks, and potentially `cli.Command`'s hooks, which are part of the `urfave/cli` execution lifecycle.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
