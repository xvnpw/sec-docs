# Attack Surface Analysis for urfave/cli

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Command Execution via Unsanitized Arguments](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_command_execution_via_unsanitized_arguments.md)

*   **Description:**  The application uses command-line arguments directly in system calls or shell commands without proper sanitization.
*   **How CLI Contributes:** `urfave/cli` parses and provides these arguments to the application's logic, making them available for potentially unsafe operations.
*   **Example:**  An application takes a filename as an argument and uses it in a `system()` call like `system("cat " + filename)`. A malicious user could provide an argument like `; rm -rf /`.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Full system compromise, data loss, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Never directly use user-provided input in system calls or shell commands. Use parameterized commands or dedicated libraries for specific tasks (e.g., file manipulation). Implement strict input validation and sanitization to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
    *   **Users:** Be extremely cautious about the source of commands and scripts you execute. Avoid running applications with elevated privileges unless absolutely necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Unvalidated File Paths in Arguments/Flags](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_unvalidated_file_paths_in_argumentsflags.md)

*   **Description:** The application accepts file paths as arguments or flag values and uses them without proper validation, allowing access to files outside the intended directory.
*   **How CLI Contributes:** `urfave/cli` provides the mechanism for users to supply these file paths through the command line.
*   **Example:** An application takes a `--config` flag and loads a configuration file. A user provides `--config ../../../etc/passwd`.
*   **Impact:** High - Exposure of sensitive files, potential for configuration manipulation or privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict validation of file paths. Use allow-lists of permitted directories or filenames. Canonicalize paths to resolve symbolic links and relative paths. Avoid directly concatenating user input into file paths.
    *   **Users:** Be mindful of the file paths you provide as arguments or flags. Understand the application's intended behavior regarding file access.

## Attack Surface: [Format String Vulnerabilities via Unsanitized Input in Logging/Output](./attack_surfaces/format_string_vulnerabilities_via_unsanitized_input_in_loggingoutput.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses user-provided arguments or flag values directly in formatting functions (e.g., `fmt.Printf` in Go) without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject format specifiers to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.
*   **How CLI Contributes:** `urfave/cli` makes user input readily available, increasing the risk if this input is used directly in formatting functions.
*   **Example:** An application logs a message using `fmt.Printf(user_provided_argument)`. A malicious user could provide `%x %x %x %s` as an argument to read from the stack.
*   **Impact:** High - Potential for information disclosure or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Never directly use user-provided input as the format string in formatting functions. Always use a fixed format string and pass user input as arguments to the formatting function.
    *   **Users:** Be aware that providing specific characters in arguments might trigger unexpected behavior if the application has this vulnerability.
