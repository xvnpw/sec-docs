## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via urfave/cli [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_urfavecli__critical_.md)

This is the root goal and represents the overall objective of the attacker. Successful exploitation of any of the high-risk paths leads to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Manipulate Input Arguments [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__manipulate_input_arguments__critical_.md)

This represents a broad category of attacks where the attacker aims to influence the application's behavior by providing crafted input arguments. This is a critical entry point because it's the primary way users interact with CLI applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Supply Malicious Arguments [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__supply_malicious_arguments__critical_.md)

This focuses on providing arguments that are designed to cause harm, rather than just unexpected or invalid input.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Inject Shell Commands via Arguments [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__inject_shell_commands_via_arguments__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts command-line arguments that, when processed by the application (often through insecure use of system calls or shell execution), result in the execution of arbitrary shell commands.

**Mechanism:** This typically occurs when the application directly uses user-supplied input within functions like `os/exec` in Go or similar system call interfaces without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Example:**  An argument like `--file "; rm -rf /"` could be used if the application naively constructs a shell command using the value of the `--file` argument.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insufficient Input Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insufficient_input_sanitization.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-provided arguments before using them in potentially dangerous operations (like shell execution or file system access).

**Consequence:** This allows attackers to inject malicious commands or data that the application will then execute or process.

**Mitigation:** Implementing strict input validation (e.g., whitelisting allowed characters, checking data types and formats) and sanitization (e.g., escaping shell metacharacters) is crucial.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Exploit Flag/Argument Parsing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_flagargument_parsing_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This category focuses on weaknesses in how the `urfave/cli` library or the application itself parses and handles command-line flags and arguments.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Exploit Flag Value Handling [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_flag_value_handling__critical_.md)

This specifically targets vulnerabilities related to how the application processes the values provided to command-line flags.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Provide Malicious Values to Flags [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__provide_malicious_values_to_flags__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker provides carefully crafted, malicious values to command-line flags with the intent of triggering unintended behavior, code injection, or logic errors.

**Mechanism:** This can occur if the application trusts flag values without proper validation or if the flag values are used in a way that introduces vulnerabilities (e.g., using a flag value as a file path without checking for path traversal).

**Example:** A flag like `--output-file ../../../sensitive_data.txt` could be used to attempt a path traversal attack if the application doesn't properly sanitize the `--output-file` value.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Code Injection or Logic Errors](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_code_injection_or_logic_errors.md)

**Attack Vector:**  By providing malicious flag values, the attacker aims to either inject executable code that the application will interpret and run, or to manipulate the application's internal logic to cause unintended and potentially harmful actions.

**Code Injection:** This could involve injecting scripts or commands that are later executed by the application.

**Logic Errors:** This could involve providing values that cause the application to make incorrect decisions or perform actions it shouldn't.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Exploit Action Handler Logic [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_action_handler_logic__critical_.md)

This focuses on vulnerabilities within the specific functions (action handlers) that are executed when a particular command or set of flags is used. These handlers contain the core application logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Trigger Vulnerabilities within Action Functions [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__trigger_vulnerabilities_within_action_functions__critical_.md)

This highlights the risk of security flaws within the code that implements the application's functionality triggered by CLI commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Supply Malicious Input to Action Logic [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__supply_malicious_input_to_action_logic__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker provides malicious input through CLI arguments or flags that are then processed by the action handler, exploiting vulnerabilities in that handler's logic.

**Mechanism:** This can involve providing input that causes buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities (less common in Go), or application-specific vulnerabilities like path traversal, SQL injection (if the action handler interacts with a database), or command injection (if the action handler executes external commands).

**Example (Path Traversal):** If an action handler takes a file path as input from a CLI argument and uses it to read a file without proper validation, an attacker could provide a path like `../../../../etc/passwd` to access sensitive system files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application-Specific Vulnerabilities Triggered by CLI Input (e.g., path traversal if a file path is taken from CLI)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application-specific_vulnerabilities_triggered_by_cli_input__e_g___path_traversal_if_a_file__28937323.md)

**Attack Vector:** This emphasizes that vulnerabilities are often specific to the application's functionality. The CLI acts as the entry point, and the attacker leverages the application's weaknesses when processing the CLI input.

**Path Traversal Example:** As mentioned above, providing manipulated file paths to access files outside the intended directory.

**Other Examples:**  If the CLI allows specifying database queries, it could be vulnerable to SQL injection. If it interacts with external services, it could be vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) if input is not properly sanitized.
