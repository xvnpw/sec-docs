# Threat Model Analysis for urfave/cli

## Threat: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Input (Indirect through `urfave/cli`)](./threats/command_injection_via_unsanitized_input__indirect_through__urfavecli__.md)

*Description:* While `urfave/cli` itself doesn't execute commands, it *parses* user input. If the application then takes this parsed input (from *any* flag type) and uses it *unsanitized* in a function like `os/exec.Command`, `syscall.Exec`, or similar, an attacker can inject shell metacharacters to execute arbitrary commands. The attacker's input is processed by `urfave/cli`, and the *result* of that processing is misused.
*Impact:*
    *   Complete system compromise.
    *   Data exfiltration.
    *   Malware installation.
    *   Lateral movement.
*Affected `urfave/cli` Component:*  All flag types (`StringFlag`, `IntFlag`, etc.) and arguments. The vulnerability is in how the application *uses* the data *after* `urfave/cli` has parsed it, but the input *originates* from the CLI and is handled by `urfave/cli`.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Avoid `os/exec` with User Input:**  Prioritize Go's standard library for system interactions (e.g., `os.OpenFile`, `net/http`).
    *   **Safe Command Execution Library:** If shell commands are unavoidable, use a library designed for secure command execution, handling escaping automatically.
    *   **Strict Input Validation/Whitelisting:** Implement rigorous input validation, preferably using whitelists. Reject non-conforming input.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with minimal necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Filepath Flags (Indirect through `urfave/cli`)](./threats/path_traversal_via_filepath_flags__indirect_through__urfavecli__.md)

*Description:* Similar to command injection, this isn't a direct `urfave/cli` flaw, but a misuse of its output. An attacker provides a malicious path (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`) to a `StringFlag` (or any flag used for file paths). If the application uses this parsed value *directly* in file operations (e.g., `os.Open`, `ioutil.ReadFile`) *without sanitization*, the attacker can access arbitrary files. `urfave/cli` parses the malicious input, and the application then misuses the result.
*Impact:*
    *   Reading sensitive files (configuration, keys).
    *   Overwriting critical system files (DoS, code execution).
    *   Information disclosure (file system structure).
*Affected `urfave/cli` Component:*  Any flag type (usually `StringFlag`) used to construct file paths. The vulnerability is in the application's *use* of the parsed flag value, but the input is processed by `urfave/cli`.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **`filepath.Clean`:** Always use `filepath.Clean` to normalize the user-provided path.
    *   **Base Directory Check:** After cleaning, verify the path remains within an allowed base directory (e.g., using `strings.HasPrefix`).
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Files/Directories:** If possible, use a whitelist to restrict access to specific files or directories.
    *   **Avoid User-Provided Paths:** If feasible, avoid using user-provided paths entirely; use configuration files or other mechanisms.

## Threat: [Misuse of `Before` Actions Leading to Privilege Escalation (Direct `urfave/cli` Feature)](./threats/misuse_of__before__actions_leading_to_privilege_escalation__direct__urfavecli__feature_.md)

*Description:* The application uses `urfave/cli`'s `Before` action (a function executed *before* a command's main action) to perform privileged operations *without adequate authorization checks*. Because `Before` actions run before the main command logic, they can be exploited to bypass intended security controls. This is a *direct* misuse of a `urfave/cli` feature.
*Impact:*
    *   Bypass of security checks.
    *   Unauthorized access to resources.
    *   Elevation of privilege.
*Affected `urfave/cli` Component:*  The `Before` field of `cli.Command` and `cli.App`. The vulnerability lies in the *logic* within the `Before` action itself, making it a direct `urfave/cli` concern.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Careful Design of `Before` Actions:**  Avoid performing privileged operations in `Before` actions unless absolutely necessary *and* with robust authorization checks.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate any input used within the `Before` action, even if it seems to come from a trusted source.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the `Before` action itself operates with the minimum necessary privileges.
