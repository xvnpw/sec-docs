## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This is the primary attack vector, focusing on how user-supplied data (through command-line arguments, flags, or environment variables) can be manipulated to compromise the application. The core issue is insufficient or absent input validation and sanitization.
*   **Why High Risk:** Input validation flaws are extremely common and often lead to severe vulnerabilities. Attackers actively seek out applications with weak input handling.

*   **String Parsing:** This sub-category deals with vulnerabilities arising from how the application processes string inputs.

    *   **U - Unvalidated/Unsanitized Input (Critical Node):**
        *   **Description:** The application accepts string input without checking its length, content, or format. This is the fundamental flaw that enables many other attacks.
        *   **Attack Examples:**
            *   Injecting SQL code into a database query.
            *   Injecting JavaScript code into a web page (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS, if the CLI output is used in a web context).
            *   Injecting shell commands (if the input is used in a system call).
            *   Providing excessively long strings to cause a denial-of-service.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   *Always* validate and sanitize string inputs.
            *   Use regular expressions to enforce allowed character sets and lengths (whitelisting).
            *   Use a dedicated input validation library.
            *   *Never* directly use user-provided strings in system calls, database queries, or file paths without thorough sanitization.

    *   **O - Overflow:**
        *   **Description:** While Go is generally memory-safe, extremely long strings could potentially cause memory exhaustion (DoS). In rare cases with `unsafe` code, buffer overflows are possible.
        *   **Attack Examples:**
            *   Providing a multi-gigabyte string as input to exhaust memory.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement reasonable length limits on string inputs.
            *   Monitor memory usage.

    *   **F - Format String Vulnerability (Critical Node):**
        *   **Description:** The application uses user-provided input as the format string in a function like `fmt.Printf`. This allows an attacker to control the formatting process and potentially read or write to arbitrary memory locations.
        *   **Attack Examples:**
            *   Using format specifiers like `%x` to leak memory contents.
            *   Using format specifiers like `%n` to write to memory (though more difficult in Go than C/C++).
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   *Never* use user-provided input as the format string in `fmt.Printf` or similar functions.  Use separate arguments for the format string and the values.

    *   **S - Special Character Injection (Critical Node):**
        *   **Description:** The application uses user-provided strings in contexts where special characters have meaning (e.g., shell commands, SQL queries, HTML). This allows an attacker to inject commands or manipulate the intended logic.
        *   **Attack Examples:**
            *   Injecting a semicolon (`;`) followed by a malicious command into a string that's used in a shell command.
            *   Injecting single quotes (`'`) and SQL code into a database query.
            *   Injecting `<script>` tags into HTML output.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   *Avoid* using user-provided strings directly in shell commands.
            *   If absolutely necessary, use a well-vetted escaping/quoting library *specifically designed for the target shell*.
            *   Prefer using structured APIs (e.g., Go's `os/exec` package with separate arguments) over constructing shell commands as strings.
            *   Use parameterized queries for databases.
            *   Use appropriate encoding/escaping functions for HTML output.

## Attack Tree Path: [Environment Variable Manipulation (Implicitly High Risk within Input Handling)](./attack_tree_paths/environment_variable_manipulation__implicitly_high_risk_within_input_handling_.md)

* **Overall Description:** Although not explicitly shown as a separate branch in this *sub-tree*, environment variables are a form of input and are therefore subject to the same vulnerabilities as command-line arguments. If the application reads configuration from environment variables without proper validation, an attacker who can control the environment can inject malicious values.
    * **Why High Risk:** Attackers with even limited access to a system might be able to modify environment variables. If the application blindly trusts these variables, it can be easily compromised.
    * **Mitigation:**
        *   Validate environment variables in the same way as command-line flags.
        *   Document which environment variables are used and their expected formats.
        *   Use a secure method for setting environment variables in production (e.g., container orchestration system secrets).
