## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities - Command Injection (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities_-_command_injection__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

- Inject Malicious Commands via Flag Values (CRITICAL NODE):
    - Attack Vector: The application uses the value provided for a flag directly in a shell command without proper sanitization. An attacker can inject malicious shell commands within the flag value.
    - Potential Damage: Full system compromise, arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Inject Malicious Commands via Argument Values (CRITICAL NODE):
    - Attack Vector: Similar to flag values, but the application uses the value of a positional argument in a shell command without sanitization.
    - Potential Damage: Full system compromise, arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Inject Malicious Commands via Subcommand Arguments (CRITICAL NODE):
    - Attack Vector: When using subcommands, the application uses arguments passed to the subcommand in a shell command without sanitization.
    - Potential Damage: Full system compromise, arbitrary code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities - Path Traversal (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities_-_path_traversal__high_risk_path_.md)

- Access Arbitrary Files via Flag Values:
    - Attack Vector: The application uses a flag value as a file path without proper validation. An attacker can manipulate the flag value to access files outside the intended directory using ".." sequences.
    - Potential Damage: Access to sensitive files, potential data breach, exposure of configuration files.
- Access Arbitrary Files via Argument Values:
    - Attack Vector: Similar to flag values, but the application uses a positional argument as a file path without validation.
    - Potential Damage: Access to sensitive files, potential data breach, exposure of configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit `urfave/cli` Specific Features - Exploiting Flag Completion (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit__urfavecli__specific_features_-_exploiting_flag_completion__critical_node_.md)

- Inject Malicious Code via Completion Scripts:
    - Attack Vector: If the application dynamically generates or sources shell completion scripts without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious code into these scripts. When a user uses tab completion, this injected code can be executed.
    - Potential Damage: Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit `urfave/cli` Specific Features - Exploiting Hidden Flags (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit__urfavecli__specific_features_-_exploiting_hidden_flags__critical_node_.md)

- Discover and Abuse Hidden Functionality:
    - Attack Vector: Developers might leave hidden flags for debugging or internal use. If an attacker discovers these flags (e.g., through reverse engineering or information disclosure), they can use them to access unintended functionality or bypass security checks.
    - Potential Damage: Depends on the functionality exposed by the hidden flag, could range from information disclosure to privilege escalation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application Logic via CLI - Triggering Unintended Code Paths (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application_logic_via_cli_-_triggering_unintended_code_paths__high_risk_path_.md)

- Specific Flag/Argument Combinations Lead to Vulnerable Code:
    - Attack Vector: Specific combinations of flags and arguments, even if individually benign, can trigger unexpected code paths in the application that contain vulnerabilities or bypass intended security logic.
    - Potential Damage: Varies depending on the vulnerability triggered, could lead to crashes, data corruption, or security breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application Logic via CLI - Bypassing Authentication/Authorization (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application_logic_via_cli_-_bypassing_authenticationauthorization__high_risk_path__critical__80f634f9.md)

- Manipulating Flags/Arguments to Circumvent Checks (CRITICAL NODE):
    - Attack Vector: The application relies on CLI flags or arguments for authentication or authorization decisions. An attacker can manipulate these inputs to bypass these checks and gain unauthorized access.
    - Potential Damage: Unauthorized access to sensitive functionality or data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application Logic via CLI - Data Manipulation (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application_logic_via_cli_-_data_manipulation__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

- Modify Sensitive Data via CLI Input (CRITICAL NODE):
    - Attack Vector: The application allows modification of sensitive data based on CLI input without proper validation or authorization.
    - Potential Damage: Data breach, data corruption, manipulation of critical application settings.
