# Attack Surface Analysis for urfave/cli

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Flag Values](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_flag_values.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input for command-line flags that, when processed by the application, results in the execution of arbitrary shell commands.
    *   **How CLI Contributes:** `urfave/cli` parses flag values provided by the user and makes them accessible to the application. If the application then uses these values without proper sanitization in system calls or shell commands, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An application has a flag `--output-file`. A malicious user provides `--output-file="| rm -rf /"` which, if the application naively uses this value in a shell command like `mv <input> $output_file`, could lead to the deletion of the entire filesystem.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Full system compromise, data loss, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Never directly use user-provided flag values in shell commands. Use secure alternatives like libraries for specific tasks (e.g., file manipulation) or carefully sanitize and validate input using allow-lists and escaping techniques. Avoid using `os/exec` with unsanitized user input.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about running applications from untrusted sources or with command-line arguments you don't fully understand.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Flag Values](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_flag_values.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates flag values that represent file paths to access or modify files outside of the intended application directory.
    *   **How CLI Contributes:** `urfave/cli` provides the mechanism for users to specify file paths through flags. If the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize these paths, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An application has a flag `--config-file`. A malicious user provides `--config-file="../../../../../etc/passwd"` and the application attempts to read this file, potentially exposing sensitive system information.
    *   **Impact:** High - Exposure of sensitive data, potential for arbitrary file read or write depending on application logic and permissions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict validation of file paths. Use allow-lists of allowed directories. Utilize functions that resolve canonical paths to prevent traversal (e.g., `filepath.Clean`, `filepath.Abs`). Avoid directly using user-provided paths in file system operations without validation.
        *   **Users:** Be mindful of the file paths you provide as command-line arguments. Avoid using relative paths that could potentially lead outside of intended directories.

## Attack Surface: [Environment Variable Injection/Override](./attack_surfaces/environment_variable_injectionoverride.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages `urfave/cli`'s ability to read configuration from environment variables to inject malicious values or override existing secure configurations.
    *   **How CLI Contributes:** `urfave/cli` allows applications to define flags that can be populated from environment variables. This provides an alternative input vector that attackers can manipulate.
    *   **Example:** An application uses an environment variable `API_KEY` for authentication. An attacker could run the application with `API_KEY="malicious_key" ./my-app` potentially bypassing intended authentication mechanisms or using a compromised key.
    *   **Impact:** High - Bypassing security controls, potential for unauthorized access or actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Be cautious about relying solely on environment variables for security-sensitive configurations. Implement additional layers of security. Clearly document which environment variables are used and their expected format. Consider using more robust secret management solutions.
        *   **Users:** Be aware of the environment variables set when running applications, especially those from untrusted sources. Avoid running applications with potentially malicious environment variables set.
