*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in `urfave/cli` or its Dependencies
    *   **Description:** The `urfave/cli` library itself or its dependencies contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application. This could involve sending specially crafted input that triggers a bug in the parsing logic or exploiting a known vulnerability in a dependency.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability, but could range from denial of service to remote code execution on the system running the application. Data breaches or unauthorized access could also be possible.
    *   **Affected urfave/cli Component:** The `urfave/cli` library codebase itself and its declared dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update `urfave/cli` to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories for `urfave/cli` and its dependencies.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies and update them promptly.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Default Flag Values
    *   **Description:** Default values for flags within the `urfave/cli` application inadvertently contain sensitive information such as API keys, default passwords, or internal URLs. An attacker could discover this information by simply running the application with the `--help` flag or by inspecting the application's source code.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials or internal details, potentially leading to unauthorized access to other systems or data.
    *   **Affected urfave/cli Component:** The `cli.Flag` definitions where default values are specified.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in default flag values.
        *   Use environment variables or secure configuration mechanisms to manage sensitive data.
        *   If default values are necessary, ensure they do not contain any sensitive information.
