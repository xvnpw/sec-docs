# Attack Tree Analysis for valyala/fasthttp

Objective: The attacker's goal is to achieve one or more of the following, by exploiting `fasthttp`-specific vulnerabilities:

1.  **Denial of Service (DoS):** Render the application unresponsive to legitimate users.
2.  **Information Disclosure:** Gain access to sensitive data.
3.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Execute arbitrary code on the server (indirectly via `fasthttp`).
4.  **Request Smuggling/Hijacking:** Manipulate request parsing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:**  The attacker establishes numerous connections but sends data very slowly (incomplete headers or body). This ties up server resources, preventing legitimate users from connecting.
        **Vectors:**
            *   **Slow Header Reads (1.1.1):** Sending HTTP headers very slowly, one byte at a time.
            *   **Slow Body Reads (1.1.2):**  Establishing a connection and sending the initial headers, but then sending the request body extremely slowly.
            *   **Many Concurrent Connections (1.1.3):**  Simply opening a large number of connections to the server, exhausting the available connection pool.
        **Critical Mitigations:**
            *   Set `ReadTimeout` and `WriteHeaderTimeout` to reasonable values (e.g., a few seconds).
            *   Set `MaxRequestBodySize` to limit the maximum size of a request body.
            *   Limit the maximum number of concurrent connections using the `Concurrency` setting in `fasthttp.Server`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion via Request Flooding](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_via_request_flooding.md)

**Description:** The attacker overwhelms the server with a large volume of requests, consuming CPU, memory, or other resources.
        **Vectors:**
            *   **High Request Rate (1.2.1):**  Sending a flood of valid (or seemingly valid) requests to the server.
            *   **Large Request Bodies (1.2.2):** Sending requests with very large bodies, even if the server ultimately rejects them, the initial processing can consume resources.
        **Critical Mitigations:**
            *   Implement rate limiting (per IP address, per user, or globally).
            *   Strictly enforce `MaxRequestBodySize`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting `fasthttp` Bugs](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting__fasthttp__bugs.md)

**Description:** The attacker sends crafted input designed to trigger a bug in `fasthttp` (like a panic) that causes the server to crash or become unresponsive.
        **Vectors:**
            * **Triggering Panics via Crafted Input (1.3.1):** Sending specially formed requests that exploit a vulnerability in `fasthttp`'s parsing or handling logic, leading to a panic.
        **Critical Mitigations:**
            *   Regularly update `fasthttp` to the latest version.
            *   Implement robust error handling and use `recover()` to catch panics.
            *   Use fuzz testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure.md)

**Error Handling Leaks (2.2):**
        *   **Description:**  The server reveals sensitive information through error messages or stack traces.
        *   **Vectors:**
            *   **Detailed Error Messages (2.2.1):**  Error messages that include internal file paths, database queries, or configuration details.
            *   **Stack Traces (2.2.2):**  Unhandled panics that result in stack traces being sent in the HTTP response.
        *   **Critical Mitigations:**
            *   Implement custom error handlers that return generic error messages to clients.
            *   Use `recover()` to handle panics and prevent stack traces from being exposed.
            *   Log detailed error information securely (not in responses to clients).
    * **Exploiting `fasthttp` Bugs (2.3):**
        * **Description:** The attacker sends crafted input designed to trigger a bug in `fasthttp` that causes the server to leak information.
        * **Vectors:**
            *   Exploiting buffer over-reads or other memory-related vulnerabilities.
        * **Critical Mitigations:**
            *   Regularly update `fasthttp` to the latest version.
            *   Use memory safety tools (e.g., AddressSanitizer) during development.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) - *Indirectly* via fasthttp](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__-_indirectly_via_fasthttp.md)

*   **Chaining with Other Vulnerabilities (3.2):**
        *   **Description:** `fasthttp` is used as the entry point to deliver a malicious payload that exploits a vulnerability in *another* part of the application (e.g., a vulnerable library used for deserialization or template rendering).
        *   **Vectors:**
            *   **`fasthttp` Used to Deliver Malicious Payload (3.2.1):**  The attacker sends a request containing a malicious payload (e.g., a serialized object or a crafted template) that triggers a vulnerability in a different component.
            *   **`fasthttp` Misconfiguration (3.2.2):** Incorrect routing or access control configuration in `fasthttp` exposes a vulnerable endpoint that should not be accessible.
        *   **Critical Mitigations:**
            *   Address vulnerabilities in *all* components of the application, not just `fasthttp`.
            *   Follow secure coding practices for all parts of the application.
            *   Carefully configure routing and access controls in `fasthttp`.
            *   Follow the principle of least privilege.

    * **Exploiting unsafe features of fasthttp (3.3):**
        * **Description:** Using unsafe features of `fasthttp` can lead to vulnerabilities.
        * **Vectors:**
            *   Misusing `hijack` feature.

*   **Connection Hijacking (4.2):**
        *   **Description:** If the `hijack` feature of `fasthttp` is used, the attacker might be able to gain control of the underlying TCP connection and manipulate requests or responses.
        *   **Vectors:**
            *   Improper handling of the connection after hijacking, leading to vulnerabilities.
        *   **Critical Mitigations:**
            *   Avoid using the `hijack` feature unless absolutely necessary.
            *   If `hijack` is used, ensure proper connection closure and resource cleanup.
            *   Thoroughly validate any data received on a hijacked connection.
    * **Exploiting fasthttp bugs (4.3):**
        * **Description:** The attacker sends crafted input designed to trigger a bug in `fasthttp` that causes the server to misinterpret requests.
        * **Vectors:**
