# Attack Surface Analysis for valyala/fasthttp

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Request Smuggling/Splitting (HRS)](./attack_surfaces/http_request_smugglingsplitting__hrs_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploits differences in how `fasthttp` and intermediary systems parse HTTP requests, allowing request smuggling or splitting.
    *   **How `fasthttp` Contributes:** `fasthttp`'s non-standard, performance-optimized HTTP parsing creates the discrepancies that enable HRS. This is a *direct* consequence of `fasthttp`'s design.
    *   **Example:**
        ```http
        POST / HTTP/1.1
        Host: example.com
        Content-Length: 5
        Transfer-Encoding: chunked

        0

        GET /admin HTTP/1.1
        Host: example.com

        ```
        `fasthttp` might process the entire payload, while a proxy sees only the initial `POST`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Bypassing security controls.
        *   Accessing restricted resources.
        *   Cache poisoning.
        *   Session hijacking.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use a Standard-Compliant Reverse Proxy:**  A reverse proxy (Nginx, HAProxy) is the *primary* defense, normalizing requests *before* they reach `fasthttp`. This is crucial, but I'm including it because the vulnerability *originates* in `fasthttp`.
        *   **Fuzzing:**  Extensive fuzzing of `fasthttp`'s request parsing, specifically targeting HRS scenarios (conflicting headers, malformed chunked encoding). This is a direct mitigation against `fasthttp`'s parsing.
        *   **Disable `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` (If Possible):** If chunked encoding is not *strictly* required, disabling it on the `fasthttp` server reduces the attack surface. This directly modifies `fasthttp`'s behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflow/Underflow in `fasthttp`'s Parsing](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflowunderflow_in__fasthttp_'s_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs in `fasthttp`'s custom buffer management and request parsing can lead to buffer overflows/underflows.
    *   **How `fasthttp` Contributes:** This is *entirely* due to `fasthttp`'s internal implementation of memory management and parsing.
    *   **Example:** An extremely long header value or a malformed chunked encoding sequence could trigger an overflow if `fasthttp` has a bug in its bounds checking.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE).
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) via crashes.
        *   Potential information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep `fasthttp` Updated:**  This is the *most direct* mitigation â€“ rely on the `fasthttp` developers to fix these low-level bugs.
        *   **Extensive Fuzzing:**  Use fuzzing tools (AFL, libFuzzer) to specifically target `fasthttp`'s parsing logic for buffer overflows. This directly tests `fasthttp`'s code.
        *   **Limit Header Sizes:** Configure `fasthttp`'s `MaxHeaderSize` to reject excessively large headers. This is a direct configuration change to `fasthttp`.

## Attack Surface: [Connection Desynchronization](./attack_surfaces/connection_desynchronization.md)

*   **Description:** Improper handling of connection reuse in `fasthttp` can cause requests from different clients to be mixed.
    *   **How `fasthttp` Contributes:** This vulnerability stems directly from `fasthttp`'s connection reuse mechanism, a core part of its design.
    *   **Example:** Data from one client's request (headers, cookies) leaks into the processing of a subsequent request from a *different* client on the same reused connection.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information disclosure (session cookies, etc.).
        *   Unauthorized access.
        *   Data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thorough Concurrency Testing:**  Intense testing under high concurrent load with persistent connections is crucial to identify this `fasthttp`-specific issue.
        *   **Review `fasthttp` Code (Advanced):**  Examine `fasthttp`'s connection handling code for potential bugs (requires deep expertise). This is a direct examination of `fasthttp`.
        *   **Disable Keep-Alive (Extreme):** Disabling keep-alive *completely* eliminates the risk, but severely impacts performance. This directly modifies `fasthttp`'s behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Memory Exhaustion (Targeting `fasthttp`)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_memory_exhaustion__targeting__fasthttp__.md)

*   **Description:**  Crafted requests exploit `fasthttp`'s internal memory allocation to cause excessive memory use.
    *   **How `fasthttp` Contributes:**  This targets vulnerabilities in `fasthttp`'s custom memory management, a core part of its design.
    *   **Example:**  A request with thousands of unique, long header names might cause `fasthttp` to allocate excessive memory.
    *   **Impact:**  Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Limit Request Sizes:** Use `fasthttp`'s configuration: `MaxHeaderSize`, `MaxRequestBodySize`. These directly control `fasthttp`'s behavior.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Fuzz `fasthttp` with requests designed to stress its memory allocation (large headers, many parameters). This directly tests `fasthttp`.
