## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Header Validation (within `fasthttp` Handlers)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_header_validation__within__fasthttp__handlers_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Header Validation (within `fasthttp` Handlers)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Critical Headers:** Determine which HTTP headers are crucial for security and application logic within the context of your `fasthttp` application (e.g., `Content-Length`, `Transfer-Encoding`, `Host`, `Content-Type`).
        2.  **Implement Validation Functions:** Create dedicated functions *within your `fasthttp` request handlers* to validate each critical header. These functions should:
            *   Access header values using `fasthttp`'s API (e.g., `ctx.Request.Header.Peek("Content-Length")`).
            *   Check for the presence/absence of the header as required.
            *   Verify the header's format against RFC specifications and application-specific rules.  Use regular expressions or dedicated parsing libraries where appropriate.
            *   Handle multiple occurrences of the header (e.g., reject requests with multiple `Content-Length` headers).  `fasthttp` provides methods like `VisitAll` to iterate over headers.
            *   Handle potentially conflicting headers (e.g., `Content-Length` vs. `Transfer-Encoding`).
        3.  **Integrate Validation:** Call these validation functions within the `fasthttp` request handler *before* processing the request body or performing any sensitive operations. Use `ctx.Error` to immediately return an error if validation fails.
        4.  **Reject Invalid Requests:** If any header validation fails, immediately return an appropriate HTTP error response using `ctx.Error(fasthttp.StatusBadRequest, "Invalid Header")`.  Do *not* proceed with request processing.
        5.  **Regularly Review and Update:** Periodically review the header validation logic to ensure it remains up-to-date.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Request Smuggling (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious requests by exploiting inconsistencies in header parsing, *specifically within `fasthttp`'s handling*.
        *   **Header Injection (High Severity):** Mitigates attacks where malicious headers are injected to bypass security controls or manipulate application logic, focusing on vulnerabilities within `fasthttp`.
        *   **HTTP Parameter Pollution (Medium Severity):** Can help prevent attacks that exploit multiple occurrences of the same header, as handled by `fasthttp`.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Request Smuggling:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low, assuming proper implementation and testing, focusing on `fasthttp`'s internal handling).
        *   **Header Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low, within the context of `fasthttp`).
        *   **HTTP Parameter Pollution:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low, as handled by `fasthttp`).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic `Content-Length` check in `requestHandler` function (prevents excessively large bodies) using `ctx.Request.Header.ContentLength()`.
        *   `Host` header validation against a whitelist in the `validateHost` function, using `ctx.Request.Header.Host()`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Comprehensive `Transfer-Encoding` validation (especially for `chunked` encoding) is missing.  This is a critical gap.  Needs to be implemented in a new function, `validateTransferEncoding`, using `ctx.Request.Header.Peek("Transfer-Encoding")` and `ctx.Request.Header.VisitAll`, and called within `requestHandler`.
        *   Validation of other headers like `Content-Type` is basic and needs to be more robust, using `fasthttp`'s header access methods.
        *   No specific handling of multiple header occurrences (except for a basic check on `Content-Length`).  Needs to be added to all header validation logic, utilizing `ctx.Request.Header.VisitAll`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [`fasthttp.Server` Configuration for Resource Control](./mitigation_strategies/_fasthttp_server__configuration_for_resource_control.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  `fasthttp.Server` Configuration for Resource Control

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Analyze Resource Usage:** Profile the `fasthttp` application under load to identify potential bottlenecks and resource limits.
        2.  **Configure `fasthttp.Server`:**  *Directly within the code that initializes the `fasthttp.Server`*, set appropriate values for the following parameters:
            *   `MaxConnsPerIP`: Limit connections per IP using this `fasthttp.Server` setting.
            *   `MaxRequestsPerConn`: Limit requests per connection using this setting.
            *   `Concurrency`: Limit overall concurrent connections.
            *   `ReadTimeout`, `WriteTimeout`, `IdleTimeout`: Set timeouts to prevent slow clients.
            *   `MaxRequestBodySize`: Limit request body size.
            *   `MaxHeaderBytes`: Limit the size of request headers.
        3.  **Monitor and Adjust:** Continuously monitor resource usage and adjust the configuration parameters as needed.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the `fasthttp` server with requests, exhausting resources.
        *   **Slowloris Attacks (Medium Severity):** Mitigates attacks that hold connections open for extended periods, leveraging `fasthttp`'s timeout settings.
        *   **Large Request Body Attacks (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from sending massive request bodies to consume memory, directly controlled by `fasthttp.Server.MaxRequestBodySize`.
        *   **Large Header Attacks (Medium Severity):** Prevents attacks using excessively large headers, controlled by `fasthttp.Server.MaxHeaderBytes`.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Medium, depending on the attack and configuration).
        *   **Slowloris Attacks:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).
        *   **Large Request Body Attacks:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).
        *   **Large Header Attacks:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `MaxRequestBodySize` is set in the `main` function when initializing the `fasthttp.Server`.
        *   `ReadTimeout`, `WriteTimeout`, and `IdleTimeout` are configured.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `MaxConnsPerIP`, `MaxRequestsPerConn`, and `Concurrency` are not explicitly configured.  These need to be explicitly set in the `fasthttp.Server` initialization in `main`.
        *   `MaxHeaderBytes` is not set. Add to `fasthttp.Server` initialization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe `fasthttp` Byte Slice Handling](./mitigation_strategies/safe__fasthttp__byte_slice_handling.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Safe `fasthttp` Byte Slice Handling

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify `fasthttp` Byte Slice Sources:** Identify all points in the code where byte slices are obtained from `fasthttp`'s API (e.g., `ctx.Request.Header.Peek`, `ctx.PostBody()`, `ctx.FormValue()`).
        2.  **Copy Data When Needed:** If the data from these `fasthttp`-provided byte slices needs to be used *after* the `fasthttp` request handler (`ctx`'s lifetime) returns, *always* create a copy.  Use `append([]byte{}, slice...)` or `copy(dst, src)`.  
        3.  **Avoid Global References:** Never store direct references to `fasthttp` byte slices in global variables or long-lived data structures.  The memory may be reused by `fasthttp`.
        4.  **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on how byte slices obtained from `fasthttp` are used.
        5. **Fuzz test fasthttp handlers:** Use a fuzzer to generate various inputs and test if application is handling byte slices correctly.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Corruption (High Severity):** Prevents unexpected modification of data due to `fasthttp` reusing byte slices.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of leaking sensitive data if `fasthttp`'s internal byte slices are inadvertently exposed.
        *   **Application Instability (Medium Severity):** Prevents crashes or unexpected behavior caused by incorrect handling of `fasthttp`'s byte slices.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low).
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).
        *   **Application Instability:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Some instances of copying byte slices are present (e.g., when logging request bodies).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   A systematic review of all `fasthttp` byte slice usage is missing.  This needs to be performed across the entire codebase.
        *   No fuzz testing is currently implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Deprecated/Unsafe `fasthttp` Functions](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_deprecatedunsafe__fasthttp__functions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Avoid Deprecated/Unsafe `fasthttp` Functions

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Review `fasthttp` Documentation:** Carefully review the `fasthttp` documentation and identify any deprecated or unsafe functions *within the `fasthttp` library itself*.
        2.  **Code Audit:** Perform a code audit to identify any instances of these `fasthttp` functions being used.
        3.  **Replace with Safe Alternatives:** Replace any deprecated or unsafe `fasthttp` functions with their recommended safe alternatives, as provided in the `fasthttp` documentation.
        4.  **Regularly Check for Updates:** Periodically check the `fasthttp` documentation for new deprecations or warnings, especially after updating the `fasthttp` library.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Various Vulnerabilities (Severity Varies):** Mitigates vulnerabilities that might be present in deprecated or unsafe functions *within the `fasthttp` library*. The specific threats depend on the function.
        *   **Maintainability Issues (Low Severity):** Improves maintainability.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Various Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced (severity depends on the specific vulnerability).
        *   **Maintainability Issues:** Risk reduced (from Low to Negligible).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   A basic check for `RequestCtx.URI().FullURI()` usage was performed.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   A comprehensive audit for *all* deprecated or unsafe `fasthttp` functions is missing.  This needs to be performed regularly.
