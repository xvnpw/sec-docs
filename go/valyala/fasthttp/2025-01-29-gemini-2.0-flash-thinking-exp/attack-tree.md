## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Attack Goal: Compromise fasthttp Application](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_attack_goal_compromise_fasthttp_application.md)

This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized control or causing significant disruption to the application using `fasthttp`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit fasthttp Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_fasthttp_vulnerabilities.md)

This represents the primary attack strategy.  The attacker aims to find and leverage weaknesses or vulnerabilities specifically within the `fasthttp` library itself, rather than generic web application flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node & High-Risk Path: Request Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_&_high-risk_path_request_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

This category encompasses vulnerabilities arising from how `fasthttp` processes incoming HTTP requests. It's high-risk because request handling is fundamental to any web server, and flaws here can have wide-ranging consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: HTTP Request Smuggling](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_http_request_smuggling.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploits discrepancies in how `fasthttp` and other HTTP components (like proxies or backend servers) parse HTTP requests, particularly headers like `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length`.
        *   **How it works:** Attackers craft ambiguous requests that are interpreted differently by `fasthttp` and another component in the request chain. This allows them to "smuggle" a second request within the first one, leading to request misrouting, bypassing security controls, or cache poisoning.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Bypassing authentication, unauthorized access to resources, cache poisoning, XSS via cache poisoning, routing requests to unintended backends.
        *   **Mitigation:** Strict adherence to HTTP standards in `fasthttp`'s parsing, consistent header handling, input validation, regular security audits focusing on request smuggling.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Parsing Inconsistencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_parsing_inconsistencies.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Focuses on specific parsing differences within request smuggling, particularly related to header parsing and URL parsing.
            *   **How it works:** Attackers leverage subtle variations in how `fasthttp` interprets headers (like `Transfer-Encoding`, `Content-Length` combinations) or URLs compared to other systems.
            *   **Potential Impact:**  Same as HTTP Request Smuggling.
            *   **Mitigation:**  Rigorous testing of header and URL parsing in `fasthttp`, ensuring consistency with HTTP standards and common HTTP infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Header Parsing Differences (e.g., Transfer-Encoding, Content-Length)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_header_parsing_differences__e_g___transfer-encoding__content-length_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Specifically targets ambiguities and edge cases in parsing `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers, which are common vectors for request smuggling.
                *   **How it works:** Crafting requests with combinations of these headers that lead to different interpretations by different HTTP parsers.
                *   **Potential Impact:** Same as HTTP Request Smuggling.
                *   **Mitigation:**  Strict and unambiguous parsing logic for `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length`, prioritizing standard-compliant behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Craft requests with ambiguous header combinations to bypass security checks or route requests unexpectedly.](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_craft_requests_with_ambiguous_header_combinations_to_bypass_security_checks_or_route__786b9eb7.md)

**Attack Vector:** The actionable step in exploiting header parsing differences for request smuggling.
                    *   **How it works:**  Actively crafting and sending requests designed to trigger parsing inconsistencies and achieve smuggling.
                    *   **Potential Impact:** Same as HTTP Request Smuggling.
                    *   **Mitigation:**  All mitigations for Request Smuggling and Parsing Inconsistencies apply.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Header Injection Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_header_injection_attacks.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploits insufficient sanitization of HTTP headers by the application or `fasthttp` itself, allowing attackers to inject malicious headers.
            *   **How it works:** Attackers include control characters like `\r\n` within header values. If not properly sanitized, these can be interpreted as header separators, allowing injection of new headers.
            *   **Potential Impact:** HTTP Response Splitting (if reflected in responses), session fixation, cache poisoning, manipulation of backend systems if headers are forwarded.
            *   **Mitigation:** Strict header sanitization, removing or encoding control characters, avoiding reflection of user-supplied headers, principle of least privilege for header processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Insufficient Header Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_insufficient_header_sanitization.md)

**Attack Vector:** The root cause of Header Injection attacks.
                *   **How it works:** Lack of proper input validation and sanitization on HTTP headers processed by `fasthttp` or the application.
                *   **Potential Impact:** Header Injection Attacks.
                *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust header sanitization routines in the application and ensure `fasthttp` itself handles headers safely.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Inject malicious headers (e.g., `\r\n` sequences) to manipulate application behavior or backend systems.](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_malicious_headers__e_g____rn__sequences__to_manipulate_application_behavior_or_5f2ed9c1.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Focuses on DoS attacks by sending excessively large request bodies.
            *   **How it works:** Attackers send requests with extremely large `Content-Length` values or very large chunked bodies. If `fasthttp` or the application doesn't have proper limits, this can exhaust server resources (memory, CPU) leading to DoS.
            *   **Potential Impact:** Denial of Service.
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement request body size limits in `fasthttp` configuration or application logic, resource monitoring, rate limiting.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node & High-Risk Path: Resource Exhaustion Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_&_high-risk_path_resource_exhaustion_attacks.md)

This is a common method for achieving DoS. Attackers aim to exhaust critical server resources like connections, CPU, or memory.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Connection Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_connection_exhaustion.md)

**Attack Vector:** DoS attack by exhausting the server's connection limits.
            *   **How it works:** Attackers open a large number of connections to the `fasthttp` server, exceeding its configured connection limits. This prevents legitimate users from establishing new connections, leading to DoS.
            *   **Potential Impact:** Denial of Service.
            *   **Mitigation:** Configure connection limits, implement connection rate limiting, use connection pooling, resource monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Open a large number of connections to exhaust connection limits and prevent legitimate users from connecting.](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_open_a_large_number_of_connections_to_exhaust_connection_limits_and_prevent_legitimat_d90de627.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Slowloris Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_slowloris_attacks.md)

**Attack Vector:** A type of CPU exhaustion attack that slowly sends incomplete HTTP requests to keep connections open for a long time, eventually exhausting connection resources and CPU.
                *   **How it works:** Attackers send slow, incomplete requests (e.g., sending headers but not the body, or sending headers very slowly). This keeps connections in a pending state, consuming server resources and eventually leading to connection and CPU exhaustion.
                *   **Potential Impact:** Denial of Service.
                *   **Mitigation:** Implement timeouts for connection inactivity and request completion, rate limiting, use a reverse proxy or WAF with Slowloris protection.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Send slow, incomplete requests to keep connections open and exhaust server resources.](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_send_slow__incomplete_requests_to_keep_connections_open_and_exhaust_server_resources.md)
