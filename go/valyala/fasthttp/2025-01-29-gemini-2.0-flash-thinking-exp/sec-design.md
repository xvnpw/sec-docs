# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project provides a high-performance HTTP server library for Go, aiming to offer significant speed and efficiency advantages over the standard `net/http` library.

- Business Priorities:
  - High Performance: The primary goal is to serve HTTP requests with minimal latency and resource consumption.
  - Efficiency: Optimize resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) for handling a large number of concurrent connections.
  - Scalability: Enable applications to handle increased traffic loads without significant performance degradation.

- Business Goals:
  - Reduce infrastructure costs by requiring fewer resources to handle the same workload compared to standard HTTP servers.
  - Improve application responsiveness and user experience through faster request processing.
  - Enable development of high-throughput applications like APIs, proxies, and web servers.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities introduced due to performance optimizations potentially bypassing standard security practices.
  - Risk of denial-of-service attacks if the server is not properly configured to handle malicious or excessive traffic.
  - Data breaches if the library is used to handle sensitive data without implementing appropriate security measures in the application using the library.
  - Compatibility issues with existing HTTP infrastructure or clients due to deviations from strict HTTP standards in pursuit of performance.
  - Dependency on a community-driven open-source project with potential risks related to long-term maintenance and support.

# SECURITY POSTURE

This project is a library focused on performance, and as such, it provides building blocks for creating HTTP servers. Security is primarily the responsibility of the application developer using this library and the deployment environment.

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Go Standard Library Security Features: Relies on underlying Go standard library for network operations and some basic HTTP handling, which benefits from Go's general security practices. Implemented within the Go standard library.
  - security control: Operating System Security Features: Leverages operating system level security features such as network firewalls, resource limits, and user permissions. Implemented by the operating system.
  - accepted risk: Limited Built-in Security Features: As a performance-focused library, `fasthttp` does not implement extensive security features directly. Security is expected to be handled by the application and the deployment environment.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - recommended security control: Input Validation: Implement robust input validation for all incoming HTTP requests (headers, body, parameters) within the application using `fasthttp`.
  - recommended security control: Rate Limiting and Request Throttling: Implement rate limiting and request throttling to protect against denial-of-service attacks. This should be implemented in the application or a reverse proxy in front of the application.
  - recommended security control: Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of applications built with `fasthttp` to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
  - recommended security control: Dependency Scanning: Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly. This should be part of the application's development and deployment pipeline.
  - recommended security control: Secure Configuration: Ensure secure configuration of the `fasthttp` server and the underlying operating system, including disabling unnecessary features and setting appropriate resource limits.
  - recommended security control: TLS/SSL Encryption: Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all sensitive communications to protect data in transit. This is typically configured at the application level or using a reverse proxy.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Implement authentication mechanisms within the application if access control is required. `fasthttp` provides the tools to handle authentication headers and logic, but the specific mechanism (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT, Basic Auth) needs to be implemented by the application.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement authorization logic within the application to control access to resources based on user roles or permissions. `fasthttp` provides the request context to access user information and make authorization decisions.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All input from HTTP requests (headers, URL parameters, request body) must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting). Validation should be performed within the application logic using `fasthttp`'s request handling capabilities.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use TLS/SSL to encrypt all sensitive communication between clients and the `fasthttp` server. `fasthttp` supports TLS configuration.
    - Requirement: If sensitive data is stored or processed, use appropriate encryption methods for data at rest and data in transit within the application logic. `fasthttp` itself does not handle data encryption beyond TLS.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Serving HTTP requests to end-users or other systems. The criticality depends on the application using `fasthttp`. For public-facing web applications or APIs, availability and performance are critical business processes. For internal microservices, the criticality depends on the service's role in the overall business workflow.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Data sensitivity depends entirely on the application built using `fasthttp`. It could range from public, non-sensitive data (e.g., static website content) to highly sensitive personal or financial data (e.g., e-commerce platform, banking application). The sensitivity level dictates the required security controls for data in transit, data at rest, and data in processing.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- BUSINESS POSTURE:
  - Question: What is the primary use case for applications built with `fasthttp`? (e.g., public-facing website, internal API, microservice).
  - Assumption: The primary driver for using `fasthttp` is performance and efficiency.
  - Question: What are the expected traffic volumes and performance requirements for the application?
  - Assumption: The application is expected to handle a significant volume of traffic and requires low latency.
  - Question: What is the organization's risk appetite regarding security vs. performance?
  - Assumption: While performance is prioritized, security is still a significant concern and needs to be addressed appropriately.

- SECURITY POSTURE:
  - Question: What existing security controls are already in place in the target deployment environment? (e.g., network firewalls, WAF, IDS/IPS).
  - Assumption: Basic network security controls are assumed to be in place, but application-level security needs to be implemented.
  - Question: Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR) that the application needs to meet?
  - Assumption: Compliance requirements are application-specific and need to be considered during application development and deployment.
  - Question: What is the process for security incident response and vulnerability management?
  - Assumption: A security incident response and vulnerability management process is in place or will be established for applications using `fasthttp`.

- DESIGN:
  - Question: What is the intended deployment environment (cloud, on-premises, hybrid)?
  - Assumption: Cloud-based deployment is a likely scenario, but on-premises or hybrid deployments are also possible.
  - Question: What are the scaling requirements for the application? (horizontal scaling, vertical scaling).
  - Assumption: Horizontal scaling is expected to be the primary scaling strategy for applications using `fasthttp`.
  - Question: What are the data storage requirements and database systems being used?
  - Assumption: A relational database or NoSQL database is used for persistent data storage, depending on the application requirements.
