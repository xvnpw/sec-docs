# Threat Model Analysis for valyala/fasthttp

## Threat: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./threats/http_request_smuggling.md)

- **Description:**
    - Attacker crafts malicious HTTP requests that are parsed differently by `fasthttp` compared to other HTTP components (e.g., proxies, backend servers).
    - This parsing discrepancy allows attackers to "smuggle" requests, bypassing security controls and manipulating request routing.
    - For instance, an attacker might embed a second request within the headers or body of the first in a way that `fasthttp` sees one request, but a backend server sees two.
- **Impact:**
    - Bypass of security controls like Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and authentication mechanisms.
    - Unauthorized access to resources by routing smuggled requests to unintended endpoints.
    - Data leakage through manipulated request processing and response handling.
    - Cache poisoning by injecting malicious content into caches.
- **Affected fasthttp component:**
    - HTTP Request Parsing Module (specifically header and body parsing logic).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Standardize HTTP Parsing:** Ensure consistent and strict HTTP parsing across all HTTP components in the application architecture.
    - **Rigorous Testing:** Conduct thorough testing with diverse HTTP clients and proxies to detect parsing inconsistencies.
    - **Robust Reverse Proxy:** Utilize a security-focused reverse proxy in front of `fasthttp` to normalize and sanitize incoming requests.
    - **Careful Header Handling:**  Pay close attention to header processing and forwarding to ensure consistent interpretation throughout the system.

## Threat: [Body Parsing Vulnerabilities (Buffer/Integer Overflows)](./threats/body_parsing_vulnerabilities__bufferinteger_overflows_.md)

- **Description:**
    - Attacker sends crafted, large, or malformed HTTP request bodies to exploit weaknesses in `fasthttp`'s body parsing.
    - Vulnerabilities in parsing logic, especially with large or unusual bodies, can lead to buffer overflows, integer overflows, or memory corruption.
    - This can be triggered by oversized bodies, deeply nested data structures, or specific byte sequences designed to exploit parsing flaws.
- **Impact:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS): Application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to memory corruption or resource exhaustion.
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE): In severe cases of memory corruption, attackers might achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Affected fasthttp component:**
    - HTTP Request Body Parsing Module (functions handling body reading and parsing, potentially content-type specific parsing).
- **Risk Severity:** High (potential for RCE)
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Regular Updates:** Keep `fasthttp` updated to benefit from parsing bug fixes and security patches.
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize request bodies, especially for file uploads or complex data. Implement size and format checks.
    - **Request Body Size Limits:** Enforce limits on maximum request body size in `fasthttp` or the application.
    - **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (memory, CPU) to contain the impact of resource exhaustion attacks.
    - **Fuzzing and Security Audits:** Conduct fuzzing and security audits to identify parsing vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Double-Free or Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities](./threats/double-free_or_use-after-free_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:**
    - Incorrect memory management within `fasthttp` can lead to double-free or use-after-free vulnerabilities.
    - These occur when memory is freed multiple times or accessed after being freed, often due to errors in pointer manipulation or resource lifecycle management.
    - These vulnerabilities can arise in memory handling for requests, responses, or connections.
- **Impact:**
    - Application Crashes: Double-free or use-after-free errors frequently cause immediate crashes.
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE): In exploitable scenarios, attackers might manipulate memory for remote code execution.
- **Affected fasthttp component:**
    - Memory Management within `fasthttp` (low-level memory operations related to request/response lifecycle, connection handling, and buffer management).
- **Risk Severity:** Critical (potential for RCE)
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Careful Code Audits:** Thoroughly audit code, focusing on memory management in `fasthttp` (if modifying) and application code interacting with it.
    - **Memory Safety Tools:** Use memory safety tools (address sanitizers, memory debuggers) during development and testing.
    - **Strict Memory Practices:** Adhere to strict memory management practices, minimizing manual management and carefully managing resource lifecycles.
    - **Regular Updates:** Keep `fasthttp` updated to benefit from fixes for memory management issues.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `fasthttp` Specific Features](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__fasthttp__specific_features.md)

- **Description:**
    - Applications using non-standard `fasthttp` features or extensions (beyond core HTTP) might encounter vulnerabilities due to reduced maturity and testing of these features.
    - Examples include specific connection pooling, custom header handling extensions, or experimental functionalities.
- **Impact:**
    - Depends on the specific feature and vulnerability. Impacts can range from Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Affected fasthttp component:**
    - Specific `fasthttp` Features or Extensions (e.g., connection pooling, custom header handling).
- **Risk Severity:** High (in cases leading to RCE or significant DoS)
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Minimize Non-Standard Features:** Prefer standard HTTP features to reduce reliance on less tested `fasthttp` extensions.
    - **Careful Evaluation and Testing:** If using specific features, thoroughly evaluate security implications and conduct rigorous security testing.
    - **Security Advisory Monitoring:** Monitor `fasthttp` security advisories and bug reports related to used features.
    - **Feature Isolation:** Isolate potentially risky features within the application architecture to limit vulnerability impact.
