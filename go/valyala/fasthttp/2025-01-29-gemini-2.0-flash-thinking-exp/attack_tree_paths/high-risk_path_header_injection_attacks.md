### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Header Injection Attacks

**Attack Vector:** Exploits insufficient sanitization of HTTP headers by the application or `fasthttp` itself, allowing attackers to inject malicious headers.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

The core vulnerability lies in the application's or, less likely, `fasthttp`'s failure to properly sanitize user-controlled input that is used to construct HTTP headers.  HTTP headers are structured using specific delimiters, primarily Carriage Return (`\r`) and Line Feed (`\n`) characters. These characters, when combined as `\r\n`, signify the end of a header line and the beginning of a new header or the start of the HTTP body.

If an application directly incorporates user-provided data into HTTP headers without proper validation and sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious headers by including these control characters within their input.

**How it works:** Attackers include control characters like `\r\n` within header values. If not properly sanitized, these can be interpreted as header separators, allowing injection of new headers.

**Mechanics Explained:**

1.  **User Input as Header Value:** The application receives user input, for example, through a query parameter, form field, or even a custom HTTP header.
2.  **Unsanitized Incorporation:** This user input is then directly or indirectly used to construct an HTTP header value in the application's response.  This could happen when setting custom headers, redirecting users, or even when logging header information.
3.  **Control Character Injection:** An attacker crafts their input to include the control characters `\r\n`.  They might also include further headers after the `\r\n` sequence.
4.  **Header Separator Interpretation:** If the application or `fasthttp` (though less likely in `fasthttp` itself as it's designed for performance and generally handles basic HTTP protocol correctly) does not sanitize or encode these control characters, they are interpreted as header separators by the client (browser, proxy, etc.).
5.  **Malicious Header Injection:** This interpretation allows the attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the response.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine an application that sets a custom header based on user input:

```go
func handleRequest(ctx *fasthttp.RequestCtx) {
    userInput := string(ctx.QueryArgs().Peek("customHeader"))
    ctx.Response.Header.Set("X-Custom-Header", userInput) // Vulnerable line
    ctx.WriteString("Hello, World!")
}
```

If an attacker sends a request like:

`GET /?customHeader=Vulnerable\r\nX-Injected-Header: MaliciousValue`

The server might construct the following HTTP response headers (if unsanitized):

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
X-Custom-Header: Vulnerable
X-Injected-Header: MaliciousValue
Date: ...
Content-Length: ...
```

The attacker has successfully injected the `X-Injected-Header: MaliciousValue` header.

**Potential Impact:** HTTP Response Splitting (if reflected in responses), session fixation, cache poisoning, manipulation of backend systems if headers are forwarded.

**Detailed Impact Analysis:**

*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** This is a critical vulnerability that arises when an attacker can inject headers that effectively split the HTTP response into multiple responses. By injecting headers like `Content-Length`, `Transfer-Encoding`, and even a new HTTP status line, an attacker can control the content of subsequent "responses" that the client interprets. This can be used for:
    *   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into a subsequent "response" that the browser executes in the context of the vulnerable domain.
    *   **Cache Poisoning:**  Causing a proxy or browser cache to store a malicious "response" associated with a legitimate URL.
    *   **Bypassing Security Controls:**  Circumventing web application firewalls or other security mechanisms by manipulating the response structure.

    **Example of Response Splitting:**

    Using the previous vulnerable code, an attacker could inject:

    `GET /?customHeader=Vulnerable\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n<script>alert('XSS')</script>`

    The server might generate a response that, when interpreted by a vulnerable client, could lead to XSS execution.

*   **Session Fixation:** By injecting the `Set-Cookie` header, an attacker can attempt to fixate a user's session ID. This means the attacker can force the user to use a session ID of the attacker's choosing. If the application doesn't properly regenerate session IDs after authentication, the attacker can then hijack the user's session after they log in using the pre-set session ID.

    **Example of Session Fixation:**

    `GET /?customHeader=Vulnerable\r\nSet-Cookie: SESSIONID=attackerControlledID; Path=/`

    This could force the browser to set a specific `SESSIONID` cookie.

*   **Cache Poisoning:**  Injecting headers like `Cache-Control` or `Expires` can manipulate how proxies and browser caches store the response. An attacker could force a cache to store a malicious response for a longer duration or under different caching policies, affecting other users who subsequently request the same resource.

    **Example of Cache Poisoning:**

    `GET /?customHeader=Vulnerable\r\nCache-Control: public, max-age=3600`

    This could influence caching behavior if the application doesn't explicitly control caching headers.

*   **Manipulation of Backend Systems (if headers are forwarded):** In architectures where the `fasthttp` application acts as a reverse proxy or forwards headers to backend systems, injected headers can be propagated further down the chain. This could potentially:
    *   **Bypass Backend Authentication/Authorization:** If backend systems rely on specific headers for authentication or authorization, injected headers could be used to bypass these checks.
    *   **Influence Backend Logic:**  If backend applications process certain headers for business logic, injected headers could manipulate this logic in unintended ways.
    *   **Internal Network Exploitation:**  Injected headers might be used to probe or exploit vulnerabilities in internal systems if headers are forwarded within an internal network.

**Mitigation:** Strict header sanitization, removing or encoding control characters, avoiding reflection of user-supplied headers, principle of least privilege for header processing.

**Detailed Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strict Header Sanitization:**  This is the most crucial mitigation.  All user-provided input that is intended to be used in HTTP headers *must* be rigorously sanitized. This involves:
    *   **Identifying User Input Sources:**  Pinpointing all locations in the application where user input can influence HTTP header values (query parameters, form data, custom headers, etc.).
    *   **Input Validation:**  Defining allowed characters and formats for header values. Rejecting or sanitizing input that does not conform to these rules.
    *   **Control Character Removal/Encoding:**  Specifically removing or encoding control characters like `\r` and `\n` before incorporating user input into headers. Encoding is generally preferred to preserve the intended meaning of the input while preventing injection. URL encoding (`%0D%0A` for `\r\n`) or other appropriate encoding schemes can be used.

    **Example of Sanitization in Go:**

    ```go
    import (
        "net/url"
        "strings"
        "github.com/valyala/fasthttp"
    )

    func sanitizeHeaderValue(value string) string {
        // Remove or encode control characters. Encoding example:
        return url.QueryEscape(value)

        // Alternatively, remove control characters:
        // return strings.Map(func(r rune) rune {
        //     if r == '\r' || r == '\n' {
        //         return -1 // Remove rune
        //     }
        //     return r
        // }, value)
    }

    func handleRequest(ctx *fasthttp.RequestCtx) {
        userInput := string(ctx.QueryArgs().Peek("customHeader"))
        sanitizedInput := sanitizeHeaderValue(userInput)
        ctx.Response.Header.Set("X-Custom-Header", sanitizedInput)
        ctx.WriteString("Hello, World!")
    }
    ```

*   **Avoiding Reflection of User-Supplied Headers:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly reflecting user-supplied headers in the response. If it's necessary to include user-provided information in headers, use pre-defined, safe headers and carefully control the values being set.  Avoid directly copying user-provided header names or values into response headers without thorough validation.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege for Header Processing:**  Limit the application's logic that directly manipulates HTTP headers.  Minimize the use of dynamic header construction based on user input.  Favor using well-defined, static headers where possible.  If dynamic header manipulation is required, ensure it is handled in a centralized and secure manner with robust sanitization.

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct mitigation for header injection itself, a properly configured CSP can help mitigate the impact of HTTP Response Splitting leading to XSS. CSP can restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, reducing the effectiveness of injected JavaScript.

*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential header injection vulnerabilities in the application. Automated static analysis tools can also help detect code patterns that are prone to header injection.

### 5. Conclusion

Header injection attacks represent a significant security risk for applications, including those built with `fasthttp`.  Insufficient sanitization of user input used in HTTP headers can lead to various critical vulnerabilities, including HTTP Response Splitting, session fixation, and cache poisoning.

Implementing robust mitigation strategies, particularly strict header sanitization and avoiding direct reflection of user-supplied headers, is crucial to protect `fasthttp` applications from these attacks. Developers must be vigilant in identifying all points where user input influences header construction and apply appropriate sanitization techniques. Regular security assessments are essential to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of these mitigations. By prioritizing secure header handling, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of header injection attacks and enhance the overall security posture of their `fasthttp` applications.
