# Attack Surface Analysis for valyala/fasthttp

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/header_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious headers into HTTP requests. `fasthttp`'s performance-oriented design, prioritizing speed, might lead to less strict header validation during parsing. This can be exploited if application logic improperly handles or reflects these unsanitized headers.
**fasthttp Contribution:** `fasthttp`'s focus on speed over deep inspection can make it more reliant on application-level header sanitization. Lack of strict built-in header validation in `fasthttp` increases the risk if developers don't implement robust checks.
**Example:** Injecting `X-Forwarded-Host: malicious.example.com` header. If the application uses this header to construct URLs without validation, it can lead to open redirection to `malicious.example.com`.
**Impact:** HTTP Response Splitting/Smuggling, Cache Poisoning, Open Redirection, potentially Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if headers are reflected.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Header Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for all incoming headers *within the application logic* before any further processing or reflection.
*   **Avoid Direct Header Reflection:** Minimize or eliminate directly reflecting request headers in responses. If necessary, use secure encoding and sanitization functions.
*   **Secure Header Handling Libraries:** Utilize libraries or functions specifically designed for secure header manipulation to prevent injection vulnerabilities in application code.

## Attack Surface: [URL Parsing Vulnerabilities (Path Traversal)](./attack_surfaces/url_parsing_vulnerabilities__path_traversal_.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate URL paths to access unauthorized files or resources. While `fasthttp` provides URL parsing, its speed focus might encourage developers to rely on its output without sufficient application-level path sanitization, leading to vulnerabilities.
**fasthttp Contribution:** `fasthttp`'s efficient URL parsing, while beneficial for performance, doesn't inherently prevent path traversal.  Developers must implement path sanitization *on top* of `fasthttp`'s parsing results.
**Example:** An application uses `c.URI().Path()` to construct file paths without validation. A request with `/../../etc/passwd` could expose sensitive system files if the application directly uses this path for file access.
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, data breaches, information disclosure, potentially remote code execution if combined with other weaknesses.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Robust Path Sanitization:** Implement thorough sanitization and validation of URL paths *within the application* before using them for file or resource access. Use allow-lists and deny-lists for path components.
*   **Path Normalization:** Normalize paths to remove redundant elements like `.` and `..` before processing in the application.
*   **Chroot/Jail Environments:** Consider running the application in a restricted environment (chroot or jail) to limit file system access, as a defense-in-depth measure.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Request Bodies](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_large_request_bodies.md)

**Description:** Attackers send excessively large HTTP request bodies to exhaust server resources. `fasthttp`'s efficiency might inadvertently lead developers to overlook request body size limits, assuming it can handle arbitrary sizes, making the application vulnerable to DoS.
**fasthttp Contribution:** `fasthttp`'s performance can handle many requests, but it's still susceptible to resource exhaustion from oversized bodies if limits are not explicitly set *in the application or `fasthttp` configuration*.
**Example:** Sending a POST request with a massive `Content-Length` but slow data transmission. If the application attempts to buffer the entire body without limits, it can lead to memory exhaustion and server crash.
**Impact:** Service disruption, application downtime, resource exhaustion, potential financial losses.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enforce Request Body Size Limits:** Configure `fasthttp`'s server options or implement application-level checks to enforce strict limits on the maximum allowed request body size.
*   **Streaming Body Handling:** Process request bodies in a streaming manner instead of buffering the entire body in memory, especially for file uploads or large data submissions.
*   **Request Timeouts:** Set appropriate timeouts for request processing in `fasthttp` to prevent long-running requests from consuming resources indefinitely.

## Attack Surface: [Connection Exhaustion/DoS](./attack_surfaces/connection_exhaustiondos.md)

**Description:** Attackers open a large number of connections to the server, exceeding its capacity and preventing legitimate users from connecting. While `fasthttp` is designed for high concurrency, it still has limits and can be targeted by connection exhaustion attacks.
**fasthttp Contribution:** `fasthttp`'s ability to handle many connections can be a double-edged sword. Attackers can leverage this to attempt to exhaust the server's connection resources, even if `fasthttp` is more efficient than other servers.
**Example:** A botnet opens thousands of connections and keeps them alive with minimal activity, exhausting `fasthttp`'s connection pool and preventing new legitimate connections.
**Impact:** Service disruption, application downtime, inability for legitimate users to access the application.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Connection Limits in `fasthttp`:** Configure `fasthttp`'s server options to set reasonable limits on the maximum number of concurrent connections.
*   **Rate Limiting (Application or Proxy Level):** Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests or connections from a single IP address or user within a timeframe, often done at the application level or using a reverse proxy in front of `fasthttp`.
*   **Connection Timeouts in `fasthttp`:** Configure appropriate timeouts for idle connections in `fasthttp` to release resources held by inactive connections.
*   **SYN Flood Protection (Network Level):** Implement SYN cookie protection or other SYN flood mitigation techniques at the network level, often outside of `fasthttp` itself, but crucial for overall resilience.
