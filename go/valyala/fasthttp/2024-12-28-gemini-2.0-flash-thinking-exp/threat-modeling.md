Here's an updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving `fasthttp`:

### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving `fasthttp`

*   **Threat:** Slowloris/Slow Post Attack
    *   **Description:** An attacker establishes multiple connections to the server and sends partial HTTP requests or POST data very slowly, keeping the connections open for an extended period. This exhausts the server's connection pool, preventing legitimate users from connecting.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fasthttp`'s connection handling and request parsing. Specifically, the functions responsible for reading request data and managing connection timeouts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure aggressive timeouts for idle connections and request reads within `fasthttp`.
        *   Implement connection limits per IP address using middleware or a reverse proxy.
        *   Use a reverse proxy with built-in slowloris protection.
        *   Consider using operating system-level tools to limit connections.

*   **Threat:** Connection Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** An attacker rapidly opens and closes a large number of connections to the server. If `fasthttp` doesn't manage connection resources effectively, this can exhaust available file descriptors or other system resources, leading to denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, preventing the server from accepting new connections.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fasthttp`'s connection management, including the functions for accepting and closing connections.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `fasthttp`'s connection limits appropriately.
        *   Implement connection pooling and reuse strategies within the application.
        *   Use operating system-level limits on the number of open files/connections.
        *   Implement rate limiting on new connection attempts.
        *   Use a reverse proxy to act as a connection concentrator.

*   **Threat:** Request Smuggling
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a single HTTP request that is interpreted differently by `fasthttp` and an upstream proxy or load balancer. This allows the attacker to "smuggle" a second, malicious request to the backend server, potentially bypassing security controls.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, unauthorized access to resources, potential for further attacks on the backend.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fasthttp`'s request parsing and handling, particularly how it interprets Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure consistent HTTP parsing behavior between `fasthttp` and any upstream proxies.
        *   Configure the reverse proxy to normalize requests before forwarding them to `fasthttp`.
        *   Disable or carefully manage support for both `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers.
        *   Use HTTP/2 end-to-end if possible, as it is less susceptible to request smuggling.
