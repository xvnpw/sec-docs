## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using fasthttp](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_fasthttp.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents any successful compromise of the application through `fasthttp` vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

* This represents a broad category of attacks targeting how `fasthttp` processes incoming data.
    * **High-Risk Path: Exploit HTTP Header Parsing Vulnerabilities**
        * **Attack Vector: Craft Malformed Headers:**
            * Attackers send HTTP requests with headers that violate expected formats or standards.
            * This can potentially bypass security checks, cause parsing errors leading to unexpected behavior, or exploit vulnerabilities in how the application processes headers.
        * **Attack Vector: Inject Headers:**
            * Attackers inject malicious headers into HTTP requests.
            * If the application logic relies on these headers without proper sanitization, attackers can manipulate application behavior, potentially leading to session hijacking, cross-site scripting (XSS), or other vulnerabilities.
    * **High-Risk Path: Exploit Request Body Parsing Vulnerabilities**
        * **Attack Vector: Send Malformed Request Body:**
            * Attackers send HTTP requests with request bodies that do not conform to the expected content type (e.g., invalid JSON or XML).
            * This can cause parsing errors, lead to unexpected application behavior, or potentially trigger vulnerabilities in the parsing logic.
        * **Attack Vector: Exploit Large Request Body Size Limits:**
            * Attackers send HTTP requests with excessively large request bodies.
            * This can lead to memory exhaustion on the server, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
    * **High-Risk Path: Exploit URL Parsing Vulnerabilities**
        * **Attack Vector: Craft Malformed URLs:**
            * Attackers send HTTP requests with URLs that contain unexpected characters, sequences, or formatting.
            * This can potentially bypass routing logic, cause errors in URL processing, or expose vulnerabilities in how the application handles URLs.
        * **Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Characters in URL:**
            * Attackers inject specific characters or sequences into URLs.
            * This can be used to bypass security checks, perform path traversal attacks, or exploit vulnerabilities in URL handling logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit HTTP Header Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_http_header_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector: Craft Malformed Headers:**
            * Attackers send HTTP requests with headers that violate expected formats or standards.
            * This can potentially bypass security checks, cause parsing errors leading to unexpected behavior, or exploit vulnerabilities in how the application processes headers.
        **Attack Vector: Inject Headers:**
            * Attackers inject malicious headers into HTTP requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Body Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_body_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector: Send Malformed Request Body:**
            * Attackers send HTTP requests with request bodies that do not conform to the expected content type (e.g., invalid JSON or XML).
            * This can cause parsing errors, lead to unexpected application behavior, or potentially trigger vulnerabilities in the parsing logic.
        **Attack Vector: Exploit Large Request Body Size Limits:**
            * Attackers send HTTP requests with excessively large request bodies.
            * This can lead to memory exhaustion on the server, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit URL Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_url_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Connection Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_connection_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

* This represents attacks that target how `fasthttp` manages network connections.
    * **High-Risk Path: Connection Exhaustion**
        * **Attack Vector: Send Numerous Requests:**
            * Attackers rapidly send a large number of connection requests to the server.
            * `fasthttp`'s performance focus can make it vulnerable to this type of attack, as it might quickly consume available resources (e.g., file descriptors, memory) trying to handle the flood of connections, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).

## Attack Tree Path: [Connection Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/connection_exhaustion.md)

**Attack Vector: Send Numerous Requests:**
            * Attackers rapidly send a large number of connection requests to the server.
            * `fasthttp`'s performance focus can make it vulnerable to this type of attack, as it might quickly consume available resources (e.g., file descriptors, memory) trying to handle the flood of connections, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Specific `fasthttp` Features or Bugs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_specific__fasthttp__features_or_bugs.md)

* **Attack Vector: Leverage Publicly Disclosed CVEs:**
    * Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the `fasthttp` library that have been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers.
    * This involves using existing exploits or developing new ones to take advantage of these weaknesses, potentially leading to a range of impacts from denial of service to remote code execution. The likelihood depends on how quickly the application is patched after vulnerabilities are disclosed.
