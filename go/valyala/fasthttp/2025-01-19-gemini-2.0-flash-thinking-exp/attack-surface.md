# Attack Surface Analysis for valyala/fasthttp

## Attack Surface: [Oversized HTTP Headers](./attack_surfaces/oversized_http_headers.md)

*   **Description:**  The application is susceptible to resource exhaustion by processing requests with excessively large HTTP headers.
    *   **How `fasthttp` Contributes:** `fasthttp` needs to allocate memory to store and process incoming headers. If not configured with appropriate limits, it could be forced to allocate excessive memory, leading to DoS.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a request with hundreds or thousands of very long header lines.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion, potential for performance degradation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `fasthttp`'s server options to set limits on the maximum size of request headers.
        *   Implement application-level checks to reject requests with excessively large headers before further processing.

## Attack Surface: [Oversized HTTP Request Body](./attack_surfaces/oversized_http_request_body.md)

*   **Description:** The application can be overwhelmed by processing requests with extremely large bodies.
    *   **How `fasthttp` Contributes:** `fasthttp` needs to handle the incoming request body. Without proper limits, it might attempt to buffer the entire body in memory, leading to resource exhaustion.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a POST request with a multi-gigabyte payload.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion, potential for disk space exhaustion if the body is written to disk.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `fasthttp`'s server options to set limits on the maximum size of the request body.
        *   Implement application-level checks to reject requests exceeding the allowed body size.
        *   Consider using streaming techniques to process large request bodies without loading the entire content into memory.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tls_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** The application's HTTPS implementation is vulnerable due to insecure TLS/SSL configurations.
    *   **How `fasthttp` Contributes:** `fasthttp` provides the underlying TLS support. If the application using `fasthttp` configures TLS with weak ciphers, outdated protocols, or improper certificate handling, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** The application is configured to use SSLv3 or weak ciphers like RC4.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping on sensitive data, session hijacking.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `fasthttp` to use strong and modern TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).
        *   Disable support for weak ciphers and enable only secure cipher suites.
        *   Ensure proper certificate management and validation.

## Attack Surface: [Inadequate Request Timeout Configuration](./attack_surfaces/inadequate_request_timeout_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** The application is vulnerable to slowloris or similar denial-of-service attacks due to insufficient request timeout configurations.
    *   **How `fasthttp` Contributes:** `fasthttp`'s server configuration allows setting timeouts for various stages of request processing. If these timeouts are too long or not configured, attackers can hold connections open indefinitely, exhausting server resources.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a partial HTTP request and slowly sends the remaining data, keeping the connection alive for an extended period.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting server connection limits.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure appropriate timeouts for reading headers, reading request bodies, and idle connections in `fasthttp`'s server options.
        *   Implement connection limiting or rate limiting to prevent a single attacker from opening too many connections.
