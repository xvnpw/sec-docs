# Threat Model Analysis for valyala/fasthttp

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Request Header Parsing](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_request_header_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with excessively long headers. `fasthttp`'s header parsing logic might not properly handle these oversized headers, potentially writing beyond allocated buffer boundaries.
    *   **Impact:** This can lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution if the overflow overwrites critical memory regions.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fasthttp`'s request header parsing logic, specifically functions involved in reading and processing header lines.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `fasthttp`'s `MaxRequestHeaderSize` option to a reasonable limit.
        *   Ensure `fasthttp` is updated to the latest version, as newer versions may contain fixes for buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter out requests with excessively long headers.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Request Body Handling](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_request_body_handling.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a request with a body larger than expected or declared in the `Content-Length` header (or without a `Content-Length` when it's expected). If `fasthttp` doesn't handle this discrepancy correctly, it might lead to a buffer overflow when reading the body.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to header overflows, this can cause crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fasthttp`'s request body reading and processing functions, particularly those dealing with streaming or reading fixed-length bodies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `fasthttp`s `MaxRequestBodySize` option to a reasonable limit.
        *   Validate the `Content-Length` header and reject requests exceeding the limit.
        *   Ensure `fasthttp` is updated to the latest version.

## Threat: [HTTP Request Smuggling due to Parsing Differences](./threats/http_request_smuggling_due_to_parsing_differences.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request that is interpreted differently by `fasthttp` and upstream proxies or other backend servers. This allows the attacker to "smuggle" a second request within the first one, potentially bypassing security controls or accessing unintended resources on the backend.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or the ability to poison caches.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fasthttp`'s core HTTP request parsing logic, specifically how it handles ambiguous or malformed requests compared to other HTTP implementations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure consistent HTTP parsing behavior across all components in the request processing chain (proxies, load balancers, backend servers).
        *   Avoid using `fasthttp` in configurations where it directly interacts with systems with significantly different HTTP parsing implementations without careful testing.
        *   Consider using a WAF that can normalize HTTP requests.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Slowloris Attack](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_slowloris_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends partial HTTP requests slowly, keeping many connections to the server open and exhausting server resources, preventing legitimate users from connecting. `fasthttp`'s handling of persistent connections might be vulnerable if not configured properly.
    *   **Impact:**  The application becomes unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fasthttp`'s connection handling and keep-alive mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure appropriate timeouts for idle connections in `fasthttp` (`ReadTimeout`, `WriteTimeout`).
        *   Implement connection limits to restrict the number of concurrent connections from a single IP address.
        *   Use a reverse proxy or load balancer with built-in DoS protection.
