# Attack Tree Analysis for valyala/fasthttp

Objective: To compromise the application utilizing the `fasthttp` library by exploiting its specific vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* Compromise Application via fasthttp Vulnerabilities
    * **[HIGH_RISK PATH]** Exploit Request Parsing Weaknesses
        * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Excessive Header Length Attack
        * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Excessive URI Length Attack
    * **[HIGH_RISK PATH]** Exploit Connection Handling Weaknesses
        * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Connection Exhaustion Attack
    * Exploit Specific `fasthttp` Implementation Details
        * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Race Conditions in Internal Logic
        * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Memory Management Issues
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Parsing Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_parsing_weaknesses.md)

*   This path is high-risk because vulnerabilities in request parsing can lead to direct exploitation of the server or application.

    *   **Critical Node: Excessive Header Length Attack**
        *   Attack Vector: Send requests with extremely long headers exceeding buffer limits.
        *   Insight: `fasthttp` might have fixed-size buffers for header parsing, leading to buffer overflows or denial of service.

    *   **Critical Node: Excessive URI Length Attack**
        *   Attack Vector: Send requests with extremely long URIs exceeding buffer limits.
        *   Insight: Similar to headers, long URIs can cause buffer overflows or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Connection Handling Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_connection_handling_weaknesses.md)

*   This path is high-risk as successful exploitation can lead to Denial of Service, impacting the availability of the application.

    *   **Critical Node: Connection Exhaustion Attack**
        *   Attack Vector: Rapid Connection Opening: Open a large number of connections quickly to overwhelm the server's connection pool.
        *   Insight: `fasthttp`'s connection handling might have limitations on the number of concurrent connections it can efficiently manage.
