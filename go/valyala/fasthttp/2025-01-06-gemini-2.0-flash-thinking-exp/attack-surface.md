# Attack Surface Analysis for valyala/fasthttp

## Attack Surface: [Lenient HTTP Parsing Leading to HTTP Request Smuggling/Desync](./attack_surfaces/lenient_http_parsing_leading_to_http_request_smugglingdesync.md)

*   **Description:**  `fasthttp`'s focus on performance leads to a more lenient interpretation of HTTP specifications compared to stricter parsers. This can create discrepancies in how `fasthttp` and intermediary proxies or backend servers parse the same request.
*   **How `fasthttp` Contributes:**  `fasthttp` might accept requests with minor deviations from the HTTP standard (e.g., unusual whitespace, missing headers in certain scenarios) that other parsers would reject. This ambiguity can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a request with two `Content-Length` headers with different values. `fasthttp` might process the request based on one value, while an upstream proxy uses the other, leading to the proxy misinterpreting subsequent requests as belonging to the initial one.
*   **Impact:**  Attackers can inject malicious requests into the backend, potentially bypassing security controls, poisoning caches, or gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use a Standard Compliant Reverse Proxy:** Place a well-configured reverse proxy (like Nginx or HAProxy) in front of the `fasthttp` application. These proxies typically have stricter HTTP parsing and can normalize requests before they reach the application.
    *   **Avoid Relying on Ambiguous HTTP Constructs:**  Design application logic to avoid relying on HTTP features or edge cases that could be interpreted differently by various parsers.

## Attack Surface: [Direct Byte Slice Access Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/direct_byte_slice_access_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** `fasthttp` provides direct access to the underlying byte slices of request and response data for performance. If not handled carefully, this can lead to memory safety issues.
*   **How `fasthttp` Contributes:**  Methods like `Request.Body()`, `Response.Body()`, `Request.URI().FullURI()`, etc., return byte slices. Incorrectly calculating offsets or lengths when working with these slices can lead to out-of-bounds reads or writes.
*   **Example:** Application code attempts to parse a header value by slicing the header byte slice but uses an incorrect length, potentially reading beyond the allocated memory.
*   **Impact:**  Memory corruption, crashes, information leakage (reading sensitive data from adjacent memory), or potentially even remote code execution in severe cases.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful Bounds Checking:**  Always validate offsets and lengths before accessing or manipulating byte slices.
    *   **Use Safe Copying Techniques:** When processing data from byte slices, consider copying the relevant portions into safer data structures (like strings or byte arrays with known bounds) to avoid direct manipulation risks.
    *   **Utilize `fasthttp`'s Helper Functions:**  Leverage `fasthttp`'s built-in functions for header parsing and other common tasks, as they often have built-in safety checks.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews focusing on how byte slices are handled.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in `fasthttp`'s Custom Implementations](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in__fasthttp_'s_custom_implementations.md)

*   **Description:** `fasthttp` implements many core HTTP functionalities itself for performance reasons. Bugs or vulnerabilities in these custom implementations could introduce security risks.
*   **How `fasthttp` Contributes:**  Instead of relying on standard library implementations, `fasthttp` has its own parsing logic, connection handling, etc. Bugs in these custom components are specific to `fasthttp`.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in `fasthttp`'s HTTP/2 implementation (if used) could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service or other issues.
*   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, potentially including denial of service, information disclosure, or even remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be High or Critical depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Stay Updated:**  Keep `fasthttp` updated to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:**  Subscribe to or regularly check for security advisories related to `fasthttp`.
    *   **Consider Alternative Libraries for Critical Functionality:**  If security is paramount for specific features (e.g., complex protocol handling), consider using more standard and heavily vetted libraries for those parts of the application.
