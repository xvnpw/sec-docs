## Deep Dive Threat Analysis: Response Splitting via Direct Body Writing in fasthttp Application

**Threat ID:** RS-DBW-001

**Threat:** Response Splitting via Direct Body Writing

**Context:** This analysis focuses on the threat of response splitting when an application built using the `valyala/fasthttp` library directly writes data to the response body without proper encoding or sanitization.

**1. Detailed Threat Description:**

The core issue lies in the way HTTP responses are structured. They consist of headers followed by a blank line (`\r\n`) and then the response body. Response splitting occurs when an attacker can inject newline characters (`\r\n`) into the response body, effectively terminating the current response and allowing them to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and a subsequent response body.

In the context of `fasthttp`, the `Response.BodyWriter()` provides methods like `Write`, `WriteString`, and `Writef` that allow developers to directly manipulate the response body. If data written using these methods originates from user input or external sources and is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject the sequence `\r\n\r\n` followed by malicious headers and content.

**Example Attack Payload:**

Imagine an application echoes user input back in the response body:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/valyala/fasthttp"
)

func main() {
	h := func(ctx *fasthttp.RequestCtx) {
		userInput := string(ctx.QueryArgs().Peek("input"))
		fmt.Fprintf(ctx.Response.BodyWriter(), "You said: %s", userInput)
	}

	fasthttp.ListenAndServe(":8080", h)
}
```

An attacker could craft a URL like this:

```
http://localhost:8080/?input=test%0d%0aContent-Type:%20text/html%0d%0a%0d%0a<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

Here's how the injected payload breaks down:

* `%0d%0a`: URL-encoded representation of `\r\n` (carriage return and line feed).
* `Content-Type: text/html`: Injected HTTP header, telling the browser to interpret the following content as HTML.
* `%0d%0a`: Another `\r\n` to separate the injected headers from the injected body.
* `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`: Malicious JavaScript code.

The resulting raw HTTP response would look something like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: ...
Date: ...

You said: test
Content-Type: text/html

<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

The browser, upon receiving this response, might interpret the injected headers and the subsequent script as a separate, valid HTTP response, leading to the execution of the malicious JavaScript.

**2. Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

* **Reflected Input:** The most common scenario is when the application reflects user-provided data in the response body without sanitization. This includes query parameters, form data, or any other input that finds its way into the response.
* **Data from External Sources:** If the application fetches data from external sources (databases, APIs, files) and includes it in the response body without proper encoding, and this external data can be manipulated by an attacker, response splitting is possible.
* **Logging or Debugging Output:** If debugging or logging information is directly written to the response body and includes unsanitized user input, it can be a potential attack vector.

**3. Impact Analysis:**

The consequences of a successful response splitting attack can be severe:

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** As demonstrated in the example, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable application's domain. This allows them to steal cookies, redirect users, deface the website, or perform other malicious actions.
* **Cache Poisoning:** If the injected response is cached by intermediate proxies or the browser's cache, subsequent users requesting the same resource might receive the malicious response. This can have a widespread impact and persist for a significant time.
* **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Attackers can inject the `Location` header to redirect users to phishing sites or other malicious destinations.
* **Session Fixation:**  Attackers might be able to inject `Set-Cookie` headers to set or manipulate session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
* **Content Spoofing:** By injecting arbitrary HTML content, attackers can alter the perceived content of the page, potentially tricking users into providing sensitive information.

**4. Affected Components in `fasthttp`:**

The primary affected components are the methods provided by `fasthttp.Response.BodyWriter()`:

* **`Write(p []byte)`:** Writes the contents of `p` to the response body.
* **`WriteString(s string)`:** Writes the contents of `s` to the response body.
* **`Writef(format string, a ...interface{})`:** Formats according to a format specifier and writes the resulting string to the response body.

Any code path that utilizes these methods to directly write user-controlled or external data to the response body without proper encoding or sanitization is vulnerable.

**5. Risk Severity Assessment:**

Given the potential for severe impact, including XSS, cache poisoning, and redirection, the **High** risk severity is justified. The ease of exploitation can vary depending on the application's architecture, but the fundamental vulnerability is relatively straightforward to understand and exploit.

**6. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed Analysis and Recommendations):**

* **Prioritize Encoding/Sanitization:**
    * **Context-Aware Encoding:**  The most crucial mitigation is to always encode output data appropriately for the context in which it will be displayed.
        * **HTML Encoding:** Use HTML escaping functions (e.g., `html.EscapeString` in Go's standard library) for any data that will be rendered as HTML. This will convert characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, and `'` into their corresponding HTML entities.
        * **URL Encoding:**  Use URL encoding (e.g., `url.QueryEscape`) for data that will be part of a URL.
        * **JavaScript Encoding:** If embedding data within JavaScript, ensure it's properly escaped according to JavaScript syntax.
    * **Avoid Manual String Concatenation for Output:**  Favor using templating engines or dedicated output encoding libraries that handle escaping automatically.
* **Leverage `fasthttp`'s Built-in Features (Where Applicable):**
    * **`SetBodyString(s string)`:**  While it still requires careful handling of `s`, using this method for setting the entire response body might be safer in some scenarios compared to direct writing, as it handles some basic checks. However, it doesn't inherently prevent injection if `s` contains malicious characters.
    * **`SetContentType(mimeType string)`:** Ensure the `Content-Type` header is set correctly and consistently. This can help the browser interpret the content as intended, although it doesn't prevent response splitting itself.
* **Strict Input Validation:**
    * **Whitelist Approach:** Define a strict set of allowed characters and patterns for user input. Reject any input that doesn't conform to these rules.
    * **Sanitize Input:** While not a primary defense against response splitting, sanitizing input can help reduce the attack surface. However, be extremely cautious with sanitization as it can be error-prone and might not catch all malicious patterns. Encoding is generally preferred over sanitization for output.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks. CSP allows you to define trusted sources for scripts, stylesheets, and other resources, reducing the effectiveness of injected malicious code.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including response splitting flaws.
* **Use Security Libraries and Frameworks:**
    * Consider using web frameworks built on top of `fasthttp` that provide built-in protection against common web vulnerabilities, including response splitting.
* **Educate Developers:**
    * Ensure developers are aware of the risks associated with response splitting and understand the importance of secure coding practices, particularly regarding output encoding.

**7. Exploitation Scenario (Step-by-Step):**

1. **Identify a vulnerable endpoint:** Find an endpoint where user input or external data is directly written to the response body using `fasthttp.Response.BodyWriter()`.
2. **Craft a malicious payload:** Construct a URL or request containing the `\r\n` sequence followed by malicious HTTP headers and content. For example: `?param=vulnerable%0d%0aContent-Type:%20text/html%0d%0a%0d%0a<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
3. **Send the malicious request:** Send the crafted request to the vulnerable application.
4. **Observe the response:** The server, if vulnerable, will include the injected headers and content in the response.
5. **Browser interpretation:** The browser receiving the response might interpret the injected part as a separate HTTP response, leading to the execution of the injected script or other malicious actions.

**8. Developer Checklist for Prevention:**

* **Never directly write raw user input to the response body without encoding.**
* **Always use context-aware encoding functions for output data (HTML, URL, JavaScript).**
* **Prefer templating engines or output encoding libraries for automatic escaping.**
* **Validate and sanitize user input before processing it.**
* **Set the `Content-Type` header explicitly and correctly.**
* **Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP).**
* **Regularly review code for potential response splitting vulnerabilities.**
* **Conduct security testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.**

**9. Conclusion:**

Response splitting via direct body writing is a significant threat in `fasthttp` applications. By directly manipulating the response body without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious content, leading to severe consequences like XSS and cache poisoning. A robust defense strategy relies on a combination of secure coding practices, primarily focusing on context-aware output encoding, along with input validation and the implementation of security headers like CSP. Developers must be acutely aware of this vulnerability and prioritize secure output handling to protect their applications and users.
