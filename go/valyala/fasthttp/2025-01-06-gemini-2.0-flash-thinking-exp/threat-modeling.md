# Threat Model Analysis for valyala/fasthttp

## Threat: [Malformed HTTP Request Parsing Vulnerability](./threats/malformed_http_request_parsing_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request with malformed headers, methods, or URLs that exploit vulnerabilities in `fasthttp`'s parsing logic. This could cause the application to crash, hang, or exhibit unexpected behavior. The attacker aims to disrupt the service or potentially bypass security checks if the parsing deviates from other HTTP implementations.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential for bypassing security mechanisms.

**Affected Component:** `fasthttp`'s request parsing module, specifically functions handling header and request line parsing.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `fasthttp` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization before passing data to `fasthttp`'s request handling functions, although this might be redundant with `fasthttp`'s own parsing.
*   Consider using a reverse proxy or a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the application to filter out malformed requests before they reach `fasthttp`.

## Threat: [Header Injection via Direct Header Manipulation](./threats/header_injection_via_direct_header_manipulation.md)

**Description:** If the application uses `fasthttp`'s API to directly set or modify HTTP headers without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious header values. This could lead to response splitting, cache poisoning, or session fixation attacks. The attacker crafts input that, when used to set a header, includes control characters or malicious directives.

**Impact:** Response splitting, cache poisoning, session fixation, cross-site scripting (XSS) if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** `fasthttp`'s response header manipulation functions (e.g., methods on `Response.Header`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always sanitize and validate header values before setting them using `fasthttp`'s API.
*   Utilize `fasthttp`'s built-in functions for setting standard headers where possible, as they might provide some level of protection.
*   Avoid constructing headers manually using string concatenation; prefer the provided API methods.

## Threat: [Request Smuggling due to Non-Standard Parsing](./threats/request_smuggling_due_to_non-standard_parsing.md)

**Description:** `fasthttp`'s custom HTTP parsing logic might interpret certain ambiguous or malformed requests differently than other HTTP intermediaries (like proxies or load balancers). An attacker can exploit this discrepancy to "smuggle" a second request within the first one, leading to actions being performed in a different security context or bypassing security controls.

**Impact:** Bypassing security controls, unauthorized access, cache poisoning, request routing manipulation.

**Affected Component:** `fasthttp`'s core request parsing module and connection handling logic.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure all HTTP intermediaries in the application architecture adhere to strict HTTP parsing standards.
*   Thoroughly test the application's behavior with various HTTP proxies and load balancers to identify potential discrepancies.
*   Consider configuring intermediaries to reject ambiguous or non-compliant requests.
*   Keep `fasthttp` updated, as parsing vulnerabilities might be discovered and fixed.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Large Headers or Body](./threats/denial_of_service_via_large_headers_or_body.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a request with excessively large headers or body, overwhelming `fasthttp`'s parsing and processing capabilities. This can consume significant server resources (CPU, memory), leading to a denial of service. The attacker aims to make the application unavailable to legitimate users.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).

**Affected Component:** `fasthttp`'s request parsing and body reading functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure appropriate limits for maximum request header and body sizes within the application or using a reverse proxy.
*   Implement timeouts for request processing to prevent indefinitely long requests from consuming resources.
*   Consider using a reverse proxy with rate limiting and request size limits.

## Threat: [Response Splitting via Direct Body Writing](./threats/response_splitting_via_direct_body_writing.md)

**Description:** If the application directly writes to the response body without proper encoding or sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious content, including HTTP headers. This can lead to response splitting attacks where the attacker can inject a second, malicious HTTP response.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), cache poisoning, redirection to malicious sites.

**Affected Component:** `fasthttp`'s response body writing functions (e.g., methods on `Response.BodyWriter`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always encode output data appropriately for the context (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML content).
*   Utilize `fasthttp`'s provided functions for writing responses, which might offer some level of protection against basic injection attempts.
*   Avoid directly writing raw strings to the response body without proper sanitization.
