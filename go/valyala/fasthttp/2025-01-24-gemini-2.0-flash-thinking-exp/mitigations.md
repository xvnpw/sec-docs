# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for valyala/fasthttp

## Mitigation Strategy: [Request Size Limits](./mitigation_strategies/request_size_limits.md)

### 1. Request Size Limits

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Request Size Limits using `MaxRequestBodySize`
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `MaxRequestBodySize`:** In your `fasthttp.Server` configuration, set the `MaxRequestBodySize` option to a reasonable value based on the expected maximum size of request bodies your application needs to handle. For example, use code like: `server := &fasthttp.Server{ MaxRequestBodySize: 10 * 1024 * 1024 }` to limit request bodies to 10MB. This setting is a direct configuration of `fasthttp.Server`.
    2.  **Test limits:** Test your application with requests exceeding the configured limits to ensure it behaves as expected, specifically that `fasthttp` returns a 413 Payload Too Large error.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the server by sending extremely large requests that consume excessive bandwidth and server resources. `fasthttp`'s `MaxRequestBodySize` directly addresses this by rejecting oversized requests early.
    *   **Buffer Overflow (Low Severity):**  While `fasthttp` is designed to handle large requests efficiently, extremely large requests without limits could potentially contribute to memory pressure or other resource exhaustion issues. `MaxRequestBodySize` provides a safeguard.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** High Reduction
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** Low Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `MaxRequestBodySize` is set to 5MB in the `fasthttp.Server` configuration for the main application server. This utilizes `fasthttp`'s built-in limit.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Header size limits are not explicitly checked or enforced beyond `fasthttp`'s defaults. While `fasthttp` has internal header size limits, explicit configuration or checks are not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeout Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/timeout_configuration.md)

### 2. Timeout Configuration

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Set Appropriate Timeouts using `fasthttp.Server` options
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `ReadTimeout`:** Set `ReadTimeout` in `fasthttp.Server` to limit the time the server waits for the client to send the request.  Example: `server := &fasthttp.Server{ ReadTimeout: 5 * time.Second }`. This is a direct `fasthttp.Server` configuration.
    2.  **Configure `WriteTimeout`:** Set `WriteTimeout` in `fasthttp.Server` to limit the time the server spends writing the response to the client. Example: `server := &fasthttp.Server{ WriteTimeout: 5 * time.Second }`. This is also a direct `fasthttp.Server` configuration.
    3.  **Configure `IdleTimeout`:** Set `IdleTimeout` in `fasthttp.Server` to close idle connections after a period of inactivity. Example: `server := &fasthttp.Server{ IdleTimeout: time.Minute }`.  This utilizes `fasthttp.Server`'s connection management.
    4.  **Review and adjust timeouts:** Regularly review and adjust timeout values in `fasthttp.Server` based on application performance and observed network conditions.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Slowloris DoS Attacks (High Severity):** `ReadTimeout` and `IdleTimeout` in `fasthttp.Server` effectively mitigate Slowloris attacks by preventing attackers from holding connections open indefinitely while sending data slowly.
    *   **Slow Read Attacks (High Severity):** `ReadTimeout` in `fasthttp.Server` prevents attackers from initiating a connection and then slowly sending the request, tying up server resources.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** `IdleTimeout` in `fasthttp.Server` helps prevent resource exhaustion by closing idle connections, freeing up server resources for active connections.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Slowloris DoS Attacks:** High Reduction
    *   **Slow Read Attacks:** High Reduction
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `ReadTimeout`, `WriteTimeout`, and `IdleTimeout` are set in the `fasthttp.Server` configuration with default values (e.g., `ReadTimeout: 10 * time.Second`, `WriteTimeout: 10 * time.Second`, `IdleTimeout: time.Minute`). These are configured directly within `fasthttp.Server`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Timeouts have not been specifically tuned based on application performance testing or security considerations. The current timeout values in `fasthttp.Server` are the default and might be too lenient or too strict for specific endpoints.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Concurrent Connection Limits](./mitigation_strategies/concurrent_connection_limits.md)

### 3. Concurrent Connection Limits

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit Concurrent Connections using `fasthttp.Server`'s `Concurrency` option
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `Concurrency`:** Set the `Concurrency` option in `fasthttp.Server` to limit the maximum number of concurrent connections the server will handle. Choose a value based on your server's capacity and expected traffic. Example: `server := &fasthttp.Server{ Concurrency: 1000 }`. This is a direct `fasthttp.Server` configuration.
    2.  **Monitor connection counts:** Monitor the number of concurrent connections to your server to detect potential DoS attacks or unexpected traffic spikes. While monitoring isn't directly `fasthttp`, it's crucial to assess the effectiveness of the `Concurrency` setting.
    3.  **Adjust limits dynamically:** Consider implementing dynamic adjustment of the `Concurrency` limit in `fasthttp.Server` based on server load and available resources.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Limits the impact of connection-based DoS attacks by preventing attackers from opening an excessive number of connections and exhausting server resources. `fasthttp`'s `Concurrency` setting is designed for this purpose.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Prevents legitimate traffic spikes from overwhelming the server by limiting the number of concurrent requests that `fasthttp.Server` will handle simultaneously.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** High Reduction
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `Concurrency` is set to a default value of 0 (unlimited) in `fasthttp.Server` configuration. The default `fasthttp.Server` configuration is used without explicit concurrency limits.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `Concurrency` limit needs to be configured in `fasthttp.Server` based on server capacity.  The `Concurrency` setting in `fasthttp.Server` needs to be adjusted from the default. Connection count monitoring is not in place to inform the optimal `Concurrency` value.
