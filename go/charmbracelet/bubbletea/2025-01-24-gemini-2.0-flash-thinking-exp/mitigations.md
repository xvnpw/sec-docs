# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for charmbracelet/bubbletea

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User Input](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user_input.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize User Input
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Bubble Tea Input Handlers:** Locate all places in your Bubble Tea application's `Update` function where user input is processed via `tea.KeyMsg` and `tea.MouseMsg`.
    2.  **Sanitize Input in `Update` Function:** Within these input handlers, before processing or displaying user input received from `tea.KeyMsg` or `tea.MouseMsg`, apply sanitization techniques. Focus on removing or escaping terminal escape sequences that could be embedded within the input.
    3.  **Utilize Go Libraries or Custom Functions:** Implement sanitization using Go's string manipulation functions or external libraries designed to handle terminal escape sequences.
    4.  **Apply Sanitization Before State Update or Output:** Ensure sanitization occurs *before* the input is used to update the Bubble Tea `model` or is rendered to the terminal using Bubble Tea components.
    5.  **Test with Bubble Tea Input:** Test sanitization specifically with input received through Bubble Tea's input mechanisms to ensure it effectively handles terminal escape sequences within the Bubble Tea context.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Terminal Escape Sequence Injection (High Severity):** Attackers can inject malicious terminal escape sequences through user input processed by Bubble Tea, manipulating the terminal display and potentially leading to denial of service, information spoofing, or in rare cases, code execution. This threat is directly relevant to how Bubble Tea handles terminal input.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of terminal escape sequence injection attacks specifically within Bubble Tea applications.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in the `handleKeyMsg` function within `model.go` for text input fields, using a custom function `sanitizeInputString` that strips ANSI escape codes. This function is applied to `tea.KeyMsg` input.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Not yet implemented for mouse input handling (`tea.MouseMsg`) or in any parts of the application that might process input indirectly through Bubble Tea components but bypass the current sanitization in `handleKeyMsg`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate State Transitions Based on Bubble Tea Input](./mitigation_strategies/validate_state_transitions_based_on_bubble_tea_input.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Validate State Transitions Based on Bubble Tea Input
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Bubble Tea State Transitions:** Map out the intended state transitions in your Bubble Tea application, focusing on how user interactions via `tea.KeyMsg` and `tea.MouseMsg` should trigger state changes within the `model`.
    2.  **Implement Validation in Bubble Tea `Update` Function:** Within the `Update` function, specifically in the handlers for `tea.KeyMsg` and `tea.MouseMsg`, implement validation logic *before* applying state updates. Check if the incoming message and the current state allow for the intended state transition.
    3.  **Control State Updates Based on `tea.Msg`:** Ensure that state updates in the `model` are only performed as a direct result of processing validated `tea.Msg` messages. Avoid state changes triggered by unvalidated or unexpected message types within the `Update` function.
    4.  **Use Bubble Tea's State Management:** Leverage Bubble Tea's `model` and `Update` function as the central point for managing application state and controlling transitions based on user input received through Bubble Tea's message system.
    5.  **Test Bubble Tea State Transitions:** Thoroughly test state transitions triggered by various `tea.KeyMsg` and `tea.MouseMsg` inputs to ensure only valid transitions occur and unexpected input does not lead to state corruption.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **State Corruption (Medium to High Severity, depending on application logic):** Prevents attackers from manipulating the application state into an inconsistent or invalid state by sending unexpected or malicious input through Bubble Tea's input mechanisms (`tea.KeyMsg`, `tea.MouseMsg`). This is directly related to how Bubble Tea manages state via the `model` and `Update` function.
    *   **Logic Exploits (Medium Severity):** Reduces the potential for logic exploits that rely on manipulating the application state in unintended ways through Bubble Tea input to achieve malicious goals.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of state corruption and logic exploits caused by invalid state transitions triggered by Bubble Tea input. Improves application robustness and predictability within the Bubble Tea framework.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic state transitions are managed in the `Update` function in `main.go` using conditional logic based on `tea.Msg` types and current state.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal state transition validation based on `tea.Msg` input is not explicitly implemented. The application relies on implicit logic within the `Update` function.  A state machine pattern could be integrated to formalize and strengthen state transition management within the Bubble Tea `Update` function.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Output Displayed via Bubble Tea Components](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_output_displayed_via_bubble_tea_components.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize Output Displayed via Bubble Tea Components
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Bubble Tea Output Points:** Locate all places in your Bubble Tea application where data, including user input or external data, is rendered to the terminal using Bubble Tea components (e.g., `textarea`, `list`, custom components using `fmt.Sprintf` or similar for rendering).
    2.  **Sanitize Data Before Bubble Tea Rendering:** Before passing data to Bubble Tea components for rendering, apply sanitization techniques to prevent terminal escape sequence injection in the output.
    3.  **Apply Sanitization in `View` Function or Component Render Methods:** Implement sanitization within the `View` function or within the `Render` methods of custom Bubble Tea components, ensuring data is sanitized *before* it is formatted and returned as a string for terminal output.
    4.  **Utilize Go Libraries or Custom Functions for Output Sanitization:** Use the same or similar sanitization functions as used for input sanitization to process data before it is rendered by Bubble Tea components.
    5.  **Test Bubble Tea Output Sanitization:** Test output sanitization specifically within the context of Bubble Tea components to ensure that data rendered by these components is free from malicious terminal escape sequences.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Terminal Escape Sequence Injection in Output (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious terminal escape sequences through data displayed by Bubble Tea components, even if the input itself was sanitized. This threat is directly related to how Bubble Tea renders output to the terminal.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of terminal escape sequence injection through application output rendered by Bubble Tea components.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Output sanitization is partially implemented in the same `sanitizeInputString` function used for input, which is also applied to some output strings in the UI rendered by Bubble Tea components.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Output sanitization is not consistently applied to all output points rendered by Bubble Tea components, especially when displaying data retrieved from external sources or dynamically generated content within components. Output sanitization should be systematically applied to all strings rendered by Bubble Tea components that originate from user input or external data.
