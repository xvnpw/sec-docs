# Attack Surface Analysis for charmbracelet/bubbletea

## Attack Surface: [Input Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/input_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting insufficient input validation to inject malicious data or commands through user input channels, specifically the terminal input stream used by Bubble Tea applications.
*   **Bubble Tea Contribution:** Bubble Tea applications are fundamentally interactive and driven by terminal input (keyboard, mouse events). This direct reliance on user input makes input injection a primary and directly relevant attack vector. Bubble Tea provides the mechanism for handling this input, but doesn't enforce or provide built-in input sanitization, leaving it to the developer.
*   **Example:** A Bubble Tea application takes user input to execute commands. If the input is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject shell commands within the input string. For instance, if the application uses user input to construct a command executed via `os/exec`, injecting something like `; rm -rf /` could lead to arbitrary command execution on the system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) - if injected commands can be executed by the system.
    *   Privilege Escalation - if injected commands can be used to gain higher privileges.
    *   Data Breach - if injected commands can be used to access or exfiltrate sensitive data.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - by injecting commands that crash the application or consume excessive resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (Critical if RCE is achievable, High for other severe impacts like privilege escalation or data breach).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Inputs:** Define and strictly enforce allowed characters, input formats, and command structures. Reject any input that deviates from the whitelist.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Escape or remove any potentially harmful characters or sequences from user input *before* processing it in any way.  This is crucial before using input in commands, file paths, or any system calls.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Input Handling:** Design input handling logic to operate with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running input processing or command execution with elevated permissions if possible.
    *   **Secure Command Execution (Avoid if possible):**
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Command Construction:**  If possible, avoid constructing commands dynamically from user input. Use pre-defined commands or actions instead.
        *   **Parameterization:** If dynamic command construction is unavoidable, use parameterized commands or safe functions that prevent injection.
        *   **Input Validation for Command Parameters:** Even with parameterization, rigorously validate any user input used as parameters to commands.
        *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:** If executing external commands based on user input is necessary, consider sandboxing or isolating the execution environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Attack Surface: [State Management Vulnerabilities Leading to Privilege Escalation or Data Breach](./attack_surfaces/state_management_vulnerabilities_leading_to_privilege_escalation_or_data_breach.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting flaws in the application's state management logic, facilitated by Bubble Tea's state-driven architecture, to manipulate the application's internal state in ways that lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or data breaches.
*   **Bubble Tea Contribution:** Bubble Tea's core design revolves around the `Model` and state updates.  If state transitions are not carefully controlled and validated, vulnerabilities can arise directly from how Bubble Tea manages application flow and data based on user interactions.  Bubble Tea provides the framework for state management, but secure state transition logic is the developer's responsibility.
*   **Example:** Consider an application with user roles managed in its state (e.g., "user", "admin"). A vulnerability in the state transition logic, perhaps triggered by a specific input sequence or a race condition in state updates, could allow an attacker to change their user role in the application's state from "user" to "admin" without proper authentication or authorization. This could grant them administrative privileges and access to sensitive data or functions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Privilege Escalation - gaining unauthorized administrative or higher-level access.
    *   Data Breach - accessing or modifying sensitive data due to unauthorized state transitions.
    *   Authentication Bypass - circumventing authentication mechanisms by manipulating state to bypass login requirements.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (Critical if privilege escalation leads to significant data breach or system compromise, High for privilege escalation alone).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure and Robust State Transition Logic:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege in State Access:** Restrict access to state variables and state modification functions to only the necessary parts of the application.
        *   **Strict State Transition Validation:** Implement rigorous checks and validations before allowing any state transition, especially those related to user roles, permissions, or sensitive data access.
        *   **Authentication and Authorization Checks:**  Enforce authentication and authorization checks *before* any state transition that grants access to privileged features or data. Do not rely solely on state to enforce security; use explicit checks.
        *   **Immutable State (where applicable):** Utilize immutable data structures for state where possible to reduce the risk of accidental or malicious state modification. If immutability is not fully feasible, treat state as immutable as much as possible and carefully control state updates.
        *   **State Integrity Monitoring:** Implement mechanisms to periodically monitor and validate the integrity of the application's state to detect and respond to unauthorized modifications or corruption.
    *   **Thorough Testing of State Transitions:**
        *   Conduct comprehensive testing of all state transitions, including edge cases and unexpected input sequences, to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities in state management logic.
        *   Include security-focused testing scenarios that specifically attempt to manipulate state in unauthorized ways.

These two attack surfaces represent the most critical security concerns directly related to developing applications with Bubble Tea. Addressing these areas with robust mitigation strategies is essential for building secure terminal-based applications.
