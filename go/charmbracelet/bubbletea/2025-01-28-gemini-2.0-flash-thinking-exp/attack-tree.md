## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Input Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Injecting crafted input to manipulate application behavior.
    *   **Command Injection [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Injecting shell commands via input fields or prompts when the application uses input to execute system commands.
    *   **Input Validation Bypass [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Crafting input to circumvent input validation and inject unexpected or malicious data.
    *   **Terminal Escape Sequences Injection - Execute arbitrary commands [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Injecting terminal escape sequences to execute commands on the user's terminal (if vulnerable terminal emulator).

*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depending on application design and input handling implementation).
*   **Impact:** Medium to Critical (ranging from logic bypass and data manipulation to full system compromise).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strict Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement robust validation and sanitization on all user inputs. Use allow-lists and escape special characters.
    *   Avoid Executing Shell Commands Based on User Input: Minimize or eliminate the need to execute shell commands based on user input. If necessary, use parameterized commands and careful sanitization.
    *   Secure Terminal Handling: Be aware of terminal escape sequence risks. Sanitize terminal output if displaying data from untrusted sources.
    *   Fuzz Testing: Conduct fuzz testing to identify unexpected behavior and crashes related to input handling.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Dependencies Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_dependencies_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Vulnerable Bubble Tea Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in Bubble Tea's dependencies (e.g., `lipgloss`, `termenv`).
    *   **Check for CVEs in dependencies and exploit them [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Identifying and exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in dependencies.

*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (dependencies can have vulnerabilities, but are often patched).
*   **Impact:** Medium to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability and affected dependency).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Dependency Scanning and Management: Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `govulncheck` or `snyk`. Use dependency management tools to track and update dependencies.
    *   Software Bill of Materials (SBOM): Consider generating and maintaining an SBOM to track dependencies.
    *   Verify Dependency Integrity: Use checksums or signatures to verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Application Logic Vulnerabilities (Developer Errors in Bubble Tea Usage) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_application_logic_vulnerabilities__developer_errors_in_bubble_tea_usage___critical_node___f97f966c.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Insecure Data Handling [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Vulnerabilities arising from how the application handles data within the Bubble Tea framework.
    *   **Storing sensitive data in application state without proper encryption [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Storing sensitive data unencrypted in application state, especially if state is persisted.
    *   **Logging sensitive data to terminal or logs unintentionally [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Unintentionally logging sensitive data to the terminal or application logs.
    *   **Mishandling user credentials or API keys [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Improperly handling or storing user credentials or API keys within the application logic.
*   **Business Logic Flaws [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Exploiting flaws in the application's business logic implemented using Bubble Tea.
    *   **Bypass intended workflows or access controls [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Circumventing intended application workflows or access control mechanisms.
    *   **Manipulate application behavior for malicious purposes [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Exploiting logic flaws to manipulate application behavior for unintended and malicious outcomes.

*   **Likelihood:** Medium (common developer oversights and logic flaws).
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (ranging from information disclosure and data breaches to unauthorized access and manipulation).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Coding Practices: Follow secure coding practices, especially for data handling, authentication, and authorization.
    *   Code Reviews and Security Testing: Conduct regular code reviews and security testing (static and dynamic analysis) to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege: Apply the principle of least privilege in application design and user permissions.
    *   Security Awareness Training: Train developers on secure coding practices and common vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Physical Access [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__physical_access__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Gain physical access to the machine running the application [CRITICAL NODE]:** Obtaining physical access to the system running the Bubble Tea application.

*   **Likelihood:** Low (depends on physical security measures).
*   **Impact:** Critical (full system compromise and data access).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Physical Security Measures: Implement appropriate physical security measures to protect systems running the application, especially if handling sensitive data.
    *   System Hardening: Harden the operating system and system configurations to limit the impact of physical access.
    *   Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data at rest to protect it even if physical access is gained.
