## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage Bubble Tea's Input Handling for Validation and Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_bubble_tea's_input_handling_for_validation_and_sanitization.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Utilize `tea.KeyMsg` for Key Press Validation:** In your `Update` function, when handling `tea.KeyMsg` messages, explicitly check the `Type`, `String`, and `Runes` properties to validate expected key presses. Define allowed keybindings and actions based on these properties.  Ignore or handle unexpected key presses gracefully. Bubble Tea provides the structure to intercept and process all key input, making it the ideal place for validation.
    *   **Step 2: Validate Input within Bubble Tea Components:** If using Bubble Tea's built-in components like `textinput.Model`, implement validation logic directly within the component's update cycle or using custom validation functions before processing the input value. This ensures input is validated at the point of entry within the TUI structure.
    *   **Step 3: Sanitize Input Displayed via Bubble Tea Rendering:** While Bubble Tea's rendering engine generally handles basic text display safely within the terminal, be mindful if you are dynamically constructing strings for display based on user input. Ensure that you are not inadvertently introducing terminal escape sequences or control characters that could be misinterpreted by the terminal emulator.  Bubble Tea's `String()` methods on components are designed to produce safe output, so rely on these.
    *   **Step 4: Use Bubble Tea's Command System for Controlled Actions:** Structure your application logic to trigger actions and state changes primarily through Bubble Tea's command system (`tea.Cmd`). This allows you to centralize and control the execution of operations based on validated user input processed within the `Update` function.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Design TUI for Usability and Clarity to Reduce User Errors](./mitigation_strategies/design_tui_for_usability_and_clarity_to_reduce_user_errors.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Clear and Unambiguous TUI Design using Bubble Tea Components:** Utilize Bubble Tea's layout and component system (e.g., `layout`, `list`, `form`, `viewport`) to create a TUI that is visually clear, well-organized, and easy to understand.  Avoid overly complex or cluttered interfaces that can confuse users.
    *   **Step 2: Provide Clear Feedback and Prompts within the TUI:** Use Bubble Tea's rendering capabilities to provide clear feedback to users on their actions and the application's state. Use prompts, status messages, and visual cues to guide users and prevent misinterpretations of the interface.
    *   **Step 3: Implement Confirmation Steps for Critical Actions in the TUI:** For actions that have significant consequences (e.g., data deletion, system changes), use Bubble Tea to implement confirmation prompts or multi-step processes within the TUI to ensure users intentionally perform these actions and reduce accidental errors.
    *   **Step 4: Test TUI Usability with Users:** Conduct usability testing of your Bubble Tea application with representative users to identify areas of confusion or potential for user error in the TUI design. Iterate on the design based on user feedback to improve clarity and reduce the risk of unintentional actions.
