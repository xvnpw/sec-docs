# Attack Surface Analysis for charmbracelet/bubbletea

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Input via Keypresses](./attack_surfaces/malicious_input_via_keypresses.md)

* **Malicious Input via Keypresses**
    * **Description:** The application processes user keypresses to trigger actions and state changes. Maliciously crafted or unexpected key sequences could exploit vulnerabilities in the input handling logic.
    * **How Bubble Tea Contributes:** Bubble Tea's core functionality revolves around capturing and routing keypress events to the `Update` function for processing. This direct exposure to user input creates the attack surface.
    * **Example:** An application might use a specific key combination for administrative actions. An attacker could try to guess or brute-force these combinations to gain unauthorized access. Another example is sending a very long sequence of characters to potentially cause buffer overflows if input handling is not robust.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access, unexpected state changes, application crashes, or triggering unintended functionality.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the `Update` function.
        * Avoid relying solely on complex or easily guessable key combinations for critical actions.
        * Implement rate limiting or lockout mechanisms for repeated invalid input attempts.
        * Consider using a more structured input method (like menus or prompts) for sensitive operations.

## Attack Surface: [State Manipulation through Unexpected Messages](./attack_surfaces/state_manipulation_through_unexpected_messages.md)

* **State Manipulation through Unexpected Messages**
    * **Description:** The `Update` function modifies the application's state based on received messages. If the application doesn't properly validate the source or content of messages, an attacker might send crafted messages to force the application into a vulnerable state.
    * **How Bubble Tea Contributes:** The central role of the `Update` function in state management, driven by messages, makes it a critical point for security considerations.
    * **Example:** An application might have a state variable indicating user authentication. An attacker could try to send a message that directly sets this variable to "authenticated" without proper login credentials.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data breaches, or application malfunction.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict validation of message content within the `Update` function before modifying the application state.
        * Design state transitions to be explicit and controlled, rather than allowing arbitrary state changes through messages.
        * Consider using an immutable state management approach to make unauthorized modifications more difficult.

## Attack Surface: [Command Execution Vulnerabilities (Custom Commands)](./attack_surfaces/command_execution_vulnerabilities__custom_commands_.md)

* **Command Execution Vulnerabilities (Custom Commands)**
    * **Description:** Bubble Tea allows developers to define custom commands that can interact with the operating system or external services. If these commands are not implemented securely, they can introduce significant vulnerabilities.
    * **How Bubble Tea Contributes:** The `tea.Cmd` mechanism enables interaction with the outside world, and the security of these interactions is the developer's responsibility.
    * **Example:** A custom command might take a filename as input and then execute a system command to process that file. If the filename is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious commands (command injection).
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid executing external commands directly if possible.
        * If external commands are necessary, carefully sanitize all input parameters to prevent command injection.
        * Use parameterized commands or libraries that offer safer ways to interact with the operating system.
        * Follow the principle of least privilege when designing custom commands.
