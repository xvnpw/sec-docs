# Threat Model Analysis for charmbracelet/bubbletea

## Threat: [Malicious Input Exploitation](./threats/malicious_input_exploitation.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Input Exploitation

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts input containing shell commands or terminal escape sequences and injects it into the application through user input fields or command-line arguments. The Bubble Tea application, without proper sanitization, passes this input to underlying system calls or terminal rendering functions.
*   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine, manipulation of the terminal display to mislead the user, denial of service by flooding the terminal with output.
*   **Affected Bubble Tea Component:** The `tea.Program.Send()` function, the `tea.Msg` interface, and any custom input handling logic within the application's `Update` function.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize all user input before processing it within the `Update` function.
    *   Avoid directly executing shell commands based on user input. If necessary, use parameterized commands or safer alternatives outside of Bubble Tea's core functionality.
    *   Be aware of terminal escape sequences and implement filtering or escaping mechanisms within the rendering logic or input handling to prevent their interpretation by the terminal.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Application State](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_application_state.md)

**Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data in Application State

*   **Description:** The application's internal state, managed and potentially rendered by Bubble Tea, contains sensitive information (e.g., API keys, temporary credentials, personal data). This data might be unintentionally displayed in the terminal UI, logged through Bubble Tea's rendering process (if not carefully managed), or leaked through debugging mechanisms interacting with the Bubble Tea program.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to external resources, privacy violations.
*   **Affected Bubble Tea Component:** The application's model (the data structure representing the application's state) and the `View` function responsible for rendering the UI based on this state.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing sensitive data directly in the application's state if possible.
    *   If sensitive data must be stored, encrypt it appropriately within the state before it's handled by Bubble Tea.
    *   Carefully review the `View` function and ensure sensitive data is not directly rendered to the terminal. Consider using placeholder characters or only displaying necessary information.
    *   Be mindful of debugging practices and avoid exposing sensitive state information through Bubble Tea's rendering or logging mechanisms during debugging sessions.
