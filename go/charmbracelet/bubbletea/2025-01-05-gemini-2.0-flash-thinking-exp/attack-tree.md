## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Input -> Exploit Application Logic Flaws -> Deliver Malicious Input -> Direct Keyboard Input](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_input_-_exploit_application_logic_flaws_-_deliver_malicious_input_-_direct_keyboard_f1187efc.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker directly types input designed to exploit flaws in the application's logic, causing unintended behavior or unauthorized actions.
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: Moderate to Major
* Effort: Medium
* Skill Level: Intermediate
* Detection Difficulty: Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Input -> Trigger Unexpected Behavior -> Deliver Malicious Input -> Direct Keyboard Input](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_input_-_trigger_unexpected_behavior_-_deliver_malicious_input_-_direct_keyboard_inp_6c5a2294.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker directly types input intended to cause the application to behave in an unexpected or undesirable way, potentially leading to further vulnerabilities or disruptions.
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: Minor to Moderate
* Effort: Low to Medium
* Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
* Detection Difficulty: Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS) via Input -> Send Large Volume of Input](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos__via_input_-_send_large_volume_of_input.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker floods the application with a large amount of input data, overwhelming its processing capabilities and causing it to become unresponsive.
* Likelihood: High
* Impact: Moderate
* Effort: Low
* Skill Level: Novice
* Detection Difficulty: Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS) via Input -> Send Specifically Crafted Input to Exhaust Resources](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos__via_input_-_send_specifically_crafted_input_to_exhaust_resources.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker sends carefully crafted input designed to trigger resource-intensive operations within the application, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service.
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: Moderate
* Effort: Medium
* Skill Level: Intermediate
* Detection Difficulty: Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Commands -> Craft Malicious Command Payload -> Execute Arbitrary System Commands](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_commands_-_craft_malicious_command_payload_-_execute_arbitrary_system_commands.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker injects commands into the application that, when executed, allow them to run arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the application.
* Likelihood: Low
* Impact: Critical
* Effort: Medium to High
* Skill Level: Advanced
* Detection Difficulty: Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Commands -> Craft Malicious Command Payload -> Access Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_commands_-_craft_malicious_command_payload_-_access_sensitive_data.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker injects commands to access sensitive data stored on the system or accessible to the application.
* Likelihood: Low
* Impact: Major
* Effort: Medium
* Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
* Detection Difficulty: Moderate to Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS) via Rendering -> Trigger Rendering of Extremely Large or Complex Elements](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos__via_rendering_-_trigger_rendering_of_extremely_large_or_complex_elemen_5b9bc3fd.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker provides input that forces the application to render extremely large or complex visual elements, overwhelming the terminal and potentially the application, leading to a denial of service.
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: Moderate
* Effort: Low
* Skill Level: Beginner
* Detection Difficulty: Easy
