# Attack Surface Analysis for charmbracelet/bubbletea

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Keyboard Input](./attack_surfaces/malicious_keyboard_input.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends crafted keyboard input that exploits vulnerabilities in how the application processes key presses.
    *   **How Bubble Tea Contributes:** Bubble Tea provides the framework for capturing and processing keyboard events within the `Update` function. If this function doesn't properly validate or sanitize input, it can be vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An application uses keyboard input to navigate through a file system. A carefully crafted sequence of special characters (e.g., `../`) might allow an attacker to navigate outside the intended directory and access sensitive files.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential for unauthorized access to data, unintended state changes, application crashes, or even command execution if input is used to construct system calls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation within the `Update` function to ensure only expected characters and sequences are processed.
        *   **Sanitization:** Sanitize keyboard input to remove or escape potentially harmful characters before processing.
        *   **State-Based Input Handling:** Design the application so that input is only processed in specific, controlled states, reducing the possibility of unexpected actions.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Messages](./attack_surfaces/malicious_messages.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends crafted messages to the `Update` function that exploit vulnerabilities in how the application handles and processes messages.
    *   **How Bubble Tea Contributes:** Bubble Tea's core mechanism for state updates is through messages passed to the `Update` function. If the application doesn't validate the content or source of messages, it can be vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An application receives messages from an external source to update its state. A malicious actor could send a message with invalid data that causes a panic or sets the application into an insecure state.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, data corruption, unintended state changes, potential for privilege escalation within the application if messages control access rights.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Message Validation:** Implement robust validation for all incoming messages within the `Update` function to ensure they conform to expected formats and contain valid data.
        *   **Source Authentication:** If messages originate from external sources, implement mechanisms to authenticate the source and ensure messages are coming from trusted entities.
        *   **Graceful Error Handling:** Ensure the `Update` function handles unexpected or invalid messages gracefully without crashing or entering an insecure state.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection through Messages or Input](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_through_messages_or_input.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages vulnerabilities in message or input handling to inject malicious commands that are then executed by the application's `Cmd` system.
    *   **How Bubble Tea Contributes:** Bubble Tea's `Cmd` system allows the application to perform asynchronous operations, which can include executing system commands. If the arguments or the command itself are constructed based on untrusted input or message data, it creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to specify a filename to process. If the filename is used directly in a command executed via `Cmd`, an attacker could inject shell commands by providing a malicious filename like `; rm -rf /`.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data loss, unauthorized access, denial-of-service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Command Construction:**  Whenever possible, avoid constructing commands dynamically based on user input or message data.
        *   **Input Sanitization for Commands:** If dynamic construction is necessary, rigorously sanitize all input used in command arguments, escaping or removing potentially harmful characters.
        *   **Use Parameterized Commands:**  If the underlying system allows, use parameterized commands or APIs that prevent direct command injection.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the damage if a command injection occurs.
