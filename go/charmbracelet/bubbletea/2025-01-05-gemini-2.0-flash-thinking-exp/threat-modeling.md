# Threat Model Analysis for charmbracelet/bubbletea

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Application State](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_application_state.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal data) might be stored directly within the application's model or other parts of the application's state managed by Bubble Tea. If the `View` function renders this data, or if a vulnerability in Bubble Tea's state management allows inspection, this information could be exposed on the terminal.

**Impact:** Information disclosure to unauthorized users.

**Affected Bubble Tea Component:** The `Model`, the `View` function.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the application's model.
*   If sensitive information must be handled, ensure the `View` function does not render it directly to the terminal.
*   Implement secure practices for managing and accessing sensitive data within the application's logic, separate from the Bubble Tea model if necessary.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Bubble Tea or its Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_bubble_tea_or_its_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities might exist within the `charmbracelet/bubbletea` library itself. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities, potentially through crafted input that triggers a bug in Bubble Tea's input handling or state management, or by exploiting a flaw in how Bubble Tea interacts with the terminal.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to various security issues, including remote code execution (if a critical flaw exists in Bubble Tea's core logic), denial of service, or information disclosure.

**Affected Bubble Tea Component:** The `bubbletea` library and its internal modules (e.g., input handling, event loop, rendering).

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Bubble Tea to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Monitor security advisories for any reported issues in the `charmbracelet/bubbletea` repository.
*   Consider contributing to the security auditing of the Bubble Tea library if possible.
