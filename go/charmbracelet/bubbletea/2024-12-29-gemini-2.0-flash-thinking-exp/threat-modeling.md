Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving the Bubble Tea framework:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Terminal Escape Sequences via User Input
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides user input containing crafted terminal escape sequences. When the Bubble Tea application renders this input to the terminal, these sequences can manipulate the user's terminal. This could involve actions like clearing the screen, changing text colors, moving the cursor, or even attempting to execute arbitrary commands depending on the terminal emulator's capabilities and configuration.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker could potentially disrupt the user's terminal session, hide or spoof information, or in some cases, attempt to execute commands on the user's system if the terminal emulator is vulnerable to specific escape sequences. This can lead to confusion, data loss, or even system compromise.
    *   **Affected Bubble Tea Component:** `tea.Model`'s rendering logic, specifically how strings are processed and outputted to the terminal.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize all user input before rendering it to the terminal. Strip or escape potentially harmful terminal escape sequences.
        *   Consider using libraries specifically designed for safe terminal output to handle escape sequence escaping.
        *   Educate users about the risks of pasting untrusted content into the application.

*   **Threat:** Input Injection Leading to Unexpected State Changes
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts specific input that, when processed by the application's `Update` function, leads to unintended or malicious modifications of the application's internal state (`tea.Model`). This could involve changing critical data, bypassing intended workflows, or triggering unintended actions.
    *   **Impact:** The application's behavior becomes unpredictable or incorrect. This could lead to data corruption, unauthorized actions within the application's context, or security vulnerabilities if the state is used to control access or permissions.
    *   **Affected Bubble Tea Component:** The `Update` function in the `tea.Model` and how it processes different types of messages and user input.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the `Update` function. Verify the type, format, and range of input values.
        *   Design state transitions to be explicit and well-defined, minimizing the possibility of unexpected changes due to arbitrary input.
        *   Use a clear and consistent message passing system to manage state updates.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Commands Triggered by User Input (via Commands)
    *   **Description:** If the Bubble Tea application uses commands (`tea.Cmd`) to interact with the underlying operating system or external processes, an attacker could craft input that, when processed, leads to the execution of malicious commands. This is especially relevant if user input is directly incorporated into command strings without proper sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the user's system with the privileges of the application. This could lead to data theft, system compromise, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Affected Bubble Tea Component:** The `Update` function when handling messages that trigger commands, and the execution of `tea.Cmd`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user input used to construct commands.
        *   Avoid directly incorporating user input into command strings. Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives where possible.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege for any external processes executed by the application.
