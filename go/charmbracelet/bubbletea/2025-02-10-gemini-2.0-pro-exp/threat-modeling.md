# Threat Model Analysis for charmbracelet/bubbletea

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability (Supply Chain Attack) Affecting Core Bubble Tea or `muesli`](./threats/dependency_vulnerability__supply_chain_attack__affecting_core_bubble_tea_or__muesli_.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerability (Supply Chain Attack) Affecting Core Bubble Tea or `muesli`

    *   **Description:** A vulnerability exists in the `bubbletea` library itself, or in a critical, tightly-coupled dependency like `muesli` (which provides much of the TUI rendering). This is distinct from a vulnerability in a *general* Go dependency; it's specifically about the core libraries that Bubble Tea relies on for its fundamental operation. An attacker exploits this vulnerability, potentially through a compromised dependency (supply chain attack) or a newly discovered zero-day.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Varies widely depending on the specific vulnerability. Could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution *within the context of the Bubble Tea application*. The attacker's capabilities are limited by the privileges of the application itself.
    *   **Affected Bubble Tea Component:**
        *   `bubbletea` itself (e.g., `tea.Program`, input handling, message passing).
        *   `muesli` (e.g., rendering, styling, layout).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Dependency Updates:** Use `go mod tidy` and `go get -u ./...` (or similar commands) regularly to update `bubbletea` and `muesli` (and all other dependencies) to their latest versions. This is the *most important* mitigation.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a vulnerability scanner (e.g., `govulncheck`, Snyk, Dependabot) to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in `bubbletea`, `muesli`, and their dependencies. Pay *particular attention* to vulnerabilities reported in these core libraries.
        *   **Monitor Bubble Tea and Muesli Releases:** Actively monitor the release notes and security advisories for `bubbletea` and `muesli` on GitHub. Be prepared to update *immediately* if a critical vulnerability is disclosed.
        *   **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Generate and maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for your application, specifically tracking the versions of `bubbletea` and `muesli`.
        *   **Consider Forking (Extreme):** In very high-security environments, consider forking `bubbletea` and `muesli` and performing your own security audits and patching. This is a significant undertaking and should only be considered if you have the resources and expertise to maintain the forks.

## Threat: [Race Condition *within* Bubble Tea's Internal State Management (Hypothetical)](./threats/race_condition_within_bubble_tea's_internal_state_management__hypothetical_.md)

*   **Threat:** Race Condition *within* Bubble Tea's Internal State Management (Hypothetical)

    *   **Description:**  This is a *hypothetical* threat, as no such vulnerability is currently known.  It assumes a bug *within Bubble Tea's own internal implementation* of its message passing or state management that could lead to a race condition, *even if the application developer uses Bubble Tea correctly*. This is different from a race condition caused by the *application's* misuse of `tea.Cmd`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unpredictable application behavior.
        *   Potential data corruption within Bubble Tea's internal state.
        *   Application crashes.
        *   Potentially exploitable to achieve a denial of service.
    *   **Affected Bubble Tea Component:**
        *   `bubbletea`'s internal implementation (e.g., `tea.Program`, message queue handling, state updates).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if such a vulnerability were to exist)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rely on Bubble Tea's Maintainers:**  Since this is a hypothetical internal vulnerability, the primary mitigation is to rely on the Bubble Tea maintainers to identify and fix any such bugs.
        *   **Report Suspected Issues:** If you encounter strange or unpredictable behavior that you suspect might be caused by a race condition within Bubble Tea, report it to the maintainers on GitHub with detailed reproduction steps.
        *   **Stay Updated:**  Keep `bubbletea` updated to the latest version, as any discovered internal vulnerabilities would be addressed in new releases.
        *   **Extensive Testing (Indirect):** While not a direct mitigation, extensive testing of your application, including stress testing and fuzzing, *might* help uncover such a vulnerability (though it's unlikely to pinpoint the root cause as being within Bubble Tea itself).
