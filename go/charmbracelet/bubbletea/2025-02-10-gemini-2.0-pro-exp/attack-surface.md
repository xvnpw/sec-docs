# Attack Surface Analysis for charmbracelet/bubbletea

## Attack Surface: [Unsanitized User Input in `View` (Terminal Escape Sequence Injection)](./attack_surfaces/unsanitized_user_input_in__view___terminal_escape_sequence_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** User-provided data, if not properly sanitized, can be injected into the terminal output, potentially leading to terminal escape sequence injection.
*   **Bubble Tea Contribution:** The `View` function in `bubbletea` is responsible for generating the string output rendered to the terminal. This is the *direct* point of vulnerability, as `bubbletea` handles the rendering process.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a username containing ANSI escape codes: `User<ESC>[2J<ESC>[H<ESC>[?25lMyEvilCommand`. If this is directly rendered in the `View` (which `bubbletea` controls), it could clear the screen, move the cursor, hide the cursor, and potentially execute `MyEvilCommand`.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution, data exfiltration, terminal manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Strict Sanitization:** *Never* directly embed unsanitized user input into the `View` output. Use a dedicated sanitization function to escape or remove all potentially harmful characters, especially control characters and escape sequences. A simple `strings.ReplaceAll` is *not* sufficient. Consider a whitelist approach.
        *   **Templating (with Sanitization):** If using a templating system, ensure it *also* performs robust sanitization before rendering.
        *   **Avoid Direct Display:** If possible, avoid displaying user-supplied data directly. If you must, display a sanitized/truncated version.
        *   **Specialized Libraries:** Explore libraries for safe terminal output, but vet them thoroughly.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious `tea.Msg` Payloads (Input Validation)](./attack_surfaces/malicious__tea_msg__payloads__input_validation_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can craft malicious messages of custom or built-in `tea.Msg` types, containing data designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the `Update` function.
*   **Bubble Tea Contribution:** `bubbletea`'s message-passing system (`tea.Msg`) is the *core* mechanism for handling input. Every message type and its data are potential attack vectors *because* `bubbletea` defines this input mechanism.
*   **Example:** A custom message `UpdateProfileMsg` with a `Bio` field (string). An attacker sends a message with an extremely long `Bio`, attempting a buffer overflow or DoS. If the `Bio` is later used in a `tea.Cmd`, it could lead to command injection.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, application crashes, potentially arbitrary code execution (if message data is used unsafely), data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depends on how message data is used).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Strict Type Checking:** Use appropriate data types for message fields.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate *all* data within *every* message type: length checks, range checks, format validation, content validation (sanitization).
        *   **Defensive Programming:** Handle potential errors gracefully in the `Update` function. Assume message data is malicious.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzz testing to send a wide range of unexpected message data.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via `tea.Cmd`](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via__tea_cmd_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses `tea.Cmd` to execute external commands, and those commands are constructed using user-supplied data, this creates a command injection vulnerability.
*   **Bubble Tea Contribution:** `bubbletea` *provides* the `tea.Cmd` mechanism for executing external commands. While command injection is a general vulnerability, `bubbletea`'s `tea.Cmd` is the *direct interface* that would be misused.
*   **Example:**  `tea.Cmd(exec.Command("editor", filename))`, where `filename` comes from user input.  An attacker provides `"; rm -rf /; #"` as the filename.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Avoid User Input in Commands:** Best practice: *avoid* using user data to build commands. Use fixed commands/parameters.
        *   **Strict Whitelisting:** If unavoidable, use a strict whitelist of allowed values.
        *   **Secure Command Construction:** If you *must* use user input, use a library designed for secure command construction. *Never* concatenate strings.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Consider sandboxing to limit command privileges.
