## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Control of Bubble Tea App {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_control_of_bubble_tea_app_{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker. This encompasses various forms of compromise, including displaying arbitrary content, executing arbitrary commands, manipulating application state, and leaking sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Complete loss of application integrity and confidentiality. Potential for system-level compromise depending on the application's privileges.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the root of the attack tree; all other nodes represent steps towards achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Message Handling {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_message_handling_{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks targeting the core message processing loop of Bubble Tea. This is the most direct way to influence the application's behavior.
*   **Impact:** High to Very High. Successful exploitation can grant the attacker significant control over the application's state and actions.
*   **Why Critical:** Bubble Tea's architecture is fundamentally message-driven. Controlling the message flow is equivalent to controlling the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Message Spoofing (Local) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/message_spoofing__local___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts and injects messages that appear to originate from legitimate sources within the same system, but are actually malicious. This requires some level of existing access to the running process or system.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium. Depends on existing vulnerabilities and the level of sandboxing.
*   **Impact:** High to Very High. Allows the attacker to directly manipulate the application's state and potentially trigger unintended actions.
*   **Effort:** Medium to High. Requires understanding the application's message structure and a method for injecting messages into the process.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard. Requires monitoring process activity and message queues for anomalies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Message Spoofing (Remote) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/message_spoofing__remote___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts and sends malicious messages from a remote system, making them appear as legitimate input to the Bubble Tea application. This typically requires exploiting a vulnerability in how the application receives and processes external data (e.g., network connections, file reads).
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low to Low. Requires a significant vulnerability in the application's external input handling. Bubble Tea itself doesn't handle network communication.
*   **Impact:** High to Very High. If successful, grants the attacker control over the application's state, similar to local spoofing.
*   **Effort:** High to Very High. Requires deep understanding of the application's input handling and likely an existing vulnerability.
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard. Requires network traffic analysis, intrusion detection, and careful input validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Message Injection (Local) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/message_injection__local___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker injects *additional* messages into the application's message stream, beyond those expected by the application. This, like local spoofing, requires some level of existing access.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium. Similar dependencies on existing vulnerabilities and sandboxing as local spoofing.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High. Can disrupt application flow, trigger unexpected state transitions, and potentially lead to further exploits.
*   **Effort:** Medium. Requires understanding the message structure and finding an injection point.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Requires monitoring process activity and message queues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Message Injection (Remote) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/message_injection__remote___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker injects additional messages from a remote system. This usually involves exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles external input (e.g., command injection in a text field) to trigger the creation of unintended messages.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low to Low. Relies on vulnerabilities in the application's input handling *before* the data becomes a Bubble Tea message.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High. Depends on the nature of the injected messages and their effect on the application's state.
*   **Effort:** High. Requires finding and exploiting an input vulnerability that allows crafting of messages.
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard. Requires robust input validation, anomaly detection, and potentially network traffic analysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit UI Input Validation (Local) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ui_input_validation__local___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides crafted input directly to the application's UI elements (text fields, selections, etc.) that bypasses validation checks, potentially leading to message injection or other exploits.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. UI input validation errors are relatively common vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Low to Medium. Can be used as a stepping stone to more serious attacks, such as message injection.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium. Depends on the complexity of the UI and the quality of the validation.
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium. Input validation failures are often visible or can be detected through testing.
