### High and Critical Grafana Threats

Here's a list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Grafana application:

*   **Threat:** Insecure Data Source Credentials Storage
    *   **Description:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive data source credentials (e.g., database passwords, API keys) stored within Grafana's configuration files or database. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in Grafana's backend, gaining unauthorized access to the server's filesystem, or through social engineering targeting Grafana administrators.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to underlying data sources, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service on the data source.
    *   **Affected Component:** Grafana Backend, Data Source Configuration Module
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Grafana's built-in secrets management features (e.g., using the `secureJsonData` option for data sources).
        *   Store sensitive credentials in secure vaults or secrets management systems external to Grafana and retrieve them at runtime.
        *   Encrypt Grafana's configuration files and database.
        *   Implement strong access controls on the Grafana server and its filesystem.

*   **Threat:** Grafana Administrator Account Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker could compromise the Grafana administrator account through brute-force attacks targeting Grafana's login, credential stuffing using leaked credentials, phishing attacks specifically targeting Grafana administrators, or exploiting vulnerabilities in Grafana's authentication mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the Grafana instance, allowing the attacker to view sensitive dashboards, modify configurations, create malicious dashboards, access data sources configured within Grafana, and potentially pivot to other systems accessible from the Grafana server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Grafana Authentication Module, User Management Module
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong and unique passwords for all Grafana accounts, especially the administrator account.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Grafana accounts.
        *   Regularly review and audit user accounts and permissions within Grafana.
        *   Implement account lockout policies within Grafana to prevent brute-force attacks.
        *   Keep Grafana updated to patch authentication-related vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Dashboards or Panels
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into Grafana dashboards or panel configurations. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in how Grafana handles user input within dashboard or panel settings, or by compromising a user account with dashboard editing privileges. When other users view the affected dashboard through Grafana, the malicious script could execute in their browsers.
    *   **Impact:**  Stealing user session cookies for the Grafana instance, performing actions within Grafana on behalf of the user, redirecting users to malicious websites, or defacing Grafana dashboards.
    *   **Affected Component:** Grafana Frontend, Dashboard Rendering Engine, Panel Plugins
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and output encoding for all user-supplied data in Grafana dashboards and panel configurations.
        *   Utilize Grafana's Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources when viewing Grafana.
        *   Regularly update Grafana and its panel plugins to patch known XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Educate users about the risks of running untrusted code within Grafana.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Panel Plugins
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate a vulnerable Grafana panel plugin to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources from the Grafana server. This could be achieved by crafting malicious panel configurations within Grafana or exploiting vulnerabilities in the plugin's request handling logic.
    *   **Impact:**  Accessing internal services or resources that are not directly accessible from the internet through the Grafana server, potentially leading to information disclosure or further exploitation of internal systems. Scanning internal networks or interacting with internal APIs from the Grafana server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Grafana Backend, Panel Plugin Framework, Vulnerable Panel Plugins
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and only install trusted Grafana panel plugins.
        *   Keep panel plugins updated to patch known SSRF vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF attacks originating from the Grafana server.
        *   Restrict the network access of the Grafana server.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Grafana API
    *   **Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the Grafana API if it is not properly secured. This could be due to weak or default API keys configured within Grafana, lack of authentication enforcement on API endpoints, or vulnerabilities in the Grafana API endpoints themselves.
    *   **Impact:**  Retrieving sensitive information about Grafana configurations, users, and dashboards via the API. Modifying dashboards, data sources, and alert rules through the API. Potentially gaining control over the Grafana instance through API calls.
    *   **Affected Component:** Grafana API, Authentication Middleware
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the Grafana API using strong, unique API keys or other robust authentication mechanisms.
        *   Implement proper authorization checks on API endpoints to ensure only authorized users or services can perform specific actions via the API.
        *   Restrict API access to trusted networks or IP addresses.
        *   Regularly rotate Grafana API keys.

*   **Threat:** Malicious or Vulnerable Grafana Plugins
    *   **Description:** An attacker could install a malicious Grafana plugin or exploit vulnerabilities in a legitimate plugin. Malicious plugins could contain backdoors that compromise the Grafana instance, steal sensitive information accessible to Grafana, or perform other malicious actions within the Grafana environment. Vulnerable plugins could be exploited to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code on the Grafana server.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the Grafana instance, potential access to underlying data sources configured within Grafana, and the ability to inject malicious content into Grafana dashboards.
    *   **Affected Component:** Grafana Plugin Framework, Installed Plugins
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install Grafana plugins from trusted sources (e.g., the official Grafana plugin repository).
        *   Carefully review the permissions and functionality of plugins before installing them.
        *   Keep all installed plugins updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a process for vetting and approving new plugin installations within the organization.
