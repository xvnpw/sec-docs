## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Loki](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_loki.md)

**[CRITICAL NODE]**
This is the ultimate goal and therefore a critical node. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Loki Ingestion Process](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_loki_ingestion_process.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
    *   Inject Malicious Log Entries Containing Sensitive Information (for later retrieval) **[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**
    *   Exploit Ingester Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Loki Ingester Code: Leveraging publicly disclosed CVEs or zero-day exploits in the ingester component can grant attackers significant control over the log ingestion process, potentially leading to remote code execution or data manipulation.
    *   Exploit Authentication/Authorization Bypass in Ingester API **[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Ingester Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ingester_vulnerabilities.md)

**[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Loki Ingester Code:** Leveraging publicly disclosed CVEs or zero-day exploits in the ingester component can grant attackers significant control over the log ingestion process, potentially leading to remote code execution or data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [LogQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/logql_injection.md)

**[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Craft Malicious LogQL Queries to Extract Sensitive Information:** By exploiting insufficient input sanitization in application-generated LogQL queries, attackers can craft malicious queries to retrieve sensitive data stored in Loki logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Querier Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_querier_vulnerabilities.md)

**[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Loki Querier Code:** Similar to ingesters, exploiting vulnerabilities in the querier component can lead to critical impact, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or bypass security controls during log retrieval.

## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Access to Underlying Storage](./attack_tree_paths/direct_access_to_underlying_storage.md)

**[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Compromise Object Storage Credentials:** Gaining access to the credentials used by Loki to access its underlying storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) allows attackers to directly manipulate or exfiltrate all stored log data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfiguration of Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/misconfiguration_of_authenticationauthorization.md)

**[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Permissive Access Control Policies:**  Granting excessive permissions to users or services interacting with Loki components (ingesters, queriers) can allow attackers with compromised accounts to perform actions beyond their intended scope, such as injecting malicious logs or querying sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./attack_tree_paths/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

**[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Leaking Configuration Files:** Exposing configuration files containing sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or internal network details can provide attackers with the necessary information to compromise other parts of the application or infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Network Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_network_configuration.md)

**[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Exposing Loki Ports to the Public Internet:** Making Loki components directly accessible from the internet without proper authentication and authorization significantly increases the attack surface, allowing anyone to potentially interact with the service and exploit vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries.md)

**[CRITICAL NODE]** **[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Loki can have a critical impact, potentially leading to remote code execution or other forms of compromise within the Loki components.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Loki Querying Process](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_loki_querying_process.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
    *   LogQL Injection **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   Craft Malicious LogQL Queries to Extract Sensitive Information **[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**
    *   Exploit Querier Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Loki Querier Code
    *   Exploit Authentication/Authorization Bypass in Querier API **[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Malicious LogQL Queries to Extract Sensitive Information](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_logql_queries_to_extract_sensitive_information.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**
By exploiting insufficient input sanitization in application-generated LogQL queries, attackers can craft malicious queries to retrieve sensitive data stored in Loki logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Loki Storage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_loki_storage.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
    *   Direct Access to Underlying Storage **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   Compromise Object Storage Credentials **[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Object Storage Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_object_storage_credentials.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**
Gaining access to the credentials used by Loki to access its underlying storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) allows attackers to directly manipulate or exfiltrate all stored log data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Loki Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_loki_configuration.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
    *   Misconfiguration of Authentication/Authorization **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   Permissive Access Control Policies **[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**
    *   Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   Leaking Configuration Files **[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**
    *   Insecure Network Configuration **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   Exposing Loki Ports to the Public Internet **[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Permissive Access Control Policies](./attack_tree_paths/permissive_access_control_policies.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**
Granting excessive permissions to users or services interacting with Loki components (ingesters, queriers) can allow attackers with compromised accounts to perform actions beyond their intended scope, such as injecting malicious logs or querying sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaking Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/leaking_configuration_files.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**
Exposing configuration files containing sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or internal network details can provide attackers with the necessary information to compromise other parts of the application or infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposing Loki Ports to the Public Internet](./attack_tree_paths/exposing_loki_ports_to_the_public_internet.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**
Making Loki components directly accessible from the internet without proper authentication and authorization significantly increases the attack surface, allowing anyone to potentially interact with the service and exploit vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Loki](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_loki.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
    *   Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries **[CRITICAL NODE]** **[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**
