# Threat Model Analysis for grafana/loki

## Threat: [Malicious Log Injection](./threats/malicious_log_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject specially crafted log entries into Loki via the Push API. This might involve embedding code snippets, manipulating log formats, or injecting misleading information. The attacker might gain unauthorized access to systems processing these logs (e.g., Grafana dashboards interpreting injected JavaScript), trigger false alerts, or pollute log data for forensic analysis.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in downstream systems, misleading operational insights, disruption of alerting mechanisms, and compromised log integrity.

**Affected Component:** Loki Distributor component (handling the Push API).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application side *before* sending logs to the Loki Push API.
* Configure downstream systems (like Grafana) to properly escape or sanitize log data before rendering it.
* Enforce strict log format requirements and reject logs that deviate.
* Consider using structured logging formats (like JSON) to make parsing and validation easier.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via High Log Volume](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_high_log_volume.md)

**Description:** An attacker could flood the Loki Push API with an overwhelming volume of log data. This could exhaust Loki's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), leading to performance degradation or service unavailability for legitimate log ingestion and querying. The attacker might target the Distributor component to overwhelm its processing capacity.

**Impact:** Inability to ingest new logs, slow query performance, and potential service outage for log monitoring.

**Affected Component:** Loki Distributor component.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on the application side sending logs to Loki.
* Configure Loki's ingestion limits (e.g., `ingestion_rate_limit`, `ingestion_burst_size`).
* Implement authentication and authorization for the Push API to restrict access to known sources.
* Monitor Loki's resource usage and set up alerts for unusual ingestion rates.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Log Data in Storage](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_log_data_in_storage.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the underlying storage backend where Loki stores its data (e.g., object storage like S3, GCS, or local filesystem). This could allow them to read sensitive log information directly, bypassing Loki's access controls. The attacker might exploit misconfigured storage permissions or compromised credentials.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive application data, and potential regulatory compliance violations.

**Affected Component:** Loki Storage Backend (configured object storage or filesystem).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong access controls and authentication for the underlying storage backend.
* Encrypt data at rest in the storage backend.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to the storage.
* Regularly audit storage access logs.

## Threat: [Log Data Tampering or Deletion in Storage](./threats/log_data_tampering_or_deletion_in_storage.md)

**Description:** An attacker with unauthorized access to the storage backend could modify or delete log data. This could hinder incident investigations, mask malicious activity, or disrupt compliance efforts. The attacker might directly manipulate files in the object storage.

**Impact:** Loss of log integrity, inability to perform accurate audits or investigations, and potential compliance violations.

**Affected Component:** Loki Storage Backend.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement write protection and versioning for log data in the storage backend.
* Regularly back up log data to a secure location.
* Implement audit logging for access and modifications to the storage backend.

## Threat: [LogQL Injection](./threats/logql_injection.md)

**Description:** If user input is directly incorporated into LogQL queries without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious LogQL code. This could allow them to extract sensitive information beyond their intended access, potentially bypassing authorization controls within the application querying Loki. The attacker might manipulate query filters or aggregations.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive log data, information disclosure, and potential privilege escalation within the logging context.

**Affected Component:** Loki Querier and Query Frontend components (handling LogQL queries).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid directly embedding user input into LogQL queries.
* Use parameterized queries or a secure query building mechanism.
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data used in queries.
* Enforce least privilege for users querying Loki.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access via Weak or Default Credentials](./threats/unauthorized_access_via_weak_or_default_credentials.md)

**Description:** If Loki's authentication mechanisms (if enabled) are configured with weak or default credentials, attackers could gain unauthorized access to Loki's API or management interfaces. This could allow them to manipulate configurations, view logs, or disrupt the service.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Loki instance, including access to all logs and potential for service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Loki components with authentication enabled (e.g., Distributor, Querier, potentially ingesters depending on configuration).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong password policies for any configured authentication mechanisms.
* Avoid using default credentials and change them immediately upon deployment.
* Implement multi-factor authentication where possible.
* Securely manage API keys and other authentication tokens.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Loki Components](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_loki_components.md)

**Description:** Like any software, Loki and its components may contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. These vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.

**Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability, including complete system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Any Loki component (Distributor, Ingester, Querier, Compactor, etc.).

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Loki to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists for Loki.
* Implement a vulnerability management process to identify and address potential weaknesses.
