## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Object Storage Credentials

**Attack Tree Path:** Compromise Object Storage Credentials

**Description:** Gaining access to the credentials used by Loki to access its underlying storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) allows attackers to directly manipulate or exfiltrate all stored log data.

**Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

This high-risk path can be broken down into several potential sub-paths and stages:

**1. Initial Access & Reconnaissance:**

* **Sub-Path 1.1: Compromise the Loki Host/Environment:**
    * **Vulnerability:** Unpatched operating system or application vulnerabilities on the server(s) running Loki.
    * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities (e.g., remote code execution), gaining access through weak SSH credentials, or exploiting misconfigurations.
    * **Impact:**  Provides a foothold within the infrastructure where Loki is running.
* **Sub-Path 1.2: Compromise a Related System:**
    * **Vulnerability:** Weak security practices in adjacent systems that have access to the same network or resources as the Loki environment.
    * **Attack Vector:**  Pivoting from a less secure system to the Loki environment.
    * **Impact:**  Indirect access to the environment where Loki's configuration and potentially credentials reside.
* **Sub-Path 1.3: Insider Threat:**
    * **Vulnerability:** Malicious or negligent insiders with access to sensitive information.
    * **Attack Vector:**  Directly accessing configuration files or credential stores.
    * **Impact:**  Direct access to sensitive credentials without needing to exploit external vulnerabilities.

**2. Credential Discovery & Extraction:**

Once an attacker has gained access to a relevant system, they will attempt to locate and extract the object storage credentials. Common locations and methods include:

* **Sub-Path 2.1: Configuration Files:**
    * **Vulnerability:** Credentials stored in plain text or weakly encrypted within Loki's configuration files (e.g., `loki.yaml`).
    * **Attack Vector:**  Reading configuration files directly from the compromised host.
    * **Impact:**  Direct access to the credentials if stored insecurely.
* **Sub-Path 2.2: Environment Variables:**
    * **Vulnerability:** Credentials stored as environment variables on the system running Loki.
    * **Attack Vector:**  Listing environment variables on the compromised host.
    * **Impact:**  Direct access to the credentials if exposed as environment variables.
* **Sub-Path 2.3: Instance Metadata (Cloud Environments):**
    * **Vulnerability:** Misconfigured instance roles or insecure access to instance metadata services (e.g., AWS EC2 metadata service).
    * **Attack Vector:**  Accessing the instance metadata service from the compromised host to retrieve temporary credentials.
    * **Impact:**  Acquiring temporary credentials associated with the instance, potentially granting access to the object storage.
* **Sub-Path 2.4: Secrets Management Systems (If Used):**
    * **Vulnerability:** Weaknesses in the secrets management system itself (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) or insecure access controls to the secrets.
    * **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the secrets management system or using compromised credentials to access the secrets.
    * **Impact:**  Access to the stored object storage credentials within the secrets management system.
* **Sub-Path 2.5: Application Code or Dependencies:**
    * **Vulnerability:** Credentials hardcoded in the application code or present in vulnerable dependencies.
    * **Attack Vector:**  Analyzing the application code or its dependencies on the compromised host.
    * **Impact:**  Direct access to the credentials if they are present in the codebase.
* **Sub-Path 2.6: Memory Dump:**
    * **Vulnerability:** Credentials temporarily stored in memory during runtime.
    * **Attack Vector:**  Performing a memory dump of the Loki process and analyzing it for sensitive information.
    * **Impact:**  Potential access to credentials if they are present in memory.

**3. Exploitation & Impact:**

Once the attacker has obtained the object storage credentials, they can directly interact with the underlying storage.

* **Sub-Path 3.1: Data Exfiltration:**
    * **Action:** Downloading all or parts of the stored log data.
    * **Impact:**  Loss of confidentiality, potential exposure of sensitive information contained within the logs, and violation of privacy regulations.
* **Sub-Path 3.2: Data Manipulation/Deletion:**
    * **Action:** Modifying or deleting existing log data.
    * **Impact:**  Loss of data integrity, hindering incident response and forensic investigations, and potentially disrupting operations that rely on accurate log data.
* **Sub-Path 3.3: Planting Malicious Data:**
    * **Action:** Injecting false or misleading log entries.
    * **Impact:**  Obfuscating malicious activity, misleading security monitoring, and potentially causing operational disruptions based on false information.
* **Sub-Path 3.4: Resource Abuse:**
    * **Action:** Using the compromised credentials to upload large amounts of data, potentially incurring significant costs for the victim.
    * **Impact:**  Financial damage and potential disruption of service due to resource exhaustion.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risk associated with this attack path, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Secure Credential Management:**
    * **Utilize Secrets Management Systems:**  Store object storage credentials in dedicated secrets management solutions like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant Loki only the necessary permissions to access the object storage. Avoid using root or overly permissive credentials.
    * **Regular Credential Rotation:** Implement a policy for regularly rotating object storage access keys and secrets.
* **Secure Configuration Practices:**
    * **Avoid Storing Credentials in Configuration Files:** Never store credentials directly in plain text within configuration files.
    * **Secure Environment Variable Handling:** If using environment variables, ensure they are managed securely and not easily accessible.
* **Host and Network Security:**
    * **Regular Security Patching:** Keep the operating system and all applications running on the Loki host up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    * **Strong Access Controls:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing the Loki host (e.g., SSH with key-based authentication, multi-factor authentication).
    * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Loki environment from other less trusted networks.
    * **Firewall Rules:** Implement strict firewall rules to limit network access to the Loki host and the object storage service.
* **Cloud Security Best Practices:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege for Instance Roles:** If running Loki in a cloud environment, ensure the instance role has only the necessary permissions to access the object storage.
    * **Disable Instance Metadata Access from Within the Instance (If Not Needed):**  Restrict access to the instance metadata service if it's not required by the application.
* **Code Security:**
    * **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials:** Never hardcode credentials directly in the application code.
    * **Secure Dependency Management:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    * **Monitor API Calls to Object Storage:** Implement monitoring to detect unusual or unauthorized API calls to the object storage service.
    * **Log Analysis:** Analyze Loki logs and system logs for suspicious activity.
    * **Alerting on Credential Access:** Implement alerts for any attempts to access credential stores or configuration files.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system.

**Risk Assessment:**

* **Likelihood:**  Medium to High, depending on the overall security posture of the environment. Vulnerabilities in web applications, misconfigurations, and weak credential management are common attack vectors.
* **Impact:**  High. Compromising object storage credentials can lead to significant data breaches, data manipulation, and operational disruptions.

**Conclusion:**

The "Compromise Object Storage Credentials" attack path represents a significant risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of log data stored by Grafana Loki. Implementing robust security measures across all layers, from secure credential management to host and network security, is crucial to mitigate this risk. The development team should prioritize the mitigation strategies outlined above to protect sensitive log data and maintain the security of the Loki application.
