### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: LogQL Injection

**Attack Tree Node:** Craft Malicious LogQL Queries to Extract Sensitive Information

**Description:** This node represents the core of the LogQL injection attack. It highlights the attacker's ability to manipulate LogQL queries generated by the application to retrieve data they are not authorized to access. This is achieved by exploiting a lack of proper input sanitization or parameterized queries when the application constructs LogQL queries based on user input or external data.

**Technical Details:**

* **LogQL Basics:** LogQL is Grafana Loki's query language. It allows users to filter and aggregate log data based on labels and log content. Key elements relevant to injection include:
    * **Stream Selectors:**  Used to select specific log streams based on labels (e.g., `{app="my-app", level="error"}`).
    * **Filters:** Used to filter log lines based on content (e.g., `|~ "password"`, `| json`).
    * **Aggregations:** Functions like `count_over_time`, `rate`, `sum`, etc., that can be used to aggregate data across log streams.
* **Injection Mechanism:** The vulnerability arises when user-provided input or external data is directly concatenated into a LogQL query string without proper escaping or validation. An attacker can inject malicious LogQL syntax into this input, altering the intended query.
* **Example Attack Scenarios:**
    * **Label Manipulation:** If the application allows users to filter logs based on an "application name" and constructs the LogQL query like `"{app=\"" + user_input + "\"}"`, an attacker could input `my-app"} | logfmt | unwrap password | limit 1000 //` to potentially extract passwords. The injected part closes the intended label, adds a filter to search for "password", unwraps it (assuming it's a JSON field), and limits the results.
    * **Filter Injection:** If the application allows filtering by a keyword and constructs the query like `"{app=\"my-app\"} |= \"" + user_input + "\""`, an attacker could input `" OR app!="" //`. This would bypass the intended filter and potentially return all logs from all applications.
    * **Aggregation Exploitation:** If the application uses user input to define aggregation parameters, an attacker could inject malicious aggregation functions to extract unintended data. For example, if the application allows users to specify a label for aggregation and constructs the query like `sum by (" + user_input + ") (rate({app="my-app"}[5m]))`, an attacker could input `__name__") OR app!="" //` to potentially aggregate data across different metric names.

**Impact Assessment:**

* **Confidentiality Breach:** The primary impact is the potential exposure of sensitive information contained within the logs. This could include:
    * **Credentials:** Passwords, API keys, tokens.
    * **Personal Identifiable Information (PII):** Usernames, email addresses, IP addresses.
    * **Internal System Information:** Configuration details, internal service names, database connection strings.
* **Compliance Violations:** Exposure of sensitive data can lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization.
* **Supply Chain Risks:** If the application interacts with other systems and logs sensitive information about those interactions, the attack could potentially expose vulnerabilities in the supply chain.

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in insecure coding practices:

* **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Failure to properly sanitize and validate user-provided input before incorporating it into LogQL queries. This includes escaping special characters and validating the input against expected formats.
* **Dynamic Query Construction:** Constructing LogQL queries dynamically using string concatenation with user input is inherently risky.
* **Lack of Parameterized Queries:** Not utilizing parameterized queries or prepared statements for LogQL (if supported by the application's interaction with Loki) prevents the separation of code and data, making injection possible.
* **Insufficient Security Awareness:** Developers may not be fully aware of the risks associated with LogQL injection and the importance of secure query construction.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Input Sanitization and Validation:**
    * **Strict Validation:** Implement strict validation rules for all user-provided input that will be used in LogQL queries. Define allowed characters, formats, and lengths.
    * **Output Encoding/Escaping:**  Escape special characters in user input before incorporating it into the LogQL query string. This prevents the interpretation of these characters as LogQL syntax.
    * **Consider using allow-lists:** Instead of trying to block all malicious input, define a set of allowed values or patterns for user input.
* **Parameterized Queries (if applicable):** Explore if the libraries or methods used to interact with Loki support parameterized queries or prepared statements. This is the most effective way to prevent SQL/LogQL injection by treating user input as data, not executable code.
* **Abstraction Layer:** Create an abstraction layer or a dedicated function to construct LogQL queries. This centralizes query construction and allows for consistent application of sanitization and validation rules.
* **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure the application's credentials used to access Loki have the minimum necessary permissions. This limits the potential damage if an injection attack is successful.
* **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regularly conduct security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on areas where user input is used to construct LogQL queries.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF that can detect and block malicious LogQL injection attempts. Configure the WAF with rules specific to LogQL syntax and potential injection patterns.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While primarily for web browsers, CSP can offer some indirect protection by limiting the sources from which scripts can be executed, potentially hindering some injection attempts if the application has a web interface.
* **Regular Security Training:** Educate developers about the risks of injection vulnerabilities and best practices for secure coding.

**Detection and Monitoring:**

* **Log Analysis:** Monitor Loki logs for unusual query patterns or errors that might indicate injection attempts. Look for queries containing unexpected characters or syntax.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection systems that can identify deviations from normal LogQL query patterns.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate Loki logs with a SIEM system to correlate events and identify potential attacks.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints that construct LogQL queries to mitigate brute-force injection attempts.

**Recommendations for the Development Team:**

1. **Prioritize Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation for all user-provided data used in LogQL queries. This is the most critical step.
2. **Explore Parameterized Queries:** Investigate if the libraries used to interact with Loki support parameterized queries and implement them where possible.
3. **Develop a Secure Query Construction Function:** Create a dedicated function or module responsible for building LogQL queries, ensuring consistent application of security measures.
4. **Conduct Thorough Code Reviews:**  Specifically review code sections that handle user input and construct LogQL queries.
5. **Implement Security Testing:** Include penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify potential LogQL injection points.
6. **Educate the Team:** Provide training on secure coding practices and the risks of LogQL injection.

By implementing these mitigation strategies and recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of LogQL injection attacks and protect sensitive information stored in Grafana Loki. This proactive approach is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of the application.
