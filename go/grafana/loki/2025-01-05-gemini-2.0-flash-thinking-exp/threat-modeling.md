# Threat Model Analysis for grafana/loki

## Threat: [Log Injection/Spoofing](./threats/log_injectionspoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could send malicious or fabricated log entries to Loki's push API. This might involve crafting specific log messages to trigger false alerts, hide malicious activity within legitimate logs, or even influence downstream systems that rely on these logs for decision-making. An attacker might compromise a log shipper or directly interact with the API if authentication is weak or absent.
*   **Impact:**  Incorrect analysis of system behavior, masking of real security incidents, triggering of false alarms leading to resource waste, and potential manipulation of applications relying on log data.
*   **Affected Component:** Push API, Ingesters
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for the Loki push API. Use secure communication channels (HTTPS/TLS) between log shippers and Loki. Consider implementing log signing or verification mechanisms at the application level before sending logs to Loki.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via High Log Volume](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_high_log_volume.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could flood Loki's push API with an overwhelming volume of log data. This could be achieved by compromising multiple log sources or by exploiting a vulnerability in an application's logging mechanism to generate excessive logs. The goal is to overwhelm Loki's ingestion pipeline, making it unavailable for legitimate log data and queries.
*   **Impact:** Inability to ingest new logs, hindering real-time monitoring and alerting. Performance degradation for existing queries, potentially leading to service disruption for applications relying on Loki data.
*   **Affected Component:** Push API, Distributors, Ingesters
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement rate limiting on the Loki push API. Configure resource limits for Loki components (ingesters). Implement mechanisms to filter or drop excessive log data at the source or within Loki. Monitor Loki's resource usage and set up alerts for abnormal ingestion rates.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Chunk Storage](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_chunk_storage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the underlying storage where Loki stores its log data chunks (e.g., object storage like S3, local filesystem). This could be due to misconfigured storage permissions or compromised credentials for the storage backend.
*   **Impact:** Direct exposure of all ingested log data, potentially containing sensitive information, application secrets, or personally identifiable information.
*   **Affected Component:** Store (Chunk Storage)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong access controls and authentication for the chunk storage backend. Utilize encryption at rest for the storage backend. Regularly audit access permissions to the storage.

## Threat: [LogQL Injection](./threats/logql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If user-provided input is directly incorporated into LogQL queries without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious LogQL code. This could allow them to retrieve unintended log data, potentially including sensitive information from other tenants or streams, or to craft queries that consume excessive resources.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for denial of service by overloading Loki's query engine, and potentially gaining insights into internal system configurations through error messages or unexpected query results.
*   **Affected Component:** Queriers, Query Frontend
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Treat user input with suspicion and sanitize or validate it before constructing LogQL queries. Use parameterized queries or a query builder library to prevent injection attacks. Implement strict access controls to limit which users can query which log streams.

## Threat: [Compromise of Loki Components](./threats/compromise_of_loki_components.md)

*   **Description:** If individual Loki components (Ingesters, Distributors, Queriers, etc.) have vulnerabilities or are misconfigured, an attacker could potentially compromise these components to gain access to log data, manipulate the system, or disrupt the service. This could involve exploiting known vulnerabilities in the Loki software or the underlying operating system.
*   **Impact:** Full access to ingested log data, potential for data manipulation or deletion, and complete service disruption. The attacker could potentially pivot to other systems within the infrastructure.
*   **Affected Component:** Any Loki component (Ingesters, Distributors, Queriers, Compactor, etc.)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Keep Loki components updated with the latest security patches. Follow security best practices for deploying and configuring each component. Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a potential compromise. Regularly scan Loki components for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exposure of Loki API Endpoints](./threats/exposure_of_loki_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** If Loki's API endpoints (e.g., the push API or query API) are exposed to the public internet without proper authentication or authorization, unauthorized individuals could interact with Loki, potentially injecting malicious logs, retrieving sensitive data, or causing a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Log injection, information disclosure, denial of service, and potential compromise of the Loki service.
*   **Affected Component:** Push API, Query API
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Restrict access to Loki API endpoints to authorized clients and networks using firewalls or network policies. Implement strong authentication and authorization for all API endpoints. Consider using a reverse proxy or API gateway to add an extra layer of security.
