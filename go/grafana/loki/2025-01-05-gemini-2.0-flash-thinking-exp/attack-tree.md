## Attack Tree Path: [Log Injection -> Inject Malicious Payloads into Logs (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/log_injection_-_inject_malicious_payloads_into_logs__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts log messages containing malicious code (e.g., JavaScript for XSS, shell commands for command injection). If the application displaying or processing these logs doesn't properly sanitize the input, the malicious code can be executed, leading to various compromises like session hijacking, information disclosure, or server-side command execution.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Moderate
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Log Injection -> Overwhelm Loki with Malicious Logs (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/log_injection_-_overwhelm_loki_with_malicious_logs__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods Loki with a high volume of logs or logs containing high-cardinality labels. This can overwhelm Loki's resources (CPU, memory, disk), leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, impacting the application's ability to monitor and log events.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Moderate to Major
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized Access to Logs (Critical Node, High-Risk Path) -> Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses in Loki API (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_access_to_logs__critical_node__high-risk_path__-_exploit_authenticationauthorization_we_5ae99f2e.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits flaws in Loki's authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to stored log data. This could involve bypassing authentication entirely or exploiting vulnerabilities in the access control model to access logs they shouldn't be able to see. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to read sensitive information contained within the logs.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Major
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized Access to Logs (Critical Node, High-Risk Path) -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Loki's Query Language (LogQL) -> LogQL Injection (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_access_to_logs__critical_node__high-risk_path__-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_loki's_quer_86111f00.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious LogQL queries by injecting code or special characters into user-supplied input that is then used to construct a LogQL query. This can allow the attacker to extract more data than intended, potentially including sensitive information from other log streams.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Moderate to Major
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized Access to Loki Configuration (Critical Node, High-Risk Path) -> Exploit Weak Default Credentials (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_access_to_loki_configuration__critical_node__high-risk_path__-_exploit_weak_default_cre_779cdb47.md)

**Description:** If Loki is deployed with default credentials and these are not changed, an attacker can easily gain administrative access to Loki's configuration. This allows them to modify settings, potentially disable security features, or even gain access to the underlying system.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Major
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) against Loki (High-Risk Path) -> Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__against_loki__high-risk_path__-_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a high volume of ingestion requests, complex queries, or logs that consume excessive disk space, overwhelming Loki's resources and causing a Denial of Service (DoS). This disrupts the application's logging and monitoring capabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Moderate
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
