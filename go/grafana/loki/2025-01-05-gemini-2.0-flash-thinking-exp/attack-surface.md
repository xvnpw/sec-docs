# Attack Surface Analysis for grafana/loki

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Log Injection via Push API](./attack_surfaces/malicious_log_injection_via_push_api.md)

* **Malicious Log Injection via Push API:**
    * **Description:** Attackers send crafted log entries through Loki's push API designed to exploit vulnerabilities in downstream systems (like Grafana) or even Loki itself.
    * **How Loki Contributes:** Loki's core function is to ingest logs, making it a direct pathway for this type of attack. It accepts and stores the potentially malicious data.
    * **Example:** Injecting a log line containing a `<script>` tag that, when viewed in Grafana, executes arbitrary JavaScript in a user's browser (XSS). Another example is injecting log data that, if used unsafely by another application consuming Loki data, could lead to command injection.
    * **Impact:** Cross-site scripting attacks, command injection on other systems, potential data breaches if injected data exploits vulnerabilities in processing pipelines.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the exploitability of downstream systems).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on the log data *before* sending it to Loki. Sanitize or reject log entries containing potentially harmful characters or patterns.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Configure Grafana with a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of injected XSS payloads.
        * **Secure Templating Engines:** If log data is used in templating engines, ensure they are properly configured to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Review applications sending logs to Loki for potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Push API](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_push_api.md)

* **Resource Exhaustion via Push API:**
    * **Description:** Attackers flood Loki's push API with a massive volume of log entries, overwhelming its ingestion pipeline and potentially causing a denial of service.
    * **How Loki Contributes:** Loki's role as a central log aggregator makes it a target for resource exhaustion attacks via its ingestion endpoint.
    * **Example:** Sending millions of log lines per second from compromised or attacker-controlled sources.
    * **Impact:** Loki becomes unavailable, preventing legitimate log ingestion and querying. This can disrupt monitoring and alerting capabilities.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the Loki push API to restrict the number of log entries accepted per source or tenant.
        * **Authentication and Authorization:** Ensure only authorized sources can push logs to Loki.
        * **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor Loki's resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and set up alerts for unusual spikes.
        * **Ingestion Pipeline Optimization:** Optimize Loki's ingestion pipeline configuration to handle high volumes of data efficiently.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to Loki APIs](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to_loki_apis.md)

* **Unauthorized Access to Loki APIs:**
    * **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to Loki's push or query APIs, allowing them to inject malicious logs, exfiltrate sensitive information, or disrupt the service.
    * **How Loki Contributes:** Loki exposes APIs for ingestion and querying, which, if not properly secured, become entry points for attackers.
    * **Example:** Exploiting misconfigured authentication settings or using leaked API keys to push arbitrary logs or query sensitive data.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches through log exfiltration, injection of misleading or harmful logs, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strong Authentication:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms for all Loki APIs (e.g., mutual TLS, API keys, OAuth 2.0).
        * **Authorization:** Implement fine-grained authorization controls to restrict access to specific log streams or tenants based on user roles or permissions.
        * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Loki within a secure network segment and restrict access from untrusted networks.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Review API access controls and authentication configurations regularly.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Loki Components or Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_loki_components_or_dependencies.md)

* **Vulnerabilities in Loki Components or Dependencies:**
    * **Description:** Security vulnerabilities are discovered in Loki itself or its underlying dependencies, which attackers can exploit.
    * **How Loki Contributes:**  As with any software, Loki is susceptible to vulnerabilities in its codebase or the libraries it uses.
    * **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in a Loki component that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Loki instance, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or further attacks on connected systems.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (depending on the severity of the vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Loki Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Loki to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * **Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated tools to scan Loki's dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
        * **Security Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor for security advisories related to Loki and its dependencies.
