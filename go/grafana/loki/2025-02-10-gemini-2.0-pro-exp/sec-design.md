# Project Design Document: Grafana Loki

## BUSINESS POSTURE

Grafana Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It is designed to be very cost-effective and easy to operate. It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.

Business Priorities:

*   Provide a cost-effective log aggregation solution.
*   Ensure high availability and scalability to handle large volumes of logs.
*   Support multi-tenancy to isolate logs from different sources or teams.
*   Integrate seamlessly with Grafana for visualization and analysis.
*   Offer easy operation and maintenance.

Business Goals:

*   Enable efficient troubleshooting and debugging of applications and infrastructure.
*   Facilitate real-time monitoring and alerting based on log data.
*   Provide a centralized repository for logs from various sources.
*   Support compliance and auditing requirements.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data loss: Loss of log data due to system failures or misconfiguration.
*   Unauthorized access: Unauthorized access to sensitive log data.
*   Performance degradation: Slow query performance or system instability under heavy load.
*   Lack of scalability: Inability to handle increasing log volumes as the organization grows.
*   Operational complexity: Difficulty in managing and maintaining the Loki system.

## SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Authentication: Loki supports authentication via various methods, including basic auth, and integration with external identity providers (described in Loki documentation).
*   security control: Authorization: Loki supports role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to specific logs and operations (described in Loki documentation).
*   security control: Encryption in transit: Communication between Loki components and clients can be secured using TLS (described in Loki configuration).
*   security control: Multi-tenancy: Loki's multi-tenant architecture provides isolation between different tenants' logs (built-in feature).
*   security control: Rate limiting: Loki provides configuration options to limit the rate of log ingestion and querying to prevent abuse and ensure system stability (described in Loki configuration).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Limited log content indexing: Loki does not index the full content of logs, which may limit the ability to perform complex searches.
*   accepted risk: Potential for log data loss in certain failure scenarios: While Loki is designed for high availability, data loss is possible in extreme scenarios (e.g., simultaneous failure of multiple nodes).

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement network policies to restrict access to Loki components.
*   security control: Enable audit logging to track all actions performed within Loki.
*   security control: Regularly review and update access control policies.
*   security control: Configure and monitor resource quotas to prevent resource exhaustion.
*   security control: Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor network traffic for malicious activity.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All users and services accessing Loki must be authenticated.
    *   Support for strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication) should be considered.
    *   Integration with existing identity providers is preferred.
*   Authorization:
    *   Access to logs and operations should be controlled based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   RBAC should be implemented to manage user permissions.
    *   Regular review and auditing of access control policies are required.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All input to Loki (e.g., log data, queries) should be validated to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Sanitize input to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
*   Cryptography:
    *   All communication between Loki components and clients must be encrypted using TLS.
    *   Sensitive data at rest (e.g., API keys, passwords) should be encrypted.
    *   Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and key lengths.

### BUILD

The build process for Grafana Loki involves several steps, from compiling the source code to creating container images and publishing them.  Security is integrated throughout the process.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- "Push Code" --> GitRepository["Git Repository (GitHub)"]
    GitRepository -- "Trigger" --> CIEnvironment["CI Environment (GitHub Actions)"]
    CIEnvironment -- "Build & Test" --> BuildSteps["Build Steps"]
    BuildSteps -- "Go Build" --> Compile["Compile (go build)"]
    BuildSteps -- "Linting" --> Linter["Linter (golangci-lint)"]
    BuildSteps -- "Unit Tests" --> UnitTests["Unit Tests (go test)"]
    BuildSteps -- "SAST" --> SASTScanner["SAST Scanner (e.g., gosec)"]
    BuildSteps -- "Create Container Image" --> DockerImage["Docker Image"]
    DockerImage -- "Push" --> ContainerRegistry["Container Registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Quay.io)"]
    BuildSteps -- "Generate SBOM" --> SBOM["Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)"]
    SBOM -- "Store" --> SBOMStorage["SBOM Storage"]

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer pushes code changes to the Git repository (GitHub).
2.  The push triggers a workflow in the CI environment (GitHub Actions).
3.  Build Steps:
    *   Compile: The Go code is compiled using `go build`.
    *   Linter: A linter (e.g., `golangci-lint`) checks the code for style and potential errors.
    *   Unit Tests: Unit tests are run using `go test`.
    *   SAST Scanner: A Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scanner (e.g., `gosec`) analyzes the code for security vulnerabilities.
    *   Create Container Image: A Docker image is created using a Dockerfile.
    *   Generate SBOM: A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is generated, listing all dependencies and their versions.
4.  The Docker image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Quay.io).
5.  The SBOM is stored for later analysis and vulnerability management.

Security Controls:

*   security control: Code Review: All code changes are reviewed by other developers before being merged.
*   security control: Linting: `golangci-lint` enforces coding standards and helps prevent common errors.
*   security control: Unit Tests: `go test` ensures that individual components of the code function correctly.
*   security control: SAST: `gosec` identifies potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: SBOM Generation: Provides transparency into the software supply chain and helps track vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   security control: Container Image Scanning: Container images should be scanned for vulnerabilities before deployment (not explicitly shown in the build diagram, but a crucial step before deployment).

## RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Log ingestion: Ensuring that logs are reliably collected from all sources.
*   Log storage: Maintaining the integrity and availability of stored logs.
*   Log querying: Providing fast and efficient access to logs for analysis and troubleshooting.
*   Alerting: Triggering timely alerts based on log data.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Log data can contain sensitive information, including:
    *   Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
    *   Authentication credentials
    *   Financial data
    *   Internal system details
    *   Security-related events

Data Sensitivity Levels:

*   High: Logs containing PII, credentials, or financial data.
*   Medium: Logs containing internal system details or security-related events.
*   Low: General application logs with minimal sensitive information.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) apply to the log data?
*   What are the expected log ingestion rates and query loads?
*   What are the retention policies for different types of log data?
*   What are the existing monitoring and alerting infrastructure and processes?
*   What are the specific requirements for integration with other systems (e.g., SIEM)?
*   What is acceptable downtime for the system?
*   What level of support will be provided for the system?
*   What is the budget for the project?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The organization prioritizes cost-effectiveness, scalability, and ease of operation for its log aggregation solution.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The organization has a moderate risk appetite and is willing to accept some limitations in log indexing for the sake of cost and performance.
*   DESIGN: The Kubernetes deployment model is suitable for the organization's infrastructure and operational capabilities. The use of object storage (e.g., S3, GCS) is acceptable for long-term log storage. The build process described is aligned with the organization's development practices.
