# Attack Tree Analysis for grafana/loki

Objective: To compromise an application that uses Grafana Loki by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself, focusing on data exfiltration and data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Data Exfiltration [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__data_exfiltration__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.1 Unauthorized Query Access [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker gains access to query and retrieve log data without proper authorization.
    *   **1.1.1 Authentication Bypass [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker circumvents the authentication mechanisms intended to protect Loki.
        *   **1.1.1.1 Exploit misconfigured authentication [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker leverages weaknesses in the authentication configuration.
            *   **Specific Attack Vectors:**
                *   **No Authentication:** Loki is deployed without any authentication enabled.
                *   **Default Credentials:**  The attacker uses default usernames and passwords that were not changed during setup.
                *   **Weak Passwords:**  The attacker cracks weak passwords through brute-force or dictionary attacks.
                *   **Exposed API Keys:** API keys or other credentials are leaked in client-side code, configuration files, or environment variables.
                *   **Misconfigured SSO/OAuth:**  Flaws in the integration with single sign-on (SSO) or OAuth providers allow unauthorized access.
        *    **1.1.3.1 Intercept unencrypted traffic [HIGH RISK]**
            *    **Description:** Attacker captures the communication between client and Loki server.
            *    **Specific Attack Vectors:**
                *    **Lack of TLS:** Loki is not configured to use TLS (HTTPS), allowing an attacker on the same network to sniff traffic using tools like Wireshark.
                *    **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** The attacker intercepts the connection between the client and Loki, potentially using a compromised network device or ARP spoofing.
                *    **Weak TLS Configuration:**  Loki is configured with weak cipher suites or outdated TLS versions that are vulnerable to known attacks.
    *   **1.3 Access Underlying Storage Directly [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker bypasses Loki's access controls and interacts directly with the storage backend (e.g., S3, GCS, local filesystem).
        *   **1.3.1 Compromise storage credentials [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker obtains the credentials needed to access the storage backend.
            *   **Specific Attack Vectors:**
                *   **Credential Theft:**  Stealing credentials from configuration files, environment variables, or compromised systems.
                *   **Cloud Provider Misconfigurations:**  Exploiting misconfigured IAM roles or permissions in cloud environments (e.g., overly permissive S3 bucket policies).
                *   **Insider Threat:**  A malicious or compromised insider leaks the credentials.
                *   **Social Engineering:** Tricking an administrator into revealing the credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Data Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/3__data_manipulation.md)

*   **3.1 Unauthorized Write Access**
    *    **Description:** Attacker gains ability to modify or delete log data.
    *   **3.1.1 Authentication Bypass [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker bypasses authentication to gain write access to Loki. (Same attack vectors as 1.1.1.1, but with the goal of writing/modifying data).
*   **3.3 Access Underlying Storage Directly [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker gains direct access to the storage backend and modifies or deletes log data. (Same attack vectors as 1.3.1, but with the goal of modifying/deleting data).
