# Threat Model Analysis for grafana/loki

## Threat: [Malicious Log Data Injection (RCE)](./threats/malicious_log_data_injection__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted log entries containing malicious code or commands that exploit vulnerabilities in Loki's parsing logic or query engine (LogQL). The attacker would need to find a specific, exploitable vulnerability in how Loki processes input. This is a low-probability, high-impact threat.
    *   **Impact:** Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Loki ingester or querier, leading to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Loki Component:** `ingester` (specifically, the log parsing logic within the ingestion pipeline), `querier` (LogQL engine and its parsing/execution components), potentially specific parser implementations (e.g., regex parsers, JSON parsers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization (Pre-Loki):** Implement rigorous input sanitization *before* logs reach Loki. This is the *most critical* mitigation, but also the most difficult to achieve perfectly. Focus on escaping or removing characters known to be problematic in parsing contexts (e.g., control characters, special characters used in LogQL). This should ideally be done at the application level.
        *   **Regular Security Updates:** Keep Loki and *all* its dependencies (including parsing libraries and the Go runtime) updated to the absolute latest versions. This is crucial for patching known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Security Audits & Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular, in-depth security audits and penetration testing, specifically targeting the ingestion and query pipelines with fuzzing and other techniques designed to uncover parsing vulnerabilities.
        *   **WAF (Limited Effectiveness):** A Web Application Firewall (WAF) *might* provide some protection, but it's unlikely to be fully effective against sophisticated injection attacks targeting Loki's internal parsing logic. It's a defense-in-depth measure, not a primary solution.
        *   **Sandboxing (Complex):** Explore sandboxing techniques for log processing (e.g., running the ingester or querier in a restricted environment). This is a complex mitigation with potential performance implications.

## Threat: [Malicious Log Data Injection (DoS)](./threats/malicious_log_data_injection__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a flood of extremely large log lines, a high volume of log entries, or specially crafted data designed to consume excessive resources within Loki, even without exploiting a specific code vulnerability. The attacker aims to exhaust resources like memory, CPU, or disk I/O.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) of the Loki ingester, causing log loss for legitimate applications.  A sustained attack could also impact the querier and the storage backend.
    *   **Affected Loki Component:** `ingester` (ingestion pipeline, resource limits), `distributor` (if overwhelmed), potentially `querier` (if the ingester is unable to keep up).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Rate Limiting (Loki Config):** This is the *primary* defense. Configure Loki's `limits_config` *strictly*. Set appropriate limits for `ingestion_rate_mb`, `ingestion_burst_size_mb`, `max_streams_per_user`, `max_global_streams_per_user`, and `max_chunks_per_query`. These limits should be based on your expected log volume and system capacity.
        *   **Resource Quotas:** Configure resource quotas (CPU, memory) for Loki components, especially the ingester, using your container orchestration system (e.g., Kubernetes).
        *   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Implement comprehensive monitoring of Loki's resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network traffic) and ingestion rates. Set up alerts for anomalies and sustained high resource usage.
        *   **Horizontal Scaling:** Deploy multiple instances of the Loki ingester (and querier) to distribute the load and increase resilience.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Loki Storage](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_loki_storage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains direct, unauthorized access to the Loki storage backend (e.g., S3, GCS, local filesystem) and reads, modifies, or deletes log data. This bypasses Loki's access controls. The attacker might exploit misconfigured cloud storage permissions, compromised credentials, or vulnerabilities in the storage system itself.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality of logs), data loss (availability of logs), data corruption (integrity of logs), leading to compromised investigations and potential compliance violations.
    *   **Affected Loki Component:** `storage` (interaction with the configured storage backend), specifically the authentication and authorization mechanisms used to access the backend.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Storage Backend (Primary):** This is the *most important* mitigation. Follow the principle of least privilege *meticulously* when configuring access to the storage backend. For cloud storage (S3, GCS, etc.), use IAM roles and policies with the *absolute minimum* necessary permissions. For local filesystems, use strict file permissions and access controls.
        *   **Encryption at Rest:** Enable encryption at rest for the Loki data *within* the storage backend. Loki supports this for object storage (e.g., S3 server-side encryption). This protects data even if the storage backend is compromised.
        *   **Access Auditing (Storage Backend):** Enable and regularly review access logs for the storage backend itself (e.g., S3 access logs, GCS audit logs). Look for any unauthorized access attempts or unusual activity.
        *   **Loki Configuration (Credentials):** Ensure that Loki's configuration for accessing the storage backend uses secure credentials (e.g., IAM roles instead of long-lived access keys). Rotate credentials regularly.

## Threat: [Malicious LogQL Queries (DoS)](./threats/malicious_logql_queries__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, either authenticated or through an exposed endpoint, crafts complex or resource-intensive LogQL queries designed to overwhelm the Loki querier. The attacker might use extremely long time ranges, high-cardinality labels, inefficient query patterns, or regular expressions that cause excessive backtracking.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) of the Loki querier, making it unavailable for legitimate users and potentially impacting dashboards and alerting.
    *   **Affected Loki Component:** `querier` (LogQL query engine, query parsing, and execution).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Query Limits (Loki Config):** Configure Loki's `limits_config` to restrict `max_query_length`, `max_query_range`, `max_entries_limit_per_query`, `max_chunks_per_query`, and `max_streams_per_query`. These limits should be carefully tuned to balance usability and protection against DoS.
        *   **Query Timeout:** Set a reasonable `query_timeout` in Loki's configuration (e.g., `30s`, `60s`). This prevents queries from running indefinitely and consuming resources.
        *   **Monitoring & Alerting (Querier):** Monitor query performance metrics (latency, resource usage) and set up alerts for slow or resource-intensive queries. This helps identify and respond to DoS attempts.
        *   **Regular Expression Optimization:** If users are allowed to write custom LogQL queries, provide guidance on writing efficient regular expressions and avoid overly complex or potentially catastrophic regex patterns.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via LogQL](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_logql.md)

*   **Description:** A user with *some* level of legitimate access to Loki (e.g., through Grafana) is able to query and retrieve log data they should *not* have access to. This could be due to misconfigured multi-tenancy, overly permissive Grafana permissions, or a vulnerability in Loki's authorization logic.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality violation), potential exposure of sensitive information, violation of privacy regulations.
    *   **Affected Loki Component:** `querier` (authorization and multi-tenancy enforcement), interaction with Grafana (for authentication and authorization).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Multi-Tenancy (Loki):** If different users or groups should have access to *different* log streams, implement multi-tenancy in Loki using tenant IDs (`X-Scope-OrgID` header). This is *crucial* for isolating data between different tenants.
        *   **Grafana Permissions (Strict):** Configure Grafana's access control features *very carefully* to restrict access to specific Loki data sources and dashboards based on user roles and groups. Follow the principle of least privilege.
        *   **Loki Authorization (If Applicable):** If you are using Loki's built-in authorization features (beyond multi-tenancy), ensure they are configured correctly and enforce the desired access control policies.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit user permissions in both Loki and Grafana, and review access logs to identify any unauthorized access attempts.
