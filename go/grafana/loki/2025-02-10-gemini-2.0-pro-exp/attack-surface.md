# Attack Surface Analysis for grafana/loki

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Log Ingestion](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_log_ingestion.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can send arbitrary log data to the Loki push API without proper authentication or authorization.
*   **How Loki Contributes:** Loki's push API (`/loki/api/v1/push`) is the primary entry point for log data.  If not secured, it's an open door.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers the Loki endpoint and uses `curl` or a script to send fake log entries, claiming a successful database backup when none occurred.
*   **Impact:** Data poisoning, denial of service (DoS), masking of real attacks, potential triggering of false alerts.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Implement mandatory authentication for all clients pushing logs. Use API keys, JWTs (with tenant/stream claims), or mutual TLS.  *Do not* rely solely on network-level restrictions.
    *   **Fine-Grained Authorization:** Define authorization rules that restrict which clients can push to specific streams or tenants.  Use Loki's built-in features or integrate with an external authorization service (e.g., OPA).
    *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review authentication and authorization configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Log Data Injection/Manipulation (Focus on DoS)](./attack_surfaces/log_data_injectionmanipulation__focus_on_dos_.md)

*   **Description:**  A compromised or malicious client sends crafted log entries, specifically focusing on oversized payloads to cause resource exhaustion.  (Narrowed scope for direct Loki impact).
*   **How Loki Contributes:** Loki's ingester must process and store all received data.  Extremely large log entries can overwhelm it.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends log entries with megabytes of data in each entry, causing the Loki ingester to run out of memory or disk space.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement strict rate limits on the push API, both globally and per client/tenant.
    *   **Payload Size Limits:** Enforce maximum payload size limits on the push API.  This is a *direct* configuration option within Loki.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure appropriate CPU, memory, and disk space limits on the Loki ingester components.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) on Ingestion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__on_ingestion.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers flood the Loki push API with requests, overwhelming the ingester and preventing legitimate log processing.
*   **How Loki Contributes:** The ingester component is responsible for receiving and processing log data.  It's a potential bottleneck.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a botnet to send a massive number of log entries to the Loki push API, causing the ingester to crash or become unresponsive.
*   **Impact:** Loss of log data, disruption of monitoring and alerting, potential impact on applications relying on log data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** (As above) - Crucial for preventing DoS.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure appropriate CPU, memory, and connection limits on the Loki ingester components.
    *   **Horizontal Scaling:** Deploy multiple Loki ingester instances behind a load balancer to distribute the load.
    *   **Backpressure:** Implement backpressure mechanisms.
    *   **Queueing:** Use a message queue (e.g., Kafka) in front of the ingester (though this is *indirectly* related to Loki).

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Data Access (Query API)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_data_access__query_api_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain access to log data they shouldn't see via the Loki query API.
*   **How Loki Contributes:** Loki's query API (`/loki/api/v1/query`, `/loki/api/v1/query_range`, etc.) provides read access to stored log data.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers the Loki query endpoint and, without authentication, retrieves sensitive log data from other tenants in a multi-tenant environment.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, privacy violations, potential exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Enforce mandatory authentication for all query requests.
    *   **Fine-Grained Authorization:** Implement authorization rules. Leverage Loki's multi-tenancy features and consider external authorization services.
    *   **Audit Logging:** Enable audit logging for all query API requests.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Expensive Queries](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_expensive_queries.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft complex or resource-intensive LogQL queries to overwhelm the querier.
*   **How Loki Contributes:** The querier component is responsible for executing LogQL queries.  Complex queries can consume significant resources.
*   **Example:** An attacker submits a query with a very large time range, a complex regular expression, and high-cardinality label lookups, causing the querier to consume all available CPU and memory.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, slow query performance, potential impact on other users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Query Timeouts:** Implement strict timeouts for all LogQL queries.
    *   **Time Range Limits:** Limit the maximum time range that can be queried in a single request.
    *   **Resource Quotas:** Implement resource quotas (CPU, memory) for queries, potentially on a per-user or per-tenant basis.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor query performance and identify slow or resource-intensive queries.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Exposure (Directly Affecting Loki)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_exposure__directly_affecting_loki_.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information in the Loki configuration file (e.g., storage credentials, API keys *used by Loki*) is exposed.
*   **How Loki Contributes:** The configuration file controls Loki's behavior and contains sensitive information *directly used for Loki's operation*.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the server and finds the `loki-config.yaml` file, containing unencrypted authentication details for the Loki API itself.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the Loki service, unauthorized access to log data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Storage:** Store the configuration file securely with restricted access.
    *   **Secrets Management:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive credentials. Use environment variables or a secrets management system.
    *   **Regular Review:** Periodically review the configuration file.

## Attack Surface: [Tenant Isolation Failure (Multi-tenancy)](./attack_surfaces/tenant_isolation_failure__multi-tenancy_.md)

*   **Description:** In a multi-tenant Loki deployment, one tenant gains access to the log data of another tenant.
*   **How Loki Contributes:** Loki provides multi-tenancy features to isolate log data.  Misconfiguration can break this isolation.
*   **Example:** A misconfigured `auth_enabled` setting or incorrect tenant ID header allows a user from one tenant to query logs from another tenant.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, privacy violations, loss of trust.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Rigorously test the tenant isolation mechanisms.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically audit the multi-tenancy configuration.
    *   **Strong Authentication/Authorization:** Enforce strong authentication and authorization.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor for any unusual cross-tenant activity.
