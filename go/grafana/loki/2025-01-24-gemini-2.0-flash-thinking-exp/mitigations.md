# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for grafana/loki

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Loki](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__in_loki.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Loki Roles:** Determine the necessary roles within Loki based on user access requirements to log data. Examples include `loki-admin`, `loki-read-only`, `application-developer`.
    2.  **Configure Loki RBAC:**  Edit Loki's configuration file (e.g., `loki.yaml`) to enable and configure RBAC. This typically involves defining roles and associating them with permissions to specific resources within Loki, such as namespaces or operations (read, write).
    3.  **Integrate with Authentication Proxy/Gateway:** Deploy an authentication proxy or gateway (like OAuth2 Proxy, Keycloak Gatekeeper, or an API Gateway) in front of Loki. Configure this proxy to authenticate users against your organization's identity provider (IdP) and forward user identity information (e.g., groups, roles) to Loki via headers.
    4.  **Map External Roles to Loki Roles:** Configure Loki to map the roles or groups provided by the authentication proxy to the Loki-defined roles. This mapping is usually done in Loki's RBAC configuration.
    5.  **Test and Validate RBAC:** Thoroughly test the RBAC configuration by logging in as different users with varying roles and verifying that access to log streams and Loki functionalities is correctly enforced based on their assigned roles.
    6.  **Regularly Review and Update RBAC Policies:** Periodically review and update Loki RBAC policies to align with changes in user roles, application deployments, and security requirements.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Data Exposure (High Severity) - Unauthorized users accessing sensitive log data stored in Loki.
        *   Information Leakage (Medium Severity) - Accidental or intentional disclosure of confidential information through logs due to overly permissive access.
        *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity) - Users gaining access to log data or Loki functionalities beyond their intended authorization level.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data Exposure: Significantly Reduces - By strictly controlling access to Loki based on defined roles and user identities.
        *   Information Leakage: Moderately Reduces - By limiting the number of users who can potentially access sensitive information within Loki.
        *   Privilege Escalation: Significantly Reduces - By enforcing clear and role-based access boundaries within the Loki system.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic authentication is enabled for Loki access using username/password.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Loki RBAC is not configured in `loki.yaml`.
        *   Integration with an authentication proxy/gateway and organizational Identity Provider is missing.
        *   Role mapping between external identities and Loki roles is not defined.
        *   Granular access control based on namespaces or specific log streams within Loki is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable TLS Encryption for Loki Communication](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tls_encryption_for_loki_communication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate TLS Certificates:** Generate TLS certificates and keys for Loki components (ingesters, distributors, queriers, gateway if used). Use a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or self-signed certificates for testing (not recommended for production).
    2.  **Configure TLS for Loki Components:** Modify the configuration files (e.g., `loki.yaml`, ingester configuration) for each Loki component to enable TLS. This involves specifying the paths to the TLS certificate and key files, and configuring TLS settings like minimum TLS version and cipher suites.
    3.  **Enforce HTTPS for Client Communication:** Configure Loki gateway or load balancer to enforce HTTPS for all incoming client requests (from Grafana, applications, etc.). Redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.
    4.  **Enable TLS for Internal Loki Communication:** Configure TLS for communication between Loki internal components (e.g., ingester to distributor, querier to store). This ensures encryption even within the Loki cluster.
    5.  **Verify TLS Configuration:** Test the TLS configuration by accessing Loki endpoints via HTTPS and ensuring that connections are secure and encrypted. Check TLS certificate validity and configuration using tools like `openssl s_client`.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Data Exposure (Medium Severity) - Interception of log data during transmission between Loki components or between clients and Loki.
        *   Eavesdropping (Medium Severity) - Unauthorized monitoring of network traffic containing sensitive log data.
        *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Medium Severity) - Attackers intercepting and potentially manipulating communication between Loki components or clients.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data Exposure: Moderately Reduces - By encrypting data in transit, making it significantly harder to intercept and read log data.
        *   Eavesdropping: Moderately Reduces - By making network traffic unintelligible to passive eavesdroppers.
        *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: Moderately Reduces - By providing authentication and encryption, making it more difficult for attackers to perform MitM attacks.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   HTTPS is enabled for Grafana access to Loki.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   TLS encryption is not enforced for all communication with and between Loki components.
        *   TLS certificates and keys need to be generated and configured for Loki components.
        *   Internal Loki component communication is not encrypted with TLS.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Rate Limiting in Loki Distributors](./mitigation_strategies/configure_rate_limiting_in_loki_distributors.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Log Ingestion Patterns:** Analyze typical log ingestion rates and patterns to determine appropriate rate limits for Loki distributors. Consider factors like expected log volume, burst traffic, and system capacity.
    2.  **Configure Distributor Rate Limits:** Edit the Loki distributor configuration (e.g., in `loki.yaml` or distributor-specific configuration) to set rate limits. Loki allows configuring rate limits based on:
        *   `ingestion_rate_limit`: Global rate limit for all tenants/streams (in MB/sec).
        *   `ingestion_burst_size`: Burst size allowed for exceeding the rate limit.
        *   `per_stream_rate_limit`: Rate limit per log stream (using labels, in KB/sec).
        *   `per_stream_burst_size`: Burst size per stream.
    3.  **Choose Appropriate Rate Limiting Values:** Set rate limit values that are high enough to accommodate legitimate log traffic but low enough to prevent abuse and DoS attacks. Start with conservative values and adjust based on monitoring.
    4.  **Monitor Rate Limiting Metrics:** Monitor Loki distributor metrics related to rate limiting, such as `loki_distributor_ingester_appends_bytes_rate_limit_triggered_total` and `loki_distributor_ingester_appends_bytes_dropped_total`, to track rate limit effectiveness and identify potential issues.
    5.  **Adjust Rate Limits as Needed:** Periodically review and adjust rate limits based on monitoring data, changes in log volume, and system performance.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Log injection attacks aimed at overwhelming Loki distributors and causing service disruption. (High Severity)
        *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity) - Excessive log ingestion consuming excessive distributor resources (CPU, memory).
        *   Log Injection Attacks (Medium Severity) - Mitigates the impact of large-scale log injection attempts by limiting ingestion rate.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS): Significantly Reduces - By preventing attackers from overwhelming Loki distributors with excessive log data.
        *   Resource Exhaustion: Significantly Reduces - By controlling log ingestion rate and preventing distributor resource depletion.
        *   Log Injection Attacks: Moderately Reduces - By limiting the volume of malicious logs that can be injected into the system.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   No rate limiting is explicitly configured for log ingestion in Loki distributors.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Rate limiting parameters need to be configured in Loki distributor configuration.
        *   Monitoring of rate limiting metrics needs to be set up for distributors.
        *   Procedures for analyzing log ingestion patterns and adjusting rate limits are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Query Limits and Timeouts in Loki Queriers](./mitigation_strategies/configure_query_limits_and_timeouts_in_loki_queriers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Query Patterns:** Analyze typical log query patterns and identify potentially resource-intensive query types (e.g., queries with wide time ranges, complex aggregations, high cardinality labels).
    2.  **Configure Querier Query Limits:** Edit the Loki querier configuration (e.g., in `loki.yaml` or querier-specific configuration) to set query limits. Loki allows configuring limits such as:
        *   `max_query_lookback`: Maximum time range allowed for queries.
        *   `max_query_length`: Maximum duration a query can run before timeout.
        *   `max_concurrent_queries`: Maximum number of concurrent queries allowed per querier.
        *   `max_samples_per_query`: Maximum number of log samples returned per query.
        *   `max_global_streams_per_query`: Maximum number of streams a query can process globally.
    3.  **Set Appropriate Query Limits:** Set query limit values that are reasonable for typical use cases but prevent resource exhaustion and DoS attacks. Start with conservative limits and adjust based on monitoring and user feedback.
    4.  **Configure Query Timeouts:** Set appropriate query timeouts to prevent long-running queries from monopolizing querier resources.
    5.  **Monitor Query Performance and Limits:** Monitor Loki querier metrics related to query performance and limit triggers, such as query latency, error rates, and limit violations.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Malicious or accidental resource-intensive queries causing Loki querier performance degradation or service disruption. (High Severity)
        *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity) - Inefficient queries consuming excessive querier resources (CPU, memory).
        *   Slow Query Performance (Medium Severity) - Impact on user experience due to slow or unresponsive queries caused by resource contention.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS): Moderately Reduces - By limiting the impact of individual resource-intensive queries on Loki queriers.
        *   Resource Exhaustion: Significantly Reduces - By preventing queries from monopolizing querier resources and causing exhaustion.
        *   Slow Query Performance: Significantly Reduces - By ensuring queries are terminated before they excessively impact performance and by limiting concurrent queries.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Default Loki configurations are in place, but explicit query limits and timeouts are not actively configured in queriers.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Query limit and timeout parameters need to be configured in Loki querier configuration.
        *   Monitoring of query performance and limit triggers needs to be implemented for queriers.
        *   Guidelines for users on writing efficient LogQL queries and understanding query limits are missing.
