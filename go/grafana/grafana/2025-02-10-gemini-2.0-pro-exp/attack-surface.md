# Attack Surface Analysis for grafana/grafana

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass (Grafana's Authentication Mechanisms)](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass__grafana's_authentication_mechanisms_.md)

*   **Description:**  Circumventing Grafana's *built-in* authentication logic (local users, OAuth, LDAP, SAML integrations) to gain unauthorized access. This excludes attacks on *external* authentication providers themselves.
*   **How Grafana Contributes:** Vulnerabilities in Grafana's code handling authentication flows, session management, or credential validation for *its supported authentication methods*.
*   **Example:**  A flaw in Grafana's OAuth *integration code* allows an attacker to forge a valid token, bypassing the need for legitimate credentials from the OAuth provider.  Another example: a vulnerability in Grafana's *SAML response parsing logic* allows injection of malicious XML.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the Grafana instance, granting access to all connected data sources and dashboards (subject to configured permissions). Potential for data exfiltration, modification, and system disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Grafana and all authentication-related *internal* components (libraries used for OAuth, LDAP, SAML processing) up-to-date.
    *   Regularly audit authentication logs for suspicious activity *within Grafana*.
    *   Thoroughly test all *Grafana-specific* authentication integration code for vulnerabilities, including edge cases and error handling.  This includes penetration testing of the authentication flows.
    *   Implement robust session management within Grafana, including short session timeouts and secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure).
    *   Disable unused authentication methods *within Grafana*.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass (Privilege Escalation within Grafana)](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass__privilege_escalation_within_grafana_.md)

*   **Description:**  A user with limited privileges within Grafana gains access to resources or functionality they should not have, *due to flaws in Grafana's RBAC implementation*.
*   **How Grafana Contributes:** Vulnerabilities in Grafana's *internal* role-based access control (RBAC) system, folder permissions, and team management *code*.
*   **Example:**  A user with "Viewer" permissions exploits a flaw in Grafana's *dashboard editing API endpoint* to modify a dashboard they shouldn't have access to.  Another example: a bug in Grafana's *team permission handling code* allows cross-team data access.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of dashboards, and potential disruption of services. The impact depends on the level of privilege gained *within Grafana*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the level of escalation)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Grafana up-to-date to patch any RBAC-related vulnerabilities *in Grafana's codebase*.
    *   Regularly review and audit user roles, permissions, and team memberships *within Grafana*. Follow the principle of least privilege.
    *   Thoroughly test *Grafana's RBAC implementation* for bypass vulnerabilities, including edge cases and interactions between different permission levels. This requires specific penetration testing against Grafana's API and internal logic.
    *   Use Grafana's built-in auditing features to monitor changes to permissions and user roles *within Grafana*.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Grafana's Data Source Proxy](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_grafana's_data_source_proxy.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting *vulnerabilities in Grafana's data source proxy code* to make requests to internal or external resources.
*   **How Grafana Contributes:** The data source proxy feature *within Grafana* acts as an intermediary.  Vulnerabilities in *how Grafana handles and validates these proxy requests* are the key concern.
*   **Example:**  An attacker crafts a malicious query that, when processed by *Grafana's proxy code*, causes it to make a request to an internal server or a sensitive cloud metadata endpoint, *due to insufficient input validation or URL sanitization within Grafana*.
*   **Impact:**  Access to internal network resources, potential for data exfiltration, port scanning, and exploitation of vulnerabilities in internal services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Grafana up-to-date to address any vulnerabilities in the *proxy handling code*.
    *   Implement strict network segmentation to limit the reach of the Grafana server. The Grafana server should only be able to communicate with authorized data sources. This is a network-level control, but it mitigates the *impact* of a Grafana SSRF vulnerability.
    *   Use a whitelist of allowed data source URLs and IP addresses, if possible, *within Grafana's configuration*. Block access to internal IP ranges.
    *   Disable the data source proxy feature *in Grafana* if it's not absolutely necessary.
    *   Monitor network traffic from the Grafana server for suspicious requests *initiated by the proxy*.
    *   *Within Grafana's code*, validate and sanitize all user input that is used to construct data source queries *before passing them to the proxy*. This is the most crucial mitigation.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Plugin Exploitation (Vulnerabilities within Plugin Handling)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_plugin_exploitation__vulnerabilities_within_plugin_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities introduced by how Grafana *handles* plugins, rather than vulnerabilities *within* the plugins themselves (although those are also a concern). This focuses on Grafana's plugin loading, execution, and permission management.
*   **How Grafana Contributes:** Weaknesses in Grafana's plugin *signing*, *verification*, *sandboxing*, or *permission management* mechanisms.
*   **Example:** An attacker bypasses Grafana's plugin signature verification and installs a malicious plugin. Or, a vulnerability in Grafana's plugin sandboxing allows a plugin to escape its restricted environment and access the host system.
*   **Impact:** Depends on the vulnerability in Grafana's plugin handling. Could range from unauthorized data access to complete system compromise if Grafana's sandboxing is bypassed.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Grafana up-to-date, focusing on updates related to plugin security.
    *   Strengthen Grafana's plugin signing and verification mechanisms.
    *   Improve Grafana's plugin sandboxing to prevent plugins from escaping their restricted environment.
    *   Implement stricter permission controls for plugins within Grafana, limiting their access to sensitive data and functionality.
    *   Regularly review and audit Grafana's plugin handling code.
