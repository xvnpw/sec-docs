# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for grafana/grafana

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Source - Principle of Least Privilege (Grafana Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/data_source_-_principle_of_least_privilege__grafana_configuration_.md)

1.  **Identify Data Sources:** Within Grafana, navigate to "Configuration" -> "Data Sources" and list all configured data sources.
2.  **Review Existing Credentials:** For *each* data source, examine the configured credentials (username, password, API key, etc.).
3.  **Update Credentials (if necessary):** If the data source is using overly permissive credentials (e.g., a database administrator account), update the configuration within Grafana to use the credentials of a dedicated, restricted user (created as described in the previous, broader strategy). This involves editing the data source settings within Grafana's UI.
4.  **Test Connection:** After updating the credentials, use Grafana's "Test" button for the data source to ensure the connection is still working with the new, restricted credentials.
5.  **Regular Review:** Periodically (e.g., monthly, quarterly) revisit the data source configurations within Grafana to ensure the credentials remain appropriate and haven't been accidentally changed.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification (High Severity):** Limits the damage if Grafana is compromised; the attacker can only perform actions allowed by the restricted data source user.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (High Severity):** Limits the amount of data an attacker can steal.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Prevents using Grafana to gain higher privileges on the data source.
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Limits the *impact* of a successful SQL injection attack within Grafana's templating.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Impact of successful SQL injection is significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: Implemented for PostgreSQL data source.  Using credentials for `grafana_ro` user within Grafana's data source configuration.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example: Missing for Elasticsearch data source.  Still using administrative credentials within Grafana.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Grafana Configuration - Disable Unused Features](./mitigation_strategies/grafana_configuration_-_disable_unused_features.md)

1.  **Access Configuration File:** Locate and open Grafana's configuration file (`grafana.ini` or equivalent).
2.  **Review Sections:** Examine each section of the configuration file (e.g., `[auth.ldap]`, `[auth.anonymous]`, `[plugins]`).
3.  **Disable Unused Authentication:** For any unused authentication methods (LDAP, OAuth, etc.), set the `enabled` option to `false`.  For example: `[auth.ldap] enabled = false`
4.  **Disable Anonymous Access:** If anonymous access is not required, set `[auth.anonymous] enabled = false`.
5.  **Disable Unused Plugins:** *Remove* the directories of any unused plugins from Grafana's plugin directory (usually `/var/lib/grafana/plugins` or a similar path).  Do *not* just disable them in the configuration file; remove them entirely.
6.  **Disable Unused Data Sources:** Within Grafana's UI ("Configuration" -> "Data Sources"), *delete* any data sources that are no longer in use.
7.  **Restart Grafana:** Restart the Grafana server for the changes to take effect.
8.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review the configuration file and the list of installed plugins and data sources within Grafana's UI to ensure only necessary features are enabled.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerability Exploitation (Variable Severity):** Reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Variable Severity):** Prevents using unused authentication methods to gain access.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerability Exploitation:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: Disabled LDAP authentication and anonymous access in `grafana.ini`. Removed several unused plugin directories.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example: Need to review and delete unused data sources within Grafana's UI.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Grafana Access Control - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/grafana_access_control_-_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

1.  **Access User Management:** Within Grafana, navigate to "Configuration" -> "Users" (or "Server Admin" -> "Users" depending on your Grafana version).
2.  **Review Existing Users:** Examine the list of users and their assigned roles.
3.  **Assign Roles:** Ensure each user is assigned the *minimum* necessary role (Viewer, Editor, Admin).  Avoid granting the Admin role unless absolutely necessary.
4.  **Create Custom Roles (if needed):** If the built-in roles are not sufficient, create custom roles with specific permissions.  This is done through Grafana's API (not directly in the UI for older versions; newer versions have UI support).
5.  **Organization-Level Permissions (if using Organizations):** If using Grafana Organizations, configure permissions at the organization level to further restrict access.  This is done within the "Configuration" -> "Organizations" section.
6.  **Regularly Audit Permissions:** Periodically (e.g., monthly, quarterly) review user roles and permissions within Grafana's UI to ensure they are still appropriate.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from modifying dashboards or data sources.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Limits access to sensitive dashboards and data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Makes it harder to escalate privileges.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of accidental changes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: Using built-in roles. Users are assigned to roles within Grafana's UI.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example: Need to create custom roles via the API for finer-grained control.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Grafana - Disable Public Dashboards](./mitigation_strategies/grafana_-_disable_public_dashboards.md)

1.  **Identify Public Dashboards:** Within Grafana, review all dashboards and identify any that are configured to be publicly accessible (shared with "Anyone with the link").
2.  **Disable Public Sharing:** For each public dashboard, go to the dashboard settings (gear icon) and disable the public sharing option. This usually involves unchecking a "Public" or "Share" checkbox.
3.  **Review Sharing Settings:** Carefully review all sharing settings for *all* dashboards to ensure they are not inadvertently shared with a wider audience than intended.
4.  **Exceptional Cases:** If public access is *absolutely* required for a specific dashboard, document the justification clearly and ensure the exposed data is minimized and non-sensitive.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure (High Severity):** Prevents sensitive data from being exposed to unauthorized individuals.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of leaking information about your infrastructure or monitoring setup.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: All dashboards are configured to be private. Public sharing is disabled.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example: None. Fully implemented.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitoring and Auditing - Enable and Configure Audit Logging (within Grafana)](./mitigation_strategies/monitoring_and_auditing_-_enable_and_configure_audit_logging__within_grafana_.md)

1.  **Access Configuration File:** Locate and open Grafana's configuration file (`grafana.ini` or equivalent).
2.  **Enable Audit Logging:** In the `[log]` section, ensure that logging is enabled and configured to capture relevant events.  This typically involves setting:
    *   `[log] mode = console file` (or just `file` if you don't want console output)
    *   `[log.console] level = info` (if using console logging)
    *   `[log.file] level = info` (for file logging)
    *   You might also want to specify a dedicated log file path: `[log.file] file_name = grafana_audit.log`
3.  **Log Rotation (within Grafana):** Configure log rotation within the `[log.file]` section to prevent the audit log file from growing too large.  Use options like:
    *   `log_rotate = true`
    *   `max_lines = 100000` (or a suitable value)
    *   `max_size_shift = 28` (corresponds to 256MB; adjust as needed)
    *   `daily_rotate = true`
    *   `max_days = 7` (or a suitable value)
4.  **Restart Grafana:** Restart the Grafana server for the changes to take effect.
5. **Verification:** After restarting, perform some actions in Grafana (login, create a dashboard, etc.) and verify that these actions are logged in the specified audit log file.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Provides a record of user logins and actions.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Helps identify the source and scope of a breach.
    *   **Insider Threats (High Severity):** Helps detect malicious activity by authorized users.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Variable Severity):** Provides evidence of compliance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Improved detection and investigation.
    *   **Data Breach:** Improved investigation and response.
    *   **Insider Threats:** Improved detection and investigation.
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Provides evidence of compliance.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: Audit logging is enabled in `grafana.ini`. Log rotation is configured.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example: None, as far as Grafana's internal capabilities are concerned.  Further mitigation would involve *external* log analysis and alerting.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Alerting on Sensitive Actions (within Grafana)](./mitigation_strategies/alerting_on_sensitive_actions__within_grafana_.md)

1. **Identify Sensitive Actions:** Determine which actions within Grafana should trigger alerts. Examples include:
    * Changes to administrator accounts or permissions.
    * Creation or modification of data source connections.
    * Deletion of dashboards or panels.
    * Access to specific, highly sensitive dashboards.
2. **Utilize Existing Data Sources:** Determine if you can use existing data sources (e.g., Grafana's internal database, audit logs if accessible as a data source) to monitor for these actions.
3. **Create Alerting Rules:** Within Grafana's alerting system ("Alerting" -> "Alert Rules"), create new alert rules based on queries against the chosen data source. These queries should detect the sensitive actions identified in step 1.
    * For example, if you can query Grafana's internal database, you might create a query that looks for changes to the `user` table where the `is_admin` flag is modified.
4. **Configure Notifications:** Configure the alert rules to send notifications to appropriate channels (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty) when triggered.
5. **Test Alerts:** Thoroughly test the alert rules to ensure they are working correctly and not generating false positives.
6. **Regular Review:** Periodically review and update the alert rules to ensure they remain relevant and effective.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Provides early warning of unauthorized changes to Grafana's configuration.
    * **Data Breach (High Severity):** Can help detect actions that might indicate a data breach.
    * **Insider Threats (High Severity):** Can help detect malicious activity by authorized users.
    * **Accidental Misconfiguration (Medium Severity):** Provides early warning of accidental changes that could compromise security.

* **Impact:**
        * **Unauthorized Access:** Improved detection and response time.
        * **Data Breach:** Improved detection and response time.
        * **Insider Threats:** Improved detection and response time.
        * **Accidental Misconfiguration:** Improved detection and response time.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: Basic alerting rules are configured to notify on failed login attempts (using a data source that exposes login events).]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example: Need to create more sophisticated alert rules for changes to user permissions and data source connections. This might require querying Grafana's internal database directly, which may need additional setup.]
