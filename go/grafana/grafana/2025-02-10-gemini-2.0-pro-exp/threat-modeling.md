# Threat Model Analysis for grafana/grafana

## Threat: [User Impersonation](./threats/user_impersonation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a legitimate Grafana user's credentials (e.g., through phishing, credential stuffing, brute-force attacks, or exploiting weak passwords configured within Grafana's built-in authentication). The attacker then logs into Grafana as that user.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can perform any actions the compromised user is authorized to do. If the compromised user is an administrator, the attacker gains full control over Grafana. This includes viewing sensitive dashboards, modifying configurations, deleting data, and potentially using Grafana as a pivot point to attack connected data sources.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication Module (specifically Grafana's built-in authentication), Session Management.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if an administrator account is compromised), High (if a regular user account is compromised).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, regular changes) for Grafana's built-in user database.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Require MFA for *all* users, especially administrators, even when using Grafana's built-in authentication.
    *   **Session Management:** Implement short session timeouts, secure cookies (HttpOnly, Secure flags), and session invalidation upon logout.
    *   **Account Review:** Regularly review user accounts and permissions, removing inactive or unnecessary accounts, especially those with administrative privileges.
    * **Brute-Force Protection:** Implement measures to detect and prevent brute-force login attempts (e.g., account lockout after a certain number of failed attempts).

## Threat: [Unauthorized Dashboard/Alert/Configuration Modification](./threats/unauthorized_dashboardalertconfiguration_modification.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges (either through compromised credentials as described above, or by exploiting a vulnerability in Grafana's authorization mechanisms) modifies dashboards to display false information, disables or alters alerts to hide malicious activity, or changes Grafana's configuration to weaken security. They might also delete dashboards or alerts. This threat focuses on *unauthorized* modification, meaning the attacker should *not* have the permissions to perform these actions.
*   **Impact:** Loss of data integrity, misleading visualizations, missed alerts (potentially leading to undetected security incidents or operational failures), and a weakened security posture for Grafana itself.
*   **Affected Component:** Dashboard Management Module, Alerting Engine, Configuration Management, API Endpoints (specifically those related to creating, modifying, and deleting dashboards, alerts, and configuration settings).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature and extent of the modifications).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Strictly enforce the principle of least privilege. Grant users only the *minimum* necessary permissions. Use Grafana's roles and teams effectively to granularly control access.
    *   **Audit Logging:** Enable *detailed* audit logging for *all* configuration changes and user actions related to dashboards, alerts, and Grafana's settings. Regularly review these logs for suspicious activity.
    *   **Version Control:** Store dashboard definitions in a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes, revert to previous versions, and detect unauthorized modifications. This is crucial for recovery and auditing.
    *   **Configuration Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms (e.g., file integrity monitoring) to detect unauthorized changes to Grafana's configuration files.

## Threat: [Grafana Configuration Exposure](./threats/grafana_configuration_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to Grafana's configuration files (e.g., `grafana.ini`) or internal APIs *directly*, revealing information about data sources, users, authentication settings, and other sensitive details. This differs from data source spoofing; this is about accessing Grafana's *own* configuration, not a data source's.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive configuration information, which can be used to launch further attacks, compromise connected data sources (by revealing credentials), or gain unauthorized access to Grafana itself (by revealing user information or authentication secrets).
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration Management, File System Permissions, API Endpoints (specifically internal or administrative APIs).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Configuration Files:** Protect Grafana's configuration files and directories with appropriate file system permissions (restrict access to authorized users and groups *only*). Ensure the Grafana process runs with the least necessary privileges.
    *   **API Access Control:** Strictly restrict access to Grafana's internal or administrative APIs. Use authentication and authorization to control who can access these APIs. Do not expose these APIs unnecessarily to the public internet.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Grafana updated to the latest version to patch any known vulnerabilities that could expose configuration information through API vulnerabilities or other exploits.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation - Grafana Core](./threats/privilege_escalation_-_grafana_core.md)

*   **Description:** A low-privileged Grafana user exploits a vulnerability *within Grafana itself* (e.g., a bug in the authorization logic, a flaw in an API endpoint) to gain higher privileges (e.g., becoming an administrator or gaining access to data they shouldn't have). This is a direct vulnerability in Grafana's code.
*   **Impact:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to dashboards, data sources, and administrative functions, potentially compromising the entire Grafana instance and any connected systems.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication and Authorization Modules, API Endpoints, Internal Logic (any component involved in enforcing access control).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** *Immediately* apply security updates and patches released by Grafana. This is the most critical mitigation for privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Strictly enforce the principle of least privilege for all users, even if a vulnerability exists, this limits the potential damage.
    *   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically targeting Grafana's authorization mechanisms and API endpoints, to identify potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities *before* they are exploited.
    *   **Input Validation:** Ensure robust input validation and sanitization throughout Grafana's codebase to prevent injection attacks that could lead to privilege escalation.
