Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Privilege Escalation - Grafana Core" threat, structured as requested:

## Deep Analysis: Privilege Escalation in Grafana Core

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

*   **Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the "Privilege Escalation - Grafana Core" threat, identify potential attack vectors, assess the effectiveness of existing mitigations, and propose additional security measures to minimize the risk.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to harden Grafana against this critical threat.

*   **Scope:** This analysis focuses exclusively on privilege escalation vulnerabilities *within the core Grafana codebase itself*.  It does *not* cover vulnerabilities arising from:
    *   Misconfigurations (e.g., weak passwords, exposed ports).
    *   Third-party plugins (these would be a separate threat analysis).
    *   External systems interacting with Grafana (e.g., vulnerabilities in a connected database).
    *   Social engineering or phishing attacks.

    The scope includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Authentication and authorization modules.
    *   API endpoints (both internal and external).
    *   Internal logic related to user roles, permissions, and data access.
    *   Session management.
    *   Data source connection handling (as it relates to user permissions).
    *   Alerting and notification systems (potential for escalation through alert manipulation).
    *   Dashboard and panel rendering (potential for XSS leading to privilege escalation).

*   **Methodology:** This analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

    *   **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine the Grafana source code (available on GitHub) to identify potential vulnerabilities.  This will involve searching for:
        *   Incorrect or missing authorization checks.
        *   Logic errors in permission handling.
        *   Insecure use of user-supplied input.
        *   Potential for bypassing authentication mechanisms.
        *   Areas where roles or permissions are assigned or modified.
        *   Use of known vulnerable libraries or patterns.
        *   Hardcoded credentials or secrets.

    *   **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing and Penetration Testing):**  We will simulate attacks against a running Grafana instance. This will involve:
        *   Fuzzing API endpoints with unexpected or malformed data.
        *   Attempting to bypass authentication and authorization controls.
        *   Trying to escalate privileges from a low-privileged user account.
        *   Testing for common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQLi) that could lead to privilege escalation.
        *   Using automated vulnerability scanners.

    *   **Review of Past Vulnerabilities:** We will analyze previously reported Grafana vulnerabilities (CVEs) related to privilege escalation to understand common attack patterns and ensure that similar vulnerabilities are not present in the current codebase.

    *   **Threat Modeling:**  We will use the existing threat model as a starting point and expand upon it to identify specific attack scenarios and pathways.

    *   **Documentation Review:** We will review Grafana's official documentation, including security best practices and configuration guidelines, to identify any potential gaps or areas for improvement.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

Given the "Privilege Escalation - Grafana Core" threat, here's a breakdown of potential attack vectors, specific code areas to scrutinize, and enhanced mitigation strategies:

**2.1 Potential Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Endpoint Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Authorization Checks:** An API endpoint might fail to properly verify the user's role or permissions before granting access to sensitive data or functionality.  For example, an endpoint designed for administrators might be accessible to regular users due to a missing `@PreAuthorize` annotation (in Spring Security) or equivalent check.
    *   **Incorrect Authorization Logic:** The authorization logic might be flawed, allowing users with specific roles to access resources intended for other roles.  This could involve errors in role hierarchy comparisons or permission checks.
    *   **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference):** An attacker might be able to manipulate parameters in an API request (e.g., user IDs, dashboard IDs) to access resources belonging to other users or with higher privileges.  This is a classic privilege escalation vector.
    *   **Parameter Tampering:**  Modifying hidden form fields or URL parameters to elevate privileges.  For example, changing a `role=user` parameter to `role=admin`.
    *   **Unauthenticated API Access:**  Some API endpoints might be unintentionally exposed without requiring authentication, allowing an attacker to perform actions without any credentials.

*   **Authentication Bypass:**
    *   **Session Fixation:** An attacker might be able to hijack a user's session and then escalate privileges if the session is not properly invalidated after a privilege change.
    *   **Weak Session Management:**  Predictable session IDs or insufficient session timeout mechanisms could allow an attacker to guess or steal a valid session token.
    *   **Authentication Logic Flaws:**  Bugs in the authentication process itself (e.g., in handling OAuth, LDAP, or other authentication providers) could allow an attacker to bypass authentication or impersonate another user.

*   **Data Source Connection Exploits:**
    *   **Stored Credentials:** If Grafana stores data source credentials insecurely, an attacker with low privileges might be able to retrieve those credentials and directly access the data source with higher privileges.
    *   **Credential Injection:**  An attacker might be able to inject malicious code into data source connection settings, potentially leading to code execution and privilege escalation.

*   **Dashboard/Panel Rendering Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  A stored XSS vulnerability in a dashboard or panel could allow an attacker to inject JavaScript code that executes in the context of another user's browser.  If an administrator views the malicious dashboard, the attacker's code could execute with administrator privileges, allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the administrator.
    *   **Template Injection:** Similar to XSS, vulnerabilities in template rendering could allow an attacker to inject code that executes with higher privileges.

*   **Internal Logic Flaws:**
    *   **Race Conditions:**  In concurrent environments, race conditions in permission checks or role assignments could lead to inconsistent state and potential privilege escalation.
    *   **Logic Errors in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Flaws in the implementation of RBAC could allow users to gain unintended permissions.
    *   **Improper Handling of User Input:**  Even in internal functions, failing to properly validate or sanitize user input could lead to vulnerabilities.

**2.2 Specific Code Areas to Scrutinize (Examples):**

*   **`pkg/api/` (Grafana API):**  Examine all API handlers, paying close attention to authorization checks (`requireAdmin`, `requireOrgAdmin`, etc.) and parameter validation.  Look for any endpoints that might be unintentionally exposed or lack proper authorization.
*   **`pkg/services/auth/` (Authentication Service):**  Review the authentication logic, session management, and integration with external authentication providers.  Look for potential bypasses or weaknesses.
*   **`pkg/services/accesscontrol/` (Access Control Service):**  This is a critical area.  Thoroughly examine the implementation of RBAC, permission checks, and role assignments.  Look for logic errors or inconsistencies.
*   **`pkg/models/` (Data Models):**  Review the data models for users, roles, permissions, and data sources.  Ensure that relationships and constraints are correctly defined.
*   **`pkg/services/datasources/` (Data Source Service):**  Examine how data source connections are managed and how credentials are stored and used.  Look for potential injection vulnerabilities.
*   **`pkg/api/pluginproxy/` (Plugin Proxy):**  If plugins are used, examine how Grafana proxies requests to plugins and how permissions are handled in this context.
*   **`pkg/services/rendering/` (Rendering Service):**  Review the code responsible for rendering dashboards and panels.  Look for potential XSS or template injection vulnerabilities.
*   **`pkg/services/alerting/` (Alerting Service):** Examine how alerts are created, managed, and executed. Look for potential ways to manipulate alerts to gain higher privileges.

**2.3 Enhanced Mitigation Strategies (Beyond the Basics):**

*   **Mandatory Code Reviews with Security Focus:**  Every code change, especially those affecting authentication, authorization, or data access, *must* undergo a mandatory code review by at least one other developer with security expertise.  The review should specifically focus on identifying potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
*   **Automated Static Analysis (SAST):**  Integrate a SAST tool into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities, including privilege escalation issues.  Examples include SonarQube, Semgrep, and commercial SAST solutions.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Regularly run DAST scans against a staging or test environment to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by static analysis.  Tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and commercial DAST scanners can be used.
*   **Fuzz Testing:**  Implement fuzz testing for API endpoints and other input vectors.  Fuzzing involves sending random, unexpected, or malformed data to an application to identify crashes or unexpected behavior that could indicate a vulnerability.
*   **Regular Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration tests by external security experts.  These tests should specifically target Grafana's authorization mechanisms and API endpoints.
*   **Bug Bounty Program:**  Consider implementing a bug bounty program to incentivize security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities in Grafana.
*   **Security Training for Developers:**  Provide regular security training to all developers, covering topics such as secure coding practices, common web vulnerabilities, and Grafana-specific security considerations.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strict CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.  CSP allows you to control which resources (scripts, styles, images, etc.) can be loaded by the browser, making it harder for an attacker to inject malicious code.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) - Enforced by Design:** Go beyond simply assigning roles. Design the system so that components *inherently* have the minimum necessary privileges. For example, a service that only needs to read data should not have write access, even if the user has write permissions.
*   **Audit Logging:** Implement comprehensive audit logging for all security-relevant events, such as login attempts, privilege changes, and data access.  This can help detect and investigate potential privilege escalation attempts.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on sensitive API endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks and slow down attackers attempting to exploit vulnerabilities.
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enforce 2FA for all users, especially administrators. This adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for an attacker to gain access even if they obtain a user's password.
* **Regularly Review and Update Dependencies:** Keep all third-party libraries and dependencies up to date. Vulnerabilities in dependencies can be exploited to gain privilege escalation.
