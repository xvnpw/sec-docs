## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Grafana Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_grafana_vulnerabilities__high-risk_.md)

*   **1.a. Known CVEs (e.g., Path Traversal) [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in Grafana, such as path traversal flaws, to gain unauthorized access to files or execute code.
    *   **Example:** CVE-2021-43798 (Path Traversal).
    *   **Mitigation:** Immediate patching and updates.

*   **1.a.i. Unpatched Grafana Instance [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:**  Running a version of Grafana with known, unpatched vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Implement a robust and *immediate* patch management process. Automate updates where possible.

* **1.b Zero-Day Exploits [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Description:** Exploiting a vulnerability that is unknown to the vendor and the public.
    * **Mitigation:** Defense-in-depth, intrusion detection/prevention, incident response planning.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse Grafana Configuration [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__abuse_grafana_configuration__high-risk_.md)

*   **2.a. Weak Authentication (Default Credentials) [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:**  Using default or easily guessable administrative credentials to gain access to Grafana.
    *   **Mitigation:**  *Never* use default credentials. Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

*   **2.c. Exposed Admin Interface [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:**  Making the Grafana administrative interface accessible from the public internet without proper protection (e.g., VPN, IP whitelisting, reverse proxy with authentication).
    *   **Mitigation:**  Restrict access to the admin interface using network security controls.  Never expose it directly to the internet.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Data Source Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_data_source_vulnerabilities__high-risk_.md)

*   **3.a. Data Source Credentials [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:**  Obtaining the credentials used by Grafana to connect to data sources (databases, APIs, etc.).
    *   **Mitigation:**  Securely store credentials using Grafana's built-in features or a dedicated secrets management solution.

*   **3.d. Data Source Without Proper Authentication [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:**  Connecting Grafana to a data source that does not require authentication or uses easily bypassed authentication.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Ensure *all* data sources have strong authentication mechanisms in place.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Abuse Plugin System [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/4__abuse_plugin_system__high-risk_.md)

*   **4.a. Unsigned Plugins:**
    *   **Description:** Installing Grafana plugins that have not been digitally signed by a trusted provider.
    *   **Mitigation:** Only install signed plugins from trusted sources.  Thoroughly vet any unsigned plugins before installation.

*   **4.b Malicious Plugin Code [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** A plugin containing malicious code that can compromise the Grafana instance.
    *   **Mitigation:** Strict plugin management, code review (if possible), and monitoring for suspicious plugin behavior.
