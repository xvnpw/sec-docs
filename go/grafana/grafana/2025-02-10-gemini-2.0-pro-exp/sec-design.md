Okay, let's create a design document for the Grafana project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Grafana is a widely used open-source analytics and monitoring platform.  It allows users to visualize and analyze data from various sources.  Given its role in visualizing sensitive operational and potentially business data, the primary business concerns revolve around data integrity, availability, and confidentiality.  Since it's open source and widely adopted, its reputation and community trust are also critical assets.

Business Priorities:

*   Provide a stable and reliable platform for data visualization and analysis.
*   Maintain user trust in the accuracy and integrity of displayed data.
*   Enable broad compatibility with various data sources and deployment environments.
*   Foster a vibrant open-source community and ecosystem.
*   Ensure the platform can scale to handle large datasets and high user loads.
*   Provide features for user and access management.

Business Goals:

*   Become/maintain the leading open-source platform for observability and data visualization.
*   Attract and retain a large and active user base.
*   Continuously improve the platform's features, performance, and security.
*   Offer enterprise-grade features and support for commercial users.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive data visualized through Grafana.
*   Data manipulation or corruption leading to incorrect visualizations and decisions.
*   Service disruptions or performance degradation impacting users' ability to monitor their systems.
*   Reputational damage due to security vulnerabilities or mishandling of user data.
*   Loss of community trust and contributions due to perceived lack of security or stability.
*   Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to use Grafana to attack connected data sources.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Grafana has implemented various security controls and addresses several security aspects.  However, being a complex platform with numerous integrations, it also has a significant attack surface.

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Authentication mechanisms: Support for various authentication methods, including username/password, OAuth (GitHub, GitLab, Google, Azure AD, Okta), LDAP, and API keys. (Documented in Grafana's authentication documentation).
*   security control: Authorization: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and restrict access to dashboards, data sources, and features. (Documented in Grafana's user management and permissions documentation).
*   security control: Data source proxy: Grafana acts as a proxy for data sources, which can help protect backend systems from direct exposure. (Documented in Grafana's data source configuration).
*   security control: Alerting: Secure alerting mechanisms with notifications through various channels (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty). (Documented in Grafana's alerting documentation).
*   security control: Security Hardening guidelines: Grafana provides documentation and recommendations for secure deployment and configuration. (Documented in Grafana's security documentation).
*   security control: Regular security audits and penetration testing: Grafana Labs conducts regular security assessments. (Mentioned in Grafana's security announcements and blog posts).
*   security control: Active community and vulnerability disclosure program: Grafana has a process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities. (Documented in Grafana's security policy).
*   security control: Data encryption in transit: Support for HTTPS to encrypt communication between the browser and the Grafana server, and between Grafana and data sources. (Configurable in Grafana's settings).
*   security control: Input validation: Some level of input validation is performed to prevent common web vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection. (Implemented in the Grafana codebase).
*   security control: CSRF protection: Grafana includes protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. (Implemented in the Grafana codebase).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party data source security: Grafana's security is partially dependent on the security of the configured data sources.
*   accepted risk: Potential for misconfiguration:  The flexibility of Grafana's configuration can lead to insecure setups if not properly managed.
*   accepted risk: Plugin security: Third-party plugins may introduce vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Complexity of access control: Managing fine-grained permissions can be complex, potentially leading to overly permissive configurations.

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

*   Implement comprehensive audit logging of all user actions and configuration changes.
*   Provide stronger session management controls, including session timeout and concurrent session limits.
*   Offer more granular control over data source access, including per-user or per-role data source permissions.
*   Implement a robust content security policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities.
*   Provide built-in support for data encryption at rest (for Grafana's internal database).
*   Enhance input validation and sanitization across all user-facing components.
*   Implement a formal secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) with integrated security testing (SAST, DAST, IAST).

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Strong password policies and enforcement.
    *   Secure storage of user credentials (e.g., hashing and salting).
    *   Integration with existing identity providers (e.g., SAML, OpenID Connect).

*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control based on roles and permissions.
    *   Ability to restrict access to specific dashboards, data sources, and features.
    *   Regular review and auditing of user permissions.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all user inputs to prevent XSS, SQL injection, and other injection attacks.
    *   Use of output encoding to prevent stored XSS.
    *   Validation of data source queries to prevent unauthorized data access.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest.
    *   Regular review and updates of cryptographic libraries.
