## Deep Dive Analysis: Data Source Query Injection via Variables in Grafana

This document provides a deep dive analysis of the "Data Source Query Injection via Variables" attack surface in Grafana, as requested. We will explore the mechanics of this vulnerability, its potential impact, and provide detailed recommendations for mitigation.

**1. Understanding the Attack Surface:**

This attack surface centers around the interaction between user-defined variables within Grafana dashboards and the queries executed against connected data sources. The core issue lies in the potential for unsanitized user input from these variables to be directly incorporated into data source queries.

**Key Components Involved:**

* **Grafana Frontend:**  The user interface where users define and interact with dashboard variables.
* **Grafana Backend:**  The server-side logic that processes dashboard definitions, variable values, and executes queries.
* **Data Source Plugins:**  Grafana's plugins that handle communication and query execution for specific data sources (e.g., Prometheus, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch).
* **Connected Data Sources:** The underlying databases or systems where data is stored and queried.
* **Dashboard Variables:** User-defined placeholders that can be used within panel queries to dynamically filter or modify data retrieval.

**2. Mechanics of the Attack:**

The attack unfolds in the following steps:

1. **Attacker Identification:** An attacker identifies a Grafana dashboard that utilizes variables in its data source queries. This could be through publicly accessible dashboards (if permissions are misconfigured) or through internal knowledge.
2. **Malicious Variable Crafting:** The attacker crafts a malicious value for a dashboard variable. This value is designed to inject malicious code into the query executed against the data source.
3. **Variable Substitution:** When the dashboard is loaded or refreshed, Grafana's backend substitutes the attacker-controlled variable value into the data source query.
4. **Query Execution:** The modified query, now containing the injected code, is sent to the connected data source for execution.
5. **Exploitation:** If the data source driver or the underlying database does not properly sanitize or parameterize the query, the injected code is executed, potentially leading to:
    * **Unauthorized Data Access:** Reading sensitive data that the Grafana data source user should not have access to.
    * **Data Modification:**  Inserting, updating, or deleting data within the data source.
    * **Privilege Escalation:**  In some cases, the injected code could be used to escalate privileges within the data source.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Executing resource-intensive queries that overwhelm the data source.
    * **Remote Code Execution (in extreme cases):**  Depending on the data source and its configuration, it might be possible to execute arbitrary commands on the data source server.

**3. Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

* **Direct SQL Injection:**  For SQL-based data sources (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), the attacker crafts variable values containing malicious SQL code (e.g., `'; DROP TABLE users; --`).
* **NoSQL Injection:**  For NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Elasticsearch), the injection techniques will differ but the principle remains the same. Attackers can manipulate query structures or use specific operators to extract or modify data.
* **Log Injection:**  While less direct, if variables are used in queries against logging systems (e.g., Elasticsearch, Loki), attackers might be able to inject malicious log entries that could be used for further attacks or to obfuscate their actions.
* **Metric Manipulation (Potentially):** In some metric systems, carefully crafted variable values might influence the aggregation or filtering of metrics in unintended ways, potentially leading to misleading dashboards or insights.

**Example Scenario (SQL Injection):**

Consider a dashboard with a variable named `environment` used in a SQL query like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE environment = '$environment';
```

An attacker could set the `environment` variable to:

```
' OR 1=1; --
```

This would result in the following executed query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE environment = '' OR 1=1; --';
```

The `OR 1=1` condition will always be true, effectively bypassing the intended filtering and returning all orders, regardless of the environment. More sophisticated attacks could involve `UNION` statements to extract data from other tables or `UPDATE` statements to modify data.

**4. Affected Grafana Components:**

* **Dashboard Model:** The internal representation of the dashboard, including variable definitions and panel queries.
* **Variable Query Runner:** The component responsible for fetching available values for variables. This is less directly vulnerable but could be a target for manipulation to influence available options.
* **Data Source Proxy:** The intermediary component that handles communication between Grafana and the data sources. This is where the potentially malicious queries are constructed and sent.
* **Data Source Plugins:** The specific plugin responsible for the target data source needs to be considered, as vulnerabilities in the plugin itself could exacerbate the issue.

**5. Impact Assessment (Detailed):**

The impact of a successful data source query injection attack can be severe and far-reaching:

* **Confidentiality Breach:** Access to sensitive data stored in the connected data source, potentially violating privacy regulations and damaging trust.
* **Data Integrity Compromise:** Modification or deletion of critical data, leading to inaccurate reporting, business disruptions, and potential financial losses.
* **Compliance Violations:** Failure to protect sensitive data can lead to significant fines and legal repercussions under regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.
* **Reputational Damage:** Public disclosure of a security breach can severely damage an organization's reputation and customer trust.
* **Service Disruption:**  DoS attacks against the data source can render the Grafana dashboards unusable and impact dependent services.
* **Lateral Movement:**  If the compromised data source is connected to other systems, the attacker might be able to use it as a stepping stone for further attacks.
* **Supply Chain Risk:** If Grafana is used to monitor critical infrastructure or services, a successful attack could have cascading effects on dependent systems and organizations.

**6. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and Actionable):**

* **Thoroughly Sanitize and Validate User Input:**
    * **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation rules for variable values based on their expected data type and format. For example, if a variable should only contain alphanumeric characters, enforce this restriction.
    * **Output Encoding:** Encode variable values before incorporating them into queries. This prevents malicious characters from being interpreted as code. For SQL, use appropriate escaping mechanisms provided by the database driver.
    * **Whitelisting:** Define a set of allowed characters or patterns for variable values and reject any input that doesn't conform.
    * **Contextual Sanitization:**  Sanitize based on the specific data source and query language being used.
    * **Regular Expression Filtering:** Utilize regular expressions to enforce complex validation rules.

* **Utilize Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements:**
    * **Core Principle:**  Separate the query structure from the user-provided data. Parameters act as placeholders for the variable values, preventing them from being interpreted as executable code.
    * **Implementation:**  Ensure that Grafana's data source configurations and plugins are configured to use parameterized queries where supported by the underlying data source.
    * **Benefits:**  This is the most effective defense against SQL injection and similar vulnerabilities.

* **Grant Grafana Data Source Users the Least Privileges Necessary:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant the Grafana data source user only the minimum permissions required to perform its intended tasks (e.g., read-only access for dashboards that only display data).
    * **Impact Reduction:**  Even if an injection attack is successful, the attacker's capabilities will be limited by the restricted permissions of the data source user.
    * **Granular Permissions:**  Utilize database-specific permission systems to control access to individual tables, columns, or even specific data rows.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Configure CSP headers to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which could be used in conjunction with variable manipulation.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Proactive Identification:**  Regularly assess Grafana configurations and dashboards for potential vulnerabilities, including data source query injection points.
    * **Simulated Attacks:**  Conduct penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses in security controls.

* **Security Awareness Training:**  Educate Grafana users and administrators about the risks of data source query injection and the importance of secure dashboard development practices.

* **Keep Grafana and Data Source Plugins Up-to-Date:**  Regularly update Grafana and its plugins to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.

* **Monitor Data Source Query Logs:**  Implement monitoring for unusual or suspicious queries executed against the data sources. Look for patterns indicative of injection attempts.

* **Input Validation on the Frontend (Defense in Depth):** While backend sanitization is crucial, implement client-side validation as an initial layer of defense to prevent obviously malicious input from reaching the backend.

* **Consider Using a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious requests, including those attempting data source query injection.

**7. Conclusion:**

Data Source Query Injection via Variables is a significant attack surface in Grafana that can lead to severe consequences if not properly addressed. By understanding the mechanics of the attack, its potential impact, and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation. A layered security approach, combining input validation, parameterized queries, least privilege principles, and regular security assessments, is crucial for protecting sensitive data and maintaining the integrity of connected data sources. Continuous vigilance and proactive security measures are essential to defend against this evolving threat.
