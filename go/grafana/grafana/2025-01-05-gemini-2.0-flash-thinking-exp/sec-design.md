## 4. Key Components (Detailed)

*   **Web Browser:** The user's entry point for interacting with Grafana, rendering the user interface and handling user inputs.
*   **Grafana Frontend:**  A sophisticated single-page application built primarily with React and TypeScript. It is responsible for:
    *   Rendering dashboards and visualizations.
    *   Handling user interactions and events.
    *   Communicating with the backend API through HTTP requests.
    *   Managing the application state.
*   **Grafana Backend:** The core of the application, implemented in Go, responsible for the business logic and data orchestration. It comprises several sub-components:
    *   **API Server:** Handles incoming HTTP requests from the frontend, manages routing, and delegates tasks to other backend services.
    *   **Query Engine:**  Processes queries received from the frontend, interacts with data source plugins to retrieve data, and formats the results.
    *   **Alerting Engine:** Evaluates alert rules against data retrieved by the Query Engine and manages the lifecycle of alerts, including sending notifications.
    *   **Provisioning Service:**  Automates the configuration of Grafana resources (data sources, dashboards, users, etc.) based on configuration files.
    *   **User & Organization Management:**  Handles user authentication, authorization, organization management, and user roles and permissions.
    *   **Dashboard Service:** Manages the creation, storage, retrieval, and updating of dashboards and their associated panels.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** A logical component within the backend responsible for:
    *   Verifying user credentials during login.
    *   Managing user sessions and tokens.
    *   Enforcing access control policies based on user roles and permissions.
    *   Supporting various authentication methods (e.g., basic auth, OAuth 2.0, LDAP, SAML).
*   **Data Source Plugins:**  Independent modules that enable Grafana to connect to and query different types of data sources. Each plugin:
    *   Implements the specific protocol and API for a particular data source.
    *   Translates Grafana's query language into the data source's native query language.
    *   Handles authentication and authorization with the data source.
*   **Grafana Database:** Stores Grafana's internal state and configuration data. This includes:
    *   User accounts and organization details.
    *   Dashboard definitions and configurations.
    *   Alert rules and notification channels.
    *   Data source configurations.
    *   API keys and other settings.
*   **External Data Sources:** The external systems where the actual monitoring data, logs, or other data to be visualized resides (e.g., Prometheus, Graphite, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, relational databases).

## 5. Data Flow (Detailed)

This section elaborates on the data flow, providing more specific steps and component interactions.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "User"
        A["Web Browser"]
    end
    subgraph "Grafana Backend"
        B["API Server"]
        C["Query Engine"]
        D["Data Source Plugins"]
    end
    E["Grafana Frontend"]
    F["External Data Sources"]
    G["Cache (Optional)"]

    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px

    A -- "Dashboard Request" --> E
    E -- "API Request (Query)" --> B
    B -- "Route to Query Engine" --> C
    C -- "Select Plugin" --> D
    D -- "Data Source Query" --> F
    F -- "Data Response" --> D
    D -- "Format Data" --> C
    C -- "Cache Data (Optional)" --> G
    C -- "Return Data" --> B
    B -- "Send Data" --> E
    E -- "Render Visualization" --> A
```

**Detailed Data Flow Steps:**

1. The user requests a dashboard through the **Web Browser**.
2. The **Grafana Frontend** sends an API request (typically an HTTP GET request) to the **API Server** in the Grafana Backend to retrieve data for the dashboard panels.
3. The **API Server** routes the request to the **Query Engine**.
4. The **Query Engine** identifies the necessary **Data Source Plugin** based on the data source configured for each panel.
5. The **Query Engine** invokes the appropriate methods within the **Data Source Plugin**, passing the query parameters.
6. The **Data Source Plugin** constructs and sends a query in the **External Data Source's** native query language.
7. The **External Data Source** processes the query and returns the data to the **Data Source Plugin**.
8. The **Data Source Plugin** formats the data into a standardized format that Grafana understands.
9. The **Query Engine** may optionally cache the data in a **Cache**.
10. The **Query Engine** returns the formatted data to the **API Server**.
11. The **API Server** sends the data back to the **Grafana Frontend** in the HTTP response.
12. The **Grafana Frontend** processes the data and renders the visualizations in the **Web Browser**.

## 6. User Interaction Flow (Detailed)

This section details common user interactions with Grafana.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "User"
        A["Web Browser"]

        H -- "Authentication Result" --> B
        B -- "Create Session" --> C
        C -- "Store Session Data" --> G
        B -- "Session Cookie" --> F
        F -- "Authenticated UI" --> A
    end

    subgraph "Create/Edit Dashboard"
        A -- "Dashboard Action" --> F
        F -- "API Request (Save/Update)" --> B
        B -- "Authorize Action" --> H
        H -- "Authorization Result" --> B
        B -- "Update Dashboard Data" --> D
        D -- "Store Dashboard" --> G
        B -- "Success Response" --> F
        F -- "Updated UI" --> A
    end

    subgraph "Add Data Source"
        A -- "Data Source Config" --> F
        F -- "API Request (Add DS)" --> B
        B -- "Authorize Action" --> H
        H -- "Authorization Result" --> B

    end
```

**Detailed User Interaction Flows:**

*   **User Login:**
    1. The user submits login credentials through the **Web Browser**.
    2. The **Grafana Frontend** sends an API request (typically a POST request) to the **API Server** with the credentials.
    3. The **API Server** delegates the authentication to the **Authentication & Authorization** component.
    4. The **Authentication & Authorization** component verifies the credentials against the data stored in the **Grafana Database** or an external authentication provider.
    5. The **Authentication & Authorization** component returns the authentication result to the **API Server**.
    6. Upon successful authentication, the **API Server** instructs the **User & Organization Management** component to create a session.
    7. The **User & Organization Management** component stores the session data in the **Grafana Database**.
    8. The **API Server** sends a session cookie back to the **Grafana Frontend**.
    9. The **Grafana Frontend** stores the cookie, and the user is presented with the authenticated UI.

*   **Create/Edit Dashboard:**
    1. The user interacts with the dashboard editor in the **Web Browser**.
    2. The **Grafana Frontend** sends an API request (typically a POST or PUT request) to the **API Server** to save or update the dashboard definition.
    3. The **API Server** verifies the user's authorization with the **Authentication & Authorization** component.
    4. If authorized, the **API Server** instructs the **Dashboard Service** to update the dashboard data.
    5. The **Dashboard Service** stores the updated dashboard definition in the **Grafana Database**.
    6. The **API Server** sends a success response to the **Grafana Frontend**.
    7. The **Grafana Frontend** updates the UI to reflect the changes.

*   **Add Data Source:**
    1. The user configures a new data source through the **Web Browser**.
    2. The **Grafana Frontend** sends an API request (typically a POST request) to the **API Server** to add the new data source.
    3. The **API Server** verifies the user's authorization with the **Authentication & Authorization** component.
    4. If authorized, the **API Server** instructs the **Provisioning Service** to handle the data source configuration.
    5. The **Provisioning Service** persists the data source configuration in the **Grafana Database**.
    6. The **API Server** sends a success response to the **Grafana Frontend**.
    7. The **Grafana Frontend** updates the UI to reflect the newly added data source.

## 7. Deployment Considerations

Grafana's deployment options significantly impact its security posture.

*   **Standalone Binary:** Simplest deployment, but requires careful management of the host operating system's security.
*   **Docker Container:** Provides isolation and simplifies deployment, but requires securing the Docker environment and image.
*   **Kubernetes:** Offers scalability and resilience, but introduces complexities in securing the Kubernetes cluster and its components.
