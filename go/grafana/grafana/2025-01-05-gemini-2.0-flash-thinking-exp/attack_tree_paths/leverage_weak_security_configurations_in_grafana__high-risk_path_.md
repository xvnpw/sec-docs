    * **Reputational Damage:** Publicly visible sensitive information can harm the organization's reputation.
    * **Denial of Service (Potential):**  Manipulation or deletion of critical dashboards can disrupt monitoring and alerting.

**3. Exploiting Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**

* **Description:**  Without MFA, compromised credentials (through phishing, data breaches, etc.) provide direct access to Grafana.
* **Attack Steps:**
    * **Credential Acquisition:** Obtain valid Grafana credentials through various means (phishing, credential stuffing, etc.).
    * **Login Attempt:** Use the acquired credentials to log in without a secondary authentication factor.
    * **Successful Login:** Gain access to the targeted user's account.
* **Impact:** Depends on the compromised user's privileges:
    * **Read-only access:**  Data exfiltration, monitoring of sensitive information.
    * **Editor access:**  Dashboard manipulation, data source modification.
    * **Admin access:** Full control as described in point 1.

**4. Exploiting Weak API Key Management:**

* **Description:** Grafana uses API keys for programmatic access. Weak management practices, such as storing keys in insecure locations (e.g., code repositories, configuration files without proper encryption) or using overly permissive key scopes, can be exploited.
* **Attack Steps:**
    * **Key Discovery:** Find exposed API keys.
    * **API Abuse:** Use the discovered keys to interact with the Grafana API, potentially performing actions beyond the intended scope.
* **Impact:** Depends on the API key's permissions:
    * **Read access:** Data exfiltration.
    * **Write access:** Data modification, user management, plugin installation.

**5. Leveraging Insecure Plugin Management:**

* **Description:** Grafana's plugin ecosystem expands its functionality, but outdated or vulnerable plugins can introduce security risks. Also, allowing installation of unsigned or untrusted plugins can be dangerous.
* **Attack Steps:**
    * **Identify Vulnerable Plugins:** Discover Grafana instances using outdated or known vulnerable plugins.
    * **Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities:** Utilize known exploits for the identified plugins to gain access or execute arbitrary code.
    * **Install Malicious Plugins (if allowed):**  Upload and install plugins containing backdoors or malicious functionality.
* **Impact:**
    * **Remote Code Execution:** Gain control over the Grafana server.
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Access sensitive data stored within Grafana or connected data sources.
    * **System Compromise:** Potentially pivot to other systems within the network.

**6. Exploiting Misconfigured Data Sources:**

* **Description:** If data sources are configured with overly permissive credentials or lack proper access controls, attackers can leverage Grafana to access and potentially manipulate the underlying data.
* **Attack Steps:**
    * **Identify Data Sources:** Access Grafana and identify configured data sources.
    * **Leverage Grafana's Access:** Use Grafana's connection to the data source to query or manipulate data beyond the intended scope.
* **Impact:**
    * **Data Breach:** Access and exfiltrate sensitive data from connected databases or services.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Modify or delete data within connected systems.
    * **Lateral Movement:** Potentially gain access to other systems through compromised data source credentials.

**7. Lack of HTTPS Enforcement or Misconfigured TLS:**

* **Description:**  Not enforcing HTTPS or using weak TLS configurations exposes communication between the user's browser and the Grafana server to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
* **Attack Steps:**
    * **Network Sniffing:** Intercept unencrypted traffic between the user and the Grafana server.
    * **Credential Theft:** Capture login credentials transmitted over an insecure connection.
    * **Session Hijacking:** Steal session cookies to gain unauthorized access.
* **Impact:**
    * **Credential Compromise:**  Directly obtain usernames and passwords.
    * **Account Takeover:** Gain access to user accounts without knowing the credentials.
    * **Data Interception:**  Read sensitive information displayed on dashboards.

**8. Exposed Configuration Files:**

* **Description:** If Grafana's configuration files (e.g., `grafana.ini`) are accessible due to misconfigured web servers or file permissions, attackers can extract sensitive information like database credentials, secret keys, or API keys.
* **Attack Steps:**
    * **Discovery:** Identify publicly accessible configuration files.
    * **Information Extraction:**  Read the configuration files to obtain sensitive data.
* **Impact:**
    * **Credential Compromise:** Access database credentials or other secrets.
    * **Full System Compromise:**  Potentially gain access to underlying systems using extracted credentials.
