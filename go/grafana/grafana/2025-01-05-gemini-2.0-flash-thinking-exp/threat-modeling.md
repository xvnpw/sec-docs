# Threat Model Analysis for grafana/grafana

## Threat: [Data Source Credential Exposure](./threats/data_source_credential_exposure.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Source Credential Exposure
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in Grafana's configuration storage or intercept network traffic to retrieve stored data source credentials. This could involve accessing configuration files, database dumps, or exploiting API endpoints *within Grafana* that inadvertently expose these credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of backend systems, data breaches, unauthorized data modification or deletion, potential for further lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Component:** Data Source Configuration, Provisioning System, API (specifically endpoints related to data source management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Grafana's secrets management features for storing data source credentials.
        *   Encrypt Grafana's configuration files and database.
        *   Implement strong access controls for Grafana's configuration files and database.
        *   Regularly audit data source configurations and permissions *within Grafana*.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for data source access *within Grafana*.
        *   Secure network communication channels to prevent interception of credentials.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Execution](./threats/malicious_plugin_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker could install a malicious or compromised Grafana plugin. This plugin could then execute arbitrary code on the Grafana server, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, manipulating Grafana's configuration, or using the server as a pivot point for further attacks. This threat is directly tied to Grafana's plugin architecture.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Grafana server, potential compromise of connected systems, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Plugin System, Backend Services, potentially all components depending on the plugin's capabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install plugins from trusted and verified sources.
        *   Implement a plugin review and approval process.
        *   Utilize Grafana's plugin signature verification features if available.
        *   Regularly update plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor plugin behavior and resource usage.
        *   Implement strong isolation for plugin execution if possible.

## Threat: [API Access Control Bypass](./threats/api_access_control_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** API Access Control Bypass
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in Grafana's API authentication or authorization mechanisms to bypass access controls. This could allow them to perform actions they are not authorized for, such as creating/modifying dashboards, managing users, or accessing sensitive data *through the Grafana API*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Grafana functionalities, data breaches, manipulation of monitoring data, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** API Framework, Authentication and Authorization Modules, specific API endpoints.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Grafana updated to patch known API vulnerabilities.
        *   Enforce strong authentication mechanisms for API access (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
        *   Implement robust authorization checks on all API endpoints.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting API access.
        *   Regularly audit API access logs and permissions.
        *   Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on API endpoints.

## Threat: [Alert Manipulation](./threats/alert_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Alert Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to Grafana's alerting system and manipulate alert rules, notification channels, or silence alerts. This is a threat directly related to Grafana's alerting functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Delayed detection of security incidents, masking of malicious activity, potential for further damage due to delayed response.
    *   **Affected Component:** Alerting Engine, Notification Channels, Alert Rule Management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure access to Grafana's alerting configuration with strong authentication and authorization.
        *   Implement logging and auditing of alert rule changes and notifications.
        *   Consider using external systems for alert management and verification.
        *   Regularly review and validate alert configurations.
