## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Grafana (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_grafana__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node signifies a breach in the application's security posture due to weaknesses in its Grafana integration or the Grafana instance itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Grafana Core (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_grafana_core__high-risk_path_.md)

This path involves directly targeting flaws within the Grafana codebase.
    *   Attack vectors include exploiting known vulnerabilities (CVEs) or discovering and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities.
    *   Success can lead to critical outcomes like Remote Code Execution or Authentication Bypass.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Grafana CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_grafana_cves__common_vulnerabilities_and_exposures___critical_node_.md)

This focuses on leveraging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Grafana.
    *   Attackers often utilize readily available exploit code, making this a significant threat if systems are not promptly patched.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Exploit Unpatched Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_unpatched_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

This involves finding instances of Grafana running vulnerable versions that have not been updated with security patches.
    *   Attackers scan for these vulnerable instances and then deploy exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce___critical_node_.md)

A successful RCE exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the Grafana server.
    *   This provides a high degree of control and can be used to access sensitive data, pivot to other systems, or disrupt operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication Bypass (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_bypass__critical_node_.md)

Circumventing Grafana's authentication mechanisms allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access without valid credentials.
    *   This grants access to sensitive dashboards, configurations, and potentially the ability to manipulate the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Grafana's Features for Malicious Purposes (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_grafana's_features_for_malicious_purposes__high-risk_path_.md)

This path involves abusing legitimate Grafana functionalities for malicious ends, rather than exploiting underlying code flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Source Configurations (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_source_configurations__critical_node_.md)

Grafana connects to various data sources. If these connections are misconfigured or credentials are weak, attackers can gain access to the underlying data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Data Source Credentials (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_data_source_credentials__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers attempt to steal or guess the credentials used by Grafana to connect to data sources.
    *   Success provides direct access to the data, potentially allowing for exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Dashboard Configurations (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_dashboard_configurations__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers with sufficient privileges can modify dashboards to inject malicious content.
    *   This can include injecting JavaScript to steal credentials or redirect users to phishing sites, or embedding iframes to serve malware.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Grafana API (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_grafana_api__high-risk_path_.md)

Grafana exposes an API for programmatic interaction. If this API is not properly secured, attackers can exploit authentication or authorization flaws.
    *   This can allow them to perform unauthorized actions, access sensitive data, or disrupt the service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Weak Security Configurations in Grafana (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_weak_security_configurations_in_grafana__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting common misconfigurations in Grafana deployments.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Credentials (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/default_credentials__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

Failing to change the default administrator password is a critical security oversight.
    *   Attackers can easily gain full control of Grafana with these known credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Authentication Settings (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_authentication_settings__critical_node_.md)

Weak password policies or the absence of multi-factor authentication significantly increase the risk of account compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Password Policies (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/weak_password_policies__high-risk_path_.md)

If password requirements are weak, attackers can use brute-force or dictionary attacks to guess user credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_multi-factor_authentication__mfa___high-risk_path_.md)

Without MFA, compromised credentials provide direct access to an account, making account takeover significantly easier.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Points Between Grafana and the Application (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_points_between_grafana_and_the_application__high-risk_path_.md)

This path targets the interfaces and connections between Grafana and the application it's monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Shared Authentication Mechanisms (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_shared_authentication_mechanisms__high-risk_path_.md)

If Grafana and the application share authentication systems, compromising credentials for one can grant access to the other.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Shared Credentials (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_shared_credentials__critical_node_.md)

Successfully obtaining credentials that are used for both Grafana and the application provides a direct pathway to compromising both systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Integrations (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_integrations__high-risk_path_.md)

If Grafana integrates with the application through APIs, vulnerabilities in either the Grafana side of the integration or the application's API endpoints can be exploited.
