# Attack Surface Analysis for grafana/grafana

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials.md)

**Description:** Grafana, upon initial installation, often has default administrative credentials. If these are not changed, attackers can easily gain full control.

**How Grafana Contributes:** Grafana ships with predefined default usernames (e.g., `admin`) and passwords (e.g., `admin`).

**Example:** An attacker uses the default `admin/admin` credentials to log into a publicly accessible Grafana instance.

**Impact:** Full administrative access to Grafana, allowing modification of dashboards, data sources, users, and potentially the underlying server.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Immediately change the default administrator password upon initial setup.
*   Enforce strong password policies for all users.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Data Source Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_data_source_credentials.md)

**Description:** Grafana needs to store credentials to connect to various data sources. If stored insecurely, these credentials can be compromised.

**How Grafana Contributes:** Grafana stores data source credentials in its configuration database or files. If not properly encrypted or protected, they are vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the Grafana server's filesystem and retrieves plaintext data source credentials from the `grafana.ini` file.

**Impact:** Compromise of connected data sources, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or denial of service on those systems.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize Grafana's built-in secret management features for storing sensitive credentials.
*   Encrypt the Grafana configuration database or files at rest.
*   Limit access to the Grafana server's filesystem.
*   Avoid storing credentials directly in configuration files where possible, opting for environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions.

## Attack Surface: [Third-Party Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/third-party_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Grafana's extensibility through plugins introduces risk if these plugins contain security vulnerabilities.

**How Grafana Contributes:** Grafana's architecture allows users to install and run plugins developed by third parties, whose security practices may vary.

**Example:** A vulnerable plugin allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript into dashboards, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against other users.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting, potential for session hijacking, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the Grafana instance.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only install trusted plugins from reputable sources.
*   Regularly update plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Review plugin permissions and only grant necessary access.
*   Consider using a plugin security scanner if available.

## Attack Surface: [API Key Compromise](./attack_surfaces/api_key_compromise.md)

**Description:** Grafana allows the creation of API keys for programmatic access. If these keys are compromised, attackers can perform actions on behalf of the key owner.

**How Grafana Contributes:** Grafana provides a mechanism to generate API keys with varying levels of permissions.

**Example:** An API key is accidentally committed to a public Git repository, allowing an attacker to use it to create or modify dashboards.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to Grafana's API, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification of dashboards and alerts, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Treat API keys as sensitive secrets.
*   Store API keys securely and avoid embedding them directly in code.
*   Implement proper access control and least privilege principles for API keys.
*   Regularly rotate API keys.
*   Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Data Source Query Injection via Variables](./attack_surfaces/data_source_query_injection_via_variables.md)

**Description:** If user-provided input (e.g., through dashboard variables) is not properly sanitized before being used in data source queries, it can lead to injection vulnerabilities.

**How Grafana Contributes:** Grafana allows users to define variables that can be used within data source queries. If not handled carefully, this can introduce injection points.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious variable value that, when used in a SQL query, allows them to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the connected database.

**Impact:** Potential for unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion in the connected data source.

**Risk Severity:** **High** (depending on the permissions of the Grafana data source user)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly sanitize and validate user input used in variables.
*   Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements in data source configurations where supported.
*   Grant Grafana data source users the least privileges necessary.
