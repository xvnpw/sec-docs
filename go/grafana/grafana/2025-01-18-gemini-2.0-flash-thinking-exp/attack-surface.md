# Attack Surface Analysis for grafana/grafana

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Dashboard Elements](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_dashboard_elements.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into dashboard elements like panel titles, descriptions, or text panels. When other users view the dashboard, these scripts execute in their browsers.
    *   **How Grafana Contributes:** Grafana's rendering engine processes and displays user-supplied content within dashboards. If this process lacks proper sanitization, it becomes a direct pathway for XSS attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a panel title containing `<script>stealCookies();</script>`. When a user views this dashboard, their session cookies are sent to the attacker's server.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise (session hijacking), defacement of dashboards, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust and context-aware output encoding for all user-supplied data rendered in dashboards. Utilize security libraries specifically designed for XSS prevention. Regularly audit and update sanitization logic.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Grafana Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_grafana_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Third-party plugins can introduce vulnerabilities due to insecure coding practices, outdated dependencies, or a lack of thorough security testing.
    *   **How Grafana Contributes:** Grafana's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality, making it a core feature. However, the security of these plugins directly impacts the overall security of the Grafana instance. Grafana's plugin marketplace acts as a distribution point, and the security of listed plugins is paramount.
    *   **Example:** A data source plugin might contain an SQL injection vulnerability. Through a crafted dashboard, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the connected database.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, remote code execution on the Grafana server, denial of service, compromise of connected systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement rigorous security review processes for all plugins before making them available in the marketplace. Provide clear security guidelines and tools for plugin developers. Establish a robust vulnerability reporting and patching mechanism for plugins. Consider code signing for plugins to ensure integrity.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in Grafana's core authentication or authorization mechanisms could allow attackers to bypass login procedures or gain unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **How Grafana Contributes:** Grafana is responsible for managing user authentication and authorization to control access to dashboards, data sources, and administrative functions. Vulnerabilities in this core functionality directly compromise the security of the entire application.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the session management logic could allow an attacker to hijack another user's active session without needing their credentials. Alternatively, a flaw in the role-based access control (RBAC) system could allow a standard user to access administrative API endpoints.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of dashboards and configurations, account takeover, potential for lateral movement and further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust and well-tested authentication and authorization mechanisms adhering to security best practices. Regularly audit the codebase for potential authentication and authorization flaws. Enforce strong password policies and mandate multi-factor authentication (MFA). Implement proper session management techniques, including secure session ID generation and protection against session fixation.

## Attack Surface: [Data Source Credential Exposure](./attack_surfaces/data_source_credential_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** If Grafana stores data source credentials insecurely, attackers who gain access to the Grafana server or its underlying data store could potentially retrieve these credentials.
    *   **How Grafana Contributes:** Grafana needs to store credentials to connect to various backend data sources. The method and security of this storage are directly within Grafana's control and design.
    *   **Example:** Data source credentials might be stored in plain text within the `grafana.ini` configuration file or the Grafana database. An attacker gaining unauthorized access to the server's file system or the database could easily retrieve these credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches from connected data sources, unauthorized access to external systems, potential for further compromise of connected infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement secure credential storage mechanisms, such as encryption at rest using industry-standard encryption algorithms. Avoid storing credentials in plain text in configuration files or the database. Integrate with secrets management solutions for secure credential handling.

## Attack Surface: [API Endpoint Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoint_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Grafana's API endpoints could allow attackers to perform unauthorized actions, access sensitive data, or cause denial of service.
    *   **How Grafana Contributes:** Grafana exposes a comprehensive API for managing various aspects of the application. The security of these API endpoints is directly determined by Grafana's development and implementation.
    *   **Example:** An API endpoint responsible for creating users might lack proper input validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious data that could lead to privilege escalation. Another example is an API endpoint without proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized users to modify dashboard configurations.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, modification of Grafana configurations, denial of service, potential for further attacks on connected systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement thorough input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints. Enforce strict authentication and authorization for all API requests. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks. Regularly audit API endpoints for security vulnerabilities and adhere to secure API development best practices.
