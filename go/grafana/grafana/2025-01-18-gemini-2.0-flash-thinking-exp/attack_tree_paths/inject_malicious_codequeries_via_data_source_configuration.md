**Attack Tree Path:** Inject Malicious Code/Queries via Data Source Configuration

**Description:** Attackers attempt to inject malicious code or queries into the configuration of data sources within Grafana. This can lead to unauthorized data access, manipulation, or even remote code execution depending on the data source type and its capabilities.

**Sub-Path 1: Compromise Existing Data Source Credentials**

* **Description:** Attackers gain access to valid credentials for an existing data source configured within Grafana. This allows them to modify the data source configuration, potentially injecting malicious queries or code that will be executed by Grafana when interacting with that data source.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Phishing Attacks Targeting Administrators:**  Deceiving Grafana administrators into revealing their data source credentials through emails, fake login pages, or other social engineering techniques.
    * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the Data Source System:**  Targeting weaknesses in the underlying database, API, or other system that the data source connects to. This could involve SQL injection, API vulnerabilities, or unpatched software.
    * **Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force Attacks:**  Attempting to log in with known or commonly used credentials, or systematically trying various combinations until successful. This is more likely if weak or default passwords are used.
    * **Insider Threats:**  Malicious or negligent insiders with access to data source credentials could intentionally compromise them.
    * **Compromised Administrator Workstations:** If an administrator's workstation is compromised, attackers might be able to retrieve stored credentials or intercept them during use.

* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Data Exfiltration:**  Injecting malicious queries to extract sensitive data from the compromised data source.
    * **Data Manipulation:**  Modifying or deleting data within the data source, leading to inaccurate dashboards and reports, or even operational disruptions.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Injecting queries that overload the data source, making it unavailable for legitimate Grafana operations and potentially impacting other applications relying on the same data source.
    * **Lateral Movement:**  Using the compromised data source as a pivot point to access other systems within the network, especially if the data source has broader network access.
    * **Remote Code Execution (Potentially):**  Depending on the data source type and its capabilities (e.g., some databases allow stored procedures or user-defined functions), attackers might be able to execute arbitrary code on the data source server.

* **Attacker Skills and Resources:**
    * **Social Engineering Skills:** For phishing attacks.
    * **Vulnerability Research and Exploitation Skills:** For exploiting data source vulnerabilities.
    * **Password Cracking Tools and Techniques:** For brute-force attacks.
    * **Knowledge of Data Source Query Languages (e.g., SQL):** To craft malicious queries.
    * **Understanding of Grafana's Data Source Configuration:** To identify where and how to inject malicious code or queries.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strong Password Policies and Enforcement:**  Mandating complex and unique passwords for data source accounts.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Enabling MFA for data source accounts to add an extra layer of security.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Identifying vulnerabilities in data source systems and Grafana configurations.
    * **Patch Management:**  Keeping data source systems and Grafana up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    * **Network Segmentation:**  Limiting network access to data sources from Grafana servers and other authorized systems.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  While Grafana itself might not directly handle data source input in this context, ensuring the data source itself has robust input validation is crucial.
    * **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implementing monitoring for suspicious activity on data source accounts and within Grafana's data source configurations.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Granting only necessary permissions to data source accounts used by Grafana.

**Sub-Path 2: Add Malicious Data Source**

* **Description:** Attackers, having compromised a Grafana administrator account, add a completely new data source under their control. This allows them to feed malicious data into Grafana dashboards, potentially misleading users or even triggering client-side vulnerabilities if the data is rendered without proper sanitization.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Compromised Grafana Administrator Account:** This is the primary prerequisite for this attack. The administrator account could be compromised through:
        * **Phishing Attacks Targeting Grafana Administrators:** Similar to the previous sub-path, but targeting Grafana admins.
        * **Brute-Force Attacks on Grafana Login:**  Attempting to guess administrator credentials.
        * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Grafana:**  Leveraging security flaws in Grafana itself to gain unauthorized access.
        * **Credential Reuse:**  Administrators using the same credentials across multiple platforms.
        * **Insider Threats:**  Malicious or negligent insiders with administrator privileges.

* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Misleading Dashboards and Reports:**  Displaying fabricated or manipulated data, leading to incorrect business decisions or a false sense of security.
    * **Client-Side Attacks:**  Injecting malicious scripts or code within the data served by the malicious data source. When Grafana renders this data in dashboards, it could execute the malicious code in the user's browser, potentially leading to:
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Stealing cookies, session tokens, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
        * **Information Disclosure:**  Accessing sensitive information within the user's browser.
        * **Drive-by Downloads:**  Silently downloading malware onto the user's machine.
    * **Phishing Attacks via Dashboards:**  Creating dashboards that mimic legitimate interfaces to trick users into entering sensitive information.
    * **Resource Consumption:**  The malicious data source could be designed to consume excessive resources on the Grafana server or the user's browser.

* **Attacker Skills and Resources:**
    * **Skills to Compromise Grafana Administrator Accounts:**  As detailed in the "Attack Vectors" above.
    * **Knowledge of Grafana's Data Source Configuration:**  Understanding how to add and configure new data sources.
    * **Ability to Set Up and Control a Malicious Data Source:**  This could involve setting up a fake API, a compromised database, or any other data source type supported by Grafana.
    * **Web Development Skills (for Client-Side Attacks):**  Knowledge of JavaScript and web security vulnerabilities like XSS.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strong Password Policies and Enforcement for Grafana Administrators:**  Mandating complex and unique passwords.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Grafana Administrators:**  Crucial for preventing unauthorized access.
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Limiting administrator privileges to only those who absolutely need them.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing of Grafana:**  Identifying vulnerabilities in the Grafana application itself.
    * **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**  Grafana should properly sanitize and encode data received from data sources before rendering it in dashboards to prevent client-side attacks.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implementing CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating XSS risks.
    * **Regular Review of Data Source Configurations:**  Monitoring for the addition of unexpected or suspicious data sources.
    * **Audit Logging:**  Maintaining detailed logs of all actions performed within Grafana, including data source modifications.
