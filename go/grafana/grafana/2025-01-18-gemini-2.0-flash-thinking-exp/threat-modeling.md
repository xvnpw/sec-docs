# Threat Model Analysis for grafana/grafana

## Threat: [Default Administrator Credentials](./threats/default_administrator_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to log in to Grafana using the default administrator username (usually "admin") and password. If successful, they gain full administrative control over the Grafana instance.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Grafana instance, including access to all dashboards, data sources, user information, and the ability to modify or delete anything. This could lead to data breaches, service disruption, and manipulation of monitoring data.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Module, User Management

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Force a password change upon the first login for the default administrator account.
*   Clearly document the importance of changing default credentials during installation and setup.
*   Consider disabling the default administrator account after creating a new administrative user.

## Threat: [Data Source Credential Exposure](./threats/data_source_credential_exposure.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the stored credentials used by Grafana to connect to data sources. This could happen through unauthorized access to the Grafana server's file system, database, or through vulnerabilities in Grafana's credential management. With these credentials, the attacker can directly access and potentially manipulate the underlying data sources.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in connected data sources. This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or deletion of critical information, depending on the permissions of the compromised credentials.

**Affected Component:** Data Source Management, Credential Storage

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Encrypt data source credentials at rest within Grafana's configuration or database.
*   Utilize secure credential management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) and integrate them with Grafana.
*   Implement strict access controls on the Grafana server and database to prevent unauthorized access.
*   Regularly rotate data source credentials.
*   Minimize the permissions granted to Grafana's data source connections to the least privilege necessary.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

**Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges (e.g., Grafana administrator) installs a malicious plugin. This plugin could contain code designed to steal data, compromise the Grafana server, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the Grafana application.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the Grafana instance and potentially the underlying server. This could lead to data theft, service disruption, and the introduction of backdoors for persistent access.

**Affected Component:** Plugin Management, Plugin Execution Environment

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict controls over who can install plugins.
*   Only install plugins from trusted sources (e.g., the official Grafana plugin repository).
*   Implement a process for reviewing and vetting plugins before installation.
*   Consider using a plugin signing mechanism to verify the authenticity and integrity of plugins.
*   Regularly audit installed plugins.

## Threat: [SQL Injection in Data Source Queries](./threats/sql_injection_in_data_source_queries.md)

**Description:** If Grafana allows users to define custom queries against data sources (e.g., in Explore mode or through variable queries) without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code. This code could be executed against the underlying database, potentially allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, or potential compromise of the database server. The severity depends on the permissions of the Grafana's database user.

**Affected Component:** Data Source Proxy, Query Execution Engine

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with data sources.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for user-provided query components.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to Grafana's database user, limiting its permissions.
*   Regularly scan for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
