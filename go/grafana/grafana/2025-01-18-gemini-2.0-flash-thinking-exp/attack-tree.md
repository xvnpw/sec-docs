## Attack Tree Path: [[!] Exploit Grafana Data Source Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_!__exploit_grafana_data_source_vulnerabilities.md)

This critical area focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how Grafana interacts with its data sources. Attackers aim to manipulate data retrieval or gain unauthorized access to the underlying data systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [[!] Compromise Grafana Admin Account](./attack_tree_paths/_!__compromise_grafana_admin_account.md)

Gaining administrative access to Grafana is a highly critical objective for attackers. This level of access allows for widespread manipulation of Grafana's configuration, data sources, dashboards, and users, enabling a wide range of attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[!] Exploit Grafana Dashboard Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/_!__exploit_grafana_dashboard_functionality.md)

Dashboards are interactive elements within Grafana, and vulnerabilities here can be exploited to inject malicious content or manipulate user interactions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[!] Exploit Grafana Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_!__exploit_grafana_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

Grafana's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality, but vulnerabilities in these plugins can provide attackers with direct access to the Grafana server and its resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [[!] Exploit Grafana User Management and Authentication Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/_!__exploit_grafana_user_management_and_authentication_weaknesses.md)

Weaknesses in user management and authentication mechanisms provide attackers with entry points to access Grafana without proper authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [[!] Compromise Grafana Editor Account](./attack_tree_paths/_!__compromise_grafana_editor_account.md)

While not as powerful as an admin account, compromising an editor account allows attackers to modify dashboards and alerts, potentially disrupting monitoring and injecting malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Inject Malicious Code/Queries via Data Source Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_codequeries_via_data_source_configuration.md)

Attackers attempt to inject malicious code or queries into the configuration of data sources within Grafana. This can involve:
    *   **Compromise Existing Data Source Credentials:** Obtaining valid credentials for a data source to modify its configuration. This can be achieved through phishing attacks targeting administrators or exploiting vulnerabilities in the data source system itself.
    *   **Add Malicious Data Source:**  Adding a completely new, attacker-controlled data source to Grafana. This requires compromising a Grafana admin account.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Exploit Query Language Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_query_language_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers craft malicious queries within Grafana dashboards or alerts that are then executed against the underlying data source. This can involve:
    *   **SQL Injection:** Injecting malicious SQL code into queries targeting SQL-based data sources.
    *   **NoSQL Injection:** Injecting malicious code into queries targeting NoSQL databases.
    *   **PromQL Injection:** Injecting malicious PromQL queries when using Prometheus as a data source.
    *   **Other Data Source Specific Injection:** Exploiting injection vulnerabilities specific to other data source query languages.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Inject Malicious Content via Dashboard Elements](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_content_via_dashboard_elements.md)

Attackers inject malicious content into dashboard elements, primarily targeting users who view these dashboards. This often involves:
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Text Panels, HTML Panels, etc.:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into dashboard elements that is then executed in the browsers of users viewing the dashboard. This can be achieved by storing malicious JavaScript within the dashboard configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Grafana Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_installed_grafana_plugins.md)

Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities within Grafana plugins. This can involve:
    *   **Utilize Known Vulnerabilities in Specific Plugins:** Exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific versions of Grafana plugins.
    *   **Exploit Unpatched or Outdated Plugins:** Targeting plugins that have known vulnerabilities but have not been updated to the latest secure versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Compromise Grafana User Accounts](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_grafana_user_accounts.md)

Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access to Grafana user accounts. This can be achieved through:
    *   **Brute-Force or Credential Stuffing Attacks:**  Attempting to guess user passwords or using lists of compromised credentials from other breaches.
    *   **Phishing Attacks Targeting Grafana Users:** Deceiving users into revealing their login credentials through fake login pages or emails.
    *   **Exploiting Default or Weak Passwords:**  Taking advantage of default or easily guessable passwords that have not been changed.
