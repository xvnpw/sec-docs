*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Dashboard and Panel Elements**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into dashboard elements (like panel titles, descriptions, text panels) that are then executed in the browsers of other users viewing the dashboard.
    *   **How Grafana Contributes:** Grafana's rendering engine for dashboards and panels does not adequately sanitize user-provided content in panel titles, descriptions, and text panels before displaying it to other users.
    *   **Example:** An attacker creates a panel with a title containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When another user views this dashboard, the script executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and output encoding on the Grafana server-side for all user-provided content rendered in dashboards and panels. Utilize context-aware escaping techniques.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about importing dashboards from untrusted sources. Report any suspicious dashboard content to administrators.

*   **Malicious Plugin Installation and Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can install malicious plugins or exploit vulnerabilities in existing plugins to compromise the Grafana instance or the underlying system.
    *   **How Grafana Contributes:** Grafana's plugin architecture allows for the extension of its functionality through third-party plugins. If plugin installation is not strictly controlled or if plugins contain security flaws, it introduces risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a plugin containing a backdoor that allows remote code execution on the Grafana server.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict plugin verification and signing mechanisms. Provide clear guidelines and security best practices for plugin developers. Regularly audit and review popular plugins for vulnerabilities.
        *   **Users:** Only install plugins from trusted sources. Carefully review plugin permissions before installation. Keep plugins updated to the latest versions. Consider disabling unused plugins.

*   **API Key Exposure and Abuse**
    *   **Description:** Grafana API keys, if exposed or not properly managed, can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to Grafana's API and perform actions on behalf of legitimate users.
    *   **How Grafana Contributes:** Grafana relies on API keys for programmatic access. Weak key generation, storage, or management practices within Grafana or by users can lead to exposure.
    *   **Example:** An API key is accidentally committed to a public code repository. An attacker finds the key and uses it to create new users with administrative privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; account takeover; denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement secure API key generation and storage mechanisms. Encourage the use of scoped API keys with least privilege. Provide clear guidance on secure API key management.
        *   **Users:** Store API keys securely (e.g., using secrets management tools). Avoid hardcoding API keys in code or configuration files. Regularly rotate API keys. Use scoped API keys with minimal necessary permissions.

*   **Data Source Connection String Injection**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate data source connection strings if user input is not properly sanitized, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the underlying data source.
    *   **How Grafana Contributes:** Grafana allows users to configure data sources, and if the process of handling and validating connection details is flawed, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious data source configuration that includes SQL injection commands within the connection string, targeting the database.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data in the connected data source, data manipulation, potential for remote code execution on the data source server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all data source connection parameters. Avoid constructing connection strings dynamically using user-provided input. Use secure methods for storing and retrieving credentials.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious when configuring data sources, especially when importing configurations from untrusted sources. Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring data source access.

*   **Privilege Escalation through Role Manipulation or Authorization Flaws**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in Grafana's role-based access control (RBAC) system to elevate their privileges and gain unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities or data.
    *   **How Grafana Contributes:**  Flaws in the design or implementation of Grafana's user and permission management system can allow for unintended privilege escalation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker with "Viewer" role exploits a vulnerability to grant themselves "Admin" privileges within an organization.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of critical configurations, account takeover, potential for further system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement a robust and well-tested RBAC system. Follow the principle of least privilege. Conduct thorough security reviews and penetration testing of the authorization mechanisms.
        *   **Users:** Regularly review user roles and permissions within Grafana organizations. Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication.
