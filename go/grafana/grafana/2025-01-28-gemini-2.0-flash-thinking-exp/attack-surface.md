# Attack Surface Analysis for grafana/grafana

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Using default credentials for the administrator account.
*   **Grafana Contribution:** Grafana often defaults to `admin/admin` for the initial administrator account.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a Grafana instance by using the default `admin/admin` credentials after the instance is deployed without changing them.
*   **Impact:** Full administrative access to Grafana, allowing attackers to control dashboards, data sources, users, and potentially the underlying server.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Immediately change the default `admin` password upon initial Grafana setup.
    *   Enforce strong password policies for all users.
    *   Consider disabling the default `admin` account after creating a new administrative user.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Dashboards](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_dashboards.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious JavaScript code into dashboards that executes in the browsers of users viewing the dashboard.
*   **Grafana Contribution:** Grafana dashboards allow users to input various data, including panel titles, descriptions, annotations, and template variables, which if not properly sanitized, can be exploited for XSS.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a panel title. When another user views the dashboard, the script executes, potentially stealing session cookies or redirecting the user to a malicious site.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, defacement of dashboards, redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-supplied data within dashboards.
    *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
    *   Regularly audit dashboards for potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Data Source Injection](./attack_surfaces/data_source_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting insufficient input validation when configuring data sources to inject malicious connection strings or queries.
*   **Grafana Contribution:** Grafana allows users to configure connections to various data sources. If input validation is weak, attackers can manipulate connection parameters.
*   **Example:** An attacker, with permissions to add data sources, injects malicious SQL into the connection string for a database data source. This could lead to unauthorized data access or command execution on the database server.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend data sources, data breaches, command execution on backend systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all data source configuration parameters.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with data sources to prevent SQL injection.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to manage data sources.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication/Authorization Issues](./attack_surfaces/api_authenticationauthorization_issues.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in Grafana's API authentication or authorization mechanisms allowing unauthorized access to API endpoints.
*   **Grafana Contribution:** Grafana exposes a powerful API for management and data retrieval. Vulnerabilities in API security can lead to broad access.
*   **Example:** An attacker bypasses API authentication due to a flaw in the authentication logic and gains access to sensitive API endpoints to retrieve user data or modify configurations.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, configuration changes, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong authentication mechanisms for the Grafana API (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
    *   Implement robust authorization controls to restrict API access based on user roles and permissions.
    *   Regularly audit API access logs for suspicious activity.
    *   Disable or restrict access to API endpoints that are not strictly necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities (Potentially High/Critical)](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities__potentially_highcritical_.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities present in third-party Grafana plugins.
*   **Grafana Contribution:** Grafana's plugin architecture allows for extending functionality, but relies on the security of third-party code.
*   **Example:** A vulnerable plugin contains a critical remote code execution flaw. An attacker exploits this flaw to gain complete control of the Grafana server.
*   **Impact:** Server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, complete system takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High to Critical** (depending on the vulnerability and plugin functionality)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only install plugins from trusted sources and the official Grafana plugin repository.
    *   Regularly update plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Perform security assessments of plugins before deployment, especially for critical plugins.
    *   Minimize the number of installed plugins to reduce the attack surface.
