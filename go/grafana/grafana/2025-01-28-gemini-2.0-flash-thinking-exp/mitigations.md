# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for grafana/grafana

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Dashboards and Folders](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__for_dashboards_and_folders.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User Roles:** Define distinct user roles within your organization that interact with Grafana (e.g., Viewer, Editor, Admin, Security Team).
    2.  **Map Roles to Permissions:** Determine the necessary permissions for each role within Grafana.  Viewers should only be able to view dashboards, Editors should be able to create and modify dashboards within their scope, and Admins should have full control.
    3.  **Configure Grafana RBAC:**  Utilize Grafana's built-in RBAC system (accessible through the Grafana UI under "Server Admin" -> "Users & Teams" -> "Roles") to create and configure these roles.
    4.  **Assign Users to Roles:**  Assign users to the appropriate roles based on their responsibilities within Grafana user management.
    5.  **Apply Folder and Dashboard Permissions:**  Set permissions on folders and individual dashboards within Grafana to restrict access based on roles. Ensure sensitive dashboards are only accessible to authorized roles through Grafana's permission settings.
    6.  **Regularly Review Roles and Permissions:** Periodically review and adjust roles and permissions within Grafana as organizational needs and user responsibilities change.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access - Severity: High
    *   Data Breaches due to Accidental Exposure - Severity: High
    *   Unauthorized Dashboard Modification - Severity: Medium

*   **Currently Implemented:** Unknown - Input validation for Grafana API requests is likely partially implemented by default Grafana framework, but a comprehensive and explicit input validation strategy might be missing.
    *   Implemented in: Potentially default Grafana framework validation.
*   **Missing Implementation:** A comprehensive and explicit input validation strategy for Grafana API requests needs to be implemented and tested.  Specific validation rules for each API endpoint should be defined and enforced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Features and Services in Grafana](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_features_and_services_in_grafana.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Enabled Features and Services in Grafana:** Review the list of enabled features and services in Grafana configuration.
    2.  **Identify Unnecessary Features and Services in Grafana:** Identify any Grafana features or services that are not required for your application's functionality or are not actively used.
    3.  **Disable Unnecessary Features and Services in Grafana Configuration:** Disable the identified unnecessary features and services in Grafana's configuration files or settings.
    4.  **Regularly Audit Enabled Features and Services in Grafana:** Periodically audit the list of enabled features and services in Grafana to ensure only necessary components are active.
    5.  **Document Enabled/Disabled Features Policy for Grafana:** Document a policy outlining which Grafana features and services should be enabled or disabled based on security and functional requirements.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Increased Attack Surface due to Unnecessary Features - Severity: Medium
    *   Potential Vulnerabilities in Unused Features - Severity: Medium
    *   Resource Consumption by Unnecessary Services - Severity: Low
*   **Impact:**
    *   Increased Attack Surface due to Unnecessary Features: Moderately Reduces
    *   Potential Vulnerabilities in Unused Features: Moderately Reduces
    *   Resource Consumption by Unnecessary Services: Slightly Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** No - No systematic review and disabling of unnecessary features and services in Grafana is in place.
    *   Implemented in: None.
*   **Missing Implementation:** A process for regularly reviewing and disabling unnecessary features and services in Grafana needs to be implemented. A policy for enabled/disabled features should also be documented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Subscribe to Grafana Security Advisories](./mitigation_strategies/subscribe_to_grafana_security_advisories.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Find Grafana Security Advisory Subscription Channels:** Identify official channels for Grafana security advisories (e.g., mailing lists, RSS feeds, Grafana website security section).
    2.  **Subscribe to Grafana Security Advisories:** Subscribe to the identified Grafana security advisory channels to receive notifications about newly discovered vulnerabilities and security updates.
    3.  **Monitor Grafana Security Advisories Regularly:** Regularly monitor the subscribed channels for new Grafana security advisories.
    4.  **Assess Impact of Grafana Security Advisories:** When a new advisory is released, assess its impact on your Grafana deployment and prioritize remediation actions.
    5.  **Act Promptly on Grafana Security Advisories:** Apply recommended mitigations or updates promptly based on the severity and impact of the vulnerability described in the Grafana security advisory.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Grafana Vulnerabilities (Reduced Window) - Severity: High
    *   Zero-Day Vulnerability Exposure (Reduced Window) - Severity: Medium
    *   Delayed Patching of Grafana Vulnerabilities - Severity: High
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Grafana Vulnerabilities (Reduced Window): Moderately Reduces
    *   Zero-Day Vulnerability Exposure (Reduced Window): Slightly Reduces
    *   Delayed Patching of Grafana Vulnerabilities: Significantly Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Subscription to Grafana security advisories is not formally implemented.
    *   Implemented in: None.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Subscribing to and actively monitoring Grafana security advisories is missing. This is a crucial step to stay informed about Grafana security vulnerabilities and apply timely patches.
