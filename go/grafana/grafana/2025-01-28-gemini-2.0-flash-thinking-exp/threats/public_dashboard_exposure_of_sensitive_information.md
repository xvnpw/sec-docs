### 4. Deep Analysis of Public Dashboard Exposure of Sensitive Information

#### 4.1 Threat Breakdown

*   **Actor:**
    *   **Unintentional:**  A legitimate Grafana user (e.g., employee, team member) who mistakenly configures dashboard sharing settings to be public or overly permissive due to lack of awareness, misunderstanding of the interface, or simple human error.
    *   **Malicious:**
        *   **Insider Threat:** A user with legitimate Grafana access who intentionally shares a dashboard publicly or with unauthorized individuals for malicious purposes (e.g., data exfiltration, sabotage, competitive advantage).
        *   **External Attacker (Indirect):** An external attacker who has compromised a legitimate user account or exploited a vulnerability in Grafana's authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain access and then maliciously share dashboards.

*   **Action:**  Sharing a Grafana dashboard publicly or with overly broad permissions. This can be achieved through:
    *   **Public Share Links:** Generating and distributing public share links for dashboards.
    *   **Organization/Team Permissions:** Granting "Viewer" or "Editor" roles to entire organizations or teams when only specific individuals should have access.
    *   **Anonymous Access (if enabled):**  If anonymous access is enabled in Grafana (generally discouraged for production environments), dashboards might be inadvertently accessible to anyone.
    *   **Misconfigured API Access:**  While less direct, misconfigured API access could potentially be exploited to programmatically alter dashboard permissions or extract dashboard data if public access is enabled.

*   **Asset:** Sensitive Information contained within Grafana dashboards. This can include:
    *   **Business Metrics:** Key performance indicators (KPIs), revenue figures, sales data, customer acquisition costs, market share, financial projections, etc.
    *   **Operational Data:** Server performance metrics, application logs, database statistics, infrastructure details, network topology, security alerts, incident response data, etc.
    *   **Customer Data:**  Potentially anonymized or aggregated customer data, but even in aggregated form, it could reveal sensitive trends or patterns. In some cases, dashboards might inadvertently contain PII (Personally Identifiable Information) if data sources are not properly sanitized.
    *   **Proprietary Algorithms/Logic:**  Visualizations or calculations within dashboards that reveal proprietary business logic or algorithms.
    *   **Internal System Details:** Information about internal systems, configurations, and vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.

*   **Impact:**  The consequences of public dashboard exposure can be significant and multifaceted:
    *   **Data Breaches:** Exposure of confidential business data, financial information, or customer data, leading to potential financial losses, legal liabilities, and regulatory fines.
    *   **Privacy Violations:**  If dashboards contain any form of PII, even indirectly, public exposure can constitute a privacy violation, leading to reputational damage and legal repercussions, especially under regulations like GDPR, CCPA, etc.
    *   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust, negative media coverage, and damage to brand reputation due to perceived security negligence.
    *   **Competitive Disadvantage:**  Exposure of business strategies, market insights, or proprietary information to competitors, potentially eroding competitive advantage.
    *   **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** Failure to comply with data protection regulations and industry standards, resulting in penalties and legal action.
    *   **Security Risks:**  Exposure of internal system details or security-related dashboards (e.g., security monitoring dashboards) could provide valuable information to attackers, increasing the risk of further attacks.
    *   **Financial Losses:** Direct financial losses from data breaches, regulatory fines, legal fees, and reputational damage, as well as indirect losses from competitive disadvantage and loss of customer trust.

#### 4.2 Attack Vectors and Scenarios

*   **Accidental Public Share Link Generation:** A user intends to share a dashboard with a specific team but mistakenly generates a public share link and distributes it, or forgets to restrict access after temporary public sharing.
*   **Overly Permissive Role Assignment:**  Administrators or users with permission management capabilities grant overly broad roles (e.g., "Viewer" to the entire "Everyone" organization) without fully understanding the implications, making dashboards accessible to a wider audience than intended.
*   **Lack of User Awareness and Training:** Users are not adequately trained on the risks of public dashboard sharing, proper permission settings, and data sensitivity classifications, leading to unintentional misconfigurations.
*   **Default Settings and Misconfigurations:**  Default Grafana settings might be too permissive, or initial configurations might not have implemented strict access controls from the outset.
*   **Insider Threat Exploitation:** A disgruntled or malicious insider intentionally exploits dashboard sharing features to leak sensitive information for personal gain, revenge, or to harm the organization.
*   **Account Compromise:** An external attacker compromises a legitimate user account through phishing, credential stuffing, or other methods and then uses that account to access and publicly share sensitive dashboards.
*   **Insufficient Review and Auditing:** Lack of regular reviews of dashboard sharing settings and user permissions allows misconfigurations and overly permissive access to persist unnoticed over time.
