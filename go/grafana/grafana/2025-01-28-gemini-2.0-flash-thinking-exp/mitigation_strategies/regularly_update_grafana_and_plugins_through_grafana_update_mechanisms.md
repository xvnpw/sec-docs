#### 4.2. List of Threats Mitigated:

*   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Grafana - Severity: High**
    *   **Analysis:** This is the most significant threat mitigated by regular updates. Known vulnerabilities are publicly disclosed and actively exploited. Timely updates patch these vulnerabilities, directly eliminating the attack vector. The "High" severity is justified as exploitation can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, and service disruption.
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **Significantly Reduces**. Regular updates are the primary defense against known vulnerabilities.

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerability Exposure in Grafana (Reduced Window) - Severity: Medium**
    *   **Analysis:** Zero-day vulnerabilities are unknown to vendors and have no immediate patch available. While updates cannot prevent zero-day exploits initially, a robust update process *reduces the window of exposure*. As soon as a patch becomes available for a zero-day, a well-established update process ensures rapid deployment, minimizing the time the system remains vulnerable. The "Medium" severity reflects the inherent uncertainty of zero-day exploits, but the potential impact can still be high.
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **Moderately Reduces**.  Reduces the duration of exposure once a patch is released. Does not prevent initial zero-day exploitation before a patch is available.

*   **Plugin Vulnerabilities within Grafana - Severity: Medium to High (depending on plugin)**
    *   **Analysis:** Grafana's plugin ecosystem extends its functionality but also introduces potential security risks. Plugins can contain vulnerabilities that, if exploited, can compromise the Grafana instance. The severity is variable ("Medium to High") as it depends on the specific plugin, its privileges, and the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **Significantly Reduces**. Regular plugin updates are crucial for patching vulnerabilities within plugins.  The strategy also implicitly encourages vigilance regarding plugin selection and usage, as outdated plugins pose a higher risk.

#### 4.3. Impact:

The "Impact" section accurately reflects the positive effects of this mitigation strategy on reducing the identified threats. Regularly updating Grafana and plugins has a significant positive impact on security posture.
