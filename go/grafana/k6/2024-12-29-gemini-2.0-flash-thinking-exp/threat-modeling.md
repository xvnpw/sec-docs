### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving k6

This list details high and critical severity threats that directly involve the k6 load testing tool.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Script Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to the k6 script repository or development environment injects malicious JavaScript code *into a k6 script*. This code is then executed by the k6 scripting engine, potentially leading to exfiltration of sensitive data from the testing environment, unauthorized actions on the application under test, or compromise of the k6 execution environment. The attacker leverages *k6's capabilities* to make HTTP requests or interact with the underlying system.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach from the testing environment, unauthorized modification or deletion of data in the application under test, compromise of the k6 execution environment leading to further attacks.
    *   **Affected k6 Component:** Scripting Engine (execution of JavaScript code).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access control and code review processes for k6 scripts.
        *   Utilize version control systems with access logging and auditing for k6 scripts.
        *   Employ static analysis security testing (SAST) tools on k6 scripts to detect potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Run k6 tests in isolated, non-production environments with limited access to sensitive data.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization within k6 scripts if they handle external data.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Secrets in k6 Scripts or Environment
    *   **Description:** Developers unintentionally or carelessly hardcode sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or internal URLs directly *into k6 scripts* or store them as environment variables *accessible by k6*. An attacker gaining access to these scripts or the execution environment can extract these secrets.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services or internal systems, potential data breaches, and compromise of accounts associated with the exposed credentials.
    *   **Affected k6 Component:** Scripting Engine (storage within script code), Environment Variable Handling (access to environment variables).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Mandate the use of secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and retrieve sensitive information.
        *   Avoid hardcoding secrets directly in k6 scripts.
        *   Ensure environment variables containing secrets are properly secured and not exposed unnecessarily.
        *   Regularly scan k6 scripts and the execution environment for exposed secrets.
        *   Implement least privilege principles for accessing secrets.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via k6
    *   **Description:** An attacker, either intentionally or through a compromised account, configures *k6 to generate an overwhelming amount of traffic* towards the application under test or other internal systems. This could exhaust resources, leading to service disruption or complete outage.
    *   **Impact:**  Unavailability of the application under test or other targeted systems, financial losses due to downtime, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected k6 Component:**  Load Generation Engine (ability to generate a high volume of requests).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing and controlling k6 execution.
        *   Monitor k6 test execution and resource consumption.
        *   Implement rate limiting and traffic shaping on the network and the application under test.
        *   Establish clear guidelines and limits for k6 test configurations.
        *   Consider using a dedicated, isolated environment for running high-load k6 tests.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in k6 Itself
    *   **Description:**  An attacker discovers and exploits a security vulnerability *within the k6 tool itself* (e.g., a buffer overflow, injection flaw). This could allow them to gain unauthorized access to the k6 execution environment, execute arbitrary code *within the k6 process*, or disrupt k6 functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the k6 execution environment, potential use of k6 as a vector for attacking other systems, disruption of testing processes.
    *   **Affected k6 Component:** Various components depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., CLI, scripting engine, network handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the k6 tool updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to k6.
        *   Follow security best practices for deploying and configuring k6.
        *   Limit the exposure of the k6 execution environment to the network.
