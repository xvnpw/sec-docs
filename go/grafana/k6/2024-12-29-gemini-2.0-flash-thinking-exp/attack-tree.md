            *   Leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in k6 (e.g., CVEs) ***
            *   Exploit unpatched vulnerabilities in older k6 versions ***

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Compromise Application via k6 [CRITICAL]:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. Success here means the attacker has gained unauthorized control or caused significant disruption.

*   **Exploit k6 Configuration/Setup [CRITICAL]:**  This is a critical entry point. Insecure configuration makes the application vulnerable to various attacks.

    *   **Use of insecure protocols (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS for internal communication) ***:**
        *   Attack Vector: If k6 communicates internally using HTTP, attackers on the same network can eavesdrop on sensitive data like API keys, authentication tokens, or other confidential information used within the load tests.
        *   Risk: Exposure of sensitive credentials or data that can be used for further attacks.

    *   **Weak or default credentials for k6 reporting/metrics endpoints [CRITICAL] ***:**
        *   Attack Vector: If k6 exposes reporting or metrics endpoints with default or easily guessable credentials, attackers can gain unauthorized access to performance data. This data can reveal insights into the application's internal workings, potential vulnerabilities, or even allow manipulation of the data to hide malicious activity.
        *   Risk: Information disclosure, potential manipulation of monitoring data, and a stepping stone for further attacks.

    *   **Inject malicious code into k6 scripts (if scripts are dynamically generated or sourced from untrusted locations) ***:**
        *   Attack Vector: If k6 scripts are dynamically generated or fetched from untrusted sources, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes during the load test. This code can interact with the application in unintended ways, exfiltrate data, or compromise the k6 execution environment.
        *   Risk: Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, and potential compromise of the k6 host.

*   **Exploit k6 Functionality/Features [CRITICAL]:**  Abusing k6's intended features for malicious purposes poses a significant risk.

    *   **Launch Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks by overwhelming the application with requests ***:**
        *   Attack Vector: Attackers can leverage k6's ability to generate high volumes of traffic to overwhelm the application's resources, causing denial of service and making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
        *   Risk: Application unavailability, business disruption, and potential financial loss.

    *   **Perform resource exhaustion attacks by sending requests that consume excessive server resources ***:**
        *   Attack Vector: Attackers can craft specific requests using k6 that consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, database connections), leading to application instability, slowdowns, or even crashes.
        *   Risk: Application instability, performance degradation, and potential service outages.

    *   **Utilize known vulnerabilities in k6 extensions ***:**
        *   Attack Vector: Like any software, k6 extensions can have vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in popular or custom extensions to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or compromise the k6 environment.
        *   Risk: Arbitrary code execution, data access, and potential compromise of the k6 host or the application.

*   **Exploit k6 Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**  Directly exploiting vulnerabilities within k6 itself is a high-risk scenario.

    *   **Leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in k6 (e.g., CVEs) ***:**
        *   Attack Vector: Attackers can exploit publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in k6 if the application is using an outdated or vulnerable version. This can lead to various forms of compromise, including remote code execution.
        *   Risk: Arbitrary code execution, system compromise, and data breaches.

    *   **Exploit unpatched vulnerabilities in older k6 versions ***:**
        *   Attack Vector: Even if vulnerabilities are known, if the k6 instance is not patched, it remains susceptible to exploitation. Attackers can target these unpatched vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.
        *   Risk: Arbitrary code execution, system compromise, and data breaches.
