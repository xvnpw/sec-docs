# Attack Surface Analysis for stackexchange/dnscontrol

## Attack Surface: [Credential Compromise (credentials.json or Environment Variables)](./attack_surfaces/credential_compromise__credentials_json_or_environment_variables_.md)

*   **1. Credential Compromise (credentials.json or Environment Variables)**

    *   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the `credentials.json` file or environment variables containing API keys and secrets for DNS providers.
    *   **How DNSControl Contributes:** `dnscontrol` *requires* these credentials to function, making them a central point of vulnerability. The tool's design necessitates storing these credentials somewhere.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a developer's laptop and finds the `credentials.json` file, or a misconfigured CI/CD pipeline exposes environment variables containing the credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over all DNS records managed by `dnscontrol`. This allows for website redirection, email interception, subdomain takeover, and issuance of malicious certificates.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** store `credentials.json` in the source code repository.
        *   Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager).
        *   Inject credentials securely into the `dnscontrol` execution environment (e.g., via environment variables managed by a container orchestration system).
        *   Implement least privilege: Grant only the necessary permissions to the API keys used by `dnscontrol`.
        *   Regularly rotate API keys.
        *   Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for DNS provider accounts.
        *   Monitor DNS provider logs for unauthorized changes.

## Attack Surface: [CI/CD Pipeline Compromise](./attack_surfaces/cicd_pipeline_compromise.md)

*   **2. CI/CD Pipeline Compromise**

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the CI/CD pipeline used to automate `dnscontrol` execution.
    *   **How DNSControl Contributes:** `dnscontrol` is often integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated DNS management, making the pipeline a high-value target *because* of its interaction with `dnscontrol`.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the CI/CD system (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) or compromises a developer's credentials with access to the pipeline. They then modify the `dnsconfig.js` file or inject malicious commands before `dnscontrol` runs.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to credential compromise, the attacker gains control over DNS records, but the attack is executed through the automated pipeline.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the CI/CD pipeline itself: Use strong authentication, restrict access, and monitor for suspicious activity.
        *   Implement least privilege for the pipeline's access to DNS provider credentials (ideally, use short-lived, scoped credentials).
        *   Use signed commits and verify signatures in the pipeline.
        *   Implement code review and approval processes for changes to the pipeline configuration and the `dnsconfig.js` file.
        *   Use a dedicated, isolated build environment for running `dnscontrol`.
        *   Regularly audit and update the CI/CD system and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [`dnsconfig.js` Modification](./attack_surfaces/_dnsconfig_js__modification.md)

*   **3. `dnsconfig.js` Modification**

    *   **Description:** Unauthorized modification of the `dnsconfig.js` file, which defines the desired state of DNS records.
    *   **How DNSControl Contributes:** `dnsconfig.js` is the core configuration file for `dnscontrol`. Its integrity is paramount *to the correct functioning of `dnscontrol`*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to the repository containing `dnsconfig.js` and adds a malicious record, or a disgruntled employee makes unauthorized changes.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can indirectly control DNS settings by modifying the desired state. The changes will be applied the next time `dnscontrol` is run.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store `dnsconfig.js` in a secure, version-controlled repository with strict access controls.
        *   Implement mandatory code review and approval processes for all changes to `dnsconfig.js`.
        *   Use a CI/CD pipeline with integrity checks (e.g., checksum verification) to ensure the file hasn't been tampered with.
        *   Consider using digital signatures to verify the authenticity of the `dnsconfig.js` file.
        *   Implement a rollback mechanism to quickly revert to a previous, known-good configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **4. Dependency Vulnerabilities**

    *   **Description:** Exploitable vulnerabilities in `dnscontrol` itself or its dependencies.
    *   **How DNSControl Contributes:** This is *directly* related to the `dnscontrol` codebase and its chosen dependencies.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in a library used by `dnscontrol` for interacting with a specific DNS provider, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** Potentially arbitrary code execution on the system running `dnscontrol`, leading to credential theft or other malicious actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update `dnscontrol` to the latest version.
        *   Use a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., `npm audit`, `go mod tidy`, Dependabot, Snyk) to identify and remediate known vulnerabilities.
        *   Keep the operating system and other software on the host running `dnscontrol` up to date.
        *   Consider using a software bill of materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.
