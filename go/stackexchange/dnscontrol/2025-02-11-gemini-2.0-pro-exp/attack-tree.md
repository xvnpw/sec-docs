## Attack Tree Path: [[[Manipulate DNS Records via DNSControl]]](./attack_tree_paths/__manipulate_dns_records_via_dnscontrol__.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker. Successful manipulation can lead to traffic redirection, content injection, or service disruption.
*   **Likelihood:** (Not applicable to the goal itself)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** (Not applicable to the goal itself)
*   **Skill Level:** (Not applicable to the goal itself)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** (Not applicable to the goal itself)

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Compromise DNSControl Configuration]]](./attack_tree_paths/__compromise_dnscontrol_configuration__.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining control over the DNSControl configuration files (e.g., `dnsconfig.js`, `creds.json`), allowing the attacker to directly specify DNS records.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Varies depending on the sub-path
*   **Skill Level:** Varies depending on the sub-path
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies depending on the sub-path

## Attack Tree Path: [==[Gain Unauthorized Access to Config Files]==](./attack_tree_paths/==_gain_unauthorized_access_to_config_files_==.md)

*   **Description:** Obtaining the configuration files through various means without proper authorization.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Varies
*   **Skill Level:** Varies
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Git Repo Compromise]]](./attack_tree_paths/__git_repo_compromise__.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining unauthorized access to the Git repository where the DNSControl configuration is stored (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). This could be through stolen credentials, compromised SSH keys, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the Git platform.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Cloud Storage Compromise]]](./attack_tree_paths/__cloud_storage_compromise__.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining unauthorized access to cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) where the DNSControl configuration is stored. This could be through misconfigured permissions, stolen cloud credentials, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the cloud provider.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

## Attack Tree Path: [[Phishing/Social Engineering]](./attack_tree_paths/_phishingsocial_engineering_.md)

*   **Description:** Tricking an authorized user into revealing credentials, downloading a malicious configuration file, or otherwise compromising the configuration through social manipulation.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [==[Tamper with Config Files]==](./attack_tree_paths/==_tamper_with_config_files_==.md)

*   **Description:** Intercepting and modifying the DNSControl configuration files during transit (e.g., during deployment) without authorization.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (if secure transport is used)
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Abuse DNS Provider API]]](./attack_tree_paths/__abuse_dns_provider_api__.md)

*   **Description:** Directly interacting with the DNS provider's API (e.g., AWS Route 53, Google Cloud DNS) to manipulate DNS records, bypassing DNSControl's intended workflow.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Varies
*   **Skill Level:** Varies
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Brute-Force API Keys]]](./attack_tree_paths/__brute-force_api_keys__.md)

*   **Description:** Attempting to guess the DNS provider API key through repeated trials.  Highly unlikely with strong keys and rate limiting.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[[API Key Leakage (e.g., in logs, code repos)]]](./attack_tree_paths/__api_key_leakage__e_g___in_logs__code_repos___.md)

*   **Description:** The accidental or unintentional exposure of the DNS provider API key, such as through committing it to a public code repository, logging it to a file, or including it in an error message. This is a *very* common vulnerability.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low (for the attacker, once the key is exposed)
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Misconfigured API Permissions]]](./attack_tree_paths/__misconfigured_api_permissions__.md)

*   **Description:** The DNS provider API key being configured with overly permissive access rights, allowing an attacker to perform actions beyond what is necessary.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
