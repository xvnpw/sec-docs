# Threat Model Analysis for stackexchange/dnscontrol

## Threat: [Unauthorized Modification of `dnsconfig.js`](./threats/unauthorized_modification_of__dnsconfig_js_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Modification of `dnsconfig.js`

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains write access to the `dnsconfig.js` file. The attacker modifies the file to add, delete, or change DNS records. This could involve inserting malicious records (e.g., pointing a legitimate domain to an attacker-controlled server), deleting critical records (causing service outages), or modifying existing records (e.g., changing MX records to intercept email). This is a *direct* threat because `dnsconfig.js` is the core configuration file that DNSControl uses.
    *   **Impact:**  Loss of availability (services become unreachable), loss of integrity (users are directed to malicious sites), loss of confidentiality (email interception).  Reputational damage. Potential financial losses.
    *   **Affected Component:** `dnsconfig.js` file (the core configuration file).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Version Control:** Implement strict access controls (least privilege, MFA, SSH keys) on the repository. Enforce mandatory code reviews and branch protection rules (e.g., requiring approvals before merging changes).  Use signed commits.
        *   **File System:**  Restrict access to the `dnsconfig.js` file on the file system to only the necessary users/processes. Use file integrity monitoring (FIM).
        *   **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular audits of the version control history and file system to detect unauthorized changes.

## Threat: [Credential Leakage (`credentials.json` or Environment Variables)](./threats/credential_leakage___credentials_json__or_environment_variables_.md)

*   **Threat:** Credential Leakage (`credentials.json` or Environment Variables)

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the API credentials used by DNSControl to interact with DNS providers.  The attacker can then use these credentials to directly manipulate DNS records through the provider's API, *bypassing DNSControl's intended workflow*. This is a *direct* threat because `credentials.json` (or environment variables, if misconfigured) is how DNSControl authenticates to providers.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete control over DNS records, leading to all impacts listed in the previous threat (availability, integrity, confidentiality loss).  Bypass of DNSControl's change management processes.
    *   **Affected Component:** `credentials.json` file. Environment variables (if used to store credentials). The DNS provider's API (indirectly, via the compromised credentials).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secrets Management:**  Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and manage API credentials.  *Never* hardcode credentials in `credentials.json` or environment variables.
        *   **Credential Rotation:**  Regularly rotate API credentials.
        *   **Least Privilege:**  Grant the DNSControl API credentials the minimum necessary permissions on the DNS provider's side.
        *   **Secure Configuration:**  Ensure that the secrets management solution itself is securely configured and access is tightly controlled.
        *   **Log Sanitization:** Implement measures to prevent sensitive information (like credentials) from being logged.

## Threat: [Logic Errors in `dnsconfig.js` leading to destructive changes](./threats/logic_errors_in__dnsconfig_js__leading_to_destructive_changes.md)

* **Threat:** Logic Errors in `dnsconfig.js` leading to destructive changes.

    * **Description:** The `dnsconfig.js` file contains errors in its logic that, when executed by `dnscontrol push`, result in the *unintentional deletion or modification* of critical DNS records. This is a *direct* threat because it involves the core logic of how DNSControl interprets and applies the desired state.  This is distinct from *malicious* modification; it's about *accidental* damage due to coding errors.
    * **Impact:** Loss of availability (services become unreachable). Potential data loss (if records are deleted without backups).  Significant operational disruption.
    * **Affected Component:** `dnsconfig.js` file. The `dnscontrol` commands, specifically `push` (and potentially `get-zones` if used incorrectly in a script).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Reviews:**  Thorough code reviews of `dnsconfig.js` by multiple individuals, with a focus on identifying potential logic errors that could lead to destructive changes.
        *   **Testing:**  *Mandatory* use of `dnscontrol preview` to review changes *before* applying them with `dnscontrol push`. Implement a staging environment to test DNS changes before deploying them to production.  This is the *primary* mitigation.
        *   **Linting/Validation:**  Use a linter or validator for JavaScript to catch syntax errors and potential logic problems.
        *   **Documentation:**  Clearly document the intended purpose of each section of the `dnsconfig.js` file, making it easier to spot errors.
        * **Type Safety:** Consider using TypeScript instead of JavaScript to improve type safety and catch errors earlier, especially for complex logic.
        * **Backups:** Maintain regular backups of your DNS zone data, independent of DNSControl, to allow for recovery in case of accidental deletion.
