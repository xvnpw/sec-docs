# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, dnscontrol, aims to solve the problem of managing DNS records across multiple DNS providers in a consistent, automated, and auditable way.  Organizations often use different DNS providers for various reasons (cost, features, redundancy). Managing DNS records manually across these providers is error-prone, time-consuming, and lacks version control and audit trails. dnscontrol addresses these challenges by providing a declarative configuration approach, allowing users to define their desired DNS state in code and automatically synchronize it with their DNS providers.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Centralized DNS Management: Provide a single tool to manage DNS records across multiple providers, simplifying operations and reducing complexity.
- Automation: Automate DNS record updates, reducing manual errors and improving efficiency.
- Version Control and Auditability: Treat DNS configuration as code, enabling version control, collaboration, and audit trails.
- Consistency and Reliability: Ensure consistent DNS configuration across providers and improve DNS reliability through automated synchronization.
- Infrastructure as Code: Integrate DNS management into the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) paradigm.

Business Risks:
- Availability Risk: Misconfiguration or failures in dnscontrol could lead to DNS outages, impacting website and service availability.
- Data Integrity Risk: Incorrect DNS record updates could lead to misrouting of traffic and potential data breaches or service disruptions.
- Security Risk: Compromise of dnscontrol configuration or access could allow attackers to manipulate DNS records, leading to phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, or denial of service.
- Provider Dependency Risk: Reliance on dnscontrol and its supported providers introduces dependency risks. Changes in providers' APIs or dnscontrol's compatibility could disrupt DNS management.
- Configuration Drift Risk: If manual changes are made outside of dnscontrol, configuration drift can occur, leading to inconsistencies and potential issues.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Code Review - The project is open source and hosted on GitHub, allowing for community code review. Implemented in: GitHub repository, Pull Request process.
- security control: Version Control - DNS configurations are stored in version control (Git), providing an audit trail of changes. Implemented in: Git repository.
- security control: Provider API Security - dnscontrol relies on the security mechanisms provided by the DNS providers' APIs (e.g., API keys, OAuth). Implemented in: Provider SDKs and API integrations within dnscontrol.
- security control: Least Privilege (Configuration) - Users should ideally grant dnscontrol API credentials with the least privileges necessary for DNS management. Implemented in: User responsibility when configuring provider credentials.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Open Source Vulnerabilities - As an open-source project, dnscontrol may be susceptible to vulnerabilities. The project relies on community contributions and maintainer efforts for vulnerability detection and patching.
- accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities - dnscontrol depends on third-party libraries and provider SDKs, which may contain vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Configuration Errors - Users are responsible for writing correct and secure DNS configurations. Misconfigurations can lead to security issues.
- accepted risk: Credential Management - Users are responsible for securely managing and storing API credentials for DNS providers.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Automated Security Scanning - Implement automated security scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities in the code and dependencies.
- security control: Secret Management - Integrate with a secret management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and manage DNS provider API credentials instead of storing them directly in configuration files or environment variables.
- security control: Input Validation and Sanitization - Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user inputs, especially in configuration parsing and provider API interactions, to prevent injection attacks.
- security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - If dnscontrol is used in a team environment, consider implementing or recommending RBAC mechanisms to control who can manage DNS configurations and which providers they can access.
- security control: Audit Logging - Enhance audit logging to record all actions performed by dnscontrol, including configuration changes, provider API calls, and errors, for security monitoring and incident response.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: dnscontrol itself does not require user authentication as it is a CLI tool. Authentication is handled by the underlying operating system and access controls to the system where dnscontrol is executed.
    - Requirement: Authentication to DNS providers is required via API keys, tokens, or other provider-specific authentication mechanisms. dnscontrol must securely handle these credentials during runtime.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Authorization is managed at the DNS provider level. dnscontrol operates with the permissions granted to the API credentials it uses.
    - Requirement: Users should follow the principle of least privilege when configuring API credentials for dnscontrol, granting only necessary permissions for DNS management.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: dnscontrol must validate all inputs, including configuration files, command-line arguments, and responses from DNS provider APIs, to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
    - Requirement: Configuration files should be validated against a schema to ensure correctness and prevent unexpected behavior.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: dnscontrol should use cryptography to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest, such as API credentials if they are stored locally (though secret management is recommended).
    - Requirement: Communication with DNS providers over APIs should be encrypted using HTTPS.
    - Requirement: Consider using encryption for storing configuration files at rest if they contain sensitive information.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- DNS Resolution: Ensuring that domain names resolve to the correct IP addresses, enabling users to access websites and services.
- Service Availability: Maintaining the availability of online services and applications, which depends on correct DNS configuration.
- Brand Reputation: Protecting brand reputation by preventing DNS-related attacks like phishing or domain hijacking.

Data Sensitivity:
- DNS Configuration Data: DNS configuration data itself is generally considered public information. However, the configuration files might contain sensitive information indirectly, such as domain names related to sensitive services or internal infrastructure.
- DNS Provider API Credentials: API credentials used to access DNS providers are highly sensitive. Compromise of these credentials could allow unauthorized modification of DNS records.
- Log Data: Logs may contain information about DNS changes and user actions, which could be sensitive from an audit and security monitoring perspective.
