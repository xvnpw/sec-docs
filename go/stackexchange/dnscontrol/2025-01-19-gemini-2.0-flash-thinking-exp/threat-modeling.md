# Threat Model Analysis for stackexchange/dnscontrol

## Threat: [Malicious Configuration File Modification](./threats/malicious_configuration_file_modification.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Configuration File Modification
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `dnscontrol` configuration files (e.g., `dnsconfig.js`) and modifies them to alter DNS records. This could involve changing A records to redirect traffic to malicious servers, modifying MX records to intercept emails, or deleting critical records causing a denial of service. The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the storage location of these files or through compromised credentials of individuals with access to the configuration repository.
    *   **Impact:**  Traffic redirection to attacker-controlled infrastructure (phishing, malware distribution), email interception, complete DNS outage for the affected domain, reputational damage, and financial loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** `dnscontrol` configuration file parsing and application logic. Specifically, the code that reads and interprets the `dnsconfig.js` file and translates it into API calls to DNS providers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls (file system permissions) on the directories and files containing `dnscontrol` configurations.
        *   Utilize version control systems (e.g., Git) for `dnscontrol` configurations to track changes, enable rollback, and facilitate code review.
        *   Employ code review processes for any modifications to `dnscontrol` configurations before deployment.
        *   Consider encrypting sensitive information within the configuration files at rest, if applicable.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for unauthorized changes to configuration files.

## Threat: [Credential Compromise for DNS Providers](./threats/credential_compromise_for_dns_providers.md)

*   **Threat:** Credential Compromise for DNS Providers
    *   **Description:** An attacker obtains the credentials (API keys, tokens, passwords) used by `dnscontrol` to authenticate and interact with DNS providers. This could happen through insecure storage of credentials *within the context of `dnscontrol`'s configuration or execution environment*, phishing attacks targeting individuals with access to these credentials, or exploitation of vulnerabilities in systems where these credentials are used or stored *by `dnscontrol`*. With compromised credentials, the attacker can directly manipulate DNS records through the provider's API, bypassing the intended control flow of `dnscontrol`.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete control over the domain's DNS records, allowing for arbitrary modifications, including redirection, record deletion, and creation of new malicious subdomains. This can lead to severe service disruption, data breaches, and reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** `dnscontrol`'s credential management module and the functions responsible for authenticating with DNS provider APIs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing DNS provider credentials directly in `dnscontrol` configuration files.
        *   Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and manage DNS provider credentials, and ensure `dnscontrol` integrates with these solutions securely.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege, granting `dnscontrol` only the necessary permissions on the DNS provider accounts.
        *   Regularly rotate DNS provider API keys and tokens.
        *   Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accounts with access to DNS provider credentials.
        *   Monitor API access logs for suspicious activity on the DNS provider accounts.

## Threat: [Execution Environment Compromise Leading to `dnscontrol` Abuse](./threats/execution_environment_compromise_leading_to__dnscontrol__abuse.md)

*   **Threat:** Execution Environment Compromise Leading to `dnscontrol` Abuse
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the server or environment where `dnscontrol` is executed. This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system or other software. Once compromised, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands, including running `dnscontrol` with malicious configurations *they create or modify* or using the existing *legitimate* credentials configured for `dnscontrol` to manipulate DNS.
    *   **Impact:**  Ability to manipulate DNS records, potentially leading to service disruption, data breaches, and further compromise of the infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `dnscontrol` binary and its interaction with the compromised execution environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the operating system and runtime environment where `dnscontrol` is executed by applying security patches and following security best practices.
        *   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a compromise.
        *   Run `dnscontrol` in a restricted environment, such as a container, with limited privileges.
        *   Regularly scan the execution environment for vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and block malicious activity.

## Threat: [Dependency Chain Attack](./threats/dependency_chain_attack.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Chain Attack
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency (library or package) used by `dnscontrol`. This could involve injecting malicious code into a popular package that `dnscontrol` relies on. When `dnscontrol` is executed, this malicious code could be executed *within the `dnscontrol` process*, potentially allowing the attacker to manipulate DNS records or gain access to sensitive information handled by `dnscontrol`.
    *   **Impact:**  Unpredictable behavior of `dnscontrol`, potential for remote code execution *within the `dnscontrol` context*, ability to manipulate DNS records, and potential exposure of sensitive information used by `dnscontrol`.
    *   **Affected Component:** The dependency management system used by `dnscontrol` (e.g., `go.mod` for Go) and the specific compromised dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the severity of the vulnerability and the compromised dependency).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly audit and update `dnscontrol` and its dependencies to the latest secure versions.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot) to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Consider using a software bill of materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.
        *   Pin dependency versions to avoid unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities.
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies using checksums or other verification methods.

## Threat: [Manipulation of `dnscontrol` Execution Flow](./threats/manipulation_of__dnscontrol__execution_flow.md)

*   **Threat:** Manipulation of `dnscontrol` Execution Flow
    *   **Description:** An attacker, having gained some level of access to the system where `dnscontrol` runs, manipulates the execution flow of `dnscontrol`. This could involve modifying the `dnscontrol` binary itself, intercepting API calls *made by `dnscontrol`*, or altering environment variables to influence its behavior *specifically affecting `dnscontrol`'s actions*.
    *   **Impact:**  Unpredictable and potentially malicious DNS changes, bypassing intended security controls *within `dnscontrol`*, and potentially gaining further access to the infrastructure *through `dnscontrol`*.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `dnscontrol` binary, its runtime environment, and the system calls it makes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls on the `dnscontrol` binary and its execution environment.
        *   Utilize file integrity monitoring tools to detect unauthorized modifications to the `dnscontrol` binary.
        *   Run `dnscontrol` with the principle of least privilege, limiting its access to system resources.
        *   Implement security monitoring and alerting for unusual process behavior related to `dnscontrol`.
