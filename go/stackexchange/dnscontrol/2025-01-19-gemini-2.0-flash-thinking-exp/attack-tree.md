## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via DNSControl [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_dnscontrol__critical_.md)

*   This is the root goal and is inherently critical as its success means the application is compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit DNSControl Process [HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_dnscontrol_process__high-risk__critical_.md)

*   **High-Risk:**  Exploiting the running process offers direct control over DNS management.
*   **Critical:** Success directly leads to the ability to manipulate DNS records.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Compromise the Machine Running DNSControl [HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL]:**
        *   **High-Risk:** Gaining control of the server is a significant security breach.
        *   **Critical:** Provides a platform to execute malicious DNSControl commands.
        *   **Execute DNSControl with Malicious Configuration/Commands [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Critical:** Direct manipulation of DNS records.
    *   **Compromise DNSControl Credentials [HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL]:**
        *   **High-Risk:** Bypasses the need to compromise the entire server.
        *   **Critical:** Allows direct interaction with the DNS provider.
        *   **Steal API Keys/Tokens for DNS Providers [HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL]:**
            *   **High-Risk:**  Often stored insecurely, making them a prime target.
            *   **Critical:** Grants direct access to modify DNS records.
        *   **Use Stolen Credentials to Modify DNS Records Directly [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Critical:** Direct manipulation of DNS records.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Manipulate DNSControl Configuration [HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__manipulate_dnscontrol_configuration__high-risk__critical_.md)

*   **High-Risk:** Modifying the configuration is a persistent way to control DNS.
*   **Critical:** Changes will be applied by DNSControl, affecting the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Compromise the Configuration Source [HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL]:**
        *   **High-Risk:** Version control systems are often targeted due to the sensitive information they hold.
        *   **Critical:** Allows injecting malicious DNS records into the trusted source.
        *   **Introduce Malicious DNS Records into the Configuration [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Critical:** The malicious configuration will be applied by DNSControl.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit DNS Provider Interaction [HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_dns_provider_interaction__high-risk__critical_.md)

*   **High-Risk:** Targeting the interaction with the DNS provider can bypass local security measures.
*   **Critical:** Can lead to immediate DNS changes or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Abuse DNS Provider API Functionality [HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL]:**
        *   **High-Risk:** Misconfigurations or weaknesses in API usage can be exploited.
        *   **Critical:** Can directly cause disruption or unexpected changes.
        *   **Cause Denial of Service or Unexpected DNS Changes [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Critical:** Directly impacts the availability and integrity of the application's DNS.
