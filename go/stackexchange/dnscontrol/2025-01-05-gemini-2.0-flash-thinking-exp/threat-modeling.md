# Threat Model Analysis for stackexchange/dnscontrol

## Threat: [Exposure of DNS Provider Credentials in Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_dns_provider_credentials_in_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to `dnscontrol.js` or included configuration files where DNS provider API keys, secrets, or passwords are stored in plaintext or easily reversible formats. The attacker could achieve this through unauthorized access to the repository, compromised developer machines, or insecure storage of configuration files. This directly involves how `dnscontrol`'s configuration is handled.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can fully control the organization's DNS records for the affected domains. This allows them to redirect traffic to malicious servers (phishing, malware distribution), cause denial of service by pointing records to invalid IPs, or intercept sensitive communications (e.g., via MX record manipulation).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, environment variables) and avoid hardcoding credentials directly in `dnscontrol` configuration files.
    *   Leverage `dnscontrol`'s features for integrating with secret management systems if available.
    *   Implement strict access controls on repositories and systems storing `dnscontrol` configuration files.
    *   Regularly audit `dnscontrol` configuration files for exposed secrets.
    *   Educate developers on secure credential management practices specific to `dnscontrol`.

## Threat: [Malicious Modification of `dnscontrol.js`](./threats/malicious_modification_of__dnscontrol_js_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with write access to the repository or system hosting `dnscontrol.js` modifies the file to introduce malicious DNS records or alter existing ones. This directly involves the integrity of the `dnscontrol` configuration file.
*   **Impact:** Similar to credential exposure, this can lead to redirection of traffic, phishing attacks, malware distribution, or denial of service. The attacker can directly manipulate the DNS state through `dnscontrol`'s configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong access controls and authentication for the repository and deployment systems where `dnscontrol.js` resides.
    *   Enforce code review processes for all changes to `dnscontrol.js`.
    *   Utilize branch protection rules and require approvals for merging changes to `dnscontrol.js`.
    *   Implement file integrity monitoring on `dnscontrol.js` in production environments.
    *   Consider using signed commits to verify the authenticity of changes to `dnscontrol.js`.

## Threat: [Compromised Execution Environment of `dnscontrol`](./threats/compromised_execution_environment_of__dnscontrol_.md)

*   **Description:** The environment where `dnscontrol` is executed (e.g., CI/CD pipeline, deployment server) is compromised. An attacker can then execute arbitrary `dnscontrol` commands with the privileges of the executing user, potentially using credentials managed by or accessible to `dnscontrol`. This directly involves the security of the environment where `dnscontrol` operates.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can directly modify DNS records via `dnscontrol`, potentially causing widespread service disruption or redirection. They could also exfiltrate credentials used by `dnscontrol` if accessible within the environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Harden the execution environment by applying security patches, removing unnecessary software, and implementing strong access controls.
    *   Secure the CI/CD pipeline and use secure credential injection mechanisms specifically for `dnscontrol` if needed.
    *   Limit the privileges of the user or service account running `dnscontrol` to the minimum necessary.
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual `dnscontrol` executions.
