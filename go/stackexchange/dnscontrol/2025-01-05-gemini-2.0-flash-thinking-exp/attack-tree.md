## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Compromise dnscontrol Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_compromise_dnscontrol_configuration.md)

*   **Goal:** Directly manipulate DNS records by altering the `dnscontrol` configuration files.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Critical Node: Gain Access to dnscontrol Configuration Files:**
        *   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Access Control Weaknesses on Repository (e.g., Git):**
            *   **Attack Vector: Access to Stored Credentials for Repository:** Attackers obtain credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) that grant access to the repository containing the `dnscontrol` configuration. This could be through:
                *   Credential leaks in other breaches.
                *   Weak or default credentials.
                *   Phishing attacks targeting developers.
                *   Malware on developer machines.
            *   **Attack Vector: Compromise Developer Account with Repository Access:** Attackers compromise a legitimate developer account that has permissions to access the repository. This could be through:
                *   Phishing attacks.
                *   Malware infections.
                *   Password reuse.
                *   Lack of multi-factor authentication.
        *   **Exploit Access Control Weaknesses on Server Storing Configuration:**
            *   **Attack Vector: Abuse Weak Credentials for Configuration Server:** If the configuration files are stored directly on a server, attackers might gain access by exploiting weak or default passwords for user accounts or services on that server.
    *   **High-Risk Node: Modify dnscontrol Configuration:** Once access to the configuration files is gained, attackers directly edit the files to inject malicious DNS records. This is a straightforward process requiring minimal technical skill.
    *   **High-Risk Node: Inject Malicious DNS Records:** The attacker inserts various types of malicious DNS records:
        *   **Attack Vector: Redirect User Traffic to Malicious Servers (Phishing, Malware):** Injecting `A` or `CNAME` records to point domain names to attacker-controlled servers hosting phishing sites or malware.
        *   **Attack Vector: Intercept Email Communication (MX Record Manipulation):** Modifying `MX` records to redirect email traffic to attacker-controlled mail servers, allowing for interception of sensitive information.
        *   **Attack Vector: Perform Domain Takeover (NS Record Manipulation):**  Changing `NS` records to point the domain to attacker-controlled name servers, granting complete control over the domain's DNS.
    *   **Critical Node: Trigger dnscontrol Apply:** The modified configuration needs to be applied to the DNS providers.
        *   **High-Risk Path: Compromise CI/CD Pipeline to Trigger Apply:**
            *   **Attack Vector: Abuse Weak Credentials for CI/CD System:** Attackers gain access to the CI/CD system using weak or compromised credentials, allowing them to trigger the `dnscontrol apply` command with the malicious configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Gain Access to dnscontrol Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_gain_access_to_dnscontrol_configuration_files.md)

(Detailed above) This node's compromise unlocks the entire "Compromise dnscontrol Configuration" high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Access Control Weaknesses on Repository (e.g., Git)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_access_control_weaknesses_on_repository__e_g___git_.md)

*   **Attack Vector: Access to Stored Credentials for Repository:** Attackers obtain credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) that grant access to the repository containing the `dnscontrol` configuration. This could be through:
    *   Credential leaks in other breaches.
    *   Weak or default credentials.
    *   Phishing attacks targeting developers.
    *   Malware on developer machines.
*   **Attack Vector: Compromise Developer Account with Repository Access:** Attackers compromise a legitimate developer account that has permissions to access the repository. This could be through:
    *   Phishing attacks.
    *   Malware infections.
    *   Password reuse.
    *   Lack of multi-factor authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Access Control Weaknesses on Server Storing Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_access_control_weaknesses_on_server_storing_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Vector: Abuse Weak Credentials for Configuration Server:** If the configuration files are stored directly on a server, attackers might gain access by exploiting weak or default passwords for user accounts or services on that server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify dnscontrol Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/modify_dnscontrol_configuration.md)

Once access to the configuration files is gained, attackers directly edit the files to inject malicious DNS records. This is a straightforward process requiring minimal technical skill.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious DNS Records](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_dns_records.md)

*   **Attack Vector: Redirect User Traffic to Malicious Servers (Phishing, Malware):** Injecting `A` or `CNAME` records to point domain names to attacker-controlled servers hosting phishing sites or malware.
*   **Attack Vector: Intercept Email Communication (MX Record Manipulation):** Modifying `MX` records to redirect email traffic to attacker-controlled mail servers, allowing for interception of sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vector: Perform Domain Takeover (NS Record Manipulation):**  Changing `NS` records to point the domain to attacker-controlled name servers, granting complete control over the domain's DNS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Trigger dnscontrol Apply](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_trigger_dnscontrol_apply.md)

(Detailed above) This node's compromise allows the attacker to deploy the malicious changes, regardless of how the configuration was modified.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Compromise CI/CD Pipeline to Trigger Apply](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_compromise_cicd_pipeline_to_trigger_apply.md)

*   **Attack Vector: Abuse Weak Credentials for CI/CD System:** Attackers gain access to the CI/CD system using weak or compromised credentials, allowing them to trigger the `dnscontrol apply` command with the malicious configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Compromise dnscontrol Execution Environment (Partial)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_compromise_dnscontrol_execution_environment__partial_.md)

*   **Goal:** Gain control of the server running `dnscontrol` to manipulate its execution and trigger malicious applies.
*   **Attack Vectors (Focused on High-Risk elements):**
    *   **Gain Control of Server Running dnscontrol:**
        *   **Attack Vector: Abuse Weak Credentials for dnscontrol Server:** Similar to the configuration server, attackers might exploit weak or default passwords for user accounts or services on the server running `dnscontrol`.
    *   **Trigger dnscontrol Apply with Malicious Intent:** Once control of the server is gained, attackers can directly execute the `dnscontrol apply` command, forcing the deployment of a previously modified (or crafted) malicious configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Control of Server Running dnscontrol](./attack_tree_paths/gain_control_of_server_running_dnscontrol.md)

*   **Attack Vector: Abuse Weak Credentials for dnscontrol Server:** Similar to the configuration server, attackers might exploit weak or default passwords for user accounts or services on the server running `dnscontrol`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger dnscontrol Apply with Malicious Intent](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_dnscontrol_apply_with_malicious_intent.md)

Once control of the server is gained, attackers can directly execute the `dnscontrol apply` command, forcing the deployment of a previously modified (or crafted) malicious configuration.
