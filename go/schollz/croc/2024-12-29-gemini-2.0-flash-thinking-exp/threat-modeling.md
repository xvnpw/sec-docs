* **Threat:** Weak or Predictable Transfer Codes
    * **Description:** An attacker attempts to guess the short, human-readable code used by `croc` to pair sender and receiver. They might use brute-force techniques or rely on the limited character set and length of the codes. If successful, they can join the transfer.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the file being transferred, leading to a potential confidentiality breach. The attacker could obtain sensitive information.
    * **Affected Croc Component:** Transfer Code Generation, Handshake Process
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Encourage users to utilize longer and more complex transfer codes if the application allows for customization.
        * If programmatically generating codes, ensure sufficient randomness and length.
        * Implement a mechanism to securely exchange the transfer code out-of-band (e.g., through a secure channel).
        * Consider implementing a timeout or limited attempts for joining a transfer with an incorrect code.

* **Threat:** Transfer Code Leakage
    * **Description:** The `croc` transfer code is exposed through insecure channels or methods. This could happen if the code is displayed on a public screen, sent via unencrypted communication (e.g., SMS, email), or stored insecurely. An attacker who obtains the code can join the transfer.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the file being transferred, leading to a potential confidentiality breach.
    * **Affected Croc Component:** Handshake Process
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Educate users on the importance of securely sharing the transfer code.
        * Avoid displaying the code in publicly accessible areas.
        * Recommend or enforce the use of secure communication channels for sharing the code.
        * If the application manages the code exchange, ensure it's done over HTTPS or another secure protocol.

* **Threat:** Compromise of Relay Servers
    * **Description:**  `croc` often utilizes public relay servers to facilitate connections when direct peer-to-peer connections are not possible. If these relay servers are compromised by an attacker, they could potentially eavesdrop on transfers, modify data in transit, or even inject malicious content.
    * **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (eavesdropping), integrity compromise (data modification), availability disruption (relay server outage).
    * **Affected Croc Component:** Relay Servers
    * **Risk Severity:** Medium

* **Threat:** Weak or Outdated Encryption
    * **Description:**  `croc` relies on encryption to protect the file content during transfer. If the encryption algorithms used are weak or outdated, an attacker with sufficient resources might be able to decrypt the transferred data.
    * **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, as the attacker can access the contents of the transferred file.
    * **Affected Croc Component:** Encryption Module
    * **Risk Severity:** Medium
