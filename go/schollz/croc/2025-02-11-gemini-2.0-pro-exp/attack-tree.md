## Attack Tree Path: [1. Intercept & Decrypt Data](./attack_tree_paths/1__intercept_&_decrypt_data.md)

*   **1.1 Weak PAKE Code [HIGH RISK]**:
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits the use of a weak Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) code chosen by the user. Weak codes are easily guessable or susceptible to brute-force attacks.
    *   **Sub-Attacks:**
        *   **1.1.1 Brute-Force PAKE Code [HIGH RISK]**: The attacker systematically tries all possible combinations of the PAKE code until the correct one is found.  This is more feasible if the PAKE code is short.
        *   **1.1.2 Dictionary Attack on PAKE Code [HIGH RISK]**: The attacker uses a list of common passwords, phrases, or previously leaked credentials to try and guess the PAKE code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (for weak PAKE codes), Low (for strong PAKE codes, but still high risk due to impact)
    *   **Impact:** High (complete loss of data confidentiality)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (depending on PAKE code strength)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (detectable through failed login attempts, but requires proper logging and rate limiting)

*   **1.2 Compromise Relay Server [CRITICAL]**:
    *   **Description:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to and control over the `croc` relay server. This allows them to intercept, decrypt, and potentially modify all data passing through the relay.
    *   **Sub-Attacks:**
        *   **1.2.2 Compromise Relay Code (RCE) [CRITICAL]**: The attacker exploits a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the relay server software, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server and gain full control.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High (complete compromise of all data transiting the relay)
    *   **Effort:** High to Very High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Data in Transit](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_data_in_transit.md)

*   **2.1 Modify File Content**:
    *    **Description:** The attacker, having gained access to the data stream (typically through relay compromise or MitM), alters the content of the file being transferred.
    *   **Sub-Attacks:**
        *   **2.1.1 Replace File with Malware [HIGH RISK]**: The attacker replaces the legitimate file with a malicious file (e.g., a virus, Trojan horse, or ransomware).
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (requires prior compromise)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (data integrity loss, potential malware infection)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (without external integrity checks)

*   **2.2 Man-in-the-Middle (Relay) [CRITICAL]**:
    *   **Description:** The attacker positions themselves as the relay server, either by compromising the legitimate relay or by setting up a rogue relay and tricking the sender and receiver into using it. This allows the attacker to see and modify all traffic.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High (complete control over the data transfer)
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Disrupt Relay Service](./attack_tree_paths/3__disrupt_relay_service.md)

*   **3.2 Compromise Relay Server [CRITICAL]**:
    *   **Description:** Similar to 1.2, the attacker gains control of the relay server, but the goal here is disruption rather than data interception.
    *   **Sub-Attacks:**
        *   **3.2.1 Exploit Relay Software Vulnerability [CRITICAL]**: The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the relay software to crash the server or otherwise make it unavailable.
        *   **3.2.2 Inject Malicious Code (RCE) [CRITICAL]**: Same as 1.2.2, but with the intent to disrupt service.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High (relay becomes unavailable, disrupting all `croc` transfers using that relay)
    *   **Effort:** High to Very High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard (for RCE); Easy (for simple DoS)
