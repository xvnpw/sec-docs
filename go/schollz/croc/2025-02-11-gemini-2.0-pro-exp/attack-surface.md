# Attack Surface Analysis for schollz/croc

## Attack Surface: [Relay Server Compromise (Man-in-the-Middle)](./attack_surfaces/relay_server_compromise__man-in-the-middle_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains full control of the relay server used for the `croc` file transfer.
*   **How `croc` Contributes:** `croc` *relies* on a relay server to facilitate the initial key exchange and, optionally, to relay the encrypted data. This central point, *essential to croc's operation*, becomes a target.  The protocol design makes the relay a trusted intermediary.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises the default public relay or a custom relay through a server vulnerability (e.g., unpatched software, weak SSH credentials).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete data interception and decryption.
    *   Data modification (attacker can alter files in transit).
    *   Denial of service (attacker can shut down the relay).
    *   Metadata collection (IP addresses, file sizes, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Provide clear guidance on secure relay setup and operation.  This is crucial since users may deploy their own relays.
        *   Implement relay server fingerprinting/verification in the client.  This allows clients to verify they are connecting to the intended relay.
        *   *Most importantly:* Explore alternative key exchange mechanisms that *reduce or eliminate* the relay's role as a trusted intermediary.  This could involve pre-shared keys, a separate secure channel for key exchange, or other cryptographic techniques to achieve end-to-end encryption without relay trust. This is the most impactful mitigation.
    *   **User:** (Limited direct mitigation, as this is primarily a design issue)
        *   Use a trusted relay server.
        *   If high security is required, run a *private* relay server and follow *strict* security practices (regular patching, strong authentication, intrusion detection, etc.). This shifts the responsibility to the user, but is the only strong user-side mitigation.
        *   Avoid using public relays for sensitive data.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Code Phrase Guessing](./attack_surfaces/weak_code_phrase_guessing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker successfully guesses the short, human-readable code phrase used for the PAKE key exchange.
*   **How `croc` Contributes:** `croc`'s core design *uses* a relatively short, human-readable code phrase as the *foundation* of its key exchange (PAKE). This inherent design choice makes it vulnerable to brute-force or dictionary attacks. The relay facilitates these attacks by allowing multiple connection attempts.
*   **Example:** A user chooses "password123" as the code phrase. An attacker uses a script to try common passwords against the relay until they find a match.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Successful Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.
    *   Data decryption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   *Enforce* a minimum code phrase complexity (length, character types, and entropy).  This is a crucial and direct mitigation.
        *   Implement robust rate limiting on code phrase attempts *per IP address*. This should be done both on the relay *and*, ideally, on the client-side (to prevent distributed guessing attacks).  Client-side rate limiting is more complex but significantly strengthens security.
        *   Provide an option for *automatically generated*, strong code phrases, and *strongly encourage* their use.
    *   **User:** (Limited direct mitigation, relies on developer-provided features)
        *   Use strong, randomly generated code phrases. Avoid common words, phrases, or personal information.
        *   Use a password manager to generate and store unique code phrases.

## Attack Surface: [Code Phrase Leakage (Social Engineering/Observation)](./attack_surfaces/code_phrase_leakage__social_engineeringobservation_.md)

*   **Description:** The code phrase is obtained by an attacker through non-technical means.
*   **How `croc` Contributes:** `croc`'s current design necessitates the *communication* of the code phrase between users, creating an opportunity for interception.
*   **Example:** An attacker overhears the code phrase being spoken aloud, or sees it written down.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Successful MitM attack.
    *   Data decryption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Encourage users (through documentation and UI prompts) to communicate code phrases *securely*.
        *   *Crucially:* Explore alternative key exchange methods that *do not require* the verbal or visual communication of a shared secret. This is the most impactful long-term solution. Examples include QR code exchange (for in-person transfers) or integration with secure messaging platforms.
    *   **User:** (Limited direct mitigation, relies on developer-provided features and secure practices)
        *   Communicate the code phrase through a *secure* channel (e.g., encrypted messaging app, password manager).
        *   Be mindful of your surroundings when sharing the code phrase. Avoid sharing it in public places or over insecure networks.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious `croc` Binary](./attack_surfaces/malicious__croc__binary.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker distributes a modified version of the `croc` executable containing malicious code.
*   **How `croc` Contributes:** Users must download and execute the `croc` binary. This is a fundamental aspect of using the software.
*   **Example:** An attacker creates a fake website that looks like the official `croc` repository and distributes a trojanized version of the binary.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete system compromise (backdoor, data theft, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Provide *code signing* for released binaries. This allows users to verify the authenticity and integrity of the executable.
        *   Provide *checksums* (e.g., SHA-256) for released binaries.
        *   Clearly communicate the *official* download location (GitHub repository) and emphasize the importance of verifying downloads.
    *   **User:** (Limited direct mitigation, relies on developer actions)
        *   Download `croc` *only* from the official GitHub repository.
        *   *Verify* the binary's checksum or signature (if provided) before running it. This is a crucial step.
        *   Use a reputable antivirus/anti-malware solution.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** `croc` relies on external libraries, and vulnerabilities in these libraries could be exploited.
*   **How `croc` Contributes:** `croc`'s code *directly incorporates and depends on* these external libraries. The security of `croc` is intrinsically linked to the security of its dependencies.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in a cryptographic library used by `croc` that allows for remote code execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Potentially Critical, depending on the specific dependency and vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Regularly audit and update dependencies. This is a continuous process.
        *   Use a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., `dependabot`, `snyk`) to automatically identify vulnerable dependencies.
        *   Consider using statically linked binaries to reduce the number of external dependencies (this has trade-offs, but can improve security).
        *   Choose dependencies carefully, favoring well-maintained libraries with a strong security track record.
    *   **User:** (Limited direct mitigation, relies on developer actions)
        *   Keep `croc` updated to the latest version. This ensures that you have the latest security patches, including updates to dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Relay Impersonation](./attack_surfaces/relay_impersonation.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker sets up a rogue relay server mimicking a legitimate one.
*   **How `croc` Contributes:** `croc`'s reliance on a user-specified relay server address makes it *inherently vulnerable* to impersonation if the user is tricked into using the wrong address.
*   **Example:** An attacker sets up a relay at `relay.croc-transfer.com` (note the subtle difference) and convinces users to use it instead of the legitimate `relay.croc.sh`.
*   **Impact:** Same as Relay Server Compromise (Critical).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developer:**
        * Implement a mechanism to *verify relay identity* (e.g., a public key or certificate). Display a clear warning to the user if the relay identity cannot be verified. This is a *crucial* mitigation.
    * **User:**
        * *Carefully* verify the relay address before using it. Double-check for typos or subtle differences.
        * Communicate the correct relay address through a secure channel.
