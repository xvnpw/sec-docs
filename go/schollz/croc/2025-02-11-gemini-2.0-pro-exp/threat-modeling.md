# Threat Model Analysis for schollz/croc

## Threat: [Relay Server Modification Attack](./threats/relay_server_modification_attack.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious relay server operator (or an attacker who has compromised the relay) actively modifies the data in transit. They attempt to inject malicious data or alter file contents, bypassing `croc`'s integrity checks. This implies a flaw in `croc`'s integrity mechanisms or a vulnerability that allows the attacker to circumvent them.
    *   **Impact:** Integrity of transferred files is compromised. The receiver receives a modified or corrupted file, potentially containing malicious code or altered data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `croc` relay server; `croc` client (specifically, the integrity verification logic); `github.com/schollz/croc/v9/pkg/croc.Send()`, `github.com/schollz/croc/v9/pkg/croc.Receive()`, and the underlying hashing/encryption functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust Integrity Verification:** Ensure `croc`'s integrity checks (hashing, encryption) are cryptographically strong and cannot be bypassed. This requires rigorous code review and potentially formal verification.
        *   **Independent Verification (Application-Level):** As a defense-in-depth measure, the receiving application *could* independently verify the file's integrity using a pre-shared hash (out-of-band). This mitigates the risk even if `croc`'s internal checks fail.
        *   **Auditing of Cryptographic Libraries:** Regularly audit the cryptographic libraries used by `croc` (e.g., for hashing and encryption) for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [`croc` Library Vulnerability Exploitation (Zero-Day)](./threats/_croc__library_vulnerability_exploitation__zero-day_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a previously *unknown* (zero-day) vulnerability in the `croc` library itself (or one of its direct dependencies, like `spake2` or the cryptographic libraries) to gain control of the application, intercept data, or cause other harm. This is a broad category encompassing any undiscovered flaws.
    *   **Impact:** Varies greatly depending on the specific vulnerability. Could range from data leakage (confidentiality breach) to complete system compromise (loss of control, integrity violation).
    *   **Affected Component:** Potentially *any* part of the `croc` library (`github.com/schollz/croc/v9/...`) or its direct dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (until proven otherwise, all unknown vulnerabilities must be treated as high risk).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Proactive Vulnerability Research:** Encourage security researchers to analyze `croc` and its dependencies for vulnerabilities (e.g., through bug bounty programs).
        *   **Fuzzing:** Employ fuzzing techniques to test `croc`'s code for unexpected inputs that might trigger vulnerabilities.
        *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to identify potential security flaws in `croc`'s codebase.
        *   **Dependency Auditing:** Continuously monitor `croc`'s dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
        *   **Rapid Patching:** Establish a process for quickly patching and deploying updates to `croc` in response to discovered vulnerabilities.
        *   **Defense in Depth (Application Level):** Implement security measures at the application level that can mitigate the impact of a `croc` vulnerability (e.g., sandboxing, input validation).

## Threat: [PAKE Bypass (Highly Unlikely, but Critical if Possible)](./threats/pake_bypass__highly_unlikely__but_critical_if_possible_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker finds a way to bypass or break the Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol (spake2) used by `croc`. This would allow them to intercept the file transfer *without* knowing the code phrase. This is extremely unlikely if `spake2` is implemented correctly and `croc` integrates it properly, but the impact is so severe that it warrants inclusion.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of confidentiality. The attacker can decrypt the transferred files.
    *   **Affected Component:** `github.com/schollz/croc/v9/pkg/croc.Send()`, `github.com/schollz/croc/v9/pkg/croc.Receive()`, the `spake2` library implementation, and `croc`'s integration of `spake2`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a bypass is found).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Formal Verification of `spake2`:** If feasible, formally verify the correctness of the `spake2` implementation used by `croc`.
        *   **Expert Cryptographic Review:** Have experienced cryptographers review the `spake2` implementation and its integration into `croc`.
        *   **Stay Updated:** Keep the `spake2` library and `croc` itself updated to the latest versions, as any security fixes will be included in updates.
        *   **Monitor for Research:** Stay informed about any published research on `spake2` or related cryptographic protocols that might reveal weaknesses.
