# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for schollz/croc

## Mitigation Strategy: [Relay Server Control (Self-Hosting or Strict Selection)](./mitigation_strategies/relay_server_control__self-hosting_or_strict_selection_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Self-Hosting (Strongly Preferred):**
        *   Compile and deploy the `croc` relay server software on a dedicated, internally managed server. This server should *not* be the same as the application server.
        *   Configure the `croc` clients (using the `-relay` flag) to *exclusively* connect to this self-hosted relay.  Example: `croc -relay "your.relay.address:9009" send file.txt`.
        *   Ensure the relay server's operating system and the `croc` relay software are kept up-to-date with security patches.
    2.  **Strict Public Relay Selection (If Self-Hosting is Impossible):**
        *   If self-hosting is absolutely not feasible, *explicitly* configure `croc` clients (using the `-relay` flag) to use a *pre-vetted, trusted* public relay.  Do *not* rely on the default.
        *   Document the rationale for choosing this specific public relay, including its security posture and provider reputation.
        *   Regularly re-evaluate the chosen public relay's trustworthiness.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Relay Server Compromise:** (Severity: High) - A compromised relay could allow interception, modification, or eavesdropping on file transfers. Self-hosting eliminates this risk from third parties. Strict selection minimizes it.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Relay:** (Severity: Medium) - A compromised or overloaded public relay could prevent `croc` from functioning. Self-hosting provides control over resources.
    *   **Data Leakage via Relay:** (Severity: High) - Even with encryption, metadata about transfers (filenames, sizes, IP addresses) could be exposed if the relay is compromised. Self-hosting protects this metadata.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Relay Server Compromise:** Significantly reduces risk (self-hosting eliminates it).
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Relay:** Moderately reduces risk (self-hosting provides more control).
    *   **Data Leakage via Relay:** Significantly reduces risk (self-hosting eliminates it).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Most likely using the default public relay, which is a high-risk configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Self-hosted relay server deployment and configuration.
    *   `croc` client configuration to use the self-hosted or strictly selected relay.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Phrase Complexity Enforcement (Requires Code Modification)](./mitigation_strategies/code_phrase_complexity_enforcement__requires_code_modification_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Source Code Modification:** Modify the `croc` source code (specifically, the parts related to code phrase generation and validation) to enforce minimum complexity requirements.
    2.  **Minimum Length:** Set a minimum length for code phrases (e.g., 12 characters or more).
    3.  **Character Requirements:** Require a mix of character types:
        *   Uppercase letters.
        *   Lowercase letters.
        *   Numbers.
        *   Symbols.
    4.  **Rejection of Weak Phrases:** The modified `croc` should reject code phrases that do not meet the defined complexity requirements, providing clear error messages to the user.
    5.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the modified code to ensure the complexity enforcement works as expected and does not introduce any bugs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Code Phrase Guessing/Brute-Forcing:** (Severity: Medium) - Makes it significantly harder for an attacker to guess or brute-force a code phrase.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Files:** (Severity: High) - Prevents unauthorized users from connecting and accessing files due to weak code phrases.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Phrase Guessing/Brute-Forcing:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Files:** Significantly reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented in the standard `croc` distribution. Relies entirely on user discretion.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   All aspects of this mitigation require source code modification.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Relay-Side Rate Limiting (Requires Code Modification)](./mitigation_strategies/relay-side_rate_limiting__requires_code_modification_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Source Code Modification (Relay Server):** Modify the `croc` relay server source code to implement rate limiting for connection attempts.
    2.  **Limit Attempts per IP:** Restrict the number of connection attempts allowed from a single IP address within a specific time window (e.g., 5 attempts per minute).
    3.  **Limit Attempts per Code Phrase:** Restrict the number of attempts to connect using the same code phrase within a specific time window.
    4.  **Adjustable Thresholds:** Make the rate limiting thresholds (number of attempts, time window) configurable.
    5.  **Logging:** Log all rate-limited attempts, including the IP address and code phrase (if applicable).
    6.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the rate limiting implementation to ensure it works as expected and does not inadvertently block legitimate users.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Code Phrase Brute-Forcing:** (Severity: Medium) - Significantly slows down brute-force attacks by limiting the number of attempts an attacker can make.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) on Relay:** (Severity: Medium) - Helps prevent a DoS attack that attempts to overwhelm the relay with connection requests.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Phrase Brute-Forcing:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) on Relay:** Moderately reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented in the standard `croc` distribution.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   All aspects of this mitigation require source code modification of the relay server.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Display Cryptographic Fingerprints (Requires Code Modification)](./mitigation_strategies/display_cryptographic_fingerprints__requires_code_modification_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Source Code Modification:** Modify the `croc` source code to calculate and display the cryptographic fingerprints (e.g., SHA256 hash) of the public keys used for the encrypted connection.
    2.  **Display on Both Ends:** Display the fingerprint on *both* the sending and receiving clients' terminals.
    3.  **Clear Presentation:** Present the fingerprint in a clear, easily readable format (e.g., hexadecimal representation).
    4.  **User Guidance:** Provide clear instructions to users on how to use the displayed fingerprints for out-of-band verification (see previous out-of-band verification strategy).
    5. **Testing:** Thoroughly test to ensure fingerprints are calculated and displayed correctly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** (Severity: High) - Enables users to verify that they are communicating with the intended party and not an attacker who has intercepted the connection. This is the *most effective* mitigation against MitM for `croc`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Significantly reduces risk when combined with out-of-band verification.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented in the standard `croc` distribution.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   All aspects of this mitigation require source code modification.

## Mitigation Strategy: [File Type Restrictions (Requires Code Modification)](./mitigation_strategies/file_type_restrictions__requires_code_modification_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Source Code Modification:** Modify the `croc` source code to implement file type restrictions.
    2.  **Define Allowed/Blocked Types:** Create a configurable list of allowed or blocked file extensions (e.g., allow only .txt, .pdf, .docx; block .exe, .bat, .sh).
    3.  **File Extension Check:** Before initiating a transfer, `croc` should check the file extension against the allowed/blocked list.
    4.  **Rejection and Error Message:** If a file type is not allowed, `croc` should reject the transfer and display a clear error message to the user.
    5.  **Configuration:** Provide a mechanism to configure the allowed/blocked file types (e.g., through a configuration file or command-line options).
    6. **Testing:** Thoroughly test to ensure file type restrictions are enforced correctly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malware Introduction:** (Severity: High) - Reduces the risk of transferring executable files or other potentially malicious file types.
    *   **Accidental Transfer of Sensitive Files:** (Severity: Medium) - Can be used to prevent the transfer of specific file types that might contain sensitive data (e.g., database files).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malware Introduction:** Significantly reduces risk (depending on the restrictions implemented).
    *   **Accidental Transfer of Sensitive Files:** Moderately reduces risk (depending on the restrictions implemented).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented in the standard `croc` distribution.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   All aspects of this mitigation require source code modification.
