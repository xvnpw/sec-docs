## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via Croc [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_croc__critical_node_.md)

This is the overall goal and inherently critical. Success means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application through `croc`.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise Data Transfer via Croc [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_data_transfer_via_croc__critical_node_.md)

This node represents a critical pathway as it targets the core functionality of `croc` within the application - data transfer. Compromising data transfer can lead to confidentiality, integrity, and availability breaches.

    * **2.1. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * **Network Eavesdropping [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                - Intercepting `croc` traffic on a network the application uses (e.g., public Wi-Fi, compromised LAN).
                - Techniques include ARP poisoning, rogue Wi-Fi access points, and network sniffing.
            * **Relay Server Compromise (If Relay Used) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                - Compromising the infrastructure of a relay server used by `croc` (if the application relies on relays).
                - This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the relay server software, gaining unauthorized access to the server, or compromising the network it resides on.
                - **Eavesdrop on traffic passing through compromised relay [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Once the relay is compromised, all traffic passing through it can be intercepted.

    * **2.2. Password Leakage/Social Engineering [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * **Obtain codeword through social engineering or leaked information [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                - Tricking users into revealing the `croc` codeword through phishing, pretexting, or other social engineering tactics.
                - Exploiting insecure communication channels where the codeword might be transmitted or stored (e.g., unencrypted chat, email).

    * **2.3. Relay Server Manipulation (If Relay Used) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * **Manipulate data passing through compromised relay server [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                - If a relay server is compromised, an attacker can not only eavesdrop but also modify data in transit.
                - This could involve injecting malicious code, altering file contents, or corrupting data being transferred.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Croc Software Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_croc_software_vulnerabilities.md)

This branch represents attacks that directly target vulnerabilities within the `croc` software itself.

    * **3.1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * **Resource Exhaustion [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                - Overwhelming the application or the `croc` process with a large number of connection requests, consuming resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and making the service unavailable.
                - **Send large number of connection requests to exhaust resources [HIGH RISK PATH].**
            * **Relay Server DoS (If Relay Used) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                - Targeting the relay server with DoS attacks to disrupt file transfers for all users relying on that relay.
                - **Relay Server DoS (If Relay Used) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH].**

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Abuse Croc Functionality for Malicious Purposes [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__abuse_croc_functionality_for_malicious_purposes__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

This branch highlights attacks that misuse the intended functionality of `croc` to achieve malicious goals, often leveraging social engineering or compromised senders.

    * **4.1. Malicious File Injection [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * **Send Malicious File as Sender [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                - An attacker acts as a sender and uses `croc` to send a file containing malware (viruses, Trojans, ransomware, etc.) disguised as a legitimate file to the application or its users.
                - **Attacker as sender sends malware disguised as legitimate file [HIGH RISK PATH].**

    * **4.2. Data Exfiltration (If attacker gains access) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * **Use Croc to exfiltrate sensitive data [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                - If an attacker has already gained unauthorized access to the application's system or data, they can use `croc` to exfiltrate sensitive information to an external system they control.

    * **4.3. Phishing/Social Engineering via Croc [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * **Trick user into accepting malicious file [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                - Using social engineering tactics to trick a user into accepting a `croc` file transfer from an attacker, where the file contains malware or leads to a phishing website.
                - This leverages the user's trust in the `croc` transfer process or the perceived sender.
