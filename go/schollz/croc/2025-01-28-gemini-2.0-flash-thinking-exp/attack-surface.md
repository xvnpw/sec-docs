# Attack Surface Analysis for schollz/croc

## Attack Surface: [Default Relay Server Compromise](./attack_surfaces/default_relay_server_compromise.md)

- **Description:** Reliance on the public `croc.schollz.com` relay server introduces risk if this server is compromised by a malicious actor.
- **Croc Contribution:** `croc` defaults to using this public relay server for connection brokering and potentially data relay if direct peer-to-peer connection fails. This is a core design choice in `croc`'s ease of use.
- **Example:** An attacker gains control of `croc.schollz.com`. Users transferring files unknowingly route their data through the attacker's server, allowing the attacker to intercept and potentially modify files in transit.
- **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, loss of confidentiality and integrity, denial of service if the relay is taken offline.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
    - **Self-Hosted Relay Server:** Deploy and use a private, self-hosted `croc` relay server within your controlled infrastructure. This completely removes dependency on the public server.
    - **VPN/Secure Network:** Use `croc` within a trusted and secure network environment (e.g., VPN) to minimize exposure even when relying on the default relay. This adds a layer of network security.

## Attack Surface: [Croc Application Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/croc_application_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities within the `croc` application code itself could be exploited by attackers.
- **Croc Contribution:** As with any software, `croc`'s codebase may contain vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, injection flaws) inherent to software development.
- **Example:** A crafted filename or file content sent during a `croc` transfer triggers a buffer overflow vulnerability in the receiving `croc` application, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the receiver's machine.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, compromise of user's system.
- **Risk Severity:** High (if remote code execution potential exists)
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
    - **Keep Croc Updated:** Regularly update `croc` to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the developers. This is crucial for addressing known vulnerabilities.
    - **Code Audits (If Modifying Croc):** If you are modifying or extending `croc`, conduct thorough security code audits to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities introduced in your changes. This is important for custom deployments.
    - **Sandbox/Isolate Croc (Advanced):**  Run `croc` in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the impact of potential exploits. This is a more advanced security measure for high-risk environments.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** `croc` relies on external libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect `croc` and introduce attack vectors.
- **Croc Contribution:** `croc`'s functionality is built upon external libraries for core functionalities like cryptography and networking.  The choice to use these dependencies directly introduces this attack surface.
- **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a cryptographic library used by `croc`. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability through `croc` to compromise the security of file transfers.
- **Impact:**  Varies depending on the dependency vulnerability - could range from information disclosure to remote code execution, potentially critical.
- **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability and its exploitability through `croc`)
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
    - **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan `croc`'s dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools. This is a proactive measure to identify risks.
    - **Dependency Updates:** Keep `croc`'s dependencies updated to the latest versions that include security patches. This is essential for patching known vulnerabilities.
