# Threat Model Analysis for schollz/croc

## Threat: [Predictable or Brute-forceable Passphrases](./threats/predictable_or_brute-forceable_passphrases.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to guess or brute-force the short passphrase generated by `croc` to gain unauthorized access to the file transfer. This could be done by repeatedly trying different combinations until the correct passphrase is found.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the file being transferred, potentially leading to data theft or exposure of sensitive information.

**Affected Croc Component:** Passphrase Generation

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Increase the complexity and length of the generated passphrase (if configurable within `croc`).
* Consider contributing to `croc` to enhance passphrase generation security.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Passphrase Exchange](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_passphrase_exchange.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the initial communication between the sender and receiver where the `croc` passphrase is exchanged. The attacker can then use this intercepted passphrase to establish their own connection and potentially intercept the file transfer.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the file being transferred, potentially leading to data theft or exposure of sensitive information.

**Affected Croc Component:** Connection Establishment, Initial Handshake

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Be aware of this inherent risk in `croc`'s default connection mechanism.
* Advise users to verify the connection through alternative means (e.g., verbally confirming a portion of the generated code).
* Explore if `croc` offers alternative secure pairing methods.

## Threat: [Compromised Relay Server (if used)](./threats/compromised_relay_server__if_used_.md)

**Description:** If the `croc` transfer relies on a public or untrusted relay server, that server could be compromised by malicious actors. This could allow the attacker to intercept, modify, or block file transfers passing through the compromised server.

**Impact:** Data interception, data modification, denial of service, potential exposure of metadata about the transfer.

**Affected Croc Component:** Relay Server Communication

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Prefer direct peer-to-peer connections whenever possible within `croc`.
* If relay servers are necessary, use trusted and well-maintained relay servers.
* Consider contributing to `croc` to allow for specifying trusted relay servers or implementing end-to-end verification even with relays.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Croc's Encryption Implementation](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_croc's_encryption_implementation.md)

**Description:**  A vulnerability exists in the cryptographic libraries or the way `croc` implements encryption, allowing an attacker to potentially decrypt the transferred data.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transferred using `croc`.

**Affected Croc Component:** Encryption Module

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep `croc` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
* Monitor security advisories related to `croc` and its dependencies.
* Consider contributing to `croc` by performing security audits or suggesting improvements to the encryption implementation.

## Threat: [Malicious File Transfer](./threats/malicious_file_transfer.md)

**Description:** An attacker uses `croc` to send a malicious file (e.g., malware, virus) to a user or system.

**Impact:** Compromise of the receiving system, data breach, denial of service, or other malicious activities depending on the nature of the malicious file.

**Affected Croc Component:** File Transfer Mechanism

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust file scanning and validation on the receiving end *outside* of `croc`'s functionality.
* Educate users about the risks of accepting files from unknown or untrusted sources via `croc`.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerability during File Transfer](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerability_during_file_transfer.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the filename or path information during the `croc` transfer to write the received file to an unintended location on the receiving system, potentially overwriting critical system files or placing malicious files in sensitive areas.

**Impact:** System compromise, privilege escalation, data corruption.

**Affected Croc Component:** File Handling, Path Processing

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict validation and sanitization of filenames and destination paths on the receiving end *before* passing them to `croc` or when handling the received file.
* If possible, avoid allowing users to directly specify the destination path when using `croc`.
