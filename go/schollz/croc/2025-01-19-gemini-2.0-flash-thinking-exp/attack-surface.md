# Attack Surface Analysis for schollz/croc

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Relay Servers](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_relay_servers.md)

* **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between two `croc` instances by controlling or compromising a relay server used for connection establishment or data transfer.
    * **How `croc` Contributes:** `croc`'s reliance on publicly accessible relay servers as a fallback mechanism introduces the risk of MITM attacks if these servers are compromised or malicious.
    * **Example:** An attacker operates a rogue relay server that intercepts the initial code exchange, allowing them to participate in the transfer without authorization. They could also eavesdrop on the encrypted data stream passing through their server.
    * **Impact:**  Eavesdropping on file transfers, potential manipulation of transferred data (though encryption mitigates this), and unauthorized access to the transfer.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement mechanisms to verify the authenticity and integrity of relay servers. Explore options for end-to-end encryption that minimizes reliance on relay server security. Allow users to specify trusted relay servers.
        * **Users:** Be aware that using relay servers increases risk. If possible, ensure a direct peer-to-peer connection.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Relay Servers Injecting Malicious Data](./attack_surfaces/compromised_relay_servers_injecting_malicious_data.md)

* **Description:** A malicious actor controlling a relay server injects or modifies data during the file transfer process.
    * **How `croc` Contributes:** While `croc` uses encryption, vulnerabilities in the implementation or negotiation could potentially be exploited by a compromised relay server to inject malicious content.
    * **Example:** A compromised relay server injects malware into a file being transferred, which the recipient unknowingly receives and executes.
    * **Impact:** Delivery of malware or corrupted files to the recipient, potentially leading to system compromise or data loss.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Ensure robust encryption and integrity checks are implemented throughout the transfer process. Consider adding mechanisms for the receiver to verify the integrity of the received file against the sender's original.
        * **Users:** Be cautious about transferring sensitive files through public relay servers. Always scan received files with up-to-date antivirus software.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in `croc`'s Encryption Implementation](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in__croc_'s_encryption_implementation.md)

* **Description:**  Weaknesses or flaws in the way `croc` implements encryption algorithms or manages cryptographic keys.
    * **How `croc` Contributes:**  Any vulnerabilities in the encryption implementation directly weaken the security of file transfers.
    * **Example:** A flaw in the key exchange mechanism allows an attacker to derive the encryption key, enabling them to decrypt intercepted traffic.
    * **Impact:**  Exposure of the transferred file contents to unauthorized parties.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  Employ secure coding practices when implementing encryption. Regularly audit the codebase for cryptographic vulnerabilities. Use well-vetted and established cryptographic libraries.
        * **Users:** Keep `croc` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via Filenames](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_filenames.md)

* **Description:**  An attacker crafts a filename containing malicious code or commands that are executed by the receiving system.
    * **How `croc` Contributes:** If `croc` doesn't properly sanitize filenames, it could allow the transfer of files with malicious filenames.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends a file with a filename like "; rm -rf /", which, if not properly handled by the receiving system, could lead to data loss.
    * **Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution or unintended system modifications on the receiving end.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement robust filename sanitization on both the sending and receiving ends of the `croc` transfer.
        * **Users:** Be cautious about receiving files with unusual or suspicious filenames.
