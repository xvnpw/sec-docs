## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Receiving Application's File Handling (AND relies on Croc's integrity) [HR] [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_receiving_application's_file_handling__and_relies_on_croc's_integrity___hr__42e8d9e8.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious file specifically designed to exploit a known vulnerability in how the receiving application processes files. This could be a buffer overflow, a format string bug, or any other vulnerability related to file parsing or handling. The attacker leverages Croc to transfer this malicious file to the application. The "reliance on Croc's integrity" implies the application might be making assumptions about the safety of files transferred via Croc, potentially skipping its own rigorous validation checks.
    * **Potential Impact:** This can lead to critical consequences, including arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the application, data breaches, denial of service, or complete system compromise.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Exploiting file handling vulnerabilities is a common and often successful attack vector. If the application trusts files received via Croc, it lowers the barrier for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Croc Invocation [HR] [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_croc_invocation__hr___cr_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application programmatically invokes the `croc` command-line tool, and it constructs the command using user-controlled input without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker can inject malicious commands into parameters like the filename or other arguments passed to the `croc` command. For example, if the application uses a user-provided filename directly in the `croc send` command, an attacker could provide a filename like `; rm -rf /` which would be executed on the server.
    * **Potential Impact:** This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the same privileges as the application. This can lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, installation of malware, or denial of service.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Command injection is a well-known and frequently exploited vulnerability in applications that interact with the operating system shell.

## Attack Tree Path: [Executes received files without validation [HR] [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/executes_received_files_without_validation__hr___cr_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application, upon receiving a file via Croc, directly executes it without any form of validation or security checks. This could involve running a script, executing a binary, or interpreting a file as code.
    * **Potential Impact:** This is a critical vulnerability that allows an attacker to directly execute malicious code on the server. The impact is immediate and can lead to complete system compromise.
    * **Why High-Risk:** This is a fundamental security flaw and a very direct path to system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path traversal vulnerabilities when saving files [HR] [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_vulnerabilities_when_saving_files__hr___cr_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses the filename provided during the Croc transfer to save the file on the server without properly sanitizing it. An attacker can craft a filename containing path traversal characters (e.g., `../../evil.sh`) to save the file in an unintended location. This could allow overwriting critical system files or placing executable files in vulnerable directories.
    * **Potential Impact:** This can lead to various security issues, including the ability to overwrite configuration files, place malicious scripts in web directories for execution, or even gain remote code execution if an executable is placed in a location where it will be run.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Path traversal is a common vulnerability, and it's relatively easy for attackers to exploit if filenames are not properly sanitized.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in the relay server infrastructure [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_the_relay_server_infrastructure__cr_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application relies on a specific, non-public relay server for its Croc transfers, an attacker could attempt to compromise that relay server by exploiting vulnerabilities in its operating system, software, or configuration.
    * **Potential Impact:** Compromising the relay server grants the attacker control over all transfers going through that server for the targeted application. This allows for interception, modification, or blocking of files, potentially leading to data breaches, injection of malicious payloads, or denial of service.
    * **Why Critical:** While the likelihood might be lower than application-level vulnerabilities, the impact of compromising the infrastructure is significant, affecting the integrity and confidentiality of all transfers routed through it.
