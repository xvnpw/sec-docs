Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the Cortex project.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Data Poisoning via Weak Distributor Authentication/Authorization

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack path leading to data poisoning in the Cortex system through weaknesses in the distributor's authentication and authorization mechanisms.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities, assess their exploitability, determine potential impacts, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to enhance the security posture of the Cortex distributor.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the following attack tree path:

*   **1. Data Poisoning**
    *   **1.1 Exploit Ingestion Path**
        *   **1.1.1 Weak Authentication/Authorization on Distributor**
            *   **1.1.1.2 Impersonate a legitimate client (e.g., weak API key management)**
            *   **1.1.2.2 Overwhelm rate limits (if not properly configured)**

The analysis will consider the Cortex distributor component, its interaction with clients (e.g., Prometheus instances, other agents), and the relevant configuration options related to authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.  We will *not* delve into other potential data poisoning attack vectors outside of this specific path (e.g., vulnerabilities in the ingester or querier).  We will also assume a standard Cortex deployment, without considering highly customized or unusual configurations unless explicitly mentioned.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the relevant sections of the Cortex codebase (primarily in the `github.com/cortexproject/cortex` repository) related to the distributor, authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.  This includes reviewing the Go code, configuration files, and any relevant documentation.
2.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Analyze the default and recommended configurations for the distributor, focusing on settings that impact security.  Identify potential misconfigurations that could lead to vulnerabilities.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Apply threat modeling principles to identify potential attack scenarios based on the identified vulnerabilities.  This includes considering attacker motivations, capabilities, and resources.
4.  **Vulnerability Assessment:**  Assess the likelihood, impact, effort, skill level, and detection difficulty of each identified vulnerability, consistent with the provided attack tree.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  Propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies to address each identified vulnerability.  These recommendations should be prioritized based on their effectiveness and feasibility.
6.  **Documentation Review:** Consult official Cortex documentation, blog posts, and community discussions to understand best practices and known security considerations.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

#### 1.1.1.2 Impersonate a legitimate client (e.g., weak API key management)

*   **Details (Expanded):**  Cortex, by default, relies on gRPC for communication between components and can use various authentication mechanisms.  A common approach is to use API keys (or tokens) passed as metadata in gRPC requests.  If these keys are not managed securely, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the distributor and inject malicious metrics.  This could involve:
    *   **Hardcoded Keys:**  Keys embedded directly in client code or configuration files, making them easily discoverable through code analysis or accidental exposure.
    *   **Weak Key Generation:**  Using predictable or easily guessable keys (e.g., short keys, keys based on easily obtainable information).
    *   **Insecure Key Storage:**  Storing keys in plaintext in insecure locations (e.g., unencrypted files, version control systems, publicly accessible cloud storage).
    *   **Lack of Key Rotation:**  Using the same keys for extended periods without rotation, increasing the risk of compromise.
    *   **Insufficient Access Control:**  Using the same key for multiple clients with different access needs, violating the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Lack of Auditing:**  Not logging or monitoring key usage, making it difficult to detect unauthorized access.

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   `pkg/distributor/distributor.go`: Examine how the distributor handles incoming requests, extracts authentication information (e.g., from gRPC metadata), and validates it.
    *   `pkg/util/grpc/auth.go`:  Review the authentication middleware and how it interacts with different authentication providers.
    *   Configuration options related to authentication (e.g., `-distributor.client-authentication-tenant-id-header`, `-distributor.client-authentication-basic-auth-username`, `-distributor.client-authentication-basic-auth-password`).

*   **Vulnerability Assessment (Confirmed):**
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium (The likelihood depends heavily on the specific deployment and key management practices.  Poor practices are common.)
    *   *Impact:* High (Successful impersonation allows the attacker to inject arbitrary metrics, potentially leading to incorrect alerts, dashboards, and automated decisions based on poisoned data.  This can disrupt operations, cause financial losses, or even compromise safety in critical systems.)
    *   *Effort:* Low to Medium (Obtaining a valid key can be easy if it's hardcoded or stored insecurely.  Brute-forcing weak keys is also feasible.)
    *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate (Requires understanding of gRPC, API keys, and potentially some knowledge of the target system.)
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (Detecting impersonation requires monitoring API key usage and identifying anomalous patterns.  This can be challenging without proper logging and intrusion detection systems.)

*   **Mitigation Recommendations:**

    1.  **Strong Authentication:**
        *   **Use strong, randomly generated API keys.**  Avoid short, predictable, or easily guessable keys.  Use a cryptographically secure random number generator.
        *   **Implement a robust key management system.**  This could involve a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to securely store, rotate, and manage API keys.
        *   **Enforce key rotation.**  Regularly rotate API keys to limit the impact of a compromised key.  Automate the key rotation process whenever possible.
        *   **Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.**  mTLS provides stronger authentication than API keys by requiring both the client and server to present valid certificates. This is the recommended approach.
        *   **Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) if feasible.**  MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of authentication.

    2.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
        *   **Assign unique API keys to each client.**  Avoid using the same key for multiple clients.
        *   **Grant clients only the necessary permissions.**  For example, a client that only needs to push metrics should not have access to query data.  Cortex's tenant ID system can be used to enforce this separation.

    3.  **Auditing and Monitoring:**
        *   **Log all API key usage.**  Include timestamps, client IP addresses, and the specific operations performed.
        *   **Monitor API key usage for anomalous patterns.**  This could include unusual request rates, unexpected client IP addresses, or attempts to access unauthorized resources.
        *   **Implement alerting for suspicious activity.**  Configure alerts to notify administrators of potential security breaches.

    4.  **Secure Configuration:**
        *   **Never hardcode API keys in client code or configuration files.**
        *   **Store API keys securely.**  Use a secrets management solution or encrypted configuration files.
        *   **Regularly review and update security configurations.**

#### 1.1.2.2 Overwhelm rate limits (if not properly configured)

*   **Details (Expanded):**  Cortex provides rate limiting capabilities to protect the distributor from being overwhelmed by excessive requests.  However, if rate limits are not configured correctly (or are disabled), an attacker can flood the distributor with a large volume of data.  This can lead to:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The distributor becomes unresponsive, preventing legitimate clients from sending data.
    *   **Data Loss:**  The distributor may drop incoming data if it cannot process it quickly enough.
    *   **Data Corruption:**  While less direct than injecting malicious data, overwhelming the system can indirectly lead to data corruption if it causes internal errors or inconsistencies.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The distributor consumes excessive CPU, memory, and network bandwidth, potentially impacting other services running on the same infrastructure.

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   `pkg/distributor/distributor.go`: Examine how the distributor implements rate limiting, including the relevant configuration options and the logic for enforcing limits.
    *   `pkg/util/limiter/limiter.go`: Review the rate limiting implementation itself.
    *   Configuration options related to rate limiting (e.g., `-distributor.ingestion-rate-limit-mb`, `-distributor.ingestion-burst-size-mb`, `-distributor.per-user-override-config`).

*   **Vulnerability Assessment (Confirmed):**
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium to High (Default configurations may not be sufficiently restrictive for all deployments.  Administrators may disable rate limiting for troubleshooting or performance reasons, leaving the system vulnerable.)
    *   *Impact:* Medium (The impact ranges from temporary service disruption to data loss and resource exhaustion.  The severity depends on the scale of the attack and the resilience of the system.)
    *   *Effort:* Low (Sending a large volume of data is relatively easy, especially with automated tools.)
    *   *Skill Level:* Novice (Requires minimal technical expertise.)
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy (Rate limiting violations are typically logged and can be easily detected through monitoring tools.)

*   **Mitigation Recommendations:**

    1.  **Configure Rate Limits:**
        *   **Enable rate limiting on the distributor.**  This is a fundamental security measure.
        *   **Set appropriate rate limits based on expected traffic patterns and system capacity.**  Consider both the overall ingestion rate and the burst size.  Start with conservative limits and gradually increase them as needed, monitoring performance and resource utilization.
        *   **Use per-user rate limits.**  This prevents a single malicious client from consuming all available resources.  Cortex's tenant ID system can be used to enforce per-user limits.
        *   **Regularly review and adjust rate limits.**  Traffic patterns can change over time, so it's important to periodically review and adjust rate limits to ensure they remain effective.

    2.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**
        *   **Monitor rate limiting metrics.**  Cortex exposes metrics related to rate limiting, such as the number of requests that have been rate-limited.
        *   **Configure alerts for rate limiting violations.**  This allows administrators to quickly respond to potential attacks.

    3.  **Resilient Architecture:**
        *   **Use a load balancer in front of the distributor.**  This can help distribute traffic and prevent a single distributor from being overwhelmed.
        *   **Scale the distributor horizontally.**  Deploy multiple distributor instances to increase capacity and resilience.
        *   **Implement circuit breakers.**  Circuit breakers can automatically stop sending requests to a failing distributor, preventing cascading failures.

    4. **Input Validation:**
        * While not directly related to *overwhelming* rate limits, validating the *content* of incoming data is crucial. Even if rate limits are in place, an attacker could send a smaller amount of highly malicious data. Implement checks to ensure that the data conforms to expected formats and ranges. This prevents injection of crafted data that might exploit vulnerabilities further down the processing pipeline.

### 3. Conclusion

This deep analysis has identified two critical vulnerabilities within the specified attack tree path: impersonation of legitimate clients and overwhelming rate limits. Both vulnerabilities can lead to data poisoning and other serious consequences.  The provided mitigation recommendations offer a comprehensive approach to addressing these vulnerabilities, focusing on strong authentication, proper rate limiting, secure configuration, and robust monitoring.  By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly enhance the security posture of the Cortex distributor and protect the system from data poisoning attacks.  Regular security audits and penetration testing are also recommended to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.
