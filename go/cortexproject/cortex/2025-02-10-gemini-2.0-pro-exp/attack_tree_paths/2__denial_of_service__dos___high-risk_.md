### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Path 2.1.1

**2.1. Understanding the Cortex Distributor**

The Cortex distributor is the entry point for write requests.  Its primary responsibilities include:

*   **Request Validation:**  Performing basic checks on incoming write requests (e.g., authentication, authorization, data format).
*   **Routing:**  Determining which ingester(s) should receive the data based on the configured sharding strategy (typically consistent hashing based on tenant ID and labels).
*   **Load Balancing:**  Distributing the write load across multiple ingester instances.
*   **Buffering (Limited):**  Potentially buffering requests temporarily if ingesters are unavailable or overloaded.

**2.2. Vulnerability Analysis**

Several vulnerabilities can be exploited by a flood of write requests:

*   **Insufficient Rate Limiting:**  If the distributor does not enforce strict rate limits per tenant or per source IP address, an attacker can easily overwhelm it.  This is the *primary* vulnerability.  The absence of, or poorly configured, rate limiting is a critical weakness.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Distributor):**  Even with some rate limiting, a sufficiently large and coordinated attack (DDoS) could exhaust the distributor's resources (CPU, memory, network connections).  The distributor might become a bottleneck.
*   **Upstream Connection Exhaustion:**  The distributor's connections to the ingesters could become saturated, preventing it from forwarding requests even if the ingesters themselves have capacity.
*   **Inefficient Request Handling:**  Poorly optimized code for handling incoming requests (e.g., excessive locking, inefficient data parsing) can exacerbate the impact of a flood.
*   **Lack of Backpressure Mechanism:** If the distributor doesn't have a mechanism to signal backpressure to clients when it's overloaded, clients might continue sending requests, worsening the situation.
*   **Single Point of Failure:** If only a small number of distributor instances are deployed, they become a more attractive target.

**2.3. Impact Assessment**

A successful attack can lead to:

*   **Service Degradation:**  Legitimate write requests experience high latency or are dropped entirely.
*   **Data Loss:**  If requests are dropped, data is lost.  This is a critical impact for a time-series database.
*   **Cascading Failures:**  The overloaded distributor can impact other components, potentially leading to a complete system outage.  Ingesters might become overwhelmed if the distributor suddenly recovers and forwards a large backlog of requests.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Service disruptions can damage the reputation of the service provider.
*   **Financial Loss:**  Depending on the application, data loss and downtime can have significant financial consequences.

**2.4. Mitigation Strategies**

Here are specific, actionable mitigation strategies, categorized for clarity:

*   **2.4.1. Core Mitigation: Robust Rate Limiting:**
    *   **Implement Per-Tenant Rate Limiting:**  This is *crucial*.  Cortex *should* already have this capability, but it needs to be configured correctly.  Set appropriate limits based on expected usage patterns and service level agreements (SLAs).  Use the `limits` configuration in Cortex.  Specifically, look at `ingestion_rate_limit` and `ingestion_burst_size`.
    *   **Implement Per-Source IP Rate Limiting:**  As a secondary defense, limit the number of requests from a single IP address.  This helps mitigate attacks from botnets.  This might require external components like a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Envoy) or a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
    *   **Dynamic Rate Limiting:**  Consider implementing adaptive rate limiting that adjusts limits based on current system load.  This can help maintain performance during legitimate traffic spikes while still protecting against attacks.
    *   **Reject Requests Above Limit:**  When a rate limit is exceeded, the distributor should *immediately* reject the request with a clear error code (e.g., HTTP 429 Too Many Requests) and a `Retry-After` header.  *Do not queue excessive requests*.

*   **2.4.2. Resource Management and Scaling:**
    *   **Horizontal Scaling:**  Deploy multiple distributor instances behind a load balancer.  This increases the overall capacity and resilience of the system.  Use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) if running in Kubernetes.
    *   **Resource Quotas:**  Configure resource limits (CPU, memory) for the distributor pods/containers to prevent them from consuming excessive resources.  Use Kubernetes resource requests and limits.
    *   **Connection Pooling:**  Use connection pooling to efficiently manage connections to the ingesters, reducing connection overhead.

*   **2.4.3. Network-Level Defenses:**
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Deploy a WAF to filter malicious traffic and block known attack patterns.  WAFs can often detect and mitigate volumetric DDoS attacks.
    *   **DDoS Mitigation Service:**  Consider using a cloud-based DDoS mitigation service (e.g., AWS Shield, Cloudflare DDoS Protection) to absorb large-scale attacks.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Cortex deployment from other systems to limit the impact of a successful attack.

*   **2.4.4. Code and Configuration Optimization:**
    *   **Review Request Handling Code:**  Examine the distributor's code for potential performance bottlenecks and optimize it for efficiency.  Focus on minimizing lock contention and avoiding unnecessary memory allocations.
    *   **Timeout Configuration:**  Set appropriate timeouts for all network operations to prevent slow requests from consuming resources indefinitely.
    *   **Backpressure Implementation:** Implement a mechanism for the distributor to signal backpressure to clients when it's overloaded. This could involve rejecting requests or using a more sophisticated protocol.

*   **2.4.5. Operational Best Practices:**
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement comprehensive monitoring of distributor metrics (request rate, latency, error rate, resource usage) and set up alerts for anomalous behavior.  Prometheus (which Cortex uses) is excellent for this.  Specifically, monitor `cortex_distributor_ingest_requests_total`, `cortex_distributor_ingest_requests_failed_total`, `cortex_distributor_ingest_request_duration_seconds`, and resource usage metrics.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
    *   **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop and maintain an incident response plan to handle DoS attacks effectively.

**2.5. Detection Mechanisms**

*   **Metrics Monitoring:** Monitor key metrics like:
    *   `cortex_distributor_ingest_requests_total`: A sudden spike indicates a potential flood.
    *   `cortex_distributor_ingest_requests_failed_total`: Increased failures, especially with 429 errors, are a strong indicator.
    *   `cortex_distributor_ingest_request_duration_seconds`: Increased latency suggests the distributor is struggling.
    *   Resource usage (CPU, memory, network) of the distributor pods.
*   **Log Analysis:** Analyze logs for:
    *   A high volume of requests from a single IP address or tenant.
    *   Frequent 429 (Too Many Requests) error codes.
*   **Traffic Analysis:** Use network monitoring tools to detect unusual traffic patterns, such as a large number of incoming connections or a high volume of data.
*   **Alerting:** Configure alerts based on thresholds for the above metrics and log patterns.

**2.6. Testing and Validation**

*   **Load Testing:** Use load testing tools (e.g., `wrk`, `k6`, `Loki logcli`) to simulate high write loads and verify that rate limiting is working as expected.  Specifically, test scenarios *exceeding* the configured rate limits.
*   **Chaos Engineering:** Introduce controlled failures (e.g., network partitions, resource constraints) to test the system's resilience and recovery mechanisms.  Tools like Chaos Mesh can be used in Kubernetes environments.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Engage security professionals to conduct penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by automated tools.
*   **Red Team Exercises:** Simulate realistic attack scenarios to test the effectiveness of the incident response plan.
