Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Unauthorized Data Ingestion" attack surface for a Cortex-based application, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: Unauthorized Data Ingestion in Cortex

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Unauthorized Data Ingestion" attack surface within a Cortex deployment.  This includes identifying specific vulnerabilities, assessing potential attack vectors, and recommending concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview.  The goal is to provide the development team with a detailed understanding of the risks and practical steps to harden the system against this specific threat.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack surface related to unauthorized data ingestion into the Cortex system.  It encompasses:

*   **Cortex Components:**  The analysis will primarily focus on the Distributor, Ingester, and any relevant API gateways or load balancers that handle incoming write requests.  We will also consider the interaction with the underlying storage (e.g., chunks storage).
*   **Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms:**  We will examine the implementation and configuration of authentication (identifying the sender) and authorization (verifying the sender's permissions) mechanisms used for the ingestion path.
*   **Data Validation and Sanitization:**  We will analyze the extent and effectiveness of data validation and sanitization procedures applied to incoming data.
*   **Rate Limiting:** We will assess the configuration and effectiveness of rate limiting mechanisms.
*   **Network Configuration:** We will consider network-level controls that can impact this attack surface.

This analysis *excludes* other attack surfaces related to Cortex, such as query-path vulnerabilities or attacks targeting the configuration or management interfaces.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Examine relevant sections of the Cortex codebase (Distributor, Ingester, authentication/authorization middleware) to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.  This includes reviewing how authentication tokens are handled, how authorization checks are performed, and how data is validated.
*   **Configuration Review:**  Analyze example and recommended deployment configurations (YAML files, Helm charts) to identify potential misconfigurations that could lead to unauthorized data ingestion.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Develop specific attack scenarios based on common attacker techniques and the identified vulnerabilities.  This will help us understand the practical implications of the risks.
*   **Penetration Testing (Conceptual):**  Outline potential penetration testing approaches that could be used to validate the effectiveness of the implemented mitigations.  This will not involve actual penetration testing, but rather a description of the tests that *should* be performed.
*   **Best Practices Review:**  Compare the current implementation and configuration against industry best practices for securing API endpoints and data ingestion pipelines.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 4.1. Attack Vectors and Vulnerabilities

Based on the description and scope, the following attack vectors and vulnerabilities are of primary concern:

*   **4.1.1. Authentication Bypass/Weaknesses:**

    *   **Missing Authentication:**  If authentication is not enforced at all, any client can send data to the ingestion endpoint. This is the most severe vulnerability.
    *   **Weak Authentication Mechanisms:**  Using easily guessable API keys, or relying on weak or improperly configured JWT validation (e.g., not validating the signature, issuer, or audience) allows attackers to forge credentials.
    *   **mTLS Misconfiguration:**  If mTLS is used, incorrect configuration of the certificate authority (CA) or client certificate validation can allow attackers to present forged certificates.
    *   **Token Leakage:**  If authentication tokens (API keys, JWTs) are leaked through insecure logging, error messages, or exposed configuration files, attackers can reuse them.
    *   **Session Fixation:** If session management is flawed, an attacker might be able to hijack a legitimate session.

*   **4.1.2. Authorization Failures:**

    *   **Missing Authorization Checks:**  Even with authentication, if authorization is not enforced, any authenticated client (even a legitimate tenant) could write data to any other tenant's stream.
    *   **Incorrect Tenant Isolation:**  If the logic for separating data by tenant is flawed (e.g., incorrect parsing of tenant IDs from headers or tokens), cross-tenant data injection can occur.
    *   **RBAC Misconfiguration:**  If Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is used, overly permissive roles (e.g., granting write access to all tenants) can lead to unauthorized data ingestion.
    *   **Bypassing Authorization Logic:**  Vulnerabilities in the code that performs authorization checks (e.g., logic errors, injection vulnerabilities) could allow attackers to bypass these checks.

*   **4.1.3. Insufficient Data Validation:**

    *   **Missing or Weak Validation:**  If incoming data is not validated against a schema or expected ranges, attackers can inject malicious data (e.g., extremely large values, invalid timestamps, crafted label names/values).
    *   **Bypassing Validation:**  If the validation logic itself is vulnerable (e.g., regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerabilities), attackers can craft inputs that bypass the validation checks.
    *   **Type Confusion:**  If the system doesn't properly handle different data types, attackers might be able to inject data that is misinterpreted, leading to unexpected behavior.

*   **4.1.4. Inadequate Rate Limiting:**

    *   **Missing Rate Limiting:**  Without rate limiting, attackers can flood the system with data, causing denial of service (DoS) or overwhelming the storage.
    *   **High Rate Limits:**  If rate limits are set too high, they are ineffective at preventing abuse.
    *   **Bypassing Rate Limiting:**  Attackers might be able to bypass rate limiting by using multiple IP addresses, rotating API keys, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the rate limiting implementation.

*   **4.1.5. Network-Level Vulnerabilities:**

    *   **Exposure of Ingestion Endpoint:**  If the ingestion endpoint is directly exposed to the public internet without proper network segmentation or firewall rules, it is more vulnerable to attack.
    *   **Lack of Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention:**  Without network-level monitoring and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), attacks might go unnoticed.

### 4.2. Specific Code and Configuration Considerations (Cortex)

*   **Distributor:**  The Distributor is the primary entry point for write requests.  The code handling authentication (e.g., `ValidateRequest` function, middleware) and routing based on tenant ID (e.g., `Distributor.Push` function) needs careful review.
*   **Ingester:**  The Ingester receives data from the Distributor and writes it to storage.  The code handling data validation and appending to chunks (e.g., `Ingester.Push` function) is critical.
*   **Authentication Middleware:**  Cortex uses middleware for authentication (e.g., `middleware.AuthenticateUser`).  The implementation of this middleware, including how it extracts and validates tenant IDs from headers or tokens, is crucial.
*   **Configuration Files (YAML):**  The Cortex configuration file defines authentication methods, rate limits, and other security-related settings.  Misconfigurations here can easily lead to vulnerabilities.  Specific areas to examine:
    *   `distributor.ingestion_rate_limit` and `distributor.ingestion_burst_size`
    *   `limits_config` (per-tenant limits)
    *   Authentication-related settings (e.g., `auth_enabled`, `jwt_validation_config`)
*   **Helm Charts:**  If Cortex is deployed using Helm, the Helm chart values need to be reviewed to ensure secure defaults and prevent misconfigurations.

### 4.3. Threat Modeling Scenarios

*   **Scenario 1:  Anonymous Data Injection:**  An attacker discovers that the Cortex ingestion endpoint is exposed without authentication.  They send a large volume of fabricated metrics, causing a denial of service and corrupting the data.
*   **Scenario 2:  Tenant Impersonation:**  An attacker obtains a leaked API key for a legitimate tenant.  They use this key to inject malicious data into that tenant's stream, causing false alerts and incorrect dashboards.
*   **Scenario 3:  Cross-Tenant Data Injection:**  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the tenant ID extraction logic to inject data into a different tenant's stream, despite having valid credentials for their own tenant.
*   **Scenario 4:  Data Poisoning:**  An attacker injects carefully crafted data that is designed to poison machine learning models trained on the Cortex data.
*   **Scenario 5:  Rate Limit Bypass:** An attacker uses a botnet to send data from multiple IP addresses, circumventing the per-IP rate limits and overwhelming the system.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The following mitigation strategies provide more detail and context than the initial high-level overview:

*   **4.4.1. Strong Authentication:**

    *   **Mandatory Authentication:**  Enforce authentication for *all* ingestion requests.  Do not allow any anonymous access.
    *   **mTLS:**  Prefer mTLS for service-to-service communication (e.g., between Prometheus and Cortex).  Ensure proper CA configuration and client certificate validation.  Regularly rotate certificates.
    *   **JWT with Strong Validation:**  If using JWTs, ensure:
        *   **Strong Signature Algorithm:**  Use a strong signature algorithm (e.g., RS256, ES256).
        *   **Issuer and Audience Validation:**  Always validate the `iss` (issuer) and `aud` (audience) claims.
        *   **Expiration Validation:**  Always validate the `exp` (expiration) claim.
        *   **Tenant Claim:**  Include a tenant ID claim (e.g., `tenant_id`) in the JWT and use this for authorization.
        *   **Secure Key Management:**  Protect the secret key used for signing JWTs.  Use a secure key management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
    *   **API Keys (Less Preferred):**  If API keys are used, ensure they are:
        *   **Long and Random:**  Use long, randomly generated API keys.
        *   **Stored Securely:**  Store API keys securely (e.g., in a secrets management system).
        *   **Regularly Rotated:**  Implement a process for regularly rotating API keys.
    *   **Token Revocation:** Implement a mechanism for revoking compromised tokens (JWTs or API keys).

*   **4.4.2. Strict Authorization:**

    *   **Tenant-Based Authorization:**  Enforce strict tenant isolation.  Ensure that each tenant can only write to their own streams.  This should be enforced at the Distributor and Ingester levels.
    *   **RBAC:**  Implement RBAC to limit write access based on roles.  Grant the minimum necessary privileges.
    *   **Authorization Logic Review:**  Thoroughly review the code that performs authorization checks to ensure it is correct and cannot be bypassed.

*   **4.4.3. Comprehensive Data Validation:**

    *   **Schema Validation:**  Define a schema for the expected data format (label names, label values, data types) and validate incoming data against this schema.
    *   **Range Checks:**  Validate that sample values and timestamps fall within expected ranges.
    *   **Label Name and Value Validation:**  Validate label names and values to prevent injection attacks and ensure they conform to Prometheus naming conventions.
    *   **Regular Expression Security:**  If regular expressions are used for validation, ensure they are not vulnerable to ReDoS attacks.  Use safe regular expression libraries and carefully review the expressions.
    * **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all input to prevent injection attacks.

*   **4.4.4. Robust Rate Limiting:**

    *   **Per-Tenant Rate Limits:**  Implement per-tenant rate limits to prevent any single tenant from overwhelming the system.
    *   **Global Rate Limits:**  Implement global rate limits to protect the system from overall overload.
    *   **Dynamic Rate Limiting:**  Consider using dynamic rate limiting that adjusts based on system load.
    *   **Rate Limiting Bypass Prevention:**  Monitor for and mitigate attempts to bypass rate limiting (e.g., by using multiple IP addresses).

*   **4.4.5. Network Security:**

    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Cortex ingestion endpoint from the public internet using network segmentation and firewalls.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Use a WAF to protect the ingestion endpoint from common web attacks.
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Deploy IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic for malicious activity.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.

* **4.4.6. Observability and Alerting**
    * Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect and respond to unauthorized data ingestion attempts.
    * Configure alerts for suspicious activity, such as failed authentication attempts, high ingestion rates, or invalid data.

## 5. Penetration Testing (Conceptual)

The following penetration tests should be performed to validate the effectiveness of the mitigations:

*   **Authentication Bypass Tests:**  Attempt to send data to the ingestion endpoint without authentication, with invalid credentials, with expired tokens, and with forged tokens.
*   **Authorization Bypass Tests:**  Attempt to write data to another tenant's stream using valid credentials for a different tenant.
*   **Data Validation Bypass Tests:**  Attempt to inject data that violates the defined schema, exceeds range limits, or contains malicious characters.
*   **Rate Limiting Bypass Tests:**  Attempt to exceed the configured rate limits using various techniques (e.g., multiple IP addresses, rotating API keys).
*   **Fuzzing:**  Send a large number of randomly generated requests to the ingestion endpoint to identify unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

## 6. Conclusion

Unauthorized data ingestion is a high-severity risk for Cortex deployments.  By implementing the detailed mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, and by regularly performing penetration testing and security audits, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this attack and ensure the integrity and reliability of the Cortex system.  Continuous monitoring and a proactive security posture are essential for maintaining a secure Cortex deployment.
