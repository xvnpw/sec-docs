Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Unauthorized Query Execution" attack surface for a Cortex-based application, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: Unauthorized Query Execution in Cortex

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with unauthorized query execution against a Cortex deployment, identify specific vulnerabilities, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview.  We aim to provide the development team with the information needed to harden the system against this specific attack vector.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the "Unauthorized Query Execution" attack surface, as described in the provided context.  It encompasses:

*   The Cortex query API (PromQL) and its interaction with the query-frontend and querier components.
*   Potential attack vectors that exploit weaknesses in authentication, authorization, and query validation.
*   The impact of successful attacks, including data breaches and denial-of-service scenarios.
*   Mitigation strategies, including configuration best practices, code-level changes, and operational procedures.
*   The analysis *does not* cover other attack surfaces (e.g., attacks against the distributor or ingester) except where they directly relate to unauthorized query execution.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use a threat modeling approach to identify potential attackers, their motivations, and the specific steps they might take to execute unauthorized queries.  This includes considering both external attackers and malicious insiders.
2.  **Code Review (Conceptual):** While we don't have direct access to the specific application code, we will conceptually review the relevant Cortex components (query-frontend, querier) based on the official documentation and open-source codebase to identify potential vulnerability points.
3.  **Configuration Analysis:** We will analyze recommended and default Cortex configurations to identify settings that impact query authorization and security.
4.  **Best Practices Review:** We will leverage industry best practices for API security, access control, and query validation to identify potential gaps and recommend improvements.
5.  **Vulnerability Research:** We will research known vulnerabilities and exploits related to PromQL and similar query languages to understand common attack patterns.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Unauthorized Query Execution

### 4.1. Threat Modeling

**Potential Attackers:**

*   **External Attacker (Unauthenticated):**  An attacker with no prior access attempts to directly access the query API.
*   **External Attacker (Compromised Credentials):** An attacker gains access to valid credentials (e.g., through phishing, credential stuffing, or leaked secrets).
*   **Malicious Insider:**  A user with legitimate access to *some* data abuses their privileges to access unauthorized data or disrupt the system.
*   **Compromised Service Account:** An attacker compromises a service account used by another application that has access to the Cortex query API.

**Attacker Motivations:**

*   **Data Theft:**  Stealing sensitive metrics data for competitive advantage, financial gain, or espionage.
*   **System Disruption:**  Causing a denial-of-service by overwhelming the query engine with complex or resource-intensive queries.
*   **Reconnaissance:**  Gathering information about the infrastructure and monitored systems to plan further attacks.
*   **Reputation Damage:**  Causing a data breach or service outage to damage the organization's reputation.

**Attack Steps (Example - Unauthenticated Attacker):**

1.  **Discovery:** The attacker identifies the Cortex query API endpoint (e.g., through network scanning, exposed documentation, or misconfigured load balancers).
2.  **Direct Access Attempt:** The attacker sends a PromQL query directly to the API endpoint without providing any authentication credentials.
3.  **Exploitation (if successful):** If authentication is not enforced, the attacker receives the results of the query, potentially gaining access to sensitive data.
4.  **Escalation (optional):** The attacker may use the obtained data to identify further vulnerabilities or escalate their privileges.

**Attack Steps (Example - Malicious Insider):**

1.  **Legitimate Access:** The insider already has legitimate access to the Cortex query API, but only for a specific tenant or set of metrics.
2.  **Bypass Authorization:** The insider crafts a query that attempts to access data outside their authorized scope (e.g., by querying a different tenant ID or using wildcard selectors).
3.  **Exploitation (if successful):** If authorization checks are insufficient, the insider receives the unauthorized data.
4.  **Data Exfiltration:** The insider exfiltrates the stolen data.

### 4.2. Code Review (Conceptual) & Configuration Analysis

Based on the Cortex architecture and documentation, the following areas are critical for preventing unauthorized query execution:

*   **`query-frontend`:**
    *   **Authentication Middleware:**  This is the first line of defense.  Cortex supports various authentication mechanisms (e.g., basic auth, JWT, mTLS).  Misconfiguration or absence of this middleware is a critical vulnerability.  The middleware should be configured to reject unauthenticated requests *before* any query processing occurs.
    *   **Authorization Middleware:**  After authentication, authorization checks should be performed.  This typically involves verifying that the authenticated user/service has permission to access the requested data (tenant-based authorization).  Cortex uses a concept of "tenants" to isolate data.  The authorization middleware should enforce these tenant boundaries rigorously.  RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) should be implemented to grant granular permissions.
    *   **Query Validation:**  The `query-frontend` should perform basic validation of the incoming PromQL query to prevent obviously malicious or malformed queries.  This includes checking for syntax errors and potentially rejecting queries that are excessively long or complex.
    *   **Query Splitting and Caching:** While primarily for performance, these features can indirectly impact security.  Misconfigured caching could potentially leak data between tenants if not properly isolated.

*   **`querier`:**
    *   **Tenant Isolation:**  The `querier` is responsible for fetching data from the underlying storage.  It must ensure strict tenant isolation to prevent data leakage.  This relies on the `query-frontend` correctly passing the tenant ID and the `querier` enforcing it during data retrieval.
    *   **Resource Limits:**  The `querier` should enforce limits on the resources consumed by a single query (e.g., memory, CPU, number of samples).  This prevents denial-of-service attacks.  These limits should be configurable per tenant.

*   **Cortex Configuration (YAML):**
    *   **`auth_enabled`:**  This flag globally enables or disables authentication.  It *must* be set to `true` in production environments.
    *   **`limits`:**  This section defines various limits, including query-related limits (e.g., `max_samples`, `max_query_length`, `max_query_parallelism`).  These limits are crucial for preventing resource exhaustion.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization Configuration:**  The specific configuration for authentication (e.g., basic auth, JWT) and authorization (e.g., RBAC) will depend on the chosen methods.  These configurations must be carefully reviewed and tested.

### 4.3. Vulnerability Research

*   **PromQL Injection:** While not as common as SQL injection, PromQL injection is theoretically possible if user-supplied input is directly incorporated into queries without proper sanitization.  This is less likely in a standard Cortex setup but could be a concern if custom applications are built on top of the Cortex API.
*   **Known CVEs:** Regularly checking for CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related to Cortex and PromQL is essential.  Staying up-to-date with patches is crucial.
*   **Misconfigured Authentication/Authorization:**  The most common vulnerability is simply not enabling or misconfiguring authentication and authorization, leaving the API open to the public.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

Building upon the initial mitigation strategies, here are more detailed and actionable recommendations:

1.  **Strong Authentication:**
    *   **Mandatory Authentication:**  Enforce authentication for *all* requests to the query API.  Do not allow any anonymous access.
    *   **Robust Authentication Methods:**  Use strong authentication methods like:
        *   **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):**  Preferred for API access, allowing for fine-grained control and token revocation.
        *   **mTLS (Mutual TLS):**  Provides strong client and server authentication, suitable for service-to-service communication.
        *   **Avoid Basic Auth:**  Basic authentication transmits credentials in plain text (base64 encoded, but easily decoded) and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and used over HTTPS.
    *   **Token Management:**  Implement proper token management, including:
        *   **Short-Lived Tokens:**  Use short token expiration times to minimize the impact of compromised tokens.
        *   **Token Revocation:**  Provide a mechanism to revoke tokens immediately if they are compromised.
        *   **Secure Token Storage:**  Store tokens securely on the client-side (e.g., using secure HTTP-only cookies or appropriate storage mechanisms for service accounts).

2.  **Strict Authorization (RBAC and Tenant Isolation):**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users and service accounts only the minimum necessary permissions to access the data they require.
    *   **Fine-Grained RBAC:**  Implement a robust RBAC system that allows for defining specific roles and permissions for different users and groups.  For example, create roles like "Tenant Admin," "Tenant Viewer," "Global Viewer" (with limited access), etc.
    *   **Tenant-Based Authorization:**  Enforce strict tenant isolation.  Ensure that users can only access data belonging to their assigned tenant(s).  This is a core security feature of Cortex and must be configured and tested thoroughly.
    *   **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Consider ABAC for more complex authorization scenarios, where access decisions are based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment.

3.  **Comprehensive Query Limits:**
    *   **`max_samples`:**  Limit the maximum number of samples returned by a query to prevent excessive memory consumption.
    *   **`max_query_length`:**  Limit the length of the PromQL query string to prevent overly complex queries.
    *   **`max_query_parallelism`:**  Limit the number of concurrent subqueries that can be executed for a single query.
    *   **`max_query_series`:** Limit the number of unique time series a query can access.
    *   **`query_timeout`:** Set a maximum execution time for queries.
    *   **Data Range Limits:** Restrict the time range that can be queried (e.g., limit queries to the last 7 days by default, requiring explicit overrides for longer ranges).
    *   **Tenant-Specific Limits:**  Configure different limits for different tenants based on their needs and resource allocations.

4.  **Query Analysis and Blocking:**
    *   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to identify potentially dangerous patterns in PromQL queries before they are executed.  This can help detect attempts to bypass authorization or perform resource-intensive operations.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Monitor query execution in real-time and block queries that exceed predefined thresholds or exhibit suspicious behavior.
    *   **Regular Expression Filtering:**  Use regular expressions to block queries that contain specific keywords or patterns known to be associated with malicious activity.  This should be used with caution, as overly restrictive filters can block legitimate queries.
    *   **Learning-Based Systems:**  Explore using machine learning techniques to identify anomalous query patterns that may indicate malicious activity.

5.  **Auditing and Monitoring:**
    *   **Comprehensive Logging:**  Log all query activity, including:
        *   The full PromQL query string.
        *   The user/service account that executed the query.
        *   The timestamp.
        *   The tenant ID.
        *   The result of the query (success/failure).
        *   The resources consumed by the query (e.g., execution time, memory usage).
    *   **Audit Log Review:**  Regularly review audit logs to identify suspicious activity and potential security breaches.
    *   **Alerting:**  Configure alerts for suspicious query patterns, failed authentication attempts, and excessive resource consumption.
    *   **SIEM Integration:**  Integrate Cortex logs with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for centralized monitoring and analysis.

6.  **Regular Security Assessments:**
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in the Cortex deployment.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use vulnerability scanners to identify known vulnerabilities in Cortex and its dependencies.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Perform regular code reviews of the Cortex components and any custom applications built on top of it.

7. **Network Segmentation:**
    * Isolate Cortex components on separate networks or subnets to limit the impact of a compromise.
    * Use firewalls and network access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to the Cortex API and other sensitive components.

8. **Input Sanitization (if applicable):**
    * If any part of your application allows users to provide input that is used to construct PromQL queries, *strictly sanitize* that input to prevent PromQL injection attacks. This is crucial for any custom-built dashboards or applications that interact with the Cortex API.

## 5. Conclusion

Unauthorized query execution is a high-risk attack surface for Cortex deployments.  By implementing the detailed mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches, denial-of-service attacks, and other security incidents.  A layered approach, combining strong authentication, strict authorization, comprehensive query limits, query analysis, and thorough auditing, is essential for protecting sensitive data and ensuring the availability of the Cortex service.
