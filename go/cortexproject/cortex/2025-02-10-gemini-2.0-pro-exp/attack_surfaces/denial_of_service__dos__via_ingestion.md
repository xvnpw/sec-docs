# Deep Analysis: Denial of Service (DoS) via Ingestion in Cortex

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Denial of Service (DoS) via Ingestion" attack surface within a Cortex deployment, identify specific vulnerabilities, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview.  We aim to provide the development team with the information needed to harden the system against this specific threat.  This includes understanding how an attacker might exploit Cortex's architecture and configuration to achieve a DoS.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on DoS attacks targeting the ingestion pipeline of a Cortex deployment.  This includes:

*   **Components:**  The distributor, ingester, and their interactions with the storage backend (e.g., chunks storage, index).  We will *not* deeply analyze DoS attacks against other Cortex components (e.g., querier, query-frontend) unless they directly contribute to the ingestion pipeline's vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  We will focus on attacks that exploit the volume and characteristics of ingested data (e.g., high cardinality, excessive series creation, large sample sizes).  We will *not* cover network-level DoS attacks (e.g., SYN floods) that are outside the application layer, although we will touch on how application-layer defenses can interact with network-layer protections.
*   **Cortex Configuration:** We will examine relevant Cortex configuration parameters that influence ingestion rate limiting, resource allocation, and overall system resilience.
*   **Dependencies:** We will consider the impact of dependencies like the storage backend (e.g., Cassandra, Bigtable, DynamoDB, S3, GCS) on the overall DoS resilience of the ingestion pipeline.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Architecture Review:**  Deep dive into the Cortex ingestion pipeline architecture, focusing on data flow, component responsibilities, and potential bottlenecks.
2.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Examine default and recommended Cortex configurations related to rate limiting, resource limits, and scaling.  Identify potential misconfigurations or weaknesses.
3.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Pinpoint specific vulnerabilities within the architecture and configuration that could be exploited for a DoS attack.  This will involve considering various attack scenarios.
4.  **Threat Modeling:**  Develop specific threat models for different types of ingestion-based DoS attacks, considering attacker capabilities and motivations.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Expand on the initial mitigation strategies, providing detailed recommendations, configuration examples, and best practices.
6.  **Testing Recommendations:**  Suggest specific testing methodologies to validate the effectiveness of the implemented mitigations.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 4.1. Architecture Review (Ingestion Pipeline)

The Cortex ingestion pipeline, at a high level, works as follows:

1.  **Distributor:** Receives write requests (typically Prometheus remote-write protocol).  It's responsible for:
    *   Validating the incoming data (basic schema checks).
    *   Hashing the time series (based on tenant ID and labels) to determine which ingester(s) should receive the data.
    *   Forwarding the data to the appropriate ingester(s).
    *   Implementing some basic rate limiting (but often needs to be supplemented).

2.  **Ingester:**  Receives data from the distributor and is responsible for:
    *   Buffering incoming samples in memory.
    *   Periodically flushing these in-memory samples to long-term storage (chunks storage).
    *   Maintaining an in-memory index of recent time series.
    *   Handling queries for recent data (data not yet flushed to long-term storage).

3.  **Storage Backend:**  Provides long-term storage for Cortex data.  This can be a distributed database (Cassandra, Bigtable, DynamoDB) or object storage (S3, GCS).  The storage backend has two main components relevant to ingestion:
    *   **Chunks Storage:** Stores the compressed time series data (chunks).
    *   **Index:**  Stores an index of the time series, allowing for efficient querying.  This is often the most performance-sensitive part of the storage backend.

**Potential Bottlenecks:**

*   **Distributor:**  Can become overwhelmed by a high volume of requests, especially if validation or hashing becomes computationally expensive.  Insufficient network bandwidth can also be a bottleneck.
*   **Ingester:**  Memory exhaustion is a primary concern.  High cardinality or a large number of new time series can rapidly consume memory.  Slow flushes to the storage backend can also lead to memory pressure.  The in-memory index can also become a bottleneck.
*   **Storage Backend (Chunks Storage):**  Write throughput limitations of the underlying storage system can become a bottleneck.
*   **Storage Backend (Index):**  The index is often the most vulnerable component.  High cardinality or a large number of new series can overwhelm the index, leading to slow writes and potentially cascading failures.

### 4.2. Configuration Analysis

Key Cortex configuration parameters related to DoS mitigation:

*   **`-ingester.max-chunk-age`:**  Controls how long an ingester will hold data in memory before flushing it to storage.  A smaller value reduces memory pressure but increases write load on the storage backend.
*   **`-ingester.chunk-idle-period`:**  Forces a flush of a chunk if it hasn't received new samples within this period.  Helps prevent "stuck" chunks.
*   **`-distributor.ingestion-rate-limit`:**  Global rate limit on the number of samples per second.  A blunt instrument, but essential for basic protection.
*   **`-distributor.ingestion-burst-size`:**  Allows for bursts of traffic above the rate limit, up to this size.
*   **`-distributor.per-tenant-override-config` & `-distributor.per-tenant-override-period`:** Allows to configure per-tenant rate limits.
*   **`-limits`:**  Configuration file that allows for fine-grained control over various limits, including:
    *   `ingestion_rate`: Per-tenant rate limit (samples/second).
    *   `ingestion_burst_size`: Per-tenant burst size.
    *   `max_series_per_user`:  Maximum number of active series per tenant.
    *   `max_series_per_metric`: Maximum number of series per metric name.
    *   `max_label_name_length`, `max_label_value_length`, `max_label_names_per_series`: Limits on label size and count.
*   **Resource Limits (Kubernetes):**  CPU and memory limits for distributor and ingester pods are *critical*.  These should be set based on expected load and rigorously tested.

**Potential Misconfigurations:**

*   **Missing or Insufficient Rate Limits:**  The most common vulnerability.  If rate limits are not configured or are set too high, the system is highly vulnerable to DoS.
*   **Overly Generous Resource Limits:**  While seemingly counterintuitive, overly generous resource limits can allow a single tenant to consume a disproportionate share of resources, leading to a DoS for other tenants.
*   **Ignoring Label Cardinality Limits:**  Failing to limit `max_label_names_per_series`, `max_label_name_length`, and `max_label_value_length` can allow attackers to create high-cardinality series that overwhelm the index.
*   **Inadequate Storage Backend Configuration:**  The storage backend must be properly configured and scaled to handle the expected write load.  This includes appropriate sharding, replication, and resource allocation.

### 4.3. Vulnerability Identification

Specific vulnerabilities based on the architecture and configuration:

1.  **High-Cardinality Series Explosion:**  An attacker sends a large number of time series with unique label combinations.  This can:
    *   Exhaust ingester memory.
    *   Overwhelm the index in the storage backend.
    *   Slow down queries, potentially leading to cascading failures.

2.  **Massive Series Creation:**  An attacker rapidly creates a large number of new time series, even if the cardinality of each series is low.  This can:
    *   Exhaust ingester memory due to the overhead of tracking each series.
    *   Strain the index in the storage backend.

3.  **Large Sample Values:** While less common, an attacker could send samples with extremely large values (if not properly validated), potentially leading to increased storage consumption and processing overhead.

4.  **Distributor Overload:**  An attacker sends a massive number of requests to the distributor, exceeding its capacity to process them.  This can happen even *before* rate limits are applied if the distributor's resources are insufficient.

5.  **Ingester Memory Exhaustion (OOM):**  A combination of the above attacks can lead to the ingester running out of memory and crashing (OOM).  This is a classic DoS scenario.

6.  **Storage Backend Saturation:**  Even with proper rate limiting at the Cortex level, the storage backend itself can become a bottleneck.  An attacker might be able to saturate the write capacity of the storage backend, leading to ingestion failures.

### 4.4. Threat Modeling

**Threat Model 1:  Malicious Tenant**

*   **Attacker:**  A legitimate tenant with authorized access to the Cortex system.
*   **Motivation:**  To disrupt service for other tenants or to gain an unfair advantage.
*   **Capability:**  Can send valid remote-write requests, but attempts to circumvent rate limits or resource quotas.
*   **Attack Vector:**  High-cardinality series creation, massive series creation.

**Threat Model 2:  External Attacker (Compromised Credentials)**

*   **Attacker:**  An external attacker who has obtained valid credentials (e.g., through phishing or credential stuffing).
*   **Motivation:**  To disrupt service, cause financial damage, or exfiltrate data.
*   **Capability:**  Can send valid remote-write requests, potentially at a high volume.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Any of the identified vulnerabilities (high cardinality, massive series creation, distributor overload).

**Threat Model 3:  External Attacker (Brute Force)**

*   **Attacker:** An external attacker without valid credentials.
*   **Motivation:** To disrupt service.
*   **Capability:** Can send a high volume of invalid requests.
*   **Attack Vector:** Distributor overload.

### 4.5. Mitigation Strategy Refinement

Here's a refined set of mitigation strategies, with more specific recommendations:

1.  **Strict Rate Limiting (Multi-Layered):**
    *   **Global Rate Limit (`distributor.ingestion-rate-limit`):**  Set a conservative global limit as a first line of defense.  This should be based on the overall capacity of the system.
    *   **Per-Tenant Rate Limits (`ingestion_rate` in `limits` file):**  Implement *mandatory* per-tenant rate limits.  These should be significantly lower than the global limit and tailored to the expected usage of each tenant.  Consider using dynamic rate limits that adjust based on historical usage.
    *   **Ingress-Level Rate Limiting:**  Use an ingress controller (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) or a load balancer with rate-limiting capabilities to provide an additional layer of protection *before* requests reach the Cortex distributor.  This can help mitigate brute-force attacks.

2.  **Resource Limits (Precise and Tested):**
    *   **CPU and Memory Limits (Kubernetes):**  Set *precise* CPU and memory limits for the distributor and ingester pods.  These should be based on rigorous load testing and should *not* be overly generous.  Use resource requests to guarantee a minimum level of resources.
    *   **Connection Limits:**  Limit the number of concurrent connections to the distributor and ingester.

3.  **Cardinality Control:**
    *   **`max_series_per_user`:**  Set a reasonable limit on the total number of active series per tenant.
    *   **`max_series_per_metric`:**  Set a limit on the number of series per metric name to prevent accidental or malicious cardinality explosions within a single metric.
    *   **`max_label_name_length`, `max_label_value_length`, `max_label_names_per_series`:**  Enforce strict limits on label size and count.  These are crucial for preventing high-cardinality attacks.

4.  **Storage Backend Protection:**
    *   **Proper Configuration:**  Ensure the storage backend is properly configured for the expected write load and cardinality.  This includes appropriate sharding, replication, and resource allocation.
    *   **Monitoring:**  Monitor the storage backend's performance metrics (write latency, queue depth, resource utilization) to detect potential bottlenecks or saturation.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Storage Backend):**  Some storage backends offer built-in rate limiting capabilities.  Consider using these if available.

5.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   **Resource Utilization:**  Monitor CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and disk I/O for all Cortex components.
    *   **Ingestion Rate:**  Monitor the ingestion rate (samples/second) globally and per tenant.
    *   **Error Rates:**  Monitor error rates (e.g., failed write requests, dropped samples).
    *   **Storage Backend Metrics:**  Monitor key metrics for the storage backend (e.g., write latency, queue depth).
    *   **Alerting:**  Set up alerts for anomalies in any of these metrics.  Alerts should be triggered *before* resources are completely exhausted.

6.  **Code-Level Defenses:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Implement robust input validation in the distributor to reject malformed or excessively large requests.
    *   **Circuit Breakers:**  Consider using circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures if the storage backend becomes overloaded.

7.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

### 4.6. Testing Recommendations

1.  **Load Testing:**  Perform regular load testing to simulate realistic and peak loads.  This should include:
    *   Testing with different cardinality levels.
    *   Testing with a large number of new series.
    *   Testing with sustained high ingestion rates.
    *   Testing the effectiveness of rate limits.

2.  **Chaos Engineering:**  Introduce controlled failures (e.g., killing ingester pods, simulating network latency) to test the system's resilience.

3.  **Fuzz Testing:**  Use fuzz testing to send malformed or unexpected data to the distributor and ingester to identify potential vulnerabilities.

4.  **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security experts to perform penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks.

5. **Canary Deployments:** Before rolling out configuration changes, use canary deployments to test the changes on a small subset of traffic.
