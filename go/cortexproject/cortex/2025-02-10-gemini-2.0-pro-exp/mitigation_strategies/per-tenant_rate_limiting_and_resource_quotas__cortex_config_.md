Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the "Per-Tenant Rate Limiting and Resource Quotas" mitigation strategy for a Cortex-based application.

## Deep Analysis: Per-Tenant Rate Limiting and Resource Quotas (Cortex Config)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness, completeness, and potential weaknesses of the "Per-Tenant Rate Limiting and Resource Quotas" mitigation strategy as applied to a Cortex deployment.  We aim to identify any gaps in implementation, potential bypasses, and areas for improvement, focusing on how well the strategy leverages Cortex's *intrinsic* capabilities.  We'll also assess the strategy's ability to protect against the identified threats.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses *exclusively* on the mitigation strategy described, which relies on Cortex's built-in configuration options (`limits_config`, `runtime_config`, and Ruler-based alerting).  We will consider:

*   **Configuration:**  Correctness and completeness of the YAML configurations for `limits_config` and `runtime_config`.
*   **Enforcement:** How effectively Cortex enforces these limits, including potential edge cases or bypasses.
*   **Alerting:**  The adequacy of the alerting rules defined within Cortex's Ruler component.
*   **Monitoring & Review:**  The use of Cortex's own metrics for ongoing monitoring and adjustment of limits.
*   **Interaction with Cortex Components:** How the strategy interacts with standard Cortex components (Distributor, Ingester, Querier, Ruler, etc.) and any custom components.
*   **Tenant Identification:** The reliability of the mechanism used to identify tenants (assumed to be `X-Scope-OrgID`).

We will *not* cover:

*   External rate limiting or quota mechanisms (e.g., API gateways, Kubernetes resource quotas *unless* configured via Cortex's `runtime_config`).
*   Security aspects unrelated to rate limiting and resource quotas (e.g., authentication, authorization outside of tenant identification).
*   Performance tuning of Cortex itself, except as it relates to limit enforcement.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Configuration Review:**  We will examine the provided example configurations and identify potential issues, missing parameters, and areas for optimization.
2.  **Threat Model Analysis:**  We will revisit the identified threats and assess how well the strategy, as described, mitigates each threat.  We will consider potential attack vectors that might circumvent the limits.
3.  **Component Interaction Analysis:**  We will analyze how each Cortex component interacts with the rate limiting and quota mechanisms.  This will involve understanding the internal workings of Cortex.
4.  **Gap Analysis:**  We will identify any gaps between the "Currently Implemented" and "Missing Implementation" sections, and prioritize addressing these gaps.
5.  **Recommendations:**  We will provide concrete recommendations for improving the mitigation strategy, including specific configuration changes, additional alerting rules, and potential custom development efforts.
6.  **Testing Considerations:** We will outline testing strategies to validate the effectiveness of the implemented limits and alerting.

### 2. Deep Analysis

Now, let's dive into the analysis itself, following the methodology outlined above.

#### 2.1 Configuration Review

The provided example configurations are a good starting point, but require further scrutiny:

*   **`limits_config`:**
    *   `ingestion_rate`:  1000 samples/second is a reasonable starting point, but needs to be tuned based on actual tenant usage.  It's crucial to understand what constitutes a "sample" in the context of the specific data being ingested.
    *   `ingestion_burst_size`: 2000 allows for short bursts, which is good for handling temporary spikes.  The ratio between `ingestion_rate` and `ingestion_burst_size` should be carefully considered.
    *   `max_series_per_user`: 100,000 series is a high limit.  This should be based on the expected number of unique time series per tenant.  An overly high limit here could lead to resource exhaustion.
    *   `max_samples_per_query`: 1,000,000 samples per query is also a significant limit.  Large queries can impact query performance and potentially overload the system.  This should be carefully tuned.
    *   `max_series_per_metric`: 5,000 series per metric, per tenant, helps prevent a single metric from exploding in cardinality.  This is a good safeguard.
    *   `max_metadata_per_user`: 10,000 metadata entries.  This limit is important to prevent excessive metadata storage.
    *   **Missing:**  Consider adding limits related to query concurrency (`max_concurrent_queries_per_user`) and query execution time (`max_query_execution_time`). These are crucial for preventing resource exhaustion due to slow or numerous queries.

*   **`runtime_config`:**
    *   The example is conceptual, but the idea of setting per-tenant CPU and memory limits *through Cortex* is sound.  This allows for centralized management of resource quotas.
    *   **Critical:**  The exact format and mechanism for updating `runtime_config` needs to be clearly defined.  How is this file updated?  Is it a Kubernetes ConfigMap?  Is there a custom controller managing it?  How is it reloaded by Cortex?  This is a potential point of failure.
    *   **Missing:**  Consider adding limits on storage usage per tenant, especially if using a persistent storage backend.

*   **Alerting (Ruler):**
    *   The example alert `TenantNearIngestionLimit` is a good starting point, but it only covers ingestion rate limiting.
    *   **Missing:**  Alerts are needed for *all* limit types:
        *   `TenantNearSeriesLimit`
        *   `TenantNearSamplesPerQueryLimit`
        *   `TenantNearMetadataLimit`
        *   `TenantNearCPULimit` (if using `runtime_config`)
        *   `TenantNearMemoryLimit` (if using `runtime_config`)
        *   `TenantNearStorageLimit` (if applicable)
        *   Alerts for query concurrency and execution time limits (if added to `limits_config`).
    *   The `expr` in the example alert should be refined.  Instead of comparing the ratio of 429s to total requests, it's better to directly monitor the metric that tracks the limit itself (e.g., `cortex_ingester_ingested_samples_total` compared to the configured `ingestion_rate`).  This provides more accurate and timely alerts.
    *   The `for: 5m` clause is reasonable, but should be adjusted based on the desired sensitivity and the typical usage patterns.
    *   **Missing:** Consider adding different severity levels for different thresholds (e.g., warning at 80% utilization, critical at 95%).

#### 2.2 Threat Model Analysis

*   **DoS/DDoS from a Single Tenant:** The strategy is *highly effective* against this threat, *provided* the limits are set appropriately and enforced consistently.  The `ingestion_rate`, `ingestion_burst_size`, and series limits directly prevent a single tenant from overwhelming the system with data.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The strategy is *highly effective* at preventing resource exhaustion, as it limits ingestion, series, queries, and (through `runtime_config`) CPU, memory, and potentially storage.  The key is to set realistic limits based on the available resources and expected tenant usage.
*   **Unfair Resource Allocation:** The strategy directly addresses this by providing per-tenant limits, ensuring that no single tenant can consume a disproportionate share of resources.
*   **Accidental Overload:** The strategy is *effective* at preventing accidental overload, as it provides a safety net against unintentional spikes in usage.

**Potential Attack Vectors (Bypasses):**

1.  **Tenant Spoofing:** If the `X-Scope-OrgID` header is not properly validated and can be forged by an attacker, they could potentially bypass limits by impersonating other tenants or using non-existent tenant IDs.  This is a *critical* vulnerability.
2.  **Slowloris-style Attacks:**  While the strategy limits the *rate* of ingestion, it might be vulnerable to slowloris-style attacks where an attacker sends data very slowly, but keeps many connections open.  This could exhaust connection limits or other resources.  The `max_concurrent_queries_per_user` limit (if added) would help mitigate this.
3.  **Query-based Attacks:**  An attacker could craft complex or expensive queries that consume significant resources, even if they stay within the `max_samples_per_query` limit.  The `max_query_execution_time` limit (if added) is crucial for mitigating this.
4.  **Metadata Attacks:**  An attacker could try to exhaust resources by creating a large number of metadata entries, even if they stay within the series limits.  The `max_metadata_per_user` limit helps, but needs to be carefully tuned.
5.  **`runtime_config` Manipulation:** If the mechanism for updating `runtime_config` is not secure, an attacker could potentially modify the resource quotas to gain more resources.
6.  Bypassing limits by using multiple `X-Scope-OrgID` values.

#### 2.3 Component Interaction Analysis

*   **Distributor:**  The Distributor is the entry point for data ingestion and is responsible for enforcing the `ingestion_rate` and `ingestion_burst_size` limits.  It uses the `X-Scope-OrgID` header to identify the tenant.
*   **Ingester:**  The Ingester receives data from the Distributor and is responsible for enforcing the series limits (`max_series_per_user`, `max_series_per_metric`).
*   **Querier:**  The Querier handles queries and is responsible for enforcing the `max_samples_per_query`, `max_concurrent_queries_per_user`, and `max_query_execution_time` limits.
*   **Ruler:**  The Ruler evaluates alerting rules and generates alerts based on Cortex metrics.  It is *crucial* for monitoring limit utilization and notifying administrators of potential issues.
*   **Compactor:** Compactor should be monitored, as it can be resource intensive operation.
*   **Store Gateway:** Store Gateway should be monitored, as it can be resource intensive operation.

**Custom Components:** If any custom components are built, they *must* be carefully designed to respect the per-tenant limits.  This might involve using the same libraries and mechanisms as the standard Cortex components for limit enforcement.

#### 2.4 Gap Analysis

The following gaps exist, based on the "Missing Implementation" section:

1.  **Comprehensive Alerting Rules:**  This is a *high-priority* gap.  Alerts are needed for all limit types, with different severity levels.
2.  **Dynamic Adjustment of Quotas:**  This is a *medium-priority* gap.  While not strictly necessary for basic protection, dynamic adjustment would improve resource utilization and responsiveness.  This would likely require a custom controller or modifications to a Cortex component.
3.  **Consistent Enforcement Across Custom Components:**  This is a *high-priority* gap if custom components exist.  If not, it's not applicable.
4.  **Missing limits:** `max_concurrent_queries_per_user` and `max_query_execution_time`.

#### 2.5 Recommendations

1.  **Strengthen Tenant Identification:** Implement robust validation of the `X-Scope-OrgID` header.  This might involve:
    *   Using a trusted authentication and authorization system to populate the header.
    *   Verifying the tenant ID against a known list of valid tenants.
    *   Using a cryptographic mechanism (e.g., JWT) to prevent tampering.
2.  **Complete Alerting Rules:** Implement alerting rules for *all* limit types, with appropriate thresholds and severity levels.  Use direct metric comparisons rather than ratios of 429 errors.
3.  **Add Missing Limits:** Add `max_concurrent_queries_per_user` and `max_query_execution_time` to `limits_config`.
4.  **Secure `runtime_config` Updates:**  Clearly define and secure the mechanism for updating `runtime_config`.  Use a secure method (e.g., Kubernetes ConfigMaps with RBAC, a custom controller with authentication) and ensure that Cortex reloads the configuration reliably.
5.  **Consider Storage Limits:** Add per-tenant storage limits to `runtime_config` if using persistent storage.
6.  **Dynamic Quota Adjustment (Optional):**  Explore options for dynamically adjusting quotas based on real-time usage.  This could involve a custom controller that monitors Cortex metrics and updates `runtime_config`.
7.  **Enforce Limits in Custom Components:** If custom components exist, ensure they enforce the same per-tenant limits as the standard components.
8.  **Regular Review and Tuning:**  Periodically review Cortex metrics and adjust limits as needed.  This should be a regular operational task.
9.  **Documentation:** Thoroughly document the configuration, alerting rules, and any custom logic related to rate limiting and resource quotas.

#### 2.6 Testing Considerations

1.  **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests for any custom components that enforce limits.
2.  **Integration Tests:**  Test the interaction between different Cortex components to ensure that limits are enforced correctly.
3.  **Load Tests:**  Perform load tests with different tenant profiles to verify that the limits are effective and that the system remains stable under load.
4.  **Chaos Tests:**  Introduce failures (e.g., network partitions, component crashes) to test the resilience of the system and the effectiveness of the alerting.
5.  **Security Tests:**  Attempt to bypass the limits using various attack vectors (e.g., tenant spoofing, slowloris attacks, complex queries).
6.  **Alerting Tests:**  Trigger alerts by intentionally exceeding limits and verify that the alerts are generated correctly and delivered to the appropriate channels.

### 3. Conclusion

The "Per-Tenant Rate Limiting and Resource Quotas" mitigation strategy, when implemented correctly and comprehensively using Cortex's built-in features, provides a strong defense against DoS/DDoS attacks, resource exhaustion, and unfair resource allocation.  However, several critical areas need to be addressed, including strengthening tenant identification, completing the alerting rules, adding missing limits, securing `runtime_config` updates, and ensuring consistent enforcement across all components.  By following the recommendations outlined in this analysis, the development team can significantly improve the security and reliability of their Cortex deployment. The testing considerations are crucial part of implementation.
