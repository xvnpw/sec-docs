Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Tenant Data Leakage" threat for a Cortex-based application, following the structure you outlined:

# Deep Analysis: Tenant Data Leakage in Cortex

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Tenant Data Leakage" threat within a Cortex deployment, identify specific attack vectors, evaluate the effectiveness of existing mitigations, and propose concrete improvements to prevent cross-tenant data access.  We aim to move beyond a general understanding of the threat and delve into the technical specifics of *how* such a leak could occur and *how* to prevent it with a high degree of certainty.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following aspects of the Cortex system:

*   **Core Components:**  `Querier`, `Query Frontend`, `Store Gateway`, `Ingester`, `Distributor`, and any component involved in handling or processing queries and data with respect to tenant identifiers (`X-Scope-OrgID`).
*   **Data Flow:**  The complete lifecycle of a query, from its arrival at the Query Frontend to the retrieval of results from storage, with a particular emphasis on how tenant isolation is (or should be) enforced at each stage.
*   **Configuration:**  Settings related to multi-tenancy, including those that control resource sharing, caching, and query limits.
*   **Code:**  Specific code sections within the identified components that handle:
    *   `X-Scope-OrgID` parsing and validation.
    *   Query rewriting or modification based on tenant ID.
    *   Data access control (e.g., filtering blocks in the Store Gateway).
    *   Caching mechanisms and their interaction with tenant isolation.
    *   Error handling (to ensure errors don't leak information).
* **Authentication and Authorization:** How the system authenticates requests and authorizes access based on tenant ID.
* **Underlying Storage:** How the storage layer (e.g., chunks storage) interacts with Cortex's multi-tenancy model.

This analysis *excludes* threats unrelated to multi-tenancy, such as general denial-of-service attacks or vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure (e.g., the cloud provider).  It also excludes vulnerabilities in external systems that integrate with Cortex, unless those integrations directly impact tenant isolation.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  A detailed examination of the Cortex codebase, focusing on the components and functions identified in the Scope.  We will use static analysis techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities.  This includes searching for:
    *   Missing or incorrect `X-Scope-OrgID` checks.
    *   Improper use of shared resources (e.g., caches) without tenant-specific keys.
    *   Logic errors in query processing or filtering.
    *   Potential for bypassing tenant isolation through crafted queries.
    *   Insufficient input validation.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis:**  Running Cortex in a controlled environment and performing targeted testing to observe its behavior under various conditions. This includes:
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Sending malformed or unexpected inputs (especially in the `X-Scope-OrgID` header and query parameters) to identify crashes or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Simulating attacks by a malicious tenant attempting to access data belonging to other tenants.  This will involve crafting specific queries and requests designed to exploit potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Differential Testing:**  Comparing the behavior of the system with different configurations and inputs to identify inconsistencies that might indicate isolation issues.
    *   **Chaos Engineering:** Introduce failures to see how the system handles tenant isolation under stress.

3.  **Configuration Review:**  Examining the default and recommended configurations for Cortex, as well as any custom configurations used in the deployment, to identify potential misconfigurations that could weaken tenant isolation.

4.  **Threat Modeling Refinement:**  Using the findings from the code review, dynamic analysis, and configuration review to update and refine the existing threat model, identifying new attack vectors and mitigation strategies.

5.  **Documentation Review:**  Examining the official Cortex documentation, including best practices and security guidelines, to ensure that the deployment adheres to recommended practices.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat: Tenant Data Leakage

This section details the specific attack vectors, potential vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies, building upon the initial threat description.

### 4.1 Attack Vectors

A malicious tenant could attempt to leak data through several attack vectors:

*   **`X-Scope-OrgID` Manipulation:**
    *   **Spoofing:**  Providing a different tenant's `X-Scope-OrgID` in the HTTP header.
    *   **Omission:**  Omitting the header entirely, hoping for a default behavior that leaks data.
    *   **Injection:**  Attempting to inject malicious code or control characters into the header.
    *   **Bypassing Validation:**  Finding ways to bypass the header validation logic (e.g., through encoding tricks).

*   **Query Manipulation:**
    *   **Crafting Queries:**  Constructing PromQL queries that exploit weaknesses in the query engine or filtering logic to access data across tenant boundaries.  This could involve:
        *   Using functions or operators in unexpected ways.
        *   Exploiting type confusion or other parsing vulnerabilities.
        *   Leveraging knowledge of the underlying data schema.
        *   Using regex in label matchers to potentially match across tenants if not properly restricted.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Submitting complex or resource-intensive queries that could cause the system to behave unexpectedly and potentially leak information.

*   **Cache Poisoning:**
    *   If caching is not properly scoped by tenant, a malicious tenant could insert data into the cache that would then be served to other tenants.  This is particularly relevant for caches in the Query Frontend and Store Gateway.

*   **Shared Resource Exploitation:**
    *   If any resources (e.g., temporary files, memory buffers) are shared between tenants without proper isolation, a malicious tenant could potentially access data left behind by another tenant.

*   **Error Handling Exploitation:**
    *   Triggering specific error conditions that might reveal information about other tenants, such as their data schema or existence.

*   **Ingester/Distributor Bypass:**
    *   Attempting to directly interact with the Ingester or Distributor components, bypassing the Query Frontend and its security checks.

* **Storage Layer Access:**
    *   If the attacker gains direct access to the underlying storage (e.g., object storage), they might be able to bypass Cortex's multi-tenancy controls.

### 4.2 Potential Vulnerabilities (Code-Level Examples)

These are hypothetical examples to illustrate the types of vulnerabilities we'd look for during code review:

*   **Missing `X-Scope-OrgID` Check:**

    ```go
    // Vulnerable Code (Querier)
    func handleQuery(query string) ([]DataPoint, error) {
        // ... (code to execute the query) ...
        // Missing: Check if the query results belong to the requesting tenant!
        return results, nil
    }
    ```

*   **Incorrect Cache Key:**

    ```go
    // Vulnerable Code (Query Frontend)
    func getCachedResult(query string) ([]DataPoint, bool) {
        key := hash(query) // Missing: Include tenant ID in the cache key!
        // ... (code to retrieve from cache) ...
    }
    ```

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:**

    ```go
    // Vulnerable Code (Query Frontend)
        func validateOrgID(orgID string) error{
            //WEAK validation
            if orgID == ""{
                return errors.New("OrgID is empty")
            }
            return nil
        }
    ```

*   **Logic Error in Filtering:**

    ```go
    // Vulnerable Code (Store Gateway)
    func filterBlocks(blocks []Block, orgID string) []Block {
        filteredBlocks := []Block{}
        for _, block := range blocks {
            // Incorrect: Should check for *equality*, not *containment*!
            if strings.Contains(block.TenantID, orgID) {
                filteredBlocks = append(filteredBlocks, block)
            }
        }
        return filteredBlocks
    }
    ```

### 4.3 Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

Building on the initial mitigations, we need to ensure these are implemented comprehensively and correctly:

*   **Strict Tenant Isolation:**
    *   **`X-Scope-OrgID` Propagation:**  Ensure the `X-Scope-OrgID` is correctly propagated through all components and function calls involved in query processing and data retrieval.  Use context propagation in Go to carry this information.
    *   **Mandatory Checks:**  Implement mandatory checks for the `X-Scope-OrgID` at *every* point where data is accessed or processed.  Fail closed (deny access) if the header is missing or invalid.
    *   **Tenant-Specific Caching:**  Include the tenant ID in all cache keys to prevent cross-tenant cache poisoning.  Consider using separate cache instances for different tenants if feasible.
    *   **Resource Isolation:**  Ensure that temporary files, memory buffers, and other resources are not shared between tenants.  Use tenant-specific prefixes or namespaces.
    *   **Storage-Level Isolation:**  Configure the underlying storage (e.g., object storage) to enforce tenant isolation, using separate buckets or prefixes for each tenant.

*   **Thorough Testing:**
    *   **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests for all functions that handle `X-Scope-OrgID` or perform tenant-specific filtering.
    *   **Integration Tests:**  Test the interaction between different components to ensure that tenant isolation is maintained across the entire data flow.
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Use fuzzing tools to test the robustness of `X-Scope-OrgID` parsing and validation, as well as query parsing and execution.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration tests to simulate attacks by malicious tenants.
    *   **Property-Based Testing:** Use property-based testing to generate a wide range of inputs and verify that tenant isolation holds under all conditions.

*   **Code Reviews:**
    *   **Mandatory Reviews:**  Require code reviews for all changes that affect multi-tenancy.
    *   **Checklists:**  Use checklists to ensure that reviewers specifically look for potential multi-tenancy vulnerabilities.
    *   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Use static analysis tools to automatically detect potential security issues.

*   **Least Privilege:**
    *   **Component Permissions:**  Ensure that each Cortex component has only the minimum necessary permissions to access data and resources.
    *   **Service Accounts:**  Use separate service accounts for different components, with limited permissions.

*   **Regular Audits:**
    *   **Configuration Audits:**  Regularly audit the Cortex configuration to ensure that multi-tenancy settings are correctly configured.
    *   **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

*   **Formal Verification (where feasible):**
    *   For critical components or functions, consider using formal verification techniques to mathematically prove the correctness of the multi-tenancy implementation. This is a high-effort, high-reward approach.

* **Input Sanitization and Validation:**
    *   Implement robust input validation for all user-provided data, including the `X-Scope-OrgID` header and query parameters. Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.

* **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   Implement monitoring to detect unusual activity, such as a high volume of requests from a single tenant or attempts to access data belonging to other tenants. Set up alerts for suspicious events.

* **Rate Limiting:**
    * Implement rate limiting per tenant to prevent resource exhaustion attacks that could lead to data leakage.

* **Error Handling:**
    *   Ensure that error messages do not reveal sensitive information about other tenants or the system's internal workings. Use generic error messages.

## 5. Conclusion

Tenant data leakage is a critical threat to any Cortex deployment.  By combining rigorous code review, dynamic analysis, and a strong focus on secure configuration and coding practices, we can significantly reduce the risk of this threat.  The detailed mitigation strategies outlined above, when implemented comprehensively, provide a robust defense against cross-tenant data access. Continuous monitoring, auditing, and testing are essential to maintain a strong security posture and adapt to evolving threats. The key is to assume that any component *could* be compromised and to build in multiple layers of defense.
