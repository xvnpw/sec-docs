Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Query-Based Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)" threat for a Cortex-based application, following the structure you outlined:

# Deep Analysis: Query-Based Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service) in Cortex

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Query-Based Resource Exhaustion" threat, identify specific attack vectors within the Cortex architecture, evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigations, and recommend concrete implementation strategies and best practices to minimize the risk.  We aim to move beyond a general understanding of the threat and delve into the specifics of how it manifests in a Cortex deployment.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following aspects of the threat:

*   **Cortex Components:**  Specifically, the `Querier`, `Query Frontend`, and `Store Gateway` components, as these are directly involved in query processing and are identified as vulnerable.  We will also *briefly* consider the interaction with ingesters, as the volume of ingested data can influence the impact of resource exhaustion attacks.
*   **Query Types:**  We will examine various types of PromQL queries, including those with:
    *   Large time ranges.
    *   High cardinality (large number of series).
    *   Complex regular expressions.
    *   Expensive aggregations and functions.
    *   Chunked queries (impact on Store Gateway).
*   **Cortex Configuration:**  We will analyze how existing Cortex configuration parameters (limits, timeouts, etc.) can be used to mitigate the threat.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  We will explore how to effectively monitor for signs of resource exhaustion attacks and set up appropriate alerts.
*   **Attack Vectors:** We will identify specific ways an attacker might craft malicious queries to exploit vulnerabilities.

This analysis *excludes* the following:

*   **Network-level DDoS attacks:**  We are focusing on application-layer attacks targeting the query path.  Network-level DDoS mitigation is a separate concern.
*   **Authentication/Authorization bypass:** We assume the attacker has valid credentials to submit queries.  We are focusing on the *content* of the queries, not how they are submitted.
*   **Vulnerabilities in underlying infrastructure:** (e.g., Kubernetes, cloud provider).  We are focusing on the Cortex application itself.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methods:

*   **Code Review:**  Examine the relevant sections of the Cortex codebase (primarily in the `querier`, `query-frontend`, and `store-gateway` packages) to understand how queries are processed and where resource limitations are (or should be) enforced.
*   **Configuration Analysis:**  Review the Cortex configuration documentation to identify relevant parameters for limiting query resource consumption.
*   **Experimentation (Optional):**  If necessary, set up a test Cortex environment to simulate resource exhaustion attacks and evaluate the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies.  This would involve crafting malicious queries and observing their impact on system resources.
*   **Threat Modeling Techniques:**  Apply threat modeling principles (e.g., STRIDE, attack trees) to systematically identify potential attack vectors.
*   **Best Practices Review:**  Consult industry best practices for securing time-series databases and mitigating DoS attacks.
*   **Documentation Review:** Analyze Cortex documentation, blog posts, and community discussions for insights into this threat and its mitigation.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 4.1 Attack Vectors and Exploitation Scenarios

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability through several attack vectors:

*   **Large Time Range Queries:**  Requesting data for an extremely long time range (e.g., months or years) forces the system to retrieve and process a massive amount of data.  This can overwhelm the `Store Gateway` (fetching chunks) and the `Querier` (processing and aggregating the data).

    *   **Example:** `sum(my_metric[1y])`

*   **High Cardinality Queries:**  Queries that select a vast number of unique time series can exhaust memory and CPU.  This is particularly problematic if the series have many labels.

    *   **Example:** `my_metric{label1=~".*", label2=~".*"}` (if `label1` and `label2` have many distinct values)

*   **Complex Regular Expressions:**  Using computationally expensive regular expressions in label matchers can significantly slow down query processing.  "Evil regexes" (those with catastrophic backtracking) can be particularly damaging.

    *   **Example:** `my_metric{label1=~"^(a+)+$"}` (classic evil regex)

*   **Expensive Aggregations/Functions:**  Certain PromQL functions, especially those involving calculations over large datasets or complex groupings, can consume significant resources.

    *   **Example:** `histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(my_high_cardinality_metric[5m])) by (label1, label2, label3))` (if the `by` clause results in many groups)

*   **Abuse of Chunked Queries:**  The `Store Gateway` retrieves data in chunks.  An attacker could craft queries that request an excessive number of small chunks, leading to a large number of requests and increased overhead.

*   **Combinations:**  The most effective attacks often combine multiple techniques.  For example, a query with a large time range, high cardinality, *and* a complex regular expression would be particularly devastating.

### 4.2 Affected Components and Impact

*   **Querier:**
    *   **Impact:**  The `Querier` is responsible for executing queries, aggregating results, and returning them to the client.  Resource exhaustion can lead to:
        *   **Slow Query Performance:**  Queries take a long time to complete, impacting user experience.
        *   **OOM (Out-of-Memory) Errors:**  The `Querier` process crashes due to excessive memory consumption.
        *   **CPU Exhaustion:**  The `Querier` consumes all available CPU, starving other processes.
        *   **Increased Latency:**  Even non-malicious queries experience delays due to resource contention.
    * **Code Locations of Interest:**
        *   `querier/querier.go`:  Main query execution logic.
        *   `promql`:  The PromQL engine itself.
        *   `querier/queryrange`: Handling of query ranges and splitting.

*   **Query Frontend:**
    *   **Impact:**  The `Query Frontend` acts as a reverse proxy and query scheduler.  It can be overwhelmed by:
        *   **High Request Rate:**  A flood of malicious queries can saturate the frontend.
        *   **Queue Buildup:**  Slow query processing in the `Queriers` can cause the frontend's queue to grow excessively, leading to delays and dropped requests.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The frontend itself can run out of memory or CPU.
    * **Code Locations of Interest:**
        *   `queryfrontend/tripperware.go`:  Middleware for handling requests, including limits and timeouts.
        *   `queryfrontend/queryrange`:  Query splitting and caching logic.

*   **Store Gateway:**
    *   **Impact:**  The `Store Gateway` retrieves data chunks from object storage.  It is vulnerable to:
        *   **Excessive Chunk Requests:**  Queries that require fetching a large number of chunks can overwhelm the gateway.
        *   **Network Bandwidth Saturation:**  Retrieving large amounts of data can saturate the network connection to object storage.
        *   **Disk I/O Bottlenecks:**  If the gateway uses local caching, excessive chunk requests can lead to disk I/O bottlenecks.
    * **Code Locations of Interest:**
        *   `storegateway/shipper.go`:  Logic for fetching chunks from object storage.
        *   `storegateway/bucket.go`:  Interaction with the object storage bucket.

### 4.3 Mitigation Strategies and Implementation Recommendations

The proposed mitigation strategies are generally sound, but we need to delve into specific implementation details:

*   **Query Limits:**
    *   **`query.max-samples`:**  Limit the total number of samples a query can process.  This is a *crucial* limit to prevent high-cardinality queries from overwhelming the system.  **Recommendation:** Set this to a reasonable value based on your expected workload and available resources.  Start conservatively and increase it gradually if needed.
    *   **`query.max-length`:** Limit the maximum duration of a query.  This prevents queries from spanning excessively long time ranges.  **Recommendation:** Set this to a value appropriate for your typical query patterns (e.g., 1d, 7d).  Consider allowing longer ranges for specific, trusted users/roles.
    *   **`query.lookback-delta`:**  This setting, used in conjunction with `-querier.query-ingesters-within` flag, can help limit the amount of data fetched from ingesters.  **Recommendation:**  Set this to a small value (e.g., 5m) to reduce the load on ingesters.
    *   **`querier.max-concurrent`:** Limit the number of queries that can be executed concurrently by a single querier.  **Recommendation:**  Set this based on the available resources (CPU, memory) of your querier instances.
    *   **`querier.timeout`:** Set a timeout for individual queries.  **Recommendation:**  Set this to a reasonable value (e.g., 1-2 minutes) to prevent queries from running indefinitely.
    *   **Custom Limits (Advanced):**  Consider implementing custom limits based on query complexity (e.g., number of series, complexity of regex).  This would require analyzing the query AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) before execution. This is a more complex but potentially more effective approach.

*   **Query Timeout:**
    *   **`query.timeout`:**  This is the primary timeout setting.  **Recommendation:**  As mentioned above, set this to a reasonable value (e.g., 1-2 minutes).  Ensure this timeout is enforced consistently across the `Querier` and `Query Frontend`.

*   **Resource Quotas:**
    *   **Tenant-Level Quotas:**  Cortex supports tenant-level limits on ingestion rate, active series, and API requests.  While not directly related to query resource exhaustion, these limits can help prevent a single tenant from monopolizing resources.  **Recommendation:**  Implement tenant-level quotas to ensure fair resource allocation.
    *   **Query-Specific Quotas (Advanced):**  Ideally, you would want to limit the resources (CPU, memory) a single query can consume.  This is challenging to implement accurately, but you could explore using resource tracking mechanisms within the `Querier` to estimate resource usage and potentially reject queries that exceed a threshold.

*   **Query Analysis:**
    *   **Regex Blacklisting/Whitelisting:**  Implement a mechanism to block or restrict the use of known "evil regexes."  This can be done using a blacklist of dangerous patterns or a whitelist of allowed patterns.  **Recommendation:**  Implement a regex blacklist based on known problematic patterns.  Consider using a regex analysis library to identify potentially dangerous regexes.
    *   **Query Cost Estimation (Advanced):**  Develop a mechanism to estimate the cost of a query before execution.  This could involve analyzing the query AST and considering factors like time range, series count, and function complexity.  Queries exceeding a cost threshold could be rejected.

*   **Caching:**
    *   **`query-frontend.cache-results`:**  Enable query result caching in the `Query Frontend`.  This can significantly reduce the load on the `Queriers` for frequently executed queries.  **Recommendation:**  Enable caching and configure appropriate cache size and TTL (Time-To-Live) settings.
    *   **`query-frontend.split-queries-by-interval`:**  Split long queries into smaller intervals and cache the results for each interval.  **Recommendation:**  Enable this setting to improve caching efficiency for long-range queries.

*   **Horizontal Scaling:**
    *   **Multiple Querier Instances:**  Deploy multiple instances of the `Querier` to distribute the query load.  **Recommendation:**  Use a load balancer (e.g., Kubernetes service) to distribute traffic across the `Querier` instances.  Scale the number of instances based on your workload and resource utilization.
    *   **Multiple Query Frontend Instances:**  Similarly, deploy multiple instances of the `Query Frontend` to handle a higher volume of requests.

*   **Monitoring:**
    *   **Prometheus Metrics:**  Cortex exposes a rich set of Prometheus metrics that can be used to monitor query performance and resource usage.  **Recommendation:**  Monitor the following metrics:
        *   `cortex_request_duration_seconds`:  Query latency.
        *   `cortex_query_frontend_queue_length`:  Length of the query queue in the frontend.
        *   `cortex_querier_memory_bytes`:  Memory usage of the `Querier`.
        *   `cortex_querier_cpu_seconds_total`:  CPU usage of the `Querier`.
        *   `cortex_storegateway_chunks_fetched_total`:  Number of chunks fetched by the `Store Gateway`.
        *   `cortex_storegateway_chunk_fetch_duration_seconds`:  Latency of chunk fetches.
        *   `cortex_request_ পারাtotal`: Number of requests with specific result (e.g. error, success, canceled)
    *   **Alerting:**  Set up alerts based on these metrics to detect potential resource exhaustion attacks.  **Recommendation:**  Create alerts for:
        *   High query latency.
        *   High query queue length.
        *   High `Querier` memory/CPU usage.
        *   High number of failed queries.
        *   High number of chunk fetches.

### 4.4. Additional Considerations

*   **Regular Expression Engine:** Cortex uses Go's `regexp` package. While generally safe, it's *not* immune to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks.  The regex blacklisting/whitelisting recommendation is crucial.
*   **Ingester Load:** While this analysis focuses on the query path, a high ingestion rate can exacerbate resource exhaustion issues.  Ensure your ingesters are properly scaled and that you have appropriate limits on ingestion rate and active series.
*   **Security Audits:** Regularly conduct security audits of your Cortex deployment to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure that mitigation strategies are effective.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at the API gateway or load balancer to prevent a single client from submitting an excessive number of queries. This is a general DoS prevention technique that complements the query-specific mitigations.

## 5. Conclusion

Query-based resource exhaustion is a serious threat to Cortex deployments. By implementing a combination of query limits, timeouts, resource quotas, query analysis, caching, horizontal scaling, and comprehensive monitoring, you can significantly reduce the risk of successful attacks.  The specific configuration values and implementation details will depend on your specific workload and resource constraints.  Regular monitoring and security audits are essential to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of your mitigation strategies. The most important aspect is to start with conservative limits and gradually increase them as needed, while closely monitoring system performance.
