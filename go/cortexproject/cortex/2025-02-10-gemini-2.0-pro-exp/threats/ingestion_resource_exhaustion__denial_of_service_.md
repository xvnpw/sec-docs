Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the "Ingestion Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)" threat for a Cortex-based application.

## Deep Analysis: Ingestion Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service) in Cortex

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

*   **Objective:**  To thoroughly understand the "Ingestion Resource Exhaustion" threat, identify specific attack vectors, evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigations, and recommend additional security controls to minimize the risk of a successful denial-of-service attack.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for the development team.

*   **Scope:** This analysis focuses specifically on the ingestion pathway of the Cortex system, encompassing the `Distributor` and `Ingester` components, as well as the network infrastructure supporting them.  We will consider both intentional malicious attacks and unintentional overload scenarios (e.g., a misconfigured client sending excessive data).  We will *not* delve into query-path resource exhaustion in this analysis (that would be a separate threat).  We will also consider the interaction of Cortex with its underlying storage (e.g., chunks storage like DynamoDB, Bigtable, or Cassandra).

*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Re-examine the existing threat model entry, expanding on the description and potential attack vectors.
    2.  **Code Review (Targeted):**  Analyze relevant sections of the Cortex codebase (primarily `Distributor` and `Ingester` logic) to identify potential vulnerabilities and assess the implementation of existing mitigations.  This will be a *targeted* review, focusing on areas relevant to resource consumption and handling of incoming data.  We will not perform a full code audit.
    3.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Review default and recommended configurations for Cortex, focusing on settings related to rate limiting, resource quotas, and scaling.
    4.  **Mitigation Effectiveness Evaluation:**  Assess the effectiveness of each proposed mitigation strategy against various attack scenarios.
    5.  **Recommendation Generation:**  Propose additional security controls and best practices to enhance resilience against ingestion-based DoS attacks.
    6. **Documentation Review:** Review Cortex documentation for best practices and limitations.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

#### 2.1. Expanded Threat Description and Attack Vectors

The original threat description is a good starting point, but we need to expand on the specific ways an attacker (or a misconfigured client) could cause resource exhaustion.  Here are several attack vectors:

*   **High Cardinality Attack:**  An attacker sends metrics with a very large number of unique label combinations (high cardinality).  This explodes the number of time series stored, overwhelming the ingesters and potentially the underlying storage.  For example, including a unique ID or timestamp *as a label* (rather than a value) in every sample.
*   **High Churn Attack:**  An attacker constantly creates and destroys time series by rapidly changing label values.  This forces the system to continuously create and delete index entries and chunks, consuming resources.
*   **Large Sample Attack:**  An attacker sends very large samples (e.g., extremely long metric names or label values, or a huge number of labels per sample).  This consumes excessive memory and network bandwidth.
*   **High Frequency Attack:**  An attacker sends a massive number of samples per second, exceeding the configured rate limits (if any) or the processing capacity of the distributors and ingesters.
*   **Slowloris-Style Attack:**  An attacker establishes many connections to the distributor but sends data very slowly, tying up resources and preventing legitimate clients from connecting.  This is a classic network-level DoS, but it can impact the distributor.
*   **Amplification Attack (if applicable):** If any part of the ingestion pipeline allows for amplification (e.g., a request that triggers a disproportionately large amount of processing), an attacker could exploit this.  This is less likely in Cortex's direct ingestion path but worth considering.
*   **Exploiting Bugs:**  An attacker could exploit a software vulnerability in the `Distributor` or `Ingester` (e.g., a memory leak, a buffer overflow, or an inefficient algorithm) to cause resource exhaustion with a smaller amount of data.
*  **Resource starvation of dependent services:** Exhaust resources of underlying storage (DynamoDB, Bigtable, Cassandra, etc.) by sending large amount of data, or data that is expensive to store.

#### 2.2. Affected Component Analysis

*   **Distributor:**  The distributor is the first point of contact for incoming metrics.  It's vulnerable to:
    *   Network connection exhaustion (Slowloris, high connection rate).
    *   CPU exhaustion (processing a high volume of requests).
    *   Memory exhaustion (buffering large samples or handling high cardinality).
    *   Rate limiting bypass (if rate limiting is improperly implemented).

*   **Ingester:**  The ingester receives data from the distributor and writes it to long-term storage.  It's vulnerable to:
    *   CPU exhaustion (processing and compressing data).
    *   Memory exhaustion (buffering data before flushing to storage, handling high cardinality).
    *   Storage I/O exhaustion (writing a large volume of data or a large number of small chunks).
    *   Index exhaustion (handling a very large number of time series).

*   **Network Infrastructure:**  The network between clients and the distributor, and between the distributor and ingesters, is vulnerable to:
    *   Bandwidth saturation (flooding the network with data).
    *   Packet loss (due to congestion).

* **Underlying storage:** The storage layer (e.g., DynamoDB, Bigtable, Cassandra) is vulnerable to:
    *   Throughput exhaustion (exceeding provisioned read/write capacity).
    *   Storage space exhaustion.
    *   Increased latency due to high load, impacting Cortex performance.

#### 2.3. Mitigation Strategy Evaluation

Let's evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations:

*   **Rate Limiting:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  *Essential* for preventing high-frequency attacks.  Must be implemented *per tenant* and ideally *per source IP* (or other identifying characteristic) to prevent one tenant from impacting others.  Should be configurable and dynamically adjustable.
    *   **Limitations:**  Can be bypassed if misconfigured or if the attacker can spoof source IPs.  Doesn't directly address high cardinality or large sample attacks.  Needs careful tuning to avoid blocking legitimate traffic.
    *   **Cortex Specifics:** Cortex provides per-tenant rate limiting.  It's crucial to configure this correctly and monitor its effectiveness.  Consider using the `ingestion_rate_limit_strategy` (global or local) setting.

*   **Resource Quotas:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Important for limiting the overall resource consumption of each tenant.  CPU, memory, and storage quotas can prevent a single tenant from monopolizing resources.
    *   **Limitations:**  Requires careful planning and monitoring to set appropriate quotas.  Doesn't prevent attacks within the quota limits.
    *   **Cortex Specifics:** Cortex supports limits on various resources, including `max_series_per_user`, `max_samples_per_query`, and others.  These should be set appropriately for each tenant.

*   **Horizontal Scaling:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Increases the overall capacity of the system, making it more resilient to high load.  Essential for handling large-scale deployments.
    *   **Limitations:**  Doesn't prevent attacks that target specific vulnerabilities or exceed the capacity of even a scaled-out system.  Adds complexity to deployment and management.
    *   **Cortex Specifics:** Cortex is designed to be horizontally scalable.  Use Kubernetes or similar orchestration tools to manage multiple instances of distributors and ingesters.

*   **Load Shedding:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Protects the system from complete failure by gracefully rejecting requests when overloaded.  Prioritizes critical traffic.
    *   **Limitations:**  Results in data loss for some clients.  Requires careful configuration to determine when to shed load and which requests to prioritize.
    *   **Cortex Specifics:** Cortex has some built-in load shedding capabilities.  Review the documentation for `ingester.max-inflight-push-requests` and related settings.

*   **Input Validation:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  *Crucial* for preventing large sample attacks and mitigating high cardinality attacks.  Limits the size and complexity of metric data.
    *   **Limitations:**  Requires careful definition of acceptable input formats.  May need to be updated as the system evolves.
    *   **Cortex Specifics:** Cortex allows configuring limits on label name and value lengths (`-validation.max-length-label-name`, `-validation.max-length-label-value`).  These are *essential* defenses.  Also, consider limits on the number of labels per metric.

*   **Monitoring:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Provides visibility into system performance and resource usage.  Allows for early detection of attacks and performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Limitations:**  Doesn't prevent attacks directly, but is essential for identifying and responding to them.
    *   **Cortex Specifics:** Cortex exposes numerous Prometheus metrics that can be used for monitoring.  Set up alerts for high resource utilization, error rates, and rate limit triggering.

*   **Circuit Breakers:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Prevents cascading failures by isolating failing components.  Can be used to protect the ingesters from being overwhelmed by a malfunctioning distributor.
    *   **Limitations:**  Requires careful configuration to avoid unintended consequences.
    *   **Cortex Specifics:**  While Cortex doesn't have explicit "circuit breaker" configurations in the same way as some other systems, the gRPC health checks and readiness probes, combined with proper Kubernetes deployment configurations, effectively act as circuit breakers.

#### 2.4. Additional Security Controls and Recommendations

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Place a WAF in front of the Cortex distributors to filter out malicious traffic, including Slowloris attacks and some forms of flooding.  The WAF can also enforce rate limits and perform input validation.
*   **DDoS Mitigation Service:**  Use a cloud-based DDoS mitigation service (e.g., AWS Shield, Cloudflare) to protect against large-scale volumetric attacks.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Cortex components on a separate network segment to limit the impact of attacks.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that Cortex components and clients have only the necessary permissions.
*   **Alerting and Incident Response:**  Develop a robust alerting and incident response plan to quickly detect and respond to DoS attacks.
*   **Client-Side Rate Limiting:** Encourage (or require) clients to implement their own rate limiting to prevent accidental or malicious overload. Provide client libraries that include this functionality.
*   **Cardinality Management Tools:** Implement or integrate with tools that can detect and manage high cardinality metrics. This might involve alerting, blocking, or aggregating high-cardinality data.
* **Hardening of underlying storage:** Configure underlying storage with appropriate resource limits, monitoring, and alerting.
* **Regular updates:** Keep Cortex and all dependencies up-to-date to patch security vulnerabilities.

### 3. Conclusion

The "Ingestion Resource Exhaustion" threat is a serious concern for any Cortex deployment.  By implementing a combination of the mitigation strategies discussed above, and by continuously monitoring and improving the system's security posture, the risk of a successful DoS attack can be significantly reduced.  The key is a layered defense, combining network-level protections, application-level controls, and robust monitoring and incident response capabilities.  Regular security reviews and updates are essential to maintain a strong defense against evolving threats.
