## Attack Tree Path: [1. Data Poisoning [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__data_poisoning__high-risk_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Ingestion Path [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **1.1.1 Weak Authentication/Authorization on Distributor [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The distributor is the entry point for metrics data. Weak authentication or authorization allows attackers to bypass security controls and inject malicious data.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **1.1.1.2 Impersonate a legitimate client (e.g., weak API key management) [HIGH-RISK]**
                *   *Details:* If API keys are poorly managed (e.g., hardcoded, easily guessable, stored insecurely), an attacker can obtain a valid key and use it to send data as if they were a legitimate client.
                *   *Likelihood:* Medium
                *   *Impact:* High
                *   *Effort:* Low to Medium
                *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
                *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
            *   **1.1.2.2 Overwhelm rate limits (if not properly configured) [HIGH-RISK]**
                *    *Details:* If rate limits are not enforced or are set too high, an attacker can send a large volume of (potentially malicious) data, overwhelming the system and potentially causing data loss or corruption, even if the data itself isn't inherently "malformed." This can also be a form of DoS.
                *   *Likelihood:* Medium to High
                *   *Impact:* Medium
                *   *Effort:* Low
                *   *Skill Level:* Novice
                *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__denial_of_service__dos___high-risk_.md)

*   **2.1 Overwhelm Distributors [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **2.1.1 Flood with excessive write requests [HIGH-RISK]**
            *   *Details:* Sending a massive number of write requests to the distributor can overwhelm its capacity, preventing legitimate clients from sending data.
            *   *Likelihood:* High
            *   *Impact:* Medium to High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Novice
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy

*   **2.2 Overwhelm Ingesters**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **2.2.1 Exhaust resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) [HIGH-RISK]**
            *   *Details:*  Ingesters are responsible for processing and storing incoming data.  By sending a large volume of data or crafting data that is difficult to process, an attacker can exhaust the ingester's resources, causing it to slow down or crash.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium to High
            *   *Impact:* Medium to High
            *   *Effort:* Low to Medium
            *   *Skill Level:* Novice to Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy to Medium

*   **2.3 Overwhelm Queriers/Query Frontend**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **2.3.1 Send complex or resource-intensive queries [HIGH-RISK]**
            *   *Details:*  Queriers handle data retrieval.  An attacker can send queries that require significant processing power or memory, slowing down the system and potentially making it unresponsive.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium to High
            *   *Impact:* Medium to High
            *   *Effort:* Low to Medium
            *   *Skill Level:* Novice to Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy to Medium

*   **2.5 Network-Level DoS [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **2.5.1 Flood network connections to Cortex components [HIGH-RISK]**
            *   *Details:*  A classic network flood attack, targeting the network interfaces of Cortex components to prevent legitimate communication.
            *   *Likelihood:* High
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Low to Medium
            *   *Skill Level:* Novice to Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Privilege Escalation/Lateral Movement](./attack_tree_paths/4__privilege_escalationlateral_movement.md)

*   **4.1 Compromise a Cortex Component (Distributor, Ingester, Querier) [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** Gaining control of any Cortex component provides a significant foothold for further attacks. This is a critical step because it allows the attacker to move beyond simply disrupting or observing the system.
    *   *No specific high-risk sub-vectors listed in the reduced tree, but vulnerabilities or compromised credentials could lead here.*

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Configuration Manipulation [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/5__configuration_manipulation__high-risk_.md)

*   **5.1 Gain Access to Configuration Files/Store [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** Accessing the configuration allows an attacker to modify security settings, redirect data, and generally control the behavior of Cortex.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **5.1.3 Exploit misconfigured access controls on configuration storage [HIGH-RISK]**
            *   *Details:* If the configuration storage (e.g., Kubernetes ConfigMaps, etcd) has weak access controls, an attacker can directly modify the configuration files.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Low to Medium
            *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

*   **5.2 Modify Configuration [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **5.2.1 Disable authentication/authorization [HIGH-RISK]**
            *   *Details:*  Turning off authentication or authorization makes Cortex completely vulnerable to a wide range of attacks.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium (Requires prior access to configuration)
            *   *Impact:* Very High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
        *   **5.2.2 Weaken rate limits or other security controls [HIGH-RISK]**
            *   *Details:*  Reducing rate limits or disabling other security features makes Cortex more susceptible to DoS and other attacks.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium (Requires prior access to configuration)
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
