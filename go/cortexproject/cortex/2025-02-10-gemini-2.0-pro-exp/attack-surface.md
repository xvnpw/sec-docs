# Attack Surface Analysis for cortexproject/cortex

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Data Ingestion](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_data_ingestion.md)

*   *Description:* Attackers inject false or malicious metric data into Cortex.
    *   *Cortex Contribution:* Cortex provides the ingestion API endpoints (typically Prometheus remote-write compatible) that are the target of this attack. Its multi-tenancy model, if misconfigured, exacerbates the risk.
    *   *Example:* An attacker sends fabricated metrics indicating a healthy service when it's actually down, masking a real outage. Or, a malicious tenant injects data into another tenant's stream.
    *   *Impact:* False alerts, incorrect dashboards, flawed automated decisions based on bad data, data corruption, potential data poisoning for machine learning models trained on the data.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High** (can be Critical if used for critical decision-making).
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Authentication:** Implement strong authentication (mTLS, API keys, JWT with tenant claims) for all ingestion endpoints.
        *   **Authorization:** Enforce strict tenant-based authorization, ensuring tenants can only write to their own streams.  Use RBAC to limit write access.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement per-tenant and global rate limits to prevent ingestion floods.
        *   **Data Validation:** Validate incoming data (label names, label values, timestamps, sample values) to prevent obviously malicious or nonsensical data.  Reject data outside expected ranges.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks targeting the underlying storage or processing components.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Ingestion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_ingestion.md)

*   *Description:* Attackers overwhelm the ingestion pipeline with a high volume of metrics, causing service degradation or unavailability.
    *   *Cortex Contribution:* Cortex's distributed architecture, while designed for scalability, can be overwhelmed if not properly configured and protected. The distributor and ingester components are primary targets.
    *   *Example:* An attacker sends a massive number of new time series with high-cardinality labels, exhausting resources in the ingesters and storage backend.
    *   *Impact:* Loss of monitoring data, inability to ingest new metrics, potential cascading failures in dependent systems.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement strict per-tenant and global rate limits on the number of series, samples, and label cardinality.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Configure appropriate resource limits (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) for all Cortex components.
        *   **Horizontal Scaling:** Ensure Cortex is deployed with sufficient resources and can scale horizontally to handle increased load.
        *   **Ingress Protection:** Use an ingress controller or load balancer with DoS protection capabilities.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor resource utilization and alert on anomalies that could indicate a DoS attack.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Query Execution](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_query_execution.md)

*   *Description:* Attackers execute unauthorized queries against the Cortex query API, potentially accessing sensitive data or causing resource exhaustion.
    *   *Cortex Contribution:* Cortex provides the query API (PromQL) and its associated query engine (query-frontend, querier).
    *   *Example:* An attacker gains access to the query API and runs a query that retrieves all metrics from all tenants, exposing sensitive data. Or, they run a very complex query that consumes all available resources.
    *   *Impact:* Data exfiltration, denial of service, potential exposure of internal infrastructure details.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High** (can be Critical if sensitive data is exposed).
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Authentication:** Implement strong authentication for the query API.
        *   **Authorization:** Enforce strict tenant-based authorization and RBAC, limiting query access to authorized data.
        *   **Query Limits:** Implement limits on query complexity (length, duration, number of series returned, data range).
        *   **Query Analysis:** Use query analysis tools to detect and block potentially malicious or resource-intensive queries.
        *   **Auditing:** Log all query activity for auditing and forensic analysis.

## Attack Surface: [Inter-Component Communication Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/inter-component_communication_vulnerabilities.md)

*   *Description:* Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the communication between Cortex components (e.g., distributor, ingester, querier).
    *   *Cortex Contribution:* Cortex's distributed architecture relies on inter-component communication, creating potential attack vectors if not secured.
    *   *Example:* An attacker intercepts unencrypted traffic between the distributor and ingester, gaining access to raw metric data. Or, a compromised ingester is used to attack the querier.
    *   *Impact:* Data interception, man-in-the-middle attacks, potential compromise of multiple components.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **mTLS:** Enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) for all inter-component communication.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Use network policies to restrict communication between components to only necessary traffic.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure components only have the necessary permissions to communicate with each other.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Audit network configurations and component interactions.
