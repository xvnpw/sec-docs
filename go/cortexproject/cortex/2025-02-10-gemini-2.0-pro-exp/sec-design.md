Okay, let's create a design document for the Cortex project, focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Cortex provides horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant, long-term storage for Prometheus metrics.  It's designed to be a crucial component for organizations that rely heavily on Prometheus for monitoring and alerting, especially in large, dynamic environments.

Business Priorities:

*   Reliability and Availability:  Ensure continuous monitoring data availability, even in the face of infrastructure failures or scaling events.  Downtime means lost visibility into the monitored systems.
*   Scalability:  Handle increasing volumes of metrics data as the monitored infrastructure grows.  The system must scale horizontally to accommodate growth without performance degradation.
*   Multi-tenancy:  Isolate data and access between different teams or users within the same organization, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring fair resource usage.
*   Cost-Effectiveness:  Optimize resource utilization to minimize operational costs, particularly in cloud environments.
*   Operational Efficiency:  Simplify deployment, management, and maintenance of the long-term storage solution.

Business Risks:

*   Data Loss:  Loss of historical metrics data due to storage failures, misconfiguration, or malicious activity. This is a critical risk, as historical data is essential for trend analysis, capacity planning, and post-incident review.
*   Data Breach:  Unauthorized access to sensitive metrics data, potentially exposing confidential information about the monitored systems or the organization.
*   Service Disruption:  Outages or performance degradation of Cortex, leading to gaps in monitoring coverage and delayed alerting.
*   Resource Exhaustion:  Insufficient resources (CPU, memory, storage) to handle the incoming metrics volume, leading to performance issues or data loss.
*   Configuration Errors:  Mistakes in configuring Cortex, leading to data loss, security vulnerabilities, or operational problems.
*   Dependency Failures:  Problems with underlying dependencies (e.g., object storage, key-value store) impacting Cortex's functionality.
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Vulnerabilities introduced via compromised third-party libraries or build processes.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on the GitHub repository and common practices):

*   security control: Authentication: Cortex supports authentication using various methods, including HTTP basic auth, JWT, and TLS client certificates. (Described in Cortex documentation and configuration options).
*   security control: Authorization: Cortex provides role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to specific tenants and resources. (Described in Cortex documentation and configuration options).
*   security control: Encryption in transit: Communication between Cortex components and with external systems (e.g., Prometheus, object storage) can be secured using TLS. (Described in Cortex documentation and configuration options).
*   security control: Encryption at rest: Data stored in object storage can be encrypted using server-side encryption provided by the storage provider (e.g., AWS S3 SSE). (Configurable via object storage provider settings).
*   security control: Input validation: Cortex performs input validation on incoming data to prevent common attacks like injection vulnerabilities. (Implemented in Cortex code).
*   security control: Rate limiting: Cortex can be configured to limit the rate of incoming requests to prevent denial-of-service attacks. (Described in Cortex documentation and configuration options).
*   security control: Auditing: Cortex logs various events, which can be used for auditing and security monitoring. (Implemented in Cortex code and configurable via logging settings).
*   security control: Dependency management: Cortex uses Go modules to manage dependencies and track versions. (Visible in go.mod and go.sum files).
*   security control: Secure Development Practices: The Cortex project appears to follow secure development practices, including code reviews and static analysis. (Inferred from project activity and community guidelines).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Complexity of Configuration: Cortex has a complex configuration, and misconfiguration could lead to security vulnerabilities or operational issues. This is mitigated by providing comprehensive documentation and examples.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on External Services: Cortex relies on external services like object storage and key-value stores. The security of Cortex is partially dependent on the security of these external services. This is mitigated by choosing reputable providers and following their security best practices.
*   accepted risk: Potential for Data Exfiltration: While encryption and access controls are in place, a sophisticated attacker with sufficient privileges could potentially exfiltrate data. This is mitigated by implementing strong authentication, authorization, and monitoring.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
*   Implement a robust secrets management solution.
*   Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication.
*   Implement network segmentation to isolate Cortex components.
*   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
    *   Integration with existing identity providers (e.g., LDAP, OAuth 2.0).
    *   Secure storage and management of credentials.
*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control based on roles and permissions.
    *   Ability to restrict access to specific tenants and resources.
    *   Regular review and auditing of access permissions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all incoming data, including headers and payloads.
    *   Protection against common injection vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    *   Regular updates to input validation rules to address new threats.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Regular review and updates to cryptographic configurations.

## BUILD

The Cortex project uses Go modules for dependency management and a Makefile for building and testing.  GitHub Actions are used for CI/CD.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer("Developer") -- "Commits Code" --> GitHubRepo("GitHub Repository")
    GitHubRepo -- "Triggers" --> GitHubActions("GitHub Actions")
    GitHubActions -- "Builds" --> GoBuild("Go Build")
    GoBuild -- "Runs Tests" --> UnitTests("Unit Tests")
    GoBuild -- "Runs Tests" --> IntegrationTests("Integration Tests")
    GoBuild -- "Runs" --> StaticAnalysis("Static Analysis (e.g., gosec)")
    GoBuild -- "Creates" --> DockerImage("Docker Image")
    DockerImage -- "Pushes to" --> ContainerRegistry("Container Registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Quay.io)")

```

Build Process Security Controls:

*   security control: Dependency Management: Go modules (go.mod and go.sum) ensure consistent and reproducible builds, reducing the risk of using vulnerable dependencies.
*   security control: Static Analysis:  Tools like `gosec` are used to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: Unit and Integration Tests: Automated tests help ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   security control: Signed Commits:  Encouraging or requiring signed commits helps verify the authenticity of code changes.
*   security control: Build Automation: GitHub Actions provides a consistent and automated build process, reducing the risk of manual errors.
*   security control: Containerization: Docker images provide a consistent and isolated runtime environment.
*   security control: Container Registry: Using a secure container registry (e.g., with vulnerability scanning) helps prevent the deployment of vulnerable images.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Continuous Monitoring:  Providing uninterrupted visibility into the health and performance of monitored systems.
*   Alerting:  Promptly notifying operators of critical issues.
*   Capacity Planning:  Using historical data to predict future resource needs.
*   Incident Response:  Providing data for post-incident analysis and troubleshooting.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Metrics Data:  The sensitivity of metrics data varies depending on the specific metrics being collected.  Some metrics may contain sensitive information about the monitored systems or the organization, such as internal IP addresses, usernames, or business-specific data.  Generally, metrics data should be treated as confidential.
*   Configuration Data:  Cortex configuration files may contain sensitive information, such as credentials for accessing external services.  This data should be treated as highly confidential.
*   Logs: Cortex logs may contain sensitive information, such as IP addresses, usernames, and error messages. This data should be treated as confidential.
