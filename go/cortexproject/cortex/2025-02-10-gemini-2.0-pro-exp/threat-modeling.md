# Threat Model Analysis for cortexproject/cortex

## Threat: [Fake Metric Submission (Spoofing)](./threats/fake_metric_submission__spoofing_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends forged metric data to Cortex, impersonating a legitimate source (e.g., a monitored application). The attacker crafts HTTP requests with manipulated `X-Scope-OrgID` headers (if multi-tenancy is enabled) or other identifying information.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Incorrect alerts are triggered or suppressed.
        *   Dashboards display misleading information.
        *   Autoscaling decisions are based on false data.
        *   Capacity planning is inaccurate.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Distributor`, `Ingester`, `remote_write` API endpoint.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Authentication:** Require authentication for all metric submissions (e.g., API keys, mTLS).
        *   **Authorization:** Enforce authorization policies (only authorized sources can submit metrics for specific tenants/namespaces).
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate the format and content of incoming metric data.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting per source.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the ingestion path.
        *   **Anomaly Detection:** Monitor for unusual patterns in metric submissions.

## Threat: [Tenant Data Leakage (Information Disclosure)](./threats/tenant_data_leakage__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability or misconfiguration in Cortex's multi-tenancy implementation allows one tenant to access data belonging to another. This could be due to bugs in query processing, incorrect `X-Scope-OrgID` handling, or shared resources not properly partitioned.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Confidentiality breach: Sensitive data exposed.
        *   Compliance violations (GDPR, HIPAA).
        *   Reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Querier`, `Query Frontend`, `Store Gateway`, any component handling multi-tenant data; functions related to query parsing, execution, and result filtering.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Tenant Isolation:** Enforce isolation at all layers (query processing, storage, caching).
        *   **Thorough Testing:** Extensive testing, including fuzzing and penetration testing.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Review code related to multi-tenancy.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Components have only necessary permissions.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Audit multi-tenancy configuration and implementation.
        *   **Formal Verification (where feasible):** Consider formal verification.

## Threat: [Ingestion Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)](./threats/ingestion_resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods Cortex with metric data, exceeding the capacity of ingesters or distributors. This can be done via many requests, large samples, or exploiting a vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Metric data loss.
        *   Service degradation.
        *   Outage.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Distributor`, `Ingester`, network infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Strict rate limiting per tenant and source.
        *   **Resource Quotas:** Enforce quotas (CPU, memory, storage) per tenant.
        *   **Horizontal Scaling:** Multiple instances of distributors and ingesters.
        *   **Load Shedding:** Gracefully shed load when overloaded.
        *   **Input Validation:** Limit size and complexity of metric data.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor resource usage; alerts for high utilization.
        *   **Circuit Breakers:** Prevent cascading failures.

## Threat: [Query-Based Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)](./threats/query-based_resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts complex queries that consume excessive resources on queriers or the query-frontend. This could involve large time ranges, many series, complex regex, or expensive computations.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Slow query performance.
        *   Querier/query-frontend crashes.
        *   Denial of service for other users.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Querier`, `Query Frontend`, `Store Gateway`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Query Limits:** Limits on time range, series count, complexity.
        *   **Query Timeout:** Timeouts for queries.
        *   **Resource Quotas:** Limit resources a single query can consume.
        *   **Query Analysis:** Identify and reject malicious queries.
        *   **Caching:** Cache frequent query results.
        *   **Horizontal Scaling:** Multiple instances of queriers/query-frontends.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor query performance and resource usage.

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering (Tampering)](./threats/configuration_tampering__tampering_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Cortex configuration store (etcd, Consul) and modifies the configuration, potentially changing alerting rules, disabling security, modifying storage, or lowering rate limits.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Alerts suppressed/misdirected.
        *   Security controls bypassed.
        *   Data loss/corruption.
        *   Denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** All Cortex components; configuration loading and validation mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Configuration Store:** Protect with strong authentication/authorization.
        *   **Access Control:** Restrict access to authorized users/services.
        *   **Auditing:** Log all configuration changes.
        *   **Configuration Validation:** Validate before applying.
        *   **Regular Backups:** Back up the configuration.
        *   **Integrity Checks:** Detect unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions.

## Threat: [Rule Modification (Tampering)](./threats/rule_modification__tampering_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker gains access to modify alert rules stored in the Ruler, either through direct storage access or by exploiting a vulnerability in the Ruler's API.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Suppression of legitimate alerts.
        *   Generation of false alerts.
        *   Redirection of alerts.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Ruler`, rule storage and management functions.

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure the Ruler's API.
        *   **Access Control:** Restrict access to Ruler's storage.
        *   **Auditing:** Log all rule changes.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate rule syntax and content.
