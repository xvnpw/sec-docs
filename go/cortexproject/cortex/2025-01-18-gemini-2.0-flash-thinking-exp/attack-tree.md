## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Data Ingestion Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_data_ingestion_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Inject Malicious Time-Series Data](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__inject_malicious_time-series_data.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE]** Inject Data with Malicious Payloads (e.g., for alerting rules)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__inject_data_with_malicious_payloads__e_g___for_alerting_rules_.md)

- Attack Vector: An attacker sends crafted time-series data containing malicious payloads.
- Likelihood: Medium
- Impact: Medium (Potential for triggering unintended alerts, suppressing real alerts, or even exploiting vulnerabilities in the alerting rule evaluation engine leading to further compromise).
- Effort: Low
- Skill Level: Intermediate (Requires understanding of Cortex data model and alerting rules).
- Detection Difficulty: Medium (Requires analysis of alerting rule behavior and data patterns).

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Bypass Authentication/Authorization during Ingestion **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__bypass_authenticationauthorization_during_ingestion__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE]** Exploit Weak or Missing Authentication Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_weak_or_missing_authentication_mechanisms.md)

- Attack Vector: The attacker exploits the absence of or weaknesses in the authentication mechanisms required to send data to Cortex. This could involve missing API keys, default credentials, or easily bypassed authentication.
- Likelihood: Medium (Depends heavily on the deployment's security practices).
- Impact: High (Allows the attacker to inject arbitrary data, potentially corrupting metrics or causing denial of service).
- Effort: Low
- Skill Level: Beginner.
- Detection Difficulty: Medium (Look for a lack of expected authentication headers or unusual source IPs).

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Storage Layer Vulnerabilities (Indirectly via Cortex) **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_storage_layer_vulnerabilities__indirectly_via_cortex___critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Gain Unauthorized Access to Underlying Storage (S3, GCS, Cassandra) **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__gain_unauthorized_access_to_underlying_storage__s3__gcs__cassandra___critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE]** Exploit Misconfigurations in Cortex's Storage Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_misconfigurations_in_cortex's_storage_credentials.md)

- Attack Vector: The attacker exploits misconfigurations in how Cortex stores or manages credentials for accessing the underlying storage. This could involve storing credentials in plaintext, using weak encryption, or exposing them through configuration files.
- Likelihood: Medium (A common misconfiguration risk).
- Impact: Critical (Provides full access to all stored time-series data, allowing for exfiltration, modification, or deletion).
- Effort: Low
- Skill Level: Beginner (Identifying exposed credentials).
- Detection Difficulty: Low (If proper credential management and secrets scanning are in place, but often overlooked).

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Leverage Insecure Default Configurations **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__leverage_insecure_default_configurations__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE]** Weak Authentication/Authorization Settings](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__weak_authenticationauthorization_settings.md)

- Attack Vector: The attacker leverages default, insecure authentication or authorization settings that were not changed after deployment. This could involve default passwords or easily guessable credentials for accessing Cortex components or APIs.
- Likelihood: Medium (A common issue if default configurations are not addressed).
- Impact: High (Provides easy access to Cortex functionality, potentially allowing for data manipulation, querying, or control).
- Effort: Low
- Skill Level: Beginner.
- Detection Difficulty: Low (If basic security checks are in place, but often missed).

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Misconfigurations **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_misconfigurations__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE]** Incorrectly Configured Storage Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__incorrectly_configured_storage_credentials.md)

- Attack Vector: Similar to the previous storage credential issue, but focusing on general misconfigurations in how storage credentials are handled within Cortex's configuration.
- Likelihood: Medium (A common misconfiguration risk).
- Impact: Critical (Provides full access to the stored data).
- Effort: Low
- Skill Level: Beginner.
- Detection Difficulty: Low (With proper credential management and secrets scanning).
