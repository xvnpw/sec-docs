# Project Design Document: Cortex - Scalable Monitoring System

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Software Architect

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an enhanced architectural design for the Cortex project, an open-source, horizontally scalable, multi-tenant log aggregation and metrics monitoring system. This revised document aims to offer a more refined and comprehensive understanding of Cortex's components, their interactions, and data flow, serving as a robust foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities.

This design is based on the information available in the official Cortex GitHub repository: [https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex).

## 2. Goals and Objectives

The primary goals of Cortex are:

*   **Scalability:** To efficiently handle ingestion, storage, and querying of large volumes of time-series data and logs.
*   **High Availability:** To ensure continuous operation and data availability even in the face of individual component failures.
*   **Multi-tenancy:** To provide secure and isolated data and resource management for multiple independent users or organizations within a shared infrastructure.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** To leverage cloud-native technologies and efficient storage mechanisms for optimal resource utilization and cost management.
*   **Prometheus Compatibility:** To function as a long-term, scalable storage backend for Prometheus metrics, supporting the PromQL query language.
*   **Loki Compatibility:** To serve as a scalable backend for Loki log aggregation, enabling efficient log storage and querying.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

## 5. Data Flow

The data flow within Cortex can be categorized into two primary paths: the write path for ingesting data and the read path for querying data.

### 5.1. Write Path (Metrics/Logs Ingestion)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Prometheus Agent / Source"] -- "Metrics/Logs (gRPC/HTTP)" --> B["Distributor"]
    B -- "Data (gRPC)" --> C["Ingester"]
    C -- "Data Chunks" --> I["Object Storage"]
    C -- "Index Updates" --> J["Index Database"]
```

*   Metrics or logs are collected by agents or other sources and formatted.
*   The data is sent to the Distributor via gRPC or HTTP.
*   The Distributor hashes the data based on tenant and series labels and forwards it to the appropriate Ingester(s).
*   Ingesters store the data in memory and periodically flush data chunks to Object Storage.
*   Ingesters update the Index Database with the location of the flushed chunks in Object Storage.

### 5.2. Read Path (Querying)

```mermaid
graph LR
    F["Grafana / API Client"] -- "PromQL Query (HTTP)" --> E["Query Frontend (Optional)"]
    subgraph "Query Execution"
        direction LR
        E -- "PromQL Query (gRPC)" --> D["Querier"]
        D -- "Recent Data Query (gRPC)" --> C["Ingester"]
        D -- "Historical Data Query (gRPC)" --> H["Store Gateway"]
        H -- "Chunk Location Query" --> J["Index Database"]
        H -- "Data Retrieval" --> I["Object Storage"]
        C -- "Recent Data" --> D
        H -- "Historical Data" --> D
    end
    D -- "Query Results (gRPC)" --> E
    E -- "Query Results (HTTP)" --> F
```

*   A user or application sends a PromQL query to the Query Frontend (optional) or directly to a Querier.
*   The Query Frontend (if present) can cache the query, split it into smaller parts, and deduplicate requests.
*   The Querier receives the query and determines the time range, identifying which Ingesters hold recent data and which historical data needs to be retrieved from the Store Gateway.
*   The Querier queries the relevant Ingesters for recent data within the query time range.
*   The Querier queries the Store Gateway for historical data within the query time range.
*   The Store Gateway queries the Index Database to find the location of relevant data chunks in Object Storage.
*   The Store Gateway retrieves the necessary chunks from Object Storage.
*   The Querier merges and deduplicates the results received from the Ingesters and the Store Gateway.
*   The Querier returns the consolidated results to the Query Frontend (if present).
*   The Query Frontend returns the results to the client.

## 6. Deployment Architecture

Cortex is designed for deployment in a distributed environment, commonly within a Kubernetes cluster, to leverage its scalability and high availability features. Key deployment considerations include:

*   **Statelessness:** Most Cortex components (Distributor, Querier, Query Frontend, Store Gateway, Compactor) are designed to be stateless, facilitating horizontal scaling by adding more instances.
*   **Stateful Sets for Ingesters:** Ingesters, being stateful, are typically deployed using Kubernetes StatefulSets to ensure stable network identities and persistent storage volume claims.
*   **Replication:** Replication is crucial for data durability and high availability, particularly within the Ingesters (replicating in-memory data) and the Index Database.
*   **Load Balancing:** Load balancers (e.g., Kubernetes Services) are used to distribute traffic evenly across instances of stateless components.
*   **Service Discovery:** Mechanisms like Kubernetes service discovery enable seamless communication and coordination between different Cortex components.
*   **Configuration Management:** Configuration is typically managed through configuration files, command-line flags, or environment variables, often managed by Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets.
*   **Persistent Storage:** Ingesters require persistent storage volumes for storing data before it's flushed to object storage.

## 7. Security Considerations (Initial)

This section outlines initial security considerations relevant to the Cortex architecture, which will be further analyzed during the threat modeling process.

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   Mechanisms for authenticating users and services interacting with Cortex APIs (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
    *   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorizing access to data and administrative functions.
    *   Secure multi-tenancy implementation to ensure data isolation and prevent cross-tenant access.

*   **Data Encryption:**
    *   Encryption in transit using TLS (Transport Layer Security) for all communication between components and with external clients.
    *   Encryption at rest for data stored in object storage and the index database (e.g., using server-side encryption provided by cloud providers).
    *   Secure management and rotation of encryption keys.

*   **Network Security:**
    *   Network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict communication between components and limit external access.
    *   Utilizing network policies in Kubernetes to enforce network isolation.

*   **Input Validation:**
    *   Rigorous validation of incoming metrics and log data to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Sanitization and validation of PromQL queries to mitigate potential malicious queries.

*   **Rate Limiting and Denial of Service (DoS) Protection:**
    *   Implementation of rate limiting on both the write and read paths to prevent abuse and resource exhaustion.
    *   Strategies for mitigating distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

*   **Secrets Management:**
    *   Secure storage and management of sensitive credentials (e.g., database passwords, API keys, access tokens) using secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets).
    *   Avoiding hardcoding secrets in configuration files or code.

*   **Auditing:**
    *   Comprehensive audit logging of important actions, access attempts, and configuration changes for security monitoring and compliance.

## 8. Future Considerations

*   **Enhanced Observability:** Implementing more granular metrics and distributed tracing for internal Cortex operations to aid in debugging and performance analysis.
*   **Improved Query Performance:** Exploring advanced query optimization techniques and data indexing strategies for faster query execution.
*   **Cost Optimization:** Continuously evaluating and implementing strategies for reducing storage costs, compute resource utilization, and network bandwidth consumption.
*   **Integration with other Observability Tools:** Expanding integrations with other tools in the observability ecosystem, such as tracing systems and anomaly detection platforms.
*   **Support for New Data Sources and Formats:**  Adding capabilities to ingest data from a wider range of sources and support additional data formats.

This improved document provides a more detailed and refined understanding of the Cortex architecture, offering a solid foundation for conducting thorough threat modeling and implementing robust security measures.
