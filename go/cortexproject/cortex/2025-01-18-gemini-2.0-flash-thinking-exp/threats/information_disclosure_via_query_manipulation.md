### Deep Analysis of Threat: Information Disclosure via Query Manipulation

This threat focuses on the potential for an attacker in a multi-tenant environment to craft malicious queries that bypass tenant isolation within Cortex, leading to unauthorized access to data belonging to other tenants.

**1. Threat Actor and Motivation:**

*   **Malicious Insider:** A user with legitimate access to the Cortex instance but with malicious intent to access data outside their assigned tenant.
*   **Compromised Account:** An attacker who has gained unauthorized access to a legitimate user's account within the Cortex environment.
*   **External Attacker:** An attacker who has found a way to interact with the Cortex API (e.g., through a vulnerable application using Cortex) and attempts to exploit query manipulation vulnerabilities.

The motivation is primarily **data exfiltration** â€“ gaining access to sensitive information belonging to other tenants for various purposes, including:

*   **Competitive Advantage:** Accessing business-critical data of competitors.
*   **Financial Gain:** Stealing financial data or other valuable information.
*   **Reputational Damage:** Exposing sensitive data to harm the reputation of the affected tenants.
*   **Espionage:** Gathering intelligence on other tenants.

**2. Attack Vectors and Techniques:**

Several potential attack vectors could be employed to manipulate queries and bypass tenant isolation:

*   **Direct Tenant ID Manipulation:**  Attempting to directly modify or inject tenant IDs within the query itself or associated headers/parameters. This relies on weaknesses in how Cortex validates and enforces tenant context. For example, an attacker might try to:
    *   Send a query with a different tenant ID in a header or parameter.
    *   Craft a PromQL query that somehow references data across tenants if tenant ID filtering is not strictly enforced at the query parsing or execution level.
*   **Exploiting Query Language Features:**  Leveraging specific features of PromQL that might inadvertently allow cross-tenant data access if not handled securely. This could involve:
    *   Using functions or operators that might inadvertently aggregate or join data across tenants if tenant context is not properly considered during execution.
    *   Exploiting potential vulnerabilities in the PromQL parser that could allow for the injection of malicious logic.
*   **Bypassing Authorization Checks:**  Finding ways to circumvent or exploit weaknesses in the authorization mechanisms that are supposed to restrict query execution based on tenant context. This could involve:
    *   Exploiting race conditions or timing vulnerabilities in the authorization process.
    *   Leveraging default configurations or misconfigurations that grant overly permissive access.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanism to impersonate a user from another tenant.
*   **Exploiting Logical Flaws in Query Processing:**  Identifying and exploiting logical errors in how the Querier or Query Frontend processes queries, leading to incorrect tenant context being applied or bypassed altogether.

**3. Vulnerability Analysis:**

The core vulnerability lies in the potential for insufficient or improperly implemented tenant isolation mechanisms within the Querier and Query Frontend. Specific areas of concern include:

*   **Inconsistent Tenant ID Handling:**  If tenant IDs are not consistently checked and enforced throughout the entire query processing pipeline, there might be points where an attacker can inject or manipulate them.
*   **Weak Authorization Checks:**  If authorization checks are not granular enough or do not fully consider the tenant context of the query and the data being accessed, attackers might be able to bypass them.
*   **Vulnerabilities in PromQL Parsing and Execution:**  Bugs or design flaws in the PromQL parser or execution engine could allow attackers to craft queries that bypass tenant isolation logic.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  If query inputs are not properly sanitized, attackers might be able to inject malicious code or manipulate query parameters to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Race Conditions:**  Concurrency issues in the query processing pipeline could potentially lead to incorrect tenant context being applied during authorization or data retrieval.

**4. Impact Assessment (Detailed):**

Successful exploitation of this threat can have severe consequences:

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:**  Attackers can gain access to sensitive time-series data belonging to other tenants, including metrics related to performance, usage, security, and business operations.
*   **Data Breach and Privacy Violations:**  Exposure of personal or confidential data can lead to significant legal and regulatory repercussions, including fines and penalties (e.g., under GDPR, HIPAA).
*   **Reputational Damage:**  News of a data breach can severely damage the reputation of the application provider and the affected tenants, leading to loss of trust and customers.
*   **Compliance Violations:**  Failure to maintain tenant isolation can violate compliance requirements for multi-tenant systems, leading to audits and sanctions.
*   **Loss of Competitive Advantage:**  Access to a competitor's data can provide significant unfair advantages.
*   **Service Disruption (Indirect):** While not the primary impact, the investigation and remediation of such an incident can lead to service disruptions.

**5. Plausibility and Likelihood:**

The plausibility of this threat depends on the specific implementation of tenant isolation within the Cortex deployment. If tenant ID filtering and authorization checks are not rigorously implemented and tested, the likelihood of successful exploitation is **high**. The complexity of PromQL and the distributed nature of Cortex can make it challenging to ensure complete and robust tenant isolation.

**6. Evaluation of Existing Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Enforce strict tenant ID filtering at the query layer:** This is a crucial mitigation. However, its effectiveness depends on:
    *   **Implementation Location:**  Filtering must occur early in the query processing pipeline, ideally before any significant data access.
    *   **Completeness:**  Filtering must be applied to all relevant query parameters, headers, and internal processing steps.
    *   **Robustness:**  The filtering mechanism must be resistant to bypass attempts through encoding, injection, or other manipulation techniques.
*   **Implement robust authorization checks for query execution based on tenant context:** This is another essential mitigation. Its effectiveness depends on:
    *   **Granularity:**  Authorization checks should be granular enough to control access to specific data based on tenant context.
    *   **Consistency:**  Authorization checks must be consistently applied across all query execution paths.
    *   **Accuracy:**  The system must accurately determine the tenant context of the user and the data being accessed.
*   **Regularly audit query logs for suspicious activity:** This is a detective control that can help identify and respond to exploitation attempts. However, its effectiveness depends on:
    *   **Log Completeness:**  Logs must capture sufficient information to identify suspicious queries, including tenant IDs, query text, and timestamps.
    *   **Analysis Capabilities:**  Effective tools and processes are needed to analyze the logs and identify anomalies.
    *   **Timeliness of Response:**  Prompt action is required upon detection of suspicious activity.

**7. Further Recommendations and Preventative Measures:**

Beyond the proposed mitigations, the following measures should be considered:

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the necessary permissions to access data within their own tenant. Avoid overly permissive roles or default configurations.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all query inputs to prevent injection attacks and manipulation of query parameters.
*   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Adhere to secure coding practices during the development and maintenance of the application and any custom extensions to Cortex.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting tenant isolation mechanisms in the Cortex deployment.
*   **Automated Testing for Tenant Isolation:**  Implement automated tests that specifically verify the effectiveness of tenant isolation under various query scenarios and attack attempts.
*   **Consider Using Cortex Access Control Features:**  Leverage any built-in access control features provided by Cortex to further restrict data access based on tenant context.
*   **Monitor Resource Usage per Tenant:**  Implement monitoring to track resource usage per tenant, which can help detect unusual activity that might indicate a breach of tenant isolation.
*   **Stay Updated with Cortex Security Advisories:**  Regularly review and apply security patches and updates released by the Cortex project.
*   **Implement Rate Limiting and Throttling:**  Limit the number of queries that can be executed from a single tenant within a given timeframe to mitigate potential abuse.

**Conclusion:**

Information Disclosure via Query Manipulation is a critical threat in multi-tenant Cortex environments. While the proposed mitigation strategies are essential, a layered security approach incorporating robust tenant ID filtering, strict authorization checks, regular auditing, and proactive preventative measures is crucial to effectively mitigate this risk. The development team should prioritize implementing and rigorously testing these measures to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of tenant data. Continuous monitoring and vigilance are necessary to detect and respond to any potential exploitation attempts.
