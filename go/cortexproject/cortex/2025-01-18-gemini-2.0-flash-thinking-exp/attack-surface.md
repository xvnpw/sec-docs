# Attack Surface Analysis for cortexproject/cortex

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Metric Ingestion](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_metric_ingestion.md)

- **Description**: Ingesters or Distributors are exposed without proper authentication, allowing anyone to send metrics.
- **How Cortex Contributes**: Cortex's design allows for pushing metrics to Ingesters/Distributors. If not secured, this becomes an open endpoint.
- **Example**: A malicious actor sends a large volume of arbitrary metrics to overwhelm the system or inject misleading data.
- **Impact**: Denial of Service (DoS), data pollution, incorrect alerting/monitoring.
- **Risk Severity**: **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
    - Implement authentication for metric ingestion using API keys, OAuth 2.0, or mutual TLS.
    - Utilize network policies (firewalls, network segmentation) to restrict access to ingestion endpoints.
    - Implement rate limiting on ingestion endpoints to prevent abuse.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious PromQL Queries](./attack_surfaces/malicious_promql_queries.md)

- **Description**: Attackers exploit the PromQL query language to craft queries that can overload the system, expose sensitive data, or exploit potential vulnerabilities in the query engine.
- **How Cortex Contributes**: Cortex uses PromQL for querying metrics. The complexity and power of PromQL can be misused.
- **Example**: An attacker crafts a highly inefficient query that consumes excessive resources, leading to performance degradation or crashes. Another example is a query designed to extract data from namespaces the user shouldn't have access to if authorization is not properly configured.
- **Impact**: Denial of Service (DoS), information disclosure, performance degradation.
- **Risk Severity**: **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
    - Implement query limits (e.g., max query time, max samples returned, max concurrency).
    - Enforce authorization policies to restrict access to specific metrics based on user roles or namespaces.
    - Regularly review and optimize commonly used queries.
    - Consider using a query analyzer to identify potentially problematic queries.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Shared Secrets/API Keys](./attack_surfaces/compromised_shared_secretsapi_keys.md)

- **Description**: Shared secrets or API keys used for authentication between Cortex components or external systems are compromised.
- **How Cortex Contributes**: Cortex relies on shared secrets for authentication and authorization between its components (e.g., Distributor to Ingester, Query Frontend to Querier) and for external access.
- **Example**: An attacker gains access to the API key used by an application to push metrics, allowing them to inject malicious data. Another example is a compromised secret used for communication between Cortex components, potentially allowing lateral movement or data interception.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, control over Cortex components.
- **Risk Severity**: **Critical**
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
    - Store secrets securely using a secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
    - Implement regular secret rotation policies.
    - Enforce the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions to secrets.
    - Audit access to secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Cortex Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_cortex_dependencies.md)

- **Description**: Cortex relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies that may contain security vulnerabilities.
- **How Cortex Contributes**: As a complex system, Cortex integrates numerous external libraries.
- **Example**: A known vulnerability in a Go library used by Cortex is exploited to gain remote code execution on a Cortex component.
- **Impact**: Remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches.
- **Risk Severity**: **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
    - Regularly scan Cortex deployments and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like vulnerability scanners.
    - Keep Cortex and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    - Implement a process for promptly addressing identified vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Access Controls (RBAC/Namespaces)](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_access_controls__rbacnamespaces_.md)

- **Description**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or namespace isolation within Cortex is not properly configured, allowing unauthorized access to data or actions.
- **How Cortex Contributes**: Cortex provides features for multi-tenancy and access control through namespaces and RBAC. Misconfiguration weakens these boundaries.
- **Example**: A user in one tenant can query metrics belonging to another tenant due to improperly configured namespace isolation. A user with read-only permissions is able to modify alerting rules due to a misconfigured RBAC policy.
- **Impact**: Data breaches, unauthorized modification of configurations, compliance violations.
- **Risk Severity**: **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
    - Implement and enforce a well-defined RBAC policy based on the principle of least privilege.
    - Properly configure namespace isolation to separate tenant data and resources.
    - Regularly review and audit RBAC configurations and namespace assignments.
