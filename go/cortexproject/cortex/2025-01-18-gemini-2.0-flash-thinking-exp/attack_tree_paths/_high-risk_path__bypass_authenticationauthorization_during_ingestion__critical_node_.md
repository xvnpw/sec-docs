### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Bypass Authentication/Authorization during Ingestion

This attack path represents a critical vulnerability where an attacker can successfully send data to the Cortex system without proper authentication or authorization. This means they can potentially inject malicious data, manipulate existing data, or disrupt the service.

**Understanding the Ingestion Process in Cortex:**

Cortex ingests time-series data through various APIs, primarily the Prometheus remote write API. This typically involves:

1. **Client (e.g., Prometheus agent, application exporting metrics) sending data to a Cortex endpoint.** This endpoint is usually handled by the `distributor` component.
2. **Authentication:** The `distributor` (or a gateway in front of it) is expected to authenticate the client. This often involves API keys, OAuth 2.0 tokens, or other authentication mechanisms.
3. **Authorization:** Once authenticated, the system needs to authorize the client to write data for a specific tenant. Cortex is multi-tenant, so ensuring data is written to the correct tenant is crucial.
4. **Data Processing and Storage:** After successful authentication and authorization, the `distributor` hashes the data and forwards it to the appropriate `ingester` nodes for storage.

**Potential Attack Vectors for Bypassing Authentication/Authorization:**

* **Missing or Weak Authentication:**
    * **Unprotected Endpoints:**  Ingestion endpoints might be exposed without any authentication requirements.
    * **Default Credentials:**  If default API keys or credentials are not changed, attackers can use them.
    * **Weak Password Policies:**  Easily guessable passwords for API keys or other authentication methods.
    * **Lack of Mutual TLS (mTLS):** If mTLS is not enforced, attackers can impersonate legitimate clients.

* **Authorization Flaws:**
    * **Broken Access Control:**  Even if authenticated, an attacker might be able to write data to tenants they are not authorized for. This could be due to flaws in the authorization logic.
    * **Tenant ID Manipulation:**  Attackers might try to manipulate tenant identifiers in API requests to write data to unauthorized tenants.
    * **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**  If tenant IDs are predictable or easily guessable, attackers could directly target other tenants.
    * **Missing Authorization Checks:**  The code might lack proper checks to verify if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to write data.

* **API Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Parameter Tampering:**  Attackers might modify request parameters related to authentication or authorization to bypass checks.
    * **Injection Attacks (e.g., SQL Injection - less likely in this context but worth considering for underlying data stores):** While less direct for ingestion, vulnerabilities in components interacting with the ingestion pipeline could be exploited.
    * **Bypass through Alternative Endpoints:**  If multiple ingestion endpoints exist, some might have weaker security controls than others.
    * **Exploiting Rate Limiting or Throttling Issues:** While not a direct bypass, overwhelming the system with unauthenticated requests could potentially mask malicious activity.

* **Configuration Errors:**
    * **Misconfigured Authentication Providers:**  Incorrectly configured OAuth 2.0 providers or other authentication systems could allow unauthorized access.
    * **Permissive Network Policies:**  Firewall rules or network configurations might allow access from untrusted sources.
    * **Disabled Security Features:**  Security features like authentication or authorization checks might be unintentionally disabled.

* **Component Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Vulnerabilities in the `distributor` or gateway components:**  Exploiting known vulnerabilities in these components could allow attackers to bypass authentication/authorization logic.
    * **Vulnerabilities in underlying libraries:**  Flaws in libraries used for authentication or authorization could be exploited.

**Attack Scenarios:**

1. **Scenario 1: Exploiting Missing Authentication:** An attacker discovers an ingestion endpoint that is not protected by any authentication mechanism. They can directly send malicious time-series data to this endpoint, potentially targeting any tenant or creating new, unauthorized tenants.

2. **Scenario 2: Brute-forcing Weak API Keys:** An attacker attempts to brute-force API keys used for authentication. If the key space is small or the key generation is weak, they might succeed and gain unauthorized access to ingest data.

3. **Scenario 3: Tenant ID Manipulation:** An attacker identifies the format of tenant IDs and attempts to manipulate this ID in the API request to write data to a tenant they do not own.

4. **Scenario 4: Exploiting a Vulnerability in the Distributor:** An attacker discovers a known vulnerability in the `distributor` component that allows them to bypass the authentication or authorization checks.

5. **Scenario 5: Leveraging Misconfigured Authentication Provider:** An attacker exploits a misconfiguration in the OAuth 2.0 provider used by Cortex, allowing them to obtain valid tokens for unauthorized tenants.

**Impact of Successful Attack:**

A successful bypass of authentication/authorization during ingestion can have severe consequences:

* **Data Integrity Compromise:** Attackers can inject malicious or incorrect data, leading to inaccurate metrics and potentially flawed decision-making based on that data.
* **Data Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers might be able to write data to other tenants, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.
* **Service Disruption (Availability):** Attackers could flood the system with malicious data, leading to performance degradation or even denial of service.
* **Reputation Damage:**  Security breaches can severely damage the reputation of the organization using Cortex.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Depending on the data being stored, such breaches could lead to violations of regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
* **Resource Exhaustion:**  Injecting large volumes of data can consume significant storage and processing resources.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risk of bypassing authentication/authorization during ingestion, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Enforce Strong Authentication:**
    * **Require API Keys or Tokens:** Implement robust API key management or use secure token-based authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0).
    * **Implement Mutual TLS (mTLS):**  Verify the identity of both the client and the server.
    * **Rotate API Keys Regularly:**  Periodically change API keys to limit the impact of compromised keys.
    * **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** If passwords are used for API key generation or other authentication methods, enforce strong password complexity requirements.

* **Implement Robust Authorization:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to clients.
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to manage permissions based on roles.
    * **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all input, including tenant IDs and other parameters, to prevent manipulation.
    * **Regularly Review Access Policies:**  Ensure access policies are up-to-date and accurately reflect the required permissions.

* **Secure API Design and Implementation:**
    * **Follow Secure Coding Practices:**  Adhere to secure coding guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities.
    * **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize all input data to prevent injection attacks.
    * **Rate Limiting and Throttling:**  Implement rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse and potential denial-of-service attacks.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities.

* **Secure Configuration:**
    * **Secure Default Configurations:**  Ensure default configurations are secure and change default credentials immediately.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege for Network Access:**  Restrict network access to only necessary sources.
    * **Regularly Review Configurations:**  Periodically review and audit configuration settings for potential misconfigurations.

* **Keep Components Up-to-Date:**

    * **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential weaknesses in the system.

* **Monitoring and Logging:**
    * **Comprehensive Logging:**  Log all authentication and authorization attempts, including successes and failures.
    * **Real-time Monitoring:**  Implement real-time monitoring to detect suspicious activity, such as unauthorized access attempts or unusual data ingestion patterns.
    * **Alerting:**  Set up alerts for suspicious events to enable timely response.

**Conclusion:**

The ability to bypass authentication and authorization during data ingestion in Cortex poses a significant security risk. Understanding the potential attack vectors and implementing robust mitigation strategies is crucial for protecting the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the system and the data it stores. A layered security approach, combining strong authentication, robust authorization, secure coding practices, and continuous monitoring, is essential to defend against this critical attack path.
