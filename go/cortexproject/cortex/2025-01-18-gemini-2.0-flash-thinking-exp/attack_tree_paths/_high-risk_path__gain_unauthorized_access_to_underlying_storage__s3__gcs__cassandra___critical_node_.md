### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Gain Unauthorized Access to Underlying Storage (S3, GCS, Cassandra)

Gaining unauthorized access to Cortex's underlying storage represents a critical security breach with potentially devastating consequences. Here's a breakdown of potential attack vectors and considerations:

**4.1 Potential Attack Vectors:**

* **Compromised Credentials/Keys:**
    * **Stolen Access Keys/Tokens:** Attackers could obtain AWS Access Keys, GCS Service Account Keys, or Cassandra credentials used by Cortex components. This could happen through phishing, malware, or exploiting vulnerabilities in systems where these keys are stored or used.
    * **Leaked Credentials in Code/Configuration:** Accidental inclusion of credentials in version control systems, configuration files, or container images.
    * **Compromised IAM Roles/Service Accounts:** If Cortex components are running with overly permissive IAM roles or service accounts, attackers gaining control of these components could inherit those permissions.
* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Cortex Components:**
    * **Authentication/Authorization Bypass:**  Vulnerabilities in Cortex's authentication or authorization logic could allow attackers to bypass access controls and directly interact with the storage.
    * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  If Cortex components are vulnerable to SSRF, attackers could potentially manipulate them to make requests to the storage services using the component's credentials.
* **Misconfigured Storage Access Controls:**
    * **Overly Permissive Bucket Policies (S3/GCS):**  If S3 or GCS bucket policies are configured to allow public access or access from unintended sources, attackers could directly access the data.
    * **Weak Cassandra Authentication/Authorization:**  Default or weak passwords for Cassandra users, or misconfigured role-based access control (RBAC) could be exploited.
    * **Network Segmentation Issues:**  Lack of proper network segmentation could allow attackers who have compromised other parts of the infrastructure to access the storage network.
* **Insider Threats:**
    * Malicious insiders with legitimate access to Cortex infrastructure or credentials could intentionally access and exfiltrate data from the storage.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:**
    * Compromised dependencies or third-party libraries used by Cortex could contain malicious code that grants unauthorized storage access.
* **Exploiting Metadata Services (Cloud Environments):**
    * In cloud environments, attackers gaining access to a Cortex instance might be able to query the instance's metadata service to retrieve temporary security credentials associated with the instance's IAM role.

**4.2 Step-by-Step Attack Scenarios (Examples):**

* **Scenario 1: Stolen AWS Access Key:**
    1. Attacker compromises a developer's workstation and retrieves their AWS access keys.
    2. Using these keys, the attacker directly accesses the S3 bucket used by Cortex, bypassing any application-level authentication.
    3. The attacker can then read, modify, or delete data within the bucket.

* **Scenario 2: Exploiting an SSRF Vulnerability:**
    1. Attacker identifies an SSRF vulnerability in the Cortex Ingester component.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious request that forces the Ingester to make a request to the internal GCS endpoint using the Ingester's service account credentials.
    3. The attacker can then list or download objects from the GCS bucket.

* **Scenario 3: Misconfigured S3 Bucket Policy:**
    1. An administrator accidentally configures the S3 bucket policy to allow public read access.
    2. An attacker discovers the bucket name and can directly access and download all data stored in the bucket without any authentication.

**4.3 Potential Impact:**

Successful unauthorized access to the underlying storage can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach and Confidentiality Loss:** Sensitive time-series data, metrics, and potentially configuration data could be exposed, leading to privacy violations, competitive disadvantage, and regulatory penalties.
* **Data Integrity Compromise:** Attackers could modify or delete data, leading to inaccurate monitoring, alerting failures, and potentially impacting business decisions based on faulty data.
* **Availability Disruption:**  Deleting or corrupting data could lead to service outages and impact the reliability of systems relying on Cortex.
* **Reputational Damage:** A significant data breach can severely damage the reputation of the organization using Cortex.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Depending on the type of data stored, a breach could lead to violations of regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS.
* **Financial Losses:**  Recovery efforts, legal fees, fines, and loss of business can result in significant financial losses.

**4.4 Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to the underlying storage, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Strong Credential Management:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to Cortex components and users accessing the storage.
    * **Secure Storage of Credentials:** Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager) to store and manage storage credentials. Avoid storing credentials directly in code or configuration files.
    * **Regular Key Rotation:** Implement a policy for regular rotation of access keys and tokens.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all accounts with access to storage credentials and the underlying infrastructure.
* **Robust Authentication and Authorization:**
    * **Leverage IAM Roles/Service Accounts:** Utilize IAM roles or service accounts with granular permissions for Cortex components accessing cloud storage.
    * **Implement Strong Authentication Mechanisms:** Ensure robust authentication mechanisms are in place for accessing Cassandra.
    * **Regularly Review and Audit Access Policies:** Periodically review and audit IAM policies, bucket policies, and Cassandra RBAC configurations to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege.
* **Secure Storage Configuration:**
    * **Restrict Bucket Access (S3/GCS):** Configure bucket policies to allow access only from authorized sources (e.g., specific VPCs, IP addresses, IAM roles). Avoid public access unless absolutely necessary and with strict controls.
    * **Enable Encryption at Rest and in Transit:** Utilize server-side encryption for data at rest in S3 and GCS, and ensure TLS encryption is enforced for all communication with the storage systems.
    * **Secure Cassandra Configuration:** Implement strong authentication, authorization, and encryption for Cassandra. Follow security hardening guidelines.
* **Input Validation and Output Sanitization:**
    * Implement robust input validation and output sanitization in Cortex components to prevent vulnerabilities like SSRF.
* **Network Segmentation:**
    * Isolate the storage network from other less trusted networks using firewalls and network access control lists (ACLs).
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
* **Vulnerability Management:**
    * Implement a robust vulnerability management process to promptly patch any identified vulnerabilities in Cortex and its dependencies.
* **Security Monitoring and Alerting:**
    * Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring of storage access attempts and activities.
    * Configure alerts for suspicious activities, such as unauthorized access attempts, data exfiltration, or unusual data modifications.
* **Incident Response Plan:**
    * Develop and regularly test an incident response plan specifically for scenarios involving unauthorized access to the underlying storage.
* **Supply Chain Security:**
    * Carefully vet and monitor third-party dependencies used by Cortex. Utilize software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.

**4.5 Detection and Monitoring:**

Effective detection mechanisms are crucial for identifying and responding to unauthorized storage access attempts:

* **CloudTrail/Audit Logs (S3/GCS):** Monitor CloudTrail logs for API calls related to S3 buckets and GCS buckets used by Cortex. Look for unauthorized `GetObject`, `PutObject`, `DeleteObject`, and other suspicious activities.
* **Cassandra Audit Logging:** Enable and monitor Cassandra audit logs for authentication failures, authorization failures, and data access patterns.
* **Cortex Application Logs:** Analyze Cortex application logs for errors related to storage access, authentication failures, or unexpected behavior.
* **Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns or connections to the storage systems from unauthorized sources.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) System:** Aggregate logs from various sources (cloud provider, Cortex, Cassandra) into a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and correlation of events.
* **Alerting Rules:** Configure alerts in the SIEM system for specific events indicative of unauthorized access attempts.
