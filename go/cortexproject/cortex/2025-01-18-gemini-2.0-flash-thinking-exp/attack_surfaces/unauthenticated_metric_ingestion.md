### 4. Deep Analysis of Unauthenticated Metric Ingestion Attack Surface

#### 4.1. Technical Deep Dive

The core of this vulnerability lies in the fact that Cortex's Ingesters and Distributors, by default or through misconfiguration, can be configured to accept metric data without requiring any form of authentication. This means any entity capable of reaching the network endpoint of these components can send data.

**How Cortex Works (Relevant to this Attack Surface):**

* **Ingesters:**  Responsible for receiving incoming metric samples, validating them, and storing them in memory and eventually in a long-term storage backend. They expose HTTP endpoints for receiving these metrics, typically using protocols like Prometheus's remote write protocol or similar formats.
* **Distributors:** Act as the entry point for queries and writes. They route write requests to the appropriate Ingesters and query requests to the relevant storage. Like Ingesters, they expose HTTP endpoints for receiving metrics.

**The Vulnerability:**

Without authentication, the Ingesters and Distributors act as open endpoints. An attacker can craft HTTP requests containing metric data and send them to these endpoints. The system, lacking any verification mechanism, will process this data as legitimate.

**Technical Details of Metric Ingestion:**

* **Protocols:**  Cortex commonly supports protocols like Prometheus's remote write protocol (using Protocol Buffers over HTTP) and potentially others. Understanding the specific protocol used is crucial for crafting attack payloads.
* **Data Format:**  Metrics are typically sent as time series data, consisting of a metric name, labels (key-value pairs for identifying the source and context of the metric), and a timestamp-value pair.
* **Endpoints:**  The specific HTTP endpoints for ingestion (e.g., `/api/v1/write`) are defined by Cortex's configuration and the chosen ingestion protocol.

#### 4.2. Detailed Attack Vectors

Exploiting unauthenticated metric ingestion opens up several attack vectors:

* **Volume-Based Denial of Service (DoS):**
    * **Mechanism:** An attacker sends a massive volume of legitimate-looking metrics. This can overwhelm the Ingesters, consuming CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.
    * **Impact:**  Ingesters may become unresponsive, leading to dropped metrics from legitimate sources. The system's overall performance degrades, impacting query latency and alerting capabilities. Downstream storage systems might also be overloaded.
    * **Variations:**  The attacker could send a large number of unique time series, exhausting the system's ability to track and index them.

* **Data Poisoning/Metric Spoofing:**
    * **Mechanism:**  The attacker sends metrics with misleading or fabricated data. This could involve injecting incorrect values for existing metrics or creating entirely new, bogus metrics.
    * **Impact:**  Leads to inaccurate monitoring and alerting. Teams might receive false alarms or miss genuine issues due to the polluted data. Incorrect business decisions could be made based on flawed metrics. In some cases, this could be used to mask malicious activity.
    * **Example:** An attacker could inject metrics showing artificially low error rates or high success rates to hide ongoing problems.

* **Resource Exhaustion through High Cardinality Metrics:**
    * **Mechanism:**  The attacker sends metrics with a large number of unique labels or label values. This creates a high number of distinct time series, which can strain the indexing and storage capabilities of Cortex.
    * **Impact:**  Increased memory consumption, slower query performance, and potential instability of the Ingesters and storage backend. This can be a more subtle form of DoS, gradually degrading performance.

* **Exploiting Ingestion Protocol Vulnerabilities (Less Likely but Possible):**
    * **Mechanism:**  While less likely with standard protocols, vulnerabilities might exist in the specific implementation of the ingestion protocol used by Cortex. An attacker could craft malicious payloads that exploit these vulnerabilities.
    * **Impact:**  Could potentially lead to remote code execution or other severe security breaches, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

#### 4.3. Impact Assessment (Expanded)

The impact of successful exploitation of unauthenticated metric ingestion can be significant:

* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  As described above, this can render the monitoring system unusable, preventing timely detection of critical issues.
* **Data Pollution and Integrity Compromise:**  Polluted metrics undermine the reliability of the monitoring data, leading to incorrect insights and potentially flawed decision-making. This can have serious consequences for operational stability and business performance.
* **Incorrect Alerting and Monitoring:**  False positives can lead to alert fatigue and wasted effort, while false negatives can result in missed critical incidents.
* **Resource Consumption and Cost Implications:**  Processing and storing malicious metrics consumes resources, potentially increasing infrastructure costs.
* **Reputational Damage:**  If the monitoring system is compromised and leads to service outages or incorrect reporting, it can damage the organization's reputation.
* **Security Incident Masking:**  Malicious actors could use data poisoning to hide their activities within a flood of fabricated metrics.
* **Compliance Violations:**  In some regulated industries, inaccurate or unreliable monitoring data could lead to compliance violations.

#### 4.4. Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of this vulnerability stems from the lack of enforced authentication on the metric ingestion endpoints. This can arise from several factors:

* **Default Configuration:**  Cortex might have default configurations that do not enforce authentication, requiring explicit configuration by the user.
* **Misconfiguration:**  Administrators might fail to properly configure authentication mechanisms during deployment or upgrades.
* **Lack of Awareness:**  Development or operations teams might not fully understand the security implications of exposing these endpoints without authentication.
* **Simplified Initial Setup:**  For testing or development purposes, authentication might be intentionally disabled and not re-enabled for production.

#### 4.5. Comprehensive Mitigation Strategies

Addressing this vulnerability requires a multi-layered approach:

* **Authentication for Metric Ingestion:** This is the most critical mitigation.
    * **API Keys:**  Generate unique API keys for authorized metric sources. Cortex can be configured to require these keys in the request headers or as query parameters. This provides a simple yet effective way to control access.
    * **OAuth 2.0:**  Integrate with an OAuth 2.0 provider to authenticate metric sources. This offers a more robust and standardized approach, especially in environments with existing identity management systems.
    * **Mutual TLS (mTLS):**  Require clients to present valid certificates signed by a trusted Certificate Authority. This provides strong cryptographic authentication at the transport layer.
    * **Considerations:**  Choose an authentication method that aligns with the organization's security policies and infrastructure. Implement proper key management and rotation practices for API keys.

* **Network Controls and Segmentation:**
    * **Firewalls:**  Configure firewalls to restrict access to the Ingester and Distributor endpoints, allowing only traffic from known and trusted sources.
    * **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the metric ingestion infrastructure within a dedicated network segment with restricted access.
    * **Considerations:**  Regularly review and update firewall rules to reflect changes in authorized sources.

* **Rate Limiting and Throttling:**
    * **Implement rate limiting:**  Configure Cortex or a reverse proxy in front of it to limit the number of requests from a single source within a given time window. This can prevent volume-based DoS attacks.
    * **Throttling:**  Implement mechanisms to temporarily block or slow down sources sending excessive metrics.
    * **Considerations:**  Carefully configure rate limits to avoid impacting legitimate metric ingestion. Monitor rate limiting metrics to identify potential attacks.

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Validate metric data:**  Implement checks on the structure and content of incoming metrics to identify and reject malformed or suspicious data.
    * **Sanitize labels and values:**  Enforce restrictions on the characters and length of labels and values to prevent resource exhaustion through high cardinality metrics.
    * **Considerations:**  This can add overhead to the ingestion process, so optimize validation rules for performance.

* **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    * **Monitor ingestion rates:**  Track the volume of incoming metrics and alert on significant deviations from expected patterns.
    * **Monitor resource utilization:**  Track CPU, memory, and network usage of Ingesters and Distributors to detect potential DoS attacks.
    * **Alert on suspicious metrics:**  Develop rules to identify and alert on metrics with unusual names, labels, or values that might indicate data poisoning.
    * **Considerations:**  Ensure that alerts are actionable and trigger appropriate incident response procedures.

* **Security Best Practices for Cortex Deployment:**
    * **Follow the principle of least privilege:**  Grant only necessary permissions to users and services interacting with Cortex.
    * **Regularly update Cortex:**  Keep Cortex and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    * **Secure the underlying infrastructure:**  Harden the operating systems and networks hosting the Cortex components.
    * **Implement logging and auditing:**  Enable comprehensive logging of ingestion activity for security monitoring and incident investigation.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct periodic security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
