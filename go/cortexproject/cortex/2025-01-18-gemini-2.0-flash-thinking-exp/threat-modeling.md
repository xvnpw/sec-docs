# Threat Model Analysis for cortexproject/cortex

## Threat: [Malicious Metric Injection](./threats/malicious_metric_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker might send a large volume of metrics with high cardinality or crafted metric names/labels to overwhelm the Ingesters. They could also inject metrics with misleading values to skew monitoring data.

**Impact:** Resource exhaustion leading to denial of service, preventing legitimate metric ingestion and querying. Misleading dashboards and alerts due to the injected data, potentially masking real issues or causing incorrect operational decisions.

**Affected Component:** Ingester module, potentially impacting the Distributor and Querier components as well due to resource contention.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust authentication and authorization for metric ingestion using API keys or mutual TLS.
*   Implement rate limiting on incoming metrics based on source and tenant.
*   Validate metric names and labels against a predefined schema.
*   Monitor resource usage of Ingesters and Distributors for anomalies.

## Threat: [Tenant ID Manipulation](./threats/tenant_id_manipulation.md)

**Description:** In a multi-tenant environment, an attacker could attempt to manipulate the tenant ID associated with ingested metrics or logs. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's handling of tenant IDs or intercepting and modifying requests.

**Impact:** Data leakage by injecting data into another tenant's namespace. Data corruption by injecting malicious data into another tenant's namespace. Unauthorized access to another tenant's data through queries if tenant isolation is not strictly enforced.

**Affected Component:** Distributor module, potentially affecting Ingester and Querier components depending on the implementation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strict tenant ID validation and isolation at the ingestion point.
*   Use secure and tamper-proof methods for propagating tenant context throughout the system.
*   Implement thorough authorization checks based on tenant ID for all data access and modification operations.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Object Storage](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_object_storage.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the underlying object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) used by Cortex for long-term storage. This could be achieved through compromised credentials *used by Cortex*, misconfigured access policies *related to Cortex's access*, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the storage provider *impacting Cortex's access*.

**Impact:** Data exfiltration of historical metrics and logs. Data tampering or deletion, leading to loss of valuable monitoring data and impacting auditability. Denial of service by deleting critical data.

**Affected Component:**  Storage engine interface within various Cortex components (e.g., Compactor, Ruler, Querier).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure object storage credentials used by Cortex using strong passwords or key management systems.
*   Implement the principle of least privilege for access policies, granting only necessary permissions to Cortex components.
*   Enable encryption at rest for data stored in object storage.
*   Regularly audit access logs for the object storage *related to Cortex's activity*.

## Threat: [Database Compromise (Metadata Store)](./threats/database_compromise__metadata_store_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could compromise the database used by Cortex for storing metadata (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB). This could involve exploiting database vulnerabilities, gaining access through weak credentials *used by Cortex*, or exploiting network vulnerabilities *affecting Cortex's database access*.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive metadata, including tenant information, user configurations, and internal system settings. Potential manipulation of metadata, leading to incorrect query routing or other operational disruptions.

**Affected Component:**  Metadata store interface within various Cortex components (e.g., Distributor, Querier).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure database credentials used by Cortex and access policies.
*   Harden the database server and network configurations *relevant to Cortex's deployment*.
*   Keep the database software up-to-date with security patches.
*   Implement encryption at rest and in transit for database communication *used by Cortex*.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Query Manipulation](./threats/information_disclosure_via_query_manipulation.md)

**Description:** In multi-tenant environments, an attacker might attempt to manipulate queries to bypass tenant isolation and access data from other tenants. This could involve crafting queries that exploit vulnerabilities in the query engine or rely on insufficient authorization checks *within Cortex*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data belonging to other tenants. Violation of data privacy and compliance regulations.

**Affected Component:** Querier module, Query Frontend.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strict tenant ID filtering at the query layer.
*   Implement robust authorization checks for query execution based on tenant context.
*   Regularly audit query logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Exploiting Query Engine Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_query_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the PromQL or LogQL query engines by crafting specific malicious queries.

**Impact:**  Potentially gain unauthorized access to data, cause denial of service, or even execute arbitrary code on the Querier nodes.

**Affected Component:** Querier module, Query Frontend.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Cortex components updated to the latest versions with security patches.
*   Monitor security advisories for Cortex and its dependencies.
*   Implement input validation and sanitization for query parameters (though direct user input to raw PromQL/LogQL should be minimized).

## Threat: [Insecure Inter-Component Communication](./threats/insecure_inter-component_communication.md)

**Description:** Communication between different Cortex components (e.g., Ingester to Distributor, Querier to Store) might not be properly secured, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on or intercept sensitive data in transit.

**Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive metric and log data. Potential for man-in-the-middle attacks to modify data or impersonate components.

**Affected Component:** Network communication layer between all Cortex components.

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the sensitivity of the data).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable TLS encryption for all inter-component communication.
*   Implement mutual authentication (mTLS) between components to verify their identities.
*   Isolate Cortex components within a secure network environment.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

**Description:** Sensitive configuration data *specific to Cortex*, such as database credentials, API keys, or TLS certificates, might be exposed through insecure storage or access controls.

**Impact:** Compromise of Cortex components and underlying infrastructure. Unauthorized access to data and systems.

**Affected Component:** Configuration management and deployment processes *for Cortex*.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the exposed data).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store sensitive configuration data securely using secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets).
*   Avoid storing secrets directly in configuration files or environment variables.
*   Implement strict access controls for configuration files and secrets *used by Cortex*.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries.md)

**Description:** Cortex relies on various third-party libraries, which may contain security vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to various security breaches, including remote code execution, denial of service, or data breaches *within Cortex*.

**Affected Component:** All Cortex components that depend on vulnerable libraries.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (High and Critical vulnerabilities are included here).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like Dependabot or Snyk.
*   Keep dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
*   Implement a process for promptly addressing identified vulnerabilities.
