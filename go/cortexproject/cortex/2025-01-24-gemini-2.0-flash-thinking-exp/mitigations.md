# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for cortexproject/cortex

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce TLS Encryption for Ingester Communication](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_tls_encryption_for_ingester_communication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate TLS Certificates:** Create TLS certificates for both Cortex distributors and ingesters. Use a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or a self-signed CA for internal environments.
    2.  **Configure Distributor TLS:** In the Cortex distributor configuration file (e.g., `distributor.yaml`), enable TLS and specify the path to the distributor's certificate and private key. Configure the CA certificate to verify ingester certificates.
    3.  **Configure Ingester TLS:** In the Cortex ingester configuration file (e.g., `ingester.yaml`), enable TLS and specify the path to the ingester's certificate and private key. Configure the CA certificate to verify distributor certificates (if using mTLS).
    4.  **Update Service Discovery:** If using service discovery for Cortex, ensure the distributor and ingester endpoints are configured to use HTTPS (port 443 or a custom TLS port) instead of HTTP.
    5.  **Test Connectivity:** Verify that Cortex distributors can successfully connect to ingesters over TLS by monitoring logs and network traffic.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Eavesdropping (High Severity):**  Unauthorized interception of sensitive metric data in transit between Cortex distributors and ingesters.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):**  An attacker intercepts and potentially modifies communication between Cortex distributors and ingesters.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Eavesdropping:** High Risk Reduction - TLS encryption makes it extremely difficult for attackers to decrypt and understand the data in transit within Cortex.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** High Risk Reduction - TLS with proper certificate validation prevents attackers from impersonating legitimate Cortex components and intercepting communication.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. TLS is enabled for external HTTPS access to Cortex components (e.g., Querier, Ruler), but internal distributor-to-ingester communication within Cortex is currently using plaintext HTTP for simplicity during initial development.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** TLS encryption needs to be fully configured and enforced for internal distributor-to-ingester communication within Cortex. Mutual TLS (mTLS) is also not yet implemented for Cortex internal communication.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Distributor Input Validation and Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/implement_distributor_input_validation_and_sanitization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Allowed Characters:**  Specify a whitelist of allowed characters for metric names, label names, and label values ingested by Cortex distributors. Restrict special characters and control characters that could be used for injection attacks.
    2.  **Implement Validation Logic:**  In the Cortex distributor code or a component sitting in front of it, add validation functions that check incoming metric data against the defined whitelist. Reject metrics that contain invalid characters before they are processed by Cortex.
    3.  **Enforce Length Limits:**  Set maximum lengths for metric names, label names, and label values ingested by Cortex to prevent buffer overflows and resource exhaustion within Cortex components.
    4.  **Sanitize Special Characters:**  For characters that are allowed but could be problematic (e.g., quotes, backslashes), implement sanitization functions to escape or remove them before data is processed by Cortex.
    5.  **Logging and Monitoring:**  Log rejected metrics and validation failures for monitoring and debugging purposes related to Cortex ingestion. Alert on excessive validation failures, which could indicate malicious activity targeting Cortex.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Injection Attacks (Medium to High Severity):**  Attackers inject malicious code or commands through metric names, labels, or values that are not properly validated by Cortex distributors, potentially leading to data corruption or denial of service within Cortex.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via High Cardinality Metrics (Medium Severity):**  Attackers send metrics with excessively large or unbounded label sets to Cortex, overwhelming the system and causing performance degradation or outages within Cortex.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Injection Attacks:** Medium to High Risk Reduction - Input validation significantly reduces the attack surface for injection vulnerabilities within Cortex by preventing the introduction of malicious data.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via High Cardinality Metrics:** Medium Risk Reduction -  While input validation alone doesn't fully prevent high cardinality issues, it can help by limiting the complexity and size of metric data ingested into Cortex, making it harder to exploit. Cardinality limits within Cortex are a more direct mitigation for DoS.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Basic input validation is in place to reject metrics with extremely long names or values before they reach Cortex distributors, but detailed character whitelisting and sanitization are not yet fully implemented specifically for Cortex ingestion.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement comprehensive input validation with character whitelisting, sanitization, and stricter length limits specifically for the Cortex distributor component or pre-ingestion pipeline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Querier Access Control and Rate Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/implement_querier_access_control_and_rate_limiting.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Integrate Authentication:** Integrate the Cortex querier component with your application's authentication system (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys, JWT). Require users or services to authenticate before accessing the Cortex querier API.
    2.  **Implement Authorization:** Define roles and permissions for accessing metrics data within Cortex. Implement authorization logic in the Cortex querier to ensure users can only access metrics they are authorized to view. This can be based on tenant IDs, metric namespaces within Cortex, or other access control policies.
    3.  **Configure Rate Limiting:**  Use Cortex's built-in rate limiting features or integrate with a dedicated rate limiting service to protect the Cortex querier. Define rate limits based on query complexity, user roles, or tenant quotas within Cortex.
    4.  **Monitor Query Usage:**  Monitor query patterns and rate limiting metrics for the Cortex querier to identify potential abuse or misconfigurations. Adjust rate limits as needed based on observed usage of Cortex queries.
    5.  **Secure API Endpoints:** Ensure the Cortex querier API endpoints are only accessible through HTTPS and are protected by appropriate network security measures (e.g., firewalls) to safeguard access to Cortex data.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):**  Unauthorized users or services gain access to sensitive metrics data stored and queried by Cortex, leading to information disclosure and potential privacy violations.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Query Flooding (Medium to High Severity):**  Attackers flood the Cortex querier with excessive queries, overwhelming the system and causing performance degradation or outages of the Cortex querying functionality.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** High Risk Reduction - Access control mechanisms prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data queried from Cortex by enforcing authentication and authorization policies.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Query Flooding:** Medium to High Risk Reduction - Rate limiting effectively mitigates DoS attacks against the Cortex querier by limiting the number of queries from any single source, preventing resource exhaustion within Cortex.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Basic API key authentication is implemented for the Cortex querier, but fine-grained authorization based on roles and permissions within Cortex is not yet in place. Rate limiting is configured at a basic level for Cortex queries but needs further refinement.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement role-based access control (RBAC) for the Cortex querier, refine rate limiting policies based on Cortex query usage patterns, and potentially integrate with a more robust authentication and authorization service for Cortex access.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strict Tenant Isolation in Multi-Tenant Environments](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strict_tenant_isolation_in_multi-tenant_environments.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Tenant ID Enforcement:**  Ensure that tenant IDs are correctly propagated and validated throughout the entire Cortex stack (distributor, ingester, querier, compactor, ruler). This is a core feature of Cortex multi-tenancy.
    2.  **Namespace Isolation:**  Utilize Cortex's namespace features to logically separate data for different tenants within Cortex. Configure components to operate within specific namespaces based on tenant IDs.
    3.  **Storage Isolation:**  If possible, physically or logically separate storage backends for different tenants to prevent data leakage and improve performance isolation within the context of Cortex data storage. This might involve using separate S3 buckets, Cassandra keyspaces, or database schemas for different Cortex tenants.
    4.  **Resource Quotas and Limits per Tenant:**  Configure resource quotas and limits (CPU, memory, storage, query rate) per tenant within Cortex to prevent noisy neighbor issues and ensure fair resource allocation for Cortex tenants.
    5.  **Regular Audits:**  Conduct regular audits of tenant configurations, access controls, and resource usage within Cortex to ensure proper isolation and identify any misconfigurations or potential vulnerabilities in the Cortex multi-tenancy setup.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Tenant Data Access (High Severity):**  One tenant gains unauthorized access to another tenant's metrics data within Cortex due to misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in Cortex's tenant isolation mechanisms.
        *   **Noisy Neighbor Issues (Medium Severity):**  One tenant's excessive resource consumption impacts the performance or availability of other tenants in a shared Cortex environment.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Cross-Tenant Data Access:** High Risk Reduction - Strict tenant isolation mechanisms within Cortex prevent unauthorized cross-tenant data access, protecting data confidentiality and integrity within the Cortex system.
        *   **Noisy Neighbor Issues:** Medium to High Risk Reduction - Resource quotas and limits within Cortex mitigate noisy neighbor issues by ensuring fair resource allocation and preventing one tenant from monopolizing resources within the shared Cortex environment.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Tenant IDs are used for basic data separation within Cortex, but full namespace isolation and resource quotas are not yet fully configured within Cortex. Storage is currently shared across tenants in the Cortex deployment.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement full namespace isolation within Cortex, configure resource quotas and limits per tenant within Cortex, and explore options for storage isolation to enhance multi-tenancy security and performance of the Cortex deployment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Storage Backend Configuration *for Cortex*](./mitigation_strategies/secure_storage_backend_configuration_for_cortex.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant Cortex components only the minimum necessary permissions to access the storage backend. Avoid using overly permissive IAM roles or access keys for Cortex storage access.
    2.  **Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Bucket Policies:**  For object storage (e.g., S3, GCS) used by Cortex, implement restrictive bucket policies and ACLs to limit access to Cortex components and authorized administrators.
    3.  **Encryption at Rest:**  Enable encryption at rest for the storage backend used by Cortex to protect data confidentiality if the storage media is compromised. Use server-side encryption or client-side encryption depending on your requirements and storage provider capabilities for Cortex data.
    4.  **Network Segmentation:**  For stateful storage (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB) used by Cortex, place the storage cluster in a separate network segment with strict firewall rules to restrict access to Cortex components and authorized administrative access only.
    5.  **Regular Security Audits of Storage Configuration:**  Periodically review and audit the storage backend configuration, access controls, and encryption settings specifically for the storage used by Cortex to ensure they remain secure and compliant with security best practices for Cortex data.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Breach via Storage Access (High Severity):**  Unauthorized access to the storage backend used by Cortex leads to a data breach and exposure of sensitive metrics data managed by Cortex.
        *   **Data Tampering (Medium to High Severity):**  Attackers with unauthorized storage access can modify or delete metrics data stored by Cortex, compromising data integrity and potentially disrupting monitoring and alerting based on Cortex data.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Breach via Storage Access:** High Risk Reduction - Secure storage configuration specifically for Cortex significantly reduces the risk of data breaches by limiting access to Cortex data and encrypting data at rest.
        *   **Data Tampering:** Medium to High Risk Reduction - Access controls and data integrity measures (like encryption and potentially data signing) make it more difficult for attackers to tamper with data stored by Cortex.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Basic IAM roles are used for Cortex components to access the S3 storage backend, and server-side encryption is enabled for Cortex data. However, bucket policies and ACLs are not yet fully refined for Cortex storage access, and network segmentation for storage used by Cortex is not implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to refine S3 bucket policies and ACLs for stricter access control for Cortex storage, implement network segmentation for the storage backend used by Cortex, and regularly audit storage security configurations related to Cortex.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Component Resource Limits and Quotas](./mitigation_strategies/configure_component_resource_limits_and_quotas.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Resource Requirements:**  Analyze the resource requirements (CPU, memory) for each Cortex component (distributor, ingester, querier, compactor, ruler) based on expected workload and scale of your Cortex deployment.
    2.  **Set Resource Limits in Deployment Manifests:**  In your deployment manifests (e.g., Kubernetes YAML files), configure resource limits and requests for each Cortex container. This is standard practice for deploying Cortex in containerized environments.
    3.  **Implement Circuit Breakers and Timeouts:**  Configure circuit breakers and timeouts within Cortex components to prevent cascading failures and improve resilience against overload or misbehaving upstream services interacting with Cortex.
    4.  **Monitor Resource Usage:**  Monitor resource usage for each Cortex component using Prometheus and Grafana. Set up alerts for Cortex components approaching resource limits or experiencing performance degradation.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Adjust Limits:**  Periodically review resource limits and quotas for Cortex components based on observed usage patterns and performance. Adjust limits as needed to optimize resource utilization and prevent resource exhaustion within the Cortex system.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Medium to High Severity):**  A Cortex component consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory), leading to performance degradation or outages for itself and potentially other Cortex components.
        *   **Cascading Failures (Medium Severity):**  Failure of one Cortex component due to resource exhaustion can cascade to other Cortex components, leading to a wider system outage within the Cortex deployment.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion:** Medium to High Risk Reduction - Resource limits prevent individual Cortex components from consuming excessive resources, mitigating DoS attacks caused by resource exhaustion within Cortex.
        *   **Cascading Failures:** Medium Risk Reduction - Circuit breakers and timeouts within Cortex improve system resilience and prevent cascading failures by isolating failures within Cortex and preventing them from propagating to other Cortex components.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Basic resource limits are set in Kubernetes deployment manifests for Cortex components, but circuit breakers and timeouts are not fully configured within Cortex components themselves. Resource monitoring for Cortex is in place, but alerts for resource exhaustion need refinement.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement circuit breakers and timeouts within Cortex components, refine resource monitoring alerts specifically for Cortex resource usage, and regularly review and adjust resource limits based on performance and usage data of the Cortex deployment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitoring and Alerting for Security Events *within Cortex*](./mitigation_strategies/monitoring_and_alerting_for_security_events_within_cortex.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Centralized Logging:**  Configure Cortex components to send logs to a centralized logging system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Loki, Splunk). Focus on logs generated by Cortex components.
    2.  **Security-Focused Logging:**  Ensure logs from Cortex include security-relevant events such as authentication failures to the Cortex querier, authorization violations within Cortex, API access logs to Cortex components, and suspicious query patterns directed at Cortex.
    3.  **SIEM Integration:**  Integrate Cortex security logs with your Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for centralized monitoring, analysis, and correlation of security events specifically related to Cortex.
    4.  **Alerting Rules:**  Define alerting rules in your monitoring system to detect security-relevant events in Cortex logs. Set up alerts for suspicious activity targeting Cortex, unauthorized access attempts to Cortex, and potential security incidents within the Cortex deployment.
    5.  **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop an incident response plan for security alerts related to Cortex. Define procedures for investigating and responding to security incidents originating from or targeting the Cortex monitoring system.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Delayed Incident Detection (Medium to High Severity):**  Without proper monitoring and alerting of Cortex security events, security incidents targeting or originating from Cortex may go undetected for extended periods, allowing attackers to cause more damage to the Cortex system or the wider application.
        *   **Insufficient Security Visibility (Medium Severity):**  Lack of security monitoring for Cortex makes it difficult to understand the security posture of the Cortex deployment and identify potential vulnerabilities or attacks targeting the Cortex system.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Delayed Incident Detection:** High Risk Reduction - Monitoring and alerting of Cortex security events enable timely detection of security incidents related to Cortex, allowing for faster response and mitigation of threats to the Cortex system.
        *   **Insufficient Security Visibility:** Medium Risk Reduction - Security monitoring of Cortex provides visibility into security-relevant events and trends within the Cortex deployment, improving overall security awareness and enabling proactive security measures for the Cortex monitoring system.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Cortex logs are sent to a centralized logging system, and basic monitoring is in place for Cortex components. However, security-focused logging and alerting rules specifically for Cortex security events are not yet fully defined, and SIEM integration for Cortex security logs is not implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to enhance logging to include more security-relevant events from Cortex components, define specific alerting rules for security incidents related to Cortex, and integrate Cortex security logs with a SIEM system for comprehensive security monitoring and incident response for the Cortex deployment.
