# Threat Model Analysis for cortexproject/cortex

## Threat: [Malicious Ingester Data Injection](./threats/malicious_ingester_data_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker, potentially exploiting a vulnerability in the application's data ingestion pipeline or gaining unauthorized access to an ingester's API, sends fabricated or malicious time-series data. This data could be designed to mislead monitoring, trigger false alerts, or even influence application behavior if the application relies on this data for decision-making.

**Impact:** Inaccurate monitoring, misleading alerts, potential for application malfunction based on false data, skewed analytics and reporting.

**Affected Component:** Ingester API (specifically the write endpoints).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust authentication and authorization for ingester APIs.
*   Validate data at the application level before sending it to Cortex.
*   Use mutual TLS (mTLS) for communication between the application and ingesters.
*   Implement rate limiting on ingestion endpoints to prevent abuse.
*   Consider using signed metrics if the ingestion protocol supports it.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Query Access](./threats/unauthorized_query_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Cortex query endpoints (e.g., PromQL API) and retrieves sensitive time-series data. This could be achieved through compromised credentials, exploiting API vulnerabilities, or misconfigured access controls.

**Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive operational data, business metrics, or potentially user-related information if exposed through metrics.

**Affected Component:** Querier API (PromQL endpoints), Store Gateway API.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for query APIs.
*   Enforce granular access control policies to restrict data access based on user roles or tenants.
*   Use TLS (HTTPS) to encrypt communication with query endpoints.
*   Regularly audit access logs for suspicious query patterns.
*   Consider using a dedicated authentication and authorization service for Cortex.

## Threat: [Rule Tampering Leading to Alert Suppression or Modification](./threats/rule_tampering_leading_to_alert_suppression_or_modification.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Ruler component (or its API) and modifies existing alerting or recording rules. This could involve disabling critical alerts, altering alert thresholds, or creating misleading recording rules.

**Impact:** Failure to detect critical issues, delayed incident response, misleading operational insights.

**Affected Component:** Ruler API, Ruler evaluation engine, rule storage backend.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the Ruler API.
*   Implement version control and change tracking for alerting and recording rules.
*   Regularly review and audit configured rules for unexpected changes.
*   Restrict access to rule management to authorized personnel only.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Queries](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_queries.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends deliberately crafted, resource-intensive PromQL queries that consume excessive CPU, memory, or I/O resources on the Queriers and Store Gateways. This can lead to performance degradation or denial of service for legitimate users.

**Impact:** Slow query response times, service unavailability, impact on dependent applications relying on Cortex data.

**Affected Component:** Querier, Store Gateway.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement query limits and timeouts on the Querier.
*   Analyze and optimize frequently executed queries.
*   Monitor resource utilization of Queriers and Store Gateways.
*   Consider using query analysis tools to identify potentially expensive queries.
*   Implement rate limiting on query endpoints.

## Threat: [Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against Ingestion](./threats/distributed_denial_of_service__ddos__against_ingestion.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the Cortex ingestion endpoints with a large volume of illegitimate data, overwhelming the Distributors and Ingesters. This can lead to dropped metrics, delayed processing, and potentially service unavailability.

**Impact:** Loss of monitoring data, delayed alerts, potential instability of the Cortex cluster.

**Affected Component:** Distributor, Ingester API.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement rate limiting on ingestion endpoints.
*   Use network-level protection mechanisms (e.g., firewalls, DDoS mitigation services).
*   Authenticate and authorize data sources to prevent anonymous ingestion.
*   Implement mechanisms to identify and block malicious sources.

## Threat: [Tenant Data Leakage in Multi-Tenant Environment](./threats/tenant_data_leakage_in_multi-tenant_environment.md)

**Description:** In a multi-tenant Cortex deployment, a vulnerability or misconfiguration could allow an attacker to access time-series data belonging to other tenants.

**Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive data belonging to other tenants, violation of data privacy regulations.

**Affected Component:** Distributor (tenant isolation logic), Querier (tenant filtering), Store Gateway (tenant data access).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly test and validate tenant isolation mechanisms.
*   Implement strict access control policies based on tenant IDs.
*   Regularly audit tenant configurations and access patterns.
*   Ensure proper resource isolation between tenants.

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering](./threats/configuration_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Cortex configuration files or runtime parameters and modifies them. This could lead to unexpected behavior, performance degradation, or the introduction of security vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Service disruption, performance issues, potential security breaches due to misconfigurations.

**Affected Component:** Configuration management for all Cortex components.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Secure configuration files with appropriate permissions.
*   Implement access control for modifying runtime parameters.
*   Use a centralized configuration management system with audit logging.
*   Regularly review and audit configuration settings.
