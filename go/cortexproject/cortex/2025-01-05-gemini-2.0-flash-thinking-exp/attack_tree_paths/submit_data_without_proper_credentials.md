## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Submit Data Without Proper Credentials in Cortex

This analysis delves into the attack path "Submit Data Without Proper Credentials" within the context of a Cortex application. We will break down the potential vulnerabilities, attack vectors, impact, and mitigation strategies from a cybersecurity perspective, specifically considering the architecture and functionalities of Cortex.

**Attack Tree Path:** Submit Data Without Proper Credentials

* **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (depends on configuration)
* **Impact:** High
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Novice
* **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate
* **Detailed Breakdown:** A likely path if authentication is misconfigured or weak.

**1. Deeper Dive into the Attack Path:**

This attack path centers around the ability of an unauthorized entity to successfully send data to a Cortex component without providing valid authentication credentials. This bypasses the intended security measures designed to control access and ensure data integrity.

**What "Submitting Data" Means in Cortex:**

In the context of Cortex, "submitting data" can encompass various actions depending on the component involved:

* **Ingesters:** Sending time-series metrics data.
* **Distributors:** Forwarding metrics data to ingesters.
* **Compactors:** Potentially triggering compaction jobs (though less direct data submission).
* **Queriers:** While not directly submitting data, a compromised querier could potentially be used to inject malicious queries that could indirectly impact data integrity or availability.
* **Alertmanager:** Submitting alert definitions or firing alerts.
* **Ruler:** Submitting recording rules or alerting rules.
* **Grafana (interacting with Cortex):**  While Grafana itself isn't a Cortex component, it interacts with Cortex. A misconfiguration allowing unauthorized access to Grafana's Cortex data source could be considered within this scope.

**"Without Proper Credentials" Scenarios:**

This attack path can manifest in several ways:

* **Missing Authentication:**  The Cortex instance is deployed without any authentication mechanism enabled. This is highly insecure and unlikely in production environments but can occur during development or misconfiguration.
* **Weak or Default Credentials:**  Default usernames and passwords are used and haven't been changed. This is a common vulnerability across many systems.
* **Misconfigured Authentication Middleware:**  Authentication middleware (e.g., basic auth, OAuth 2.0, mTLS) is improperly configured, allowing requests to bypass authentication checks. This could involve:
    * Incorrectly configured bypass rules.
    * Missing or ineffective validation of authentication tokens.
    * Errors in the authentication logic itself.
* **Authorization Bypass:**  While authentication might be present, the authorization mechanism (determining what authenticated users can do) is flawed. This allows users with insufficient privileges to submit data.
* **Network Segmentation Issues:**  Internal networks where Cortex components reside are not properly segmented, allowing attackers who have gained access to the network to directly interact with Cortex components without needing external authentication.
* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Authentication Mechanisms:**  Known vulnerabilities in the specific authentication methods used (e.g., vulnerabilities in specific OAuth 2.0 flows or JWT implementations) could be exploited.

**2. Potential Root Causes and Vulnerabilities:**

* **Insecure Defaults:**  Cortex, by default, might have configurations that need to be hardened for production environments. Failing to change default settings is a common mistake.
* **Lack of Security Awareness:**  Developers or operators might not fully understand the importance of secure authentication and authorization within the Cortex ecosystem.
* **Complex Configuration:**  Cortex has a rich set of configuration options, and misconfigurations can easily occur, especially in distributed deployments.
* **Insufficient Testing:**  Security testing, particularly around authentication and authorization, might be inadequate, failing to identify vulnerabilities before deployment.
* **Outdated Software:**  Using older versions of Cortex or its dependencies with known security vulnerabilities related to authentication.
* **Human Error:**  Simple mistakes in configuration files or deployment scripts can lead to authentication bypasses.

**3. Specific Cortex Components at Risk:**

The impact of this attack path varies depending on which Cortex component is targeted:

* **Ingesters:**  Unauthorized submission of metrics can lead to:
    * **Data Corruption:** Injecting false or malicious metrics, skewing dashboards and alerting.
    * **Resource Exhaustion:** Flooding the ingesters with excessive data, leading to performance degradation or denial of service.
    * **Compliance Violations:**  Injecting data that violates regulatory requirements.
* **Distributors:**  While less direct, a compromised distributor could potentially be used to amplify attacks against ingesters.
* **Alertmanager/Ruler:**  Unauthorized submission of alert definitions or rules can lead to:
    * **Suppression of Legitimate Alerts:**  Attackers could disable or modify alerts, masking malicious activity.
    * **False Positive Alerts:**  Injecting rules that trigger unnecessary alerts, causing disruption and alert fatigue.
* **Queriers:**  While not directly submitting data, unauthorized access to query data could reveal sensitive information. In some scenarios, a compromised querier could potentially be used for indirect data manipulation.

**4. Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:**

Let's consider a scenario targeting the Ingester component with a misconfigured basic authentication:

1. **Reconnaissance:** The attacker identifies an open port for the Ingester service (e.g., port 9009).
2. **Attempt Unauthenticated Request:** The attacker sends a `POST` request to the Ingester's `/api/v1/push` endpoint with Prometheus-formatted metrics data, but without any `Authorization` header.
3. **Vulnerability Exploitation:** Due to a misconfiguration in the authentication middleware, the request bypasses the authentication check. This could be due to a missing or incorrect configuration setting.
4. **Data Injection:** The Ingester accepts the unauthenticated metrics data and stores it.
5. **Impact:** The injected malicious metrics pollute the time-series database, potentially leading to incorrect dashboards, suppressed alerts, or resource exhaustion if a large volume of data is injected.

**5. Security Implications:**

The successful exploitation of this attack path can have severe consequences:

* **Data Integrity Compromise:**  Injected, modified, or deleted data can undermine the reliability of monitoring and alerting systems.
* **Availability Disruption:**  Resource exhaustion attacks can lead to denial of service, impacting the ability to monitor critical infrastructure.
* **Confidentiality Breach:**  While this specific attack path focuses on data submission, it highlights weaknesses in access control that could be exploited for unauthorized data retrieval in other scenarios.
* **Compliance and Regulatory Issues:**  Compromised monitoring data can lead to violations of industry regulations and compliance standards.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Security breaches can damage the reputation of the organization using the vulnerable Cortex instance.

**6. Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively mitigate this attack path, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Enforce Strong Authentication:**
    * **Enable Authentication:** Ensure that authentication is enabled for all critical Cortex components.
    * **Use Strong Authentication Mechanisms:**  Implement robust authentication methods beyond basic authentication, such as:
        * **OAuth 2.0:** Integrate with identity providers for centralized authentication and authorization.
        * **mTLS (Mutual TLS):**  Require client certificates for authentication, providing strong identity verification.
        * **OpenID Connect (OIDC):**  An identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0 for user authentication.
    * **Rotate Credentials Regularly:**  Implement a policy for regular rotation of API keys, passwords, and certificates.
* **Implement Robust Authorization:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to users and services.
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Define roles with specific permissions and assign users to these roles.
    * **Tenant Isolation:**  If using Cortex in a multi-tenant environment, strictly enforce tenant isolation to prevent cross-tenant data access or modification.
* **Secure Configuration Management:**
    * **Configuration as Code:**  Manage Cortex configurations using version control systems to track changes and facilitate rollbacks.
    * **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular audits of Cortex configurations to identify potential misconfigurations.
    * **Hardening Guides:**  Follow official Cortex hardening guides and best practices.
* **Network Security:**
    * **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate Cortex components within secure network segments, limiting access from untrusted networks.
    * **Firewall Rules:**  Implement strict firewall rules to control network traffic to and from Cortex components.
    * **Use TLS Encryption:**  Ensure all communication between Cortex components and clients is encrypted using TLS.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * While this attack bypasses authentication, implementing input validation on the data submitted can help prevent other types of attacks (e.g., injection attacks).
* **Regular Security Updates and Patching:**
    * Keep Cortex and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.
* **Security Testing:**
    * **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    * **Static and Dynamic Code Analysis:**  Use automated tools to identify potential security flaws in the codebase.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    * **Log Analysis:**  Monitor logs for suspicious activity, such as unauthenticated requests or attempts to access restricted resources.
    * **Alerting on Authentication Failures:**  Set up alerts for repeated authentication failures, which could indicate an attack in progress.
    * **Anomaly Detection:**  Implement anomaly detection systems to identify unusual data submission patterns.

**7. Detection and Monitoring:**

Detecting this type of attack can be challenging but is crucial. Key indicators to monitor include:

* **Logs:**  Examine Cortex component logs (especially Ingester and Distributor logs) for:
    * Requests without valid authentication headers.
    * Successful data submissions from unexpected sources or IPs.
    * High volumes of data being ingested from a single source.
* **Metrics:**  Monitor metrics related to data ingestion rates and sources. Sudden spikes in ingestion from unknown sources could be a sign of attack.
* **Alerts:**  Configure alerts for:
    * Authentication failures.
    * Unauthorized access attempts.
    * Anomalous data ingestion patterns.
* **Network Traffic Analysis:**  Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns of communication with Cortex components.

**Conclusion:**

The "Submit Data Without Proper Credentials" attack path, while potentially having a low-medium likelihood depending on configuration, carries a high impact. It underscores the critical importance of implementing and maintaining strong authentication and authorization mechanisms within a Cortex deployment. By understanding the potential vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of this attack and ensure the security and integrity of their monitoring and alerting infrastructure.
