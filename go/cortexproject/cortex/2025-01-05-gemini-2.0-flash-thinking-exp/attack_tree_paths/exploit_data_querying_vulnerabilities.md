        print("Cortex, being a horizontally scalable, multi-tenant time-series database, relies heavily on its query language (PromQL). Vulnerabilities in query processing can lead to significant security issues.")

        print("\n1. **PromQL Injection:**")
        print("   - **Description:** Similar to SQL injection, this occurs when user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or validated before being incorporated into PromQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious PromQL code.")
        print("   - **Exploitation:**")
        print("     - **Bypassing Tenant Isolation:** In a multi-tenant environment, an attacker could craft a query that bypasses tenant boundaries and accesses metrics belonging to other tenants. For example, manipulating labels or using functions in unexpected ways to circumvent tenant ID filtering.")
        print("     - **Data Exfiltration:** Injecting queries to extract specific metrics or time ranges that the attacker is not authorized to see.")
        print("     - **Information Disclosure:** Crafting queries that reveal internal system information or metadata.")
        print("   - **Example (Conceptual):** Imagine a query endpoint that takes a metric name as input. An attacker could input something like `up{tenant_id!="legitimate_tenant"}` to try and access the `up` metric for all tenants *except* the legitimate one.")

        print("\n2. **Authorization and Access Control Flaws:**")
        print("   - **Description:** Weak or improperly implemented authorization mechanisms can allow users to execute queries they shouldn't have permission for.")
        print("   - **Exploitation:**")
        print("     - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Bypass:** If RBAC is not correctly enforced, an attacker with lower privileges might be able to execute queries intended for higher-privileged users.")
        print("     - **Missing or Inconsistent Authorization Checks:** Certain query endpoints or functionalities might lack proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized access.")
        print("     - **Exploiting Default Permissions:** Overly permissive default configurations could grant unintended access to query functionalities.")

        print("\n3. **Logical Flaws in Query Processing:**")
        print("   - **Description:** Bugs or design flaws in the query engine's logic can be exploited to retrieve data in unintended ways.")
        print("   - **Exploitation:**")
        print("     - **Exploiting Edge Cases:** Crafting queries that trigger unexpected behavior in the query engine, leading to data leakage.")
        print("     - **Abuse of Aggregation Functions:** Manipulating aggregation functions to reveal aggregated data across tenants or in ways that expose individual data points indirectly.")
        print("     - **Time Range Manipulation:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how time ranges are handled to access data outside of the intended scope.")

        print("\n4. **Rate Limiting and Resource Exhaustion (Indirect Querying Vulnerability):**")
        print("   - **Description:** While not directly a data exposure vulnerability, abusing query functionalities to overwhelm the system can indirectly lead to information disclosure or availability issues.")
        print("   - **Exploitation:**")
        print("     - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Sending a large number of resource-intensive queries to overload the Cortex system, potentially impacting legitimate users' ability to access data.")
        print("     - **Timing Attacks:** Observing query response times to infer information about the presence or absence of specific data.")

        print("\n5. **Information Leakage through Error Messages:**")
        print("   - **Description:** Overly verbose or detailed error messages returned by the query engine can inadvertently reveal sensitive information about the data structure, internal workings, or even the presence of specific data points.")
        print("   - **Exploitation:** Carefully crafting queries to trigger specific error conditions and analyzing the error messages to gain insights.")

        print("\n## Impact of Successful Exploitation:")
        print("* **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Unauthorized access to time-series data, potentially including business metrics, infrastructure monitoring data, and potentially even personally identifiable information depending on the data being monitored.")
        print("* **Reputational Damage:** A data breach can severely damage the reputation of the organization using Cortex.")
        print("* **Compliance Violations:** Depending on the type of data exposed, this could lead to violations of regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS.")
        print("* **Financial Losses:** Data breaches can result in fines, legal costs, and loss of customer trust.")
        print("* **Competitive Disadvantage:** Exposure of sensitive business metrics could provide competitors with valuable insights.")

        print("\n## Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations:")
        print("* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided input used in PromQL queries. This is crucial to prevent PromQL injection attacks.")
        print("* **Parameterized Queries (where applicable):** While PromQL doesn't have direct parameterization like SQL, design query APIs to separate user-provided values from the core query structure.")
        print("* **Robust Authorization and Access Control:**")
        print("    - Implement and enforce granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure users only have access to the data they are authorized to view.")
        print("    - Regularly review and audit access control configurations.")
        print("    - Leverage Cortex's multi-tenancy features effectively to isolate data between tenants.")
        print("* **Secure Query Construction:** Train developers on secure query practices and emphasize the importance of avoiding dynamic query construction based on raw user input.")
        print("* **Rate Limiting and Resource Management:** Implement rate limiting on query endpoints to prevent abuse and resource exhaustion attacks.")
        print("* **Error Handling and Information Disclosure Prevention:** Ensure error messages are generic and do not reveal sensitive information about the data or system internals. Log detailed error information securely for debugging purposes.")
        print("* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments, including penetration testing specifically targeting query functionalities, to identify potential vulnerabilities.")
        print("* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities in the query processing logic.")
        print("* **Keep Cortex Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Cortex to the latest versions to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.")
        print("* **Security Awareness Training:** Educate developers and operations teams about the risks associated with querying vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.")

        print("\n## Detection and Monitoring Strategies:")
        print("* **Query Logging and Analysis:** Log all executed queries, including user information, timestamps, and query content. Analyze these logs for suspicious patterns, such as:")
        print("    - Queries accessing data outside of a user's normal scope.")
        print("    - Unusually complex or resource-intensive queries.")
        print("    - Queries containing potentially malicious keywords or syntax.")
        print("    - High volumes of queries from a single source.")
        print("* **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection systems to identify unusual query patterns that deviate from normal behavior.")
        print("* **Alerting:** Set up alerts for suspicious query activity to enable timely investigation and response.")
        print("* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate Cortex query logs with a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and correlation with other security events.")

        print("\n## Conclusion:")
        print(f"Exploiting data querying vulnerabilities in Cortex presents a {self.likelihood} likelihood of occurrence with a {self.impact} impact. The effort required is {self.effort}, and it typically requires an {self.skill_level} skill level to execute. Detecting these attacks can be {self.detection_difficulty}.
