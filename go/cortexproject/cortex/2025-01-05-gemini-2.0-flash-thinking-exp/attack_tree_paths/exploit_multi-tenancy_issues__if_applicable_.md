## Deep Analysis: Exploit Multi-Tenancy Issues (If Applicable) in Cortex

This analysis focuses on the "Exploit Multi-Tenancy Issues (If Applicable)" attack path within the context of a Cortex-based application. We will delve into the potential attack vectors, their implications, and mitigation strategies relevant to Cortex's architecture.

**Attack Tree Path:** Exploit Multi-Tenancy Issues (If Applicable)

* **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (depends on implementation)
* **Impact:** Medium-High
* **Effort:** Medium
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate-Advanced
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Difficult
* **Detailed Breakdown:** In multi-tenant environments, this path represents the risk of compromising the isolation between tenants.

**Deep Dive Analysis:**

This attack path targets a fundamental requirement of any multi-tenant system: the secure separation of data and resources between different tenants. If this isolation is compromised, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to another tenant's data, disrupt their services, or even escalate privileges within the system.

**Understanding the Context: Cortex and Multi-Tenancy**

Cortex is explicitly designed for multi-tenancy, allowing multiple independent users or organizations to share the same underlying infrastructure. This is achieved through the use of tenant IDs, typically passed in HTTP headers (`X-Scope-OrgID`). Cortex components rely on this identifier to segregate data and enforce access control.

**Potential Attack Scenarios:**

An attacker attempting to exploit multi-tenancy issues in Cortex might employ the following strategies:

1. **Tenant ID Manipulation/Spoofing:**
    * **Mechanism:**  The attacker attempts to guess or infer valid tenant IDs and inject them into requests. This could involve brute-forcing, exploiting information leaks, or leveraging vulnerabilities in upstream systems that handle tenant identification.
    * **Impact:**  If successful, the attacker could read, modify, or delete data belonging to other tenants. They might also be able to execute queries or rules within the context of another tenant.
    * **Cortex Specifics:**  Focuses on manipulating the `X-Scope-OrgID` header. Vulnerabilities in how Cortex components validate or sanitize this header could be exploited.
    * **Example:**  An attacker might try sending requests with different `X-Scope-OrgID` values to access metrics or alerts belonging to other tenants.

2. **Authorization Bypass/Flaws:**
    * **Mechanism:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in Cortex's authorization logic that incorrectly grants access to resources based on faulty tenant identification or permission checks. This could involve logical errors in the code or misconfigurations.
    * **Impact:**  Similar to tenant ID manipulation, this could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion across tenant boundaries.
    * **Cortex Specifics:**  Could involve issues in how Cortex components (Ingesters, Distributors, Queriers, Ruler, etc.) enforce access controls based on the tenant ID. Bugs in the authorization middleware or specific component logic are potential attack vectors.
    * **Example:**  A bug in the Ruler component might allow an attacker to create or modify alerting rules for other tenants, potentially causing confusion or even service disruption.

3. **Resource Exhaustion/Denial of Service (DoS) Across Tenants:**
    * **Mechanism:**  While not directly accessing another tenant's data, an attacker could consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, storage) within the shared Cortex infrastructure, impacting the performance and availability of other tenants.
    * **Impact:**  Can lead to degraded service or outages for other tenants, even without direct data compromise.
    * **Cortex Specifics:**  Could involve sending a large volume of metrics, creating excessively complex queries, or generating a high number of alerts, overwhelming shared resources.
    * **Example:**  An attacker could send a massive influx of metrics with their tenant ID, saturating the Ingesters and impacting the ability of other tenants to ingest data.

4. **Configuration Exploitation:**
    * **Mechanism:**  If an attacker gains access to the configuration of the Cortex deployment (e.g., through compromised credentials or vulnerabilities in configuration management tools), they might be able to modify settings that weaken tenant isolation.
    * **Impact:**  Could potentially disable tenant isolation mechanisms, grant broader access, or introduce vulnerabilities that facilitate cross-tenant attacks.
    * **Cortex Specifics:**  Focuses on manipulating configuration files or environment variables that control tenant isolation behavior within Cortex components.
    * **Example:**  An attacker might modify the configuration of the Querier to bypass tenant ID checks, allowing them to query data from all tenants.

5. **Code Vulnerabilities in Custom Extensions/Integrations:**
    * **Mechanism:**  If the application using Cortex has custom extensions or integrations that interact with Cortex data, vulnerabilities in this custom code could inadvertently expose data or functionality across tenants.
    * **Impact:**  Depends on the nature of the vulnerability, but could lead to data breaches or unauthorized actions.
    * **Cortex Specifics:**  Less about core Cortex vulnerabilities and more about how the application *uses* Cortex. Improper handling of tenant IDs or lack of sufficient authorization checks in custom code are key concerns.
    * **Example:**  A custom dashboard application might incorrectly display metrics from all tenants if it doesn't properly filter data based on the user's tenant ID.

**Likelihood, Impact, Effort, Skill Level, and Detection Difficulty Breakdown:**

* **Likelihood (Low-Medium):**  Depends heavily on the rigor of the application's and Cortex's configuration and security practices. Well-implemented multi-tenancy with robust authentication and authorization reduces the likelihood. Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities increase it.
* **Impact (Medium-High):**  The impact can range from unauthorized access to sensitive data (Medium) to complete service disruption for multiple tenants (High). Data breaches can have significant reputational and financial consequences.
* **Effort (Medium):**  Exploiting these issues often requires a good understanding of Cortex's architecture and the specific implementation details of the multi-tenant setup. Simple tenant ID guessing might be low effort, but exploiting more complex vulnerabilities requires more skill and effort.
* **Skill Level (Intermediate-Advanced):**  Requires a solid understanding of web security principles, authentication and authorization mechanisms, and the specifics of Cortex's multi-tenancy implementation. Exploiting subtle logical flaws or configuration weaknesses requires advanced skills.
* **Detection Difficulty (Medium-Difficult):**  Detecting these attacks can be challenging as they might blend in with legitimate traffic. Monitoring for unusual tenant ID usage patterns, authorization failures, and resource consumption anomalies is crucial.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risk of exploiting multi-tenancy issues, the development team should implement the following strategies:

* **Strong Tenant Identification and Enforcement:**
    * **Mandatory Tenant ID:** Ensure that all requests to Cortex components are properly tagged with a valid tenant ID.
    * **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize tenant IDs to prevent injection attacks.
    * **Secure Storage of Tenant IDs:** Protect tenant ID mappings and related sensitive information.

* **Robust Authorization Mechanisms:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to each tenant.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Review and test authorization rules and configurations.
    * **Centralized Authorization:** Implement a consistent authorization framework across all Cortex components.

* **Resource Quotas and Limits:**
    * **Tenant-Specific Resource Limits:** Implement resource quotas (CPU, memory, storage, query limits) per tenant to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
    * **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent excessive requests from a single tenant.

* **Secure Configuration Management:**
    * **Secure Storage of Configuration:** Protect configuration files and environment variables containing sensitive information.
    * **Access Control for Configuration:** Restrict access to configuration management tools and files.
    * **Configuration Auditing:** Track changes to the Cortex configuration.

* **Regular Security Testing and Code Reviews:**
    * **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing specifically targeting multi-tenancy isolation.
    * **Static and Dynamic Code Analysis:** Use tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
    * **Security-Focused Code Reviews:**  Pay close attention to code related to tenant identification, authorization, and data access.

* **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    * **Track Tenant ID Usage:** Monitor for unusual patterns in tenant ID usage, such as attempts to access resources with incorrect or invalid IDs.
    * **Monitor Authorization Failures:** Log and alert on repeated authorization failures.
    * **Monitor Resource Consumption:** Track resource usage per tenant and alert on anomalies.
    * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate Cortex logs with a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and analysis.
