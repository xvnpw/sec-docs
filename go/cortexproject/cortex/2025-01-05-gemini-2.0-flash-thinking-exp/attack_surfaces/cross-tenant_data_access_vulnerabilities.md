## Deep Analysis: Cross-Tenant Data Access Vulnerabilities in Cortex

This analysis delves into the "Cross-Tenant Data Access Vulnerabilities" attack surface within the context of the Cortex project. As a cybersecurity expert working with the development team, my goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of this risk, its implications, and actionable recommendations for mitigation.

**1. Deeper Dive into the Problem:**

The core value proposition of Cortex lies in its ability to provide a scalable, multi-tenant monitoring solution. This multi-tenancy is achieved by logically separating data and resources belonging to different users or organizations (tenants). The effectiveness of this separation is paramount for maintaining data privacy, security, and compliance.

Cross-tenant data access vulnerabilities represent a fundamental breach of this isolation. If successful, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive metrics, logs, or traces belonging to other tenants, potentially leading to severe consequences.

**Why is this a significant attack surface in Cortex?**

* **Complexity of Distributed Systems:** Cortex is a complex, distributed system with numerous interacting components (Ingester, Distributor, Querier, Store-Gateway, Compactor, Ruler, etc.). Each component handles tenant identification and authorization, increasing the potential for errors or inconsistencies in implementation.
* **Data Flow Complexity:** Data flows through multiple stages within Cortex, from ingestion to storage and querying. Tenant context needs to be consistently maintained and enforced at each stage.
* **Evolution and Feature Additions:** As Cortex evolves and new features are added, there's a risk of introducing regressions or overlooking potential isolation issues in new code paths.
* **Configuration Complexity:**  While not directly a vulnerability in the code, misconfigurations in tenant setup, authentication, or authorization can inadvertently weaken isolation.

**2. Breakdown of Vulnerable Components and Potential Weaknesses:**

Let's examine how different Cortex components might be susceptible to cross-tenant data access vulnerabilities:

* **Querier:** As highlighted in the example, the Querier is a prime target. Potential vulnerabilities include:
    * **Insufficient Tenant ID Validation:**  Failing to properly validate or sanitize tenant IDs provided in API requests, allowing manipulation.
    * **Incorrect Query Routing:**  Directing queries to the wrong set of data based on a faulty tenant ID.
    * **Caching Issues:**  Caching query results without proper tenant scoping, potentially serving data from one tenant to another.
    * **Authorization Bypass:**  Flaws in the authorization logic that incorrectly grants access to data belonging to other tenants.

* **Ingester:** Responsible for receiving and initially storing time-series data. Potential weaknesses:
    * **Tenant ID Spoofing:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the ingestion pipeline to submit data with a manipulated tenant ID.
    * **Data Tagging Errors:**  Incorrectly tagging ingested data with the wrong tenant ID, leading to misattribution.
    * **Race Conditions:**  Exploiting race conditions during data ingestion where tenant context is not handled atomically.

* **Distributor:** Responsible for routing incoming data to the appropriate Ingesters. Potential weaknesses:
    * **Incorrect Hashing/Routing Logic:**  Flaws in the distribution algorithm that could lead to data being sent to Ingesters responsible for a different tenant.
    * **Tenant ID Mismatches:**  Discrepancies between the tenant ID in the incoming data and the tenant context of the target Ingester.

* **Store-Gateway (and underlying storage):** Responsible for long-term storage and retrieval of metrics. Potential weaknesses:
    * **Insufficient Access Controls:**  Lack of granular access controls at the storage layer based on tenant ID.
    * **Data Segregation Issues:**  Failure to properly segregate data belonging to different tenants within the underlying storage system.
    * **Query Engine Vulnerabilities:**  Similar to the Querier, vulnerabilities in the Store-Gateway's query engine could lead to cross-tenant access.

* **Compactor:** Responsible for compacting and optimizing stored data. Potential weaknesses:
    * **Tenant Context Loss:**  Losing tenant context during the compaction process, potentially merging data from different tenants.
    * **Metadata Corruption:**  Corruption of metadata related to tenant identification during compaction.

* **Ruler:** Responsible for evaluating alerting and recording rules. Potential weaknesses:
    * **Incorrect Rule Scoping:**  Evaluating rules across tenant boundaries due to improper tenant ID handling.
    * **Cross-Tenant Alerting:**  Triggering alerts for one tenant based on data from another tenant.

**3. Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

Understanding how an attacker might exploit these vulnerabilities is crucial:

* **Malicious Insider:** An attacker with legitimate credentials for one tenant could exploit vulnerabilities to access data from other tenants.
* **Compromised Credentials:**  Stolen or phished credentials of a user belonging to one tenant could be used to access other tenants' data.
* **API Exploitation:**  Crafting malicious API requests with manipulated tenant IDs or exploiting flaws in API authentication/authorization mechanisms.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Compromised dependencies or third-party libraries within Cortex could introduce vulnerabilities affecting tenant isolation.
* **Misconfiguration Exploitation:**  Leveraging misconfigurations in tenant setup or access control policies to bypass isolation mechanisms.

**Example Scenario (Expanding on the provided one):**

Imagine a scenario where a user with Tenant A's API key crafts a malicious query to the Querier. Due to a bug in the Querier's tenant ID validation logic, they are able to inject Tenant B's ID into the query parameters without proper sanitization. The Querier, failing to recognize the discrepancy, executes the query against Tenant B's data and returns the results to the attacker, effectively breaching tenant isolation.

**4. Root Causes of Cross-Tenant Data Access Vulnerabilities:**

Identifying the underlying causes helps in preventing future occurrences:

* **Insufficient Input Validation and Sanitization:** Failing to properly validate and sanitize tenant IDs and other user-provided inputs.
* **Broken Authentication and Authorization:** Flaws in the mechanisms used to verify user identity and grant access to resources.
* **Insecure Direct Object References:** Exposing internal object identifiers (like tenant IDs) without proper authorization checks.
* **Missing or Inadequate Access Controls:** Lack of granular access controls at different layers of the system.
* **Security Misconfigurations:** Incorrectly configured tenant settings, authentication methods, or authorization policies.
* **Software Bugs and Logic Errors:**  Simple coding errors or logical flaws in the implementation of tenant isolation mechanisms.
* **Lack of Security Awareness and Training:** Developers not fully understanding the importance of tenant isolation and secure coding practices.
* **Insufficient Security Testing:**  Lack of thorough testing specifically targeting tenant isolation boundaries.

**5. Detailed Impact Assessment:**

The impact of successful cross-tenant data access can be severe:

* **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive metrics, logs, and traces belonging to other tenants, potentially including business-critical information, performance data, and security logs.
* **Violation of Data Privacy and Compliance:**  Breaching regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or SOC 2, leading to significant fines and legal repercussions.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of trust from users and customers, potentially leading to business loss and negative publicity.
* **Competitive Disadvantage:**  Exposing sensitive business metrics to competitors.
* **Service Disruption:**  In some cases, exploiting these vulnerabilities could lead to data corruption or denial-of-service for other tenants.
