        print("""
        While the vulnerability lies primarily within the storage backend configuration, Cortex's role is significant:

        * **Configuration Dependency:** Cortex's configuration files (YAML or command-line flags) define the connection parameters, credentials, and access methods for the storage backend. Errors or insecure practices in these configurations directly expose the storage.
        * **Permission Requirements:** Cortex requires specific permissions to interact with the storage backend (e.g., read, write, list objects/keys). Overly permissive roles or improperly scoped credentials grant attackers broader access than necessary.
        * **Data Handling:** Cortex handles sensitive metric data, which can contain valuable insights into application performance, infrastructure health, and even business metrics. Compromising the storage backend directly exposes this sensitive information.
        * **Operational Reliance:** Cortex's functionality is directly dependent on the availability and integrity of the data in the storage backend. An attack targeting the storage can disrupt Cortex's operations, leading to monitoring outages and potentially impacting dependent systems.
        * **Credential Management:** How Cortex manages and stores the credentials used to access the storage backend is crucial. Storing credentials insecurely within configuration files or failing to utilize secure secret management solutions increases the risk.

        print("""
        Beyond a publicly accessible S3 bucket, consider these more nuanced examples:

        * **Overly Permissive IAM Roles/Policies (AWS/GCP):**
            * A Cortex instance is granted an IAM role with `s3:*` permissions on an S3 bucket. An attacker compromising this instance could then perform any S3 action, including deleting data, modifying bucket policies, or accessing other sensitive buckets in the same account.
            * Similarly, in GCP, granting a Cortex service account the `roles/storage.admin` role on a GCS bucket provides excessive privileges.
        * **Misconfigured Cassandra Access Control:**
            * A Cassandra cluster used by Cortex lacks proper authentication or authorization. An attacker could connect directly to the database and read or modify metric data without needing to compromise the Cortex application itself.
            * Weak or default passwords for Cassandra users used by Cortex.
        * **Lack of Encryption at Rest:**
            * While data might be encrypted in transit (HTTPS), the storage backend itself lacks encryption at rest. An attacker gaining physical access to the storage media or exploiting vulnerabilities in the storage provider could access the raw, unencrypted metric data.
        * **Insufficiently Restrictive Network Access Control Lists (ACLs):**
            * The storage backend is accessible from a wider network range than necessary. An attacker on a compromised server within the same network (but not necessarily a Cortex instance) could potentially access the storage.
        * **Publicly Accessible Network File System (NFS/SMB):**
            * If Cortex is configured to use a network file system without proper authentication and authorization, the stored data becomes vulnerable to anyone with network access.
        * **Misconfigured Bucket Policies (S3/GCS):**
            * Allowing `Principal: "*"` with `s3:GetObject` on an S3 bucket containing Cortex data, even if the bucket isn't entirely public, can lead to data leaks if the bucket name is discovered.
        * **Failure to Implement Least Privilege:**
            * Granting Cortex write access to the entire storage backend when it only needs to write to specific prefixes or directories increases the potential impact of a compromised Cortex instance.

        print(f"**Impact (Expanded):**")
        print("""
        The impact of an insecure storage backend configuration extends beyond a simple data breach:

        * **Complete Data Breach:** Access to all historical metric data, potentially spanning years, providing a comprehensive view of the organization's operations, performance, and security posture.
        * **Data Manipulation/Corruption:** Attackers could modify or delete metric data, leading to inaccurate monitoring, flawed decision-making, and potential service disruptions. This could also be used to cover their tracks.
        * **Exposure of Sensitive Business Metrics:** Metrics often contain sensitive business information, such as sales figures, user activity, and financial data. This exposure can have significant competitive and financial repercussions.
        * **Compliance Violations:** Many regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) have strict requirements for data security and privacy. A breach due to insecure storage can lead to significant fines and legal consequences.
        * **Reputational Damage:** A publicized data breach can severely damage an organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
        * **Loss of Service Availability:** If the storage backend is compromised or data is corrupted, Cortex's ability to function correctly can be severely impacted, leading to monitoring outages and potentially affecting dependent systems.
        * **Lateral Movement Potential:** Compromised storage credentials used by Cortex could potentially be leveraged to access other resources within the cloud environment or on-premises infrastructure.
        * **Supply Chain Risks:** If Cortex is used in a managed service offering, a compromise of the storage backend could impact multiple customers.

        print("""
        * **Implement Strong Access Control Policies on the Storage Backend:**
            * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant Cortex only the necessary permissions to perform its functions. Avoid wildcard permissions (e.g., `s3:*`).
            * **Granular Permissions:** Utilize specific actions (e.g., `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`) and resource constraints (e.g., specific bucket prefixes or object names).
            * **IAM Roles (AWS/GCP):** Leverage IAM roles for Cortex instances or service accounts, avoiding the storage of long-term credentials within the application configuration.
            * **Bucket Policies (S3/GCS):** Implement restrictive bucket policies to control access to the storage. Regularly review and update these policies.
            * **Cassandra Authentication and Authorization:** Enable authentication and authorization in Cassandra. Create specific users for Cortex with the minimum required permissions on the relevant keyspaces and tables.
            * **Network Segmentation:** Restrict network access to the storage backend to only authorized networks and IP addresses. Utilize firewalls and security groups.
            * **Regularly Review Permissions:** Implement automated tools and processes to regularly audit the permissions granted to Cortex and ensure they remain appropriate.

        * **Enable Encryption at Rest for the Storage Backend:**
            * **Server-Side Encryption (SSE):** Utilize the encryption features provided by the storage backend (e.g., SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C for S3; Google-managed or customer-managed encryption keys for GCS; encryption at rest for Cassandra).
            * **Customer-Managed Keys (CMK):** Consider using CMKs for greater control over the encryption keys. Implement proper key management practices, including rotation and access control.
            * **Verify Encryption:** Regularly verify that encryption is enabled and configured correctly for all storage locations used by Cortex.

        * **Regularly Audit Storage Backend Configurations Used by Cortex:**
            * **Automated Configuration Checks:** Implement tools and scripts to automatically check storage backend configurations against security best practices.
            * **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Utilize IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) to define and manage storage backend configurations. This allows for version control, review, and automated deployment of secure configurations.
            * **Security Scanning Tools:** Integrate security scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential misconfigurations in storage backend deployments.
            * **Access Logging:** Enable and monitor access logs for the storage backend to detect unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activity.
            * **Regular Penetration Testing:** Include the storage backend in regular penetration testing exercises to identify potential vulnerabilities.
            * **Configuration Drift Detection:** Implement mechanisms to detect and alert on any unauthorized changes to storage backend configurations.
