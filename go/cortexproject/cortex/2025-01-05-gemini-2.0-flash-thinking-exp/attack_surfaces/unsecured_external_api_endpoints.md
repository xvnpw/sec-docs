## Deep Analysis: Unsecured External API Endpoints in Cortex

This analysis delves into the "Unsecured External API Endpoints" attack surface of applications utilizing Cortex, as highlighted in the provided description. We will explore the technical details, potential attack vectors, and provide actionable insights for the development team to strengthen their security posture.

**1. Deeper Dive into the Attack Surface:**

The core issue lies in the lack of robust authentication and authorization mechanisms on Cortex's external HTTP APIs. These APIs are designed to be the primary interface for interacting with Cortex, enabling actions like:

* **Writing Metrics:** Pushing time-series data into Cortex for storage and analysis. This is crucial for application monitoring and observability.
* **Querying Metrics:** Retrieving stored metric data for dashboards, alerting, and investigations.
* **Admin Operations (Potentially):** Depending on the configuration and Cortex version, administrative endpoints might exist for tasks like managing tenants, configuring limits, etc.

The absence of security controls on these endpoints transforms them into a highly vulnerable attack surface. Anyone with network access to the Cortex instance can potentially interact with these APIs without proving their identity or having the necessary permissions.

**Specifically, the lack of security can manifest in several ways:**

* **No Authentication Required:**  The API endpoints accept requests without requiring any form of credentials (e.g., API keys, tokens, usernames/passwords).
* **Weak or Default Credentials:** If authentication is present but uses easily guessable or default credentials, it offers minimal security.
* **Missing Authorization Checks:** Even if a user is authenticated, the system might not verify if they are authorized to perform the specific action they are attempting (e.g., writing metrics to a specific tenant, querying sensitive data).
* **Insecure Transport (Less likely in this context, but important):** While the description mentions HTTPS, misconfigurations or the absence of proper TLS/SSL setup could expose data in transit.

**2. Technical Breakdown and Attack Vectors:**

Let's examine the technical aspects and how attackers could exploit this vulnerability:

* **Direct API Calls:** Attackers can directly craft HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints. Tools like `curl`, `wget`, or custom scripts can be used to send arbitrary data or retrieve information.
* **Scripting and Automation:** Attackers can automate the injection of large volumes of malicious data or repeatedly query sensitive metrics.
* **Exploitation of Multi-Tenancy (if applicable):** Cortex supports multi-tenancy. Without proper authorization, an attacker could potentially inject data into or query data from tenants they shouldn't have access to.
* **Resource Exhaustion:**  Flooding the write API with excessive data can overwhelm Cortex, leading to performance degradation or denial of service for legitimate users.
* **Data Manipulation:** Injecting misleading or fabricated metrics can skew dashboards, trigger false alerts, and hinder accurate monitoring and decision-making.
* **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized access to query endpoints can expose sensitive performance metrics, business KPIs, or even security-related data.

**Example Scenario (Expanding on the provided example):**

Imagine a Cortex instance deployed without API key enforcement on the `/api/v1/push` endpoint (the standard Prometheus remote write endpoint). An attacker could:

1. **Identify the Cortex Instance:** Through port scanning or reconnaissance.
2. **Craft a Malicious Payload:**  Construct a Prometheus remote write request containing arbitrary metrics. This could include:
    ```
    POST /api/v1/push HTTP/1.1
    Content-Encoding: snappy
    Content-Type: application/x-protobuf

    <snappy-compressed protobuf data>
    ```
    The protobuf data would contain the malicious metric data, potentially with fabricated timestamps, metric names, and values.
3. **Send the Request:** Use `curl` or a similar tool to send the crafted request to the Cortex instance.

Because there's no authentication, Cortex would accept and store this data, potentially corrupting existing metrics or providing misleading information.

**3. Impact Analysis - Beyond the Initial Description:**

While the initial description highlights unauthorized data injection, corruption, and access, let's expand on the potential impact:

* **Compromised Observability:** Injected malicious data can render monitoring dashboards and alerting systems unreliable, masking real issues and delaying incident response.
* **Incorrect Business Decisions:** If business metrics are being injected or manipulated, it can lead to flawed analysis and poor decision-making.
* **Compliance Violations:** Accessing or modifying data without authorization can violate data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
* **Reputational Damage:** If an organization's monitoring data is compromised or manipulated, it can damage trust and reputation.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:** If an application using Cortex exposes these unsecured APIs, it could become a vector for attacks on downstream systems or customers relying on the monitoring data.
* **Lateral Movement:** In some scenarios, gaining access to the Cortex instance could provide insights into the infrastructure and potentially facilitate lateral movement to other systems.

**4. Detailed Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations for the Development Team:**

The provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point. Let's elaborate on them with practical recommendations for the development team:

* **Enforce Strong Authentication Mechanisms:**
    * **API Keys:** Implement API key generation and management. Require clients to include a valid API key in the request headers. Consider rotating API keys regularly.
    * **OAuth 2.0:** For more complex scenarios involving user authentication and authorization, integrate with an OAuth 2.0 provider. This allows for delegated authorization and fine-grained access control.
    * **Mutual TLS (mTLS):** For highly sensitive environments, consider mTLS, where both the client and server authenticate each other using certificates.
    * **Choose the Right Method:** Select the authentication method based on the specific use case and security requirements. API keys are simpler for machine-to-machine communication, while OAuth 2.0 is better suited for user-driven interactions.

* **Implement Granular Authorization Policies:**
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define roles with specific permissions (e.g., `metric_writer`, `metric_reader`, `admin`). Assign these roles to users or API keys.
    * **Tenant-Based Authorization:** If using Cortex's multi-tenancy features, ensure that users or API keys are restricted to accessing data within their assigned tenants.
    * **Action-Based Authorization:** Control who can perform specific actions on specific resources (e.g., allow a specific API key to write metrics with a certain prefix).
    * **Policy Enforcement:** Implement a mechanism within Cortex or an external authorization service to enforce these policies on incoming API requests.

* **Rate Limit API Requests:**
    * **Identify Critical Endpoints:** Focus rate limiting on endpoints prone to abuse, such as the write API.
    * **Set Appropriate Limits:** Determine reasonable limits based on expected traffic patterns. Avoid overly restrictive limits that could impact legitimate users.
    * **Implement Different Levels of Rate Limiting:** Consider global rate limits and per-client/API key rate limits.
    * **Use Tools and Libraries:** Leverage rate limiting features provided by API gateways, load balancers, or libraries within the application itself.

**Additional Critical Security Measures:**

* **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all data received through the API endpoints to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. This includes checking data types, formats, and ranges.
* **Secure Configuration:** Ensure Cortex is deployed with secure default configurations. Review and harden configuration settings related to authentication, authorization, and network access.
* **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Cortex instance within a secure network segment to limit the potential impact of a breach.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging of API requests, including authentication attempts, authorization decisions, and any errors. Monitor these logs for suspicious activity.
* **Security Awareness Training:** Educate developers and operations teams about the importance of API security and best practices.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Use IaC to manage the deployment and configuration of Cortex, ensuring consistent and secure configurations across environments.
* **Keep Cortex Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Cortex to the latest version to patch known security vulnerabilities.

**5. Developer Considerations:**

* **Security as a First-Class Citizen:** Integrate security considerations into the entire development lifecycle, from design to deployment.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to API clients.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines to prevent vulnerabilities like injection flaws.
* **Thorough Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and security testing for the API endpoints.
* **Documentation:** Clearly document the authentication and authorization requirements for all external API endpoints.

**Conclusion:**

The lack of proper authentication and authorization on Cortex's external API endpoints represents a significant security risk. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies and adopting a security-focused development approach, the development team can significantly reduce the attack surface and protect their applications and data. This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the risks and actionable steps to secure this critical component of their infrastructure. It's crucial to prioritize these security measures to maintain the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the monitoring data and the applications relying on it.
