# Attack Surface Analysis for cortexproject/cortex

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Missing Inter-Component Authentication](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_missing_inter-component_authentication.md)

**Description:** Lack of robust authentication mechanisms between different Cortex components (Ingesters, Distributors, Queriers, etc.).

**How Cortex Contributes:** Cortex's distributed architecture necessitates secure communication between its internal services. Weak authentication directly exposes this communication.

**Example:** An attacker on the internal network could impersonate an Ingester and send malicious data to a Distributor without proper authentication.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized data injection, potential service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for all inter-component communication.
*   Utilize secure authentication tokens or keys for internal service communication.
*   Regularly rotate authentication credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Tenant Data Access Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/cross-tenant_data_access_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Flaws in Cortex's tenant isolation mechanisms allowing one tenant to access or modify data belonging to another tenant.

**How Cortex Contributes:** Cortex's multi-tenancy feature relies on proper isolation. Vulnerabilities here are directly within Cortex's design and implementation.

**Example:** A bug in the Querier component could allow a user with Tenant A's credentials to query metrics belonging to Tenant B due to improper tenant ID handling.

**Impact:** Data breach, violation of data privacy, reputational damage.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Rigorous validation and sanitization of tenant IDs in all Cortex components.
*   Implement comprehensive authorization checks within Cortex at every stage of data access and modification.
*   Thoroughly test tenant isolation boundaries with security testing focused on Cortex.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured External API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_external_api_endpoints.md)

**Description:** Cortex exposes HTTP APIs for writing and querying metrics. Lack of proper authentication and authorization on these endpoints.

**How Cortex Contributes:** These APIs are the direct interface Cortex provides for external interaction.

**Example:** Missing API key requirements on the Cortex write endpoint allowing anyone to inject arbitrary metrics.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data injection (potentially malicious), data corruption, unauthorized access to sensitive metric data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) for all Cortex external API endpoints.
*   Implement granular authorization policies within Cortex to control who can perform specific actions (read, write, delete).
*   Rate limit API requests to prevent abuse targeting Cortex.

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Data in Transit](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_data_in_transit.md)

**Description:** Sensitive metric data transmitted between Cortex components or over external APIs without encryption.

**How Cortex Contributes:** Cortex is responsible for handling this data transmission.

**Example:** Metric data being sent from an application to the Cortex Distributor over an unencrypted HTTP connection.

**Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive operational information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce TLS encryption for all communication between Cortex components.
*   Enforce HTTPS for all Cortex external API endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage Backend Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_backend_configuration.md)

**Description:** Misconfigured or inadequately secured storage backends (e.g., S3, GCS, Cassandra) used by Cortex for storing metrics.

**How Cortex Contributes:** Cortex relies on this external storage; its configuration and the permissions Cortex uses are direct factors in the security.

**Example:** An S3 bucket used by Cortex for storing blocks is publicly accessible due to misconfiguration on the S3 side, but directly impacts the security of Cortex data.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to all historical metric data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong access control policies on the storage backend, ensuring Cortex only has the necessary permissions.
*   Enable encryption at rest for the storage backend.
*   Regularly audit storage backend configurations used by Cortex.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Cortex Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_cortex_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities present in the third-party libraries and components used by Cortex.

**How Cortex Contributes:** Cortex's codebase includes these dependencies, making it susceptible to their vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A known vulnerability in a Go library used by Cortex could be exploited to gain remote code execution on a Cortex component.

**Impact:** Range from denial of service to remote code execution and full system compromise of Cortex.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all Cortex dependencies.
*   Regularly scan Cortex dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools.
*   Promptly update Cortex dependencies to the latest secure versions.
