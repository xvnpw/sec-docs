## Deep Dive Analysis: Unauthorized Query Access in Cortex

This analysis provides a deeper understanding of the "Unauthorized Query Access" threat within the context of an application utilizing Cortex. We will explore the attack vectors, potential impacts in detail, and expand on mitigation strategies, offering actionable recommendations for the development team.

**Threat:** Unauthorized Query Access

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Cortex query endpoints (e.g., PromQL API) and retrieves sensitive time-series data. This could be achieved through compromised credentials, exploiting API vulnerabilities, or misconfigured access controls.

**Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive operational data, business metrics, or potentially user-related information if exposed through metrics.

**Affected Component:** Querier API (PromQL endpoints), Store Gateway API.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Analysis:**

This threat poses a significant risk due to the potential for exposure of highly valuable data managed by Cortex. Let's break down the attack vectors and impacts in more detail:

**Detailed Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Credentials:**
    *   **Weak Passwords:** Users or service accounts with easily guessable or default passwords.
    *   **Credential Stuffing/Spraying:** Attackers using lists of compromised credentials from other breaches to attempt login.
    *   **Phishing:** Tricking users into revealing their credentials.
    *   **Stolen API Keys/Tokens:**  If API keys or tokens are used for authentication, they could be stolen through various means (e.g., insecure storage, accidental exposure in code).
    *   **Compromised Infrastructure:** If the infrastructure hosting Cortex or related services is compromised, attackers might gain access to stored credentials.

*   **Exploiting API Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (PromQL Injection):** While less common, vulnerabilities in the PromQL parsing or execution engine could potentially allow attackers to inject malicious queries to extract more data than intended or even execute arbitrary code (though highly unlikely in most secure deployments).
    *   **Broken Authentication/Authorization:** Flaws in the authentication or authorization mechanisms allowing attackers to bypass security checks. This could include:
        *   **Missing Authentication:** Endpoints not requiring any authentication.
        *   **Bypassable Authentication:**  Weak or flawed authentication mechanisms.
        *   **Insecure Direct Object References:**  Attackers manipulating parameters to access data they shouldn't.
    *   **Excessive Data Exposure:** API endpoints returning more data than necessary, potentially revealing sensitive information even with legitimate access.
    *   **Lack of Resource & Rate Limiting:** Allowing attackers to make excessive requests to enumerate data or perform brute-force attacks.
    *   **Security Misconfiguration:** Incorrectly configured security settings, such as overly permissive CORS policies or exposed management interfaces.
    *   **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities:** Outdated versions of Cortex or its dependencies with known security flaws.

*   **Misconfigured Access Controls:**
    *   **Overly Permissive RBAC Rules:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies granting excessive permissions to users or service accounts.
    *   **Lack of Tenant Isolation:** In multi-tenant Cortex deployments, improper isolation could allow users from one tenant to access data from another.
    *   **Default Credentials:** Failure to change default credentials for administrative interfaces or internal components.
    *   **Network Segmentation Issues:** Lack of proper network segmentation allowing unauthorized access to Cortex instances.

**Detailed Impact Analysis:**

The impact of unauthorized query access can be severe and far-reaching:

*   **Disclosure of Sensitive Operational Data:**
    *   **Performance Metrics:** Revealing system bottlenecks, resource utilization, and capacity issues, potentially allowing competitors to gain insights into your infrastructure.
    *   **Error Rates and Logs:** Exposing system failures, vulnerabilities, and internal workings.
    *   **Deployment Details:**  Information about your deployment architecture, versions, and configurations.

*   **Disclosure of Business Metrics:**
    *   **Revenue and Sales Data:** Exposing financial performance, impacting investor confidence and providing insights to competitors.
    *   **User Activity and Engagement:** Revealing user behavior patterns, potentially including sensitive usage statistics.
    *   **Conversion Rates and Funnel Data:** Exposing marketing effectiveness and business strategies.

*   **Disclosure of Potentially User-Related Information:**
    *   **Accidental Exposure in Labels:** If labels contain personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive user data, unauthorized access could lead to privacy breaches.
    *   **Metrics Correlated with User Activity:** Even without direct PII, correlations between metrics and user actions could potentially deanonymize users.

*   **Competitive Disadvantage:**  Revealing strategic information about your business operations and performance to competitors.

*   **Reputational Damage:**  A data breach involving sensitive metrics can damage your organization's reputation and erode customer trust.

*   **Regulatory Fines and Penalties:**  If the exposed data includes PII, your organization may face significant fines under regulations like GDPR, CCPA, etc.

*   **Potential for Further Attacks:**  Information gained through unauthorized queries could be used to plan and execute more sophisticated attacks.

**Expanding on Mitigation Strategies with Actionable Recommendations:**

The provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point. Let's expand on them with more specific recommendations:

*   **Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization for Query APIs:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users accessing query endpoints.
    *   **Recommendation:** Utilize robust authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect (OIDC) for API access.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement API key rotation policies and secure storage mechanisms for API keys.
    *   **Recommendation:** Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service authentication.

*   **Enforce Granular Access Control Policies to Restrict Data Access Based on User Roles or Tenants:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with clearly defined roles and permissions based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Recommendation:** For multi-tenant deployments, ensure strong tenant isolation is enforced at the query layer, preventing cross-tenant data access. Leverage Cortex's built-in multi-tenancy features effectively.
    *   **Recommendation:** Regularly review and update access control policies to reflect changes in user roles and data sensitivity.
    *   **Recommendation:** Consider using attribute-based access control (ABAC) for more fine-grained control based on data attributes and user context.

*   **Use TLS (HTTPS) to Encrypt Communication with Query Endpoints:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Ensure TLS 1.2 or higher is enforced for all communication with query endpoints.
    *   **Recommendation:** Use valid and properly configured TLS certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
    *   **Recommendation:**  Enforce HTTPS strictly and disable HTTP access to query endpoints.

*   **Regularly Audit Access Logs for Suspicious Query Patterns:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive logging of all query requests, including timestamps, user identities, query content, and source IP addresses.
    *   **Recommendation:** Utilize security information and event management (SIEM) systems to analyze logs for suspicious patterns, such as:
        *   Unusual IP addresses or geographical locations.
        *   High volumes of requests from a single source.
        *   Queries for sensitive metric names.
        *   Queries outside of normal business hours.
        *   Failed authentication attempts.
    *   **Recommendation:** Set up alerts for suspicious activity to enable timely investigation and response.

*   **Consider Using a Dedicated Authentication and Authorization Service for Cortex:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Integrate Cortex with a centralized identity provider (IdP) like Keycloak, Auth0, or Azure Active Directory for managing user authentication and authorization.
    *   **Recommendation:** This can simplify user management, enforce consistent security policies, and provide a single point of control for access management.

**Additional Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict input validation on all query parameters to prevent potential injection attacks.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on query endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks and resource exhaustion.
*   **Security Headers:** Configure appropriate security headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security) to protect against common web attacks.
*   **Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in Cortex and its deployment.
*   **Data Masking and Redaction:** If possible, mask or redact sensitive information in metrics before they are stored or queried.
*   **Implement an Incident Response Plan:**  Develop and regularly test an incident response plan to effectively handle security breaches, including unauthorized query access.
*   **Secure Configuration Management:** Implement a process for securely managing Cortex configurations and ensure default settings are reviewed and hardened.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate Cortex instances within secure network segments with appropriate firewall rules.
*   **Supply Chain Security:** Be mindful of the security of third-party libraries and dependencies used by Cortex.

**Cortex Specific Considerations:**

*   **Review Cortex Configuration:** Carefully review the Cortex configuration, especially settings related to authentication, authorization, and multi-tenancy.
*   **Secure Label Management:**  Educate developers and operators on the importance of avoiding storing sensitive information in metric labels.
*   **Monitor Cortex Components:** Monitor the health and security of all Cortex components, including the Querier, Store Gateway, and distributors.
