## Deep Analysis: Tenant Data Leakage in Multi-Tenant Cortex Environment

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Tenant Data Leakage in Multi-Tenant Environment" threat within a Cortex deployment, specifically focusing on the components mentioned: Distributor, Querier, and Store Gateway. It aims to provide the development team with a comprehensive understanding of the threat, its potential attack vectors, and detailed mitigation strategies.

**Understanding the Threat Landscape:**

Cortex's multi-tenancy is a core feature, allowing multiple independent users or organizations ("tenants") to share the same infrastructure while keeping their data isolated. This isolation relies on proper configuration and robust security mechanisms within each component. Tenant data leakage fundamentally breaks this isolation, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Deep Dive into Affected Components and Potential Vulnerabilities:**

Let's examine how vulnerabilities in each affected component could lead to tenant data leakage:

**1. Distributor:**

* **Role:** The Distributor is the entry point for incoming time-series data. It authenticates and authorizes requests, determines the tenant ID, and fans out the data to ingesters.
* **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Authentication/Authorization Bypass:**
        * **Missing or Weak Authentication:** If the Distributor doesn't properly authenticate incoming requests or relies on easily guessable credentials, an attacker could impersonate a legitimate tenant.
        * **Tenant ID Spoofing:** If the Distributor doesn't rigorously validate the tenant ID provided in the request headers or other metadata, an attacker could potentially inject a different tenant ID, allowing them to write data under another tenant's namespace.
        * **Inconsistent Tenant ID Handling:** Discrepancies in how tenant IDs are extracted and validated across different parts of the Distributor's code could lead to bypasses.
    * **Logic Errors in Tenant ID Propagation:**
        * **Incorrect Header/Metadata Handling:** If the Distributor incorrectly parses or propagates the tenant ID to downstream components (Ingesters), data might be inadvertently associated with the wrong tenant.
        * **Race Conditions:** In concurrent scenarios, a race condition could lead to incorrect tenant ID assignment during data ingestion.
    * **Misconfiguration:**
        * **Permissive Network Policies:**  Allowing direct access to the Distributor from untrusted networks could expose it to malicious actors.
        * **Default Credentials:** Using default credentials for internal communication could be exploited.

**2. Querier:**

* **Role:** The Querier receives PromQL queries, determines the relevant data sources (Ingesters or Store Gateway), and merges the results. Crucially, it must filter data based on the querying tenant's ID.
* **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Insufficient Tenant ID Filtering:**
        * **Missing or Incomplete Filtering Logic:** If the Querier fails to properly filter data based on the querying tenant's ID before merging results from different sources, it could return data belonging to other tenants.
        * **Bypassable Filtering Mechanisms:**  Vulnerabilities in the filtering implementation could allow attackers to craft queries that circumvent the intended tenant boundaries. This could involve manipulating query parameters or exploiting logical flaws in the filtering logic.
        * **Incorrect Tenant ID Propagation from Authentication:** If the Querier doesn't reliably receive the correct tenant ID from the authentication mechanism, it cannot perform accurate filtering.
    * **Query Injection Vulnerabilities:**
        * **PromQL Injection:** While less likely due to the nature of PromQL, vulnerabilities in how the Querier parses and executes queries could potentially be exploited to access data outside the intended tenant scope.
    * **Caching Issues:**
        * **Shared Cache Misconfiguration:** If caching mechanisms are not properly scoped to tenants, cached data from one tenant could be served to another.
    * **Misconfiguration:**
        * **Permissive Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  Loosely configured ACLs on the Querier could allow unauthorized tenants to send queries.

**3. Store Gateway:**

* **Role:** The Store Gateway acts as an interface to the long-term storage (e.g., object storage like S3 or GCS). It retrieves data blocks based on tenant ID and time range.
* **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Insufficient Tenant ID Validation During Data Retrieval:**
        * **Missing or Weak Tenant ID Checks:** If the Store Gateway doesn't rigorously validate the tenant ID when retrieving data blocks from storage, it could potentially fetch and serve data belonging to other tenants.
        * **Reliance on Untrusted Metadata:**  If the Store Gateway relies on potentially manipulable metadata to determine tenant ownership of data blocks, an attacker could exploit this to gain access to other tenants' data.
    * **Access Control Issues at the Storage Layer:**
        * **Misconfigured Storage Permissions:** If the underlying storage (S3, GCS, etc.) has overly permissive permissions, allowing access to data buckets without proper tenant-level authorization, the Store Gateway's efforts to enforce isolation can be undermined.
        * **Lack of Tenant-Specific Storage Buckets/Prefixes:**  Not using separate buckets or prefixes for each tenant significantly increases the risk of accidental or malicious cross-tenant data access.
    * **Misconfiguration:**
        * **Incorrect IAM Roles/Permissions:**  Improperly configured IAM roles for the Store Gateway could grant it excessive permissions to access data across tenants.

**Detailed Attack Vectors:**

Building upon the potential vulnerabilities, here are some specific attack scenarios:

* **Tenant ID Manipulation in API Requests:** An attacker could intercept API requests to the Distributor or Querier and modify the tenant ID header or parameter to access data belonging to a different tenant.
* **Exploiting Authentication Weaknesses:**  If authentication is weak or predictable, an attacker could gain valid credentials for one tenant and then attempt to access data for other tenants by manipulating subsequent requests.
* **Crafted PromQL Queries:** An attacker could craft a PromQL query that exploits vulnerabilities in the Querier's filtering logic to bypass tenant boundaries and retrieve data from other tenants. This might involve using specific functions, aggregations, or selectors in unexpected ways.
* **Exploiting Misconfigurations in Storage Access:** An attacker could leverage misconfigured storage permissions to directly access data buckets belonging to other tenants, bypassing Cortex's intended access control mechanisms.
* **Internal Service Account Compromise:** If an internal service account used by one of the Cortex components is compromised, the attacker could potentially use it to access data across tenants if the account has overly broad permissions.
* **Side-Channel Attacks:** While less likely, vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure or operating system could potentially be exploited to leak data between tenants.

**Detailed Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations for the Development Team:**

The provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point, but let's expand on them with specific recommendations for the development team:

* **Thoroughly Test and Validate Tenant Isolation Mechanisms:**
    * **Dedicated Security Testing:** Implement rigorous security testing, including penetration testing, specifically focused on validating tenant isolation.
    * **Integration Tests for Tenant Boundaries:** Develop comprehensive integration tests that simulate cross-tenant access attempts and verify that isolation is maintained.
    * **Property-Based Testing:** Utilize property-based testing frameworks to automatically generate a wide range of inputs and scenarios to uncover edge cases and potential vulnerabilities in tenant isolation logic.
    * **Code Reviews Focused on Tenant Handling:** Conduct thorough code reviews specifically focusing on the logic responsible for handling tenant IDs, authentication, and authorization across all affected components.

* **Implement Strict Access Control Policies Based on Tenant IDs:**
    * **Enforce Tenant ID Validation at Every Layer:** Ensure that tenant IDs are validated at every stage of the request lifecycle, from the Distributor's initial ingestion to the Store Gateway's data retrieval.
    * **Utilize Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Implement robust access control mechanisms that explicitly define permissions based on tenant IDs and user roles.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to each component and service account, minimizing the potential impact of a compromise.
    * **Secure API Design:** Design APIs with clear tenant scoping in mind, ensuring that all requests are explicitly associated with a tenant.

* **Regularly Audit Tenant Configurations and Access Patterns:**
    * **Implement Comprehensive Logging:** Log all relevant events, including authentication attempts, data access requests, and configuration changes, with clear tenant ID association.
    * **Automated Audit Tools:** Utilize automated tools to regularly audit tenant configurations, access control policies, and storage permissions for any deviations from security best practices.
    * **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection systems to identify unusual access patterns that might indicate a potential data leakage attempt.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits by internal or external experts to assess the effectiveness of tenant isolation mechanisms.

* **Ensure Proper Resource Isolation Between Tenants:**
    * **Logical Isolation:** Utilize namespaces or prefixes within storage systems to logically separate tenant data.
    * **Physical Isolation (Where Applicable):** Consider physical isolation for highly sensitive tenants, deploying them on separate infrastructure.
    * **Resource Quotas and Limits:** Implement resource quotas and limits per tenant to prevent resource exhaustion and potential side-channel attacks.
    * **Secure Defaults:** Ensure that all configuration options related to tenant isolation have secure default values.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* **Secure Development Practices:** Adhere to secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection flaws.
* **Dependency Management:** Regularly audit and update dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities.
* **Security Awareness Training:** Educate developers and operations teams about the importance of tenant isolation and potential attack vectors.
