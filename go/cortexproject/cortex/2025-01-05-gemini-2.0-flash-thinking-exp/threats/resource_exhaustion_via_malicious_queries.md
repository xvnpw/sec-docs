## Deep Dive Analysis: Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Queries in Cortex

This analysis provides a comprehensive breakdown of the "Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Queries" threat targeting our Cortex-based application. We will delve into the technical details, potential attack vectors, impact, and a more granular look at mitigation strategies.

**1. Threat Breakdown:**

* **Core Vulnerability:** The inherent nature of PromQL allows for complex queries that can consume significant computational resources. Without proper safeguards, malicious actors can exploit this to overwhelm the system.
* **Attacker Goal:**  The primary goal is to disrupt the service by making it unavailable or significantly impacting its performance. This can stem from various motivations, including:
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Rendering the application unusable for legitimate users.
    * **Resource Squatting:** Consuming resources to hinder the performance of other applications or services sharing the infrastructure.
    * **Cover for Other Attacks:**  Distracting security teams while other malicious activities are underway.
    * **Financial Gain (Indirect):**  Impacting a business that relies on the application's data and availability.
* **Exploitable Features of PromQL:** Attackers can leverage specific PromQL features to amplify resource consumption:
    * **High Cardinality Data:** Queries targeting metrics with a large number of unique label combinations can lead to massive data processing.
    * **Aggregations over Large Datasets:** Aggregating data across long time ranges or numerous series can be computationally expensive.
    * **Cartesian Products:** Joins or operations that result in a large number of combinations (e.g., using `on` without proper filtering).
    * **Regular Expressions:** Complex regular expressions in label matching can be CPU-intensive.
    * **Subqueries and Nested Queries:**  Deeply nested queries can significantly increase processing overhead.
    * **Functions with High Computational Cost:** Certain functions, especially those involving string manipulation or complex calculations, can be abused.

**2. Technical Analysis of Affected Components:**

* **Querier:**
    * **Role:** The Querier is responsible for receiving PromQL queries, fetching data from the Store Gateway, and performing the necessary computations to return results.
    * **Vulnerability:**  Malicious queries directly target the Querier's CPU and memory. Processing complex queries requires significant computational power and memory allocation. If overwhelmed, the Querier will become slow or unresponsive, impacting all users.
    * **Specific Resource Consumption:**
        * **CPU:**  Processing complex calculations, filtering large datasets, and executing PromQL functions.
        * **Memory:** Storing intermediate results, holding large datasets during aggregation, and managing query execution context.
        * **Network I/O:** While less direct, excessive query load can also strain network resources between the Querier and Store Gateway.
* **Store Gateway:**
    * **Role:** The Store Gateway acts as an intermediary between the Querier and the long-term storage (e.g., object storage like S3 or GCS). It retrieves chunks of metric data based on the Querier's requests.
    * **Vulnerability:** While not directly executing the queries, the Store Gateway can be overwhelmed by a large volume of requests for data from the Querier, especially if these requests target large time ranges or numerous series.
    * **Specific Resource Consumption:**
        * **CPU:**  Processing data retrieval requests and potentially performing some filtering or aggregation before sending data to the Querier.
        * **Memory:** Caching data chunks to improve performance, but excessive requests can lead to cache thrashing or OOM errors.
        * **I/O:**  Reading data from the underlying storage backend. Malicious queries can force the Store Gateway to perform a large number of I/O operations, leading to disk contention and slow response times.

**3. Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

* **Unauthenticated Access:** If the query endpoints are not properly secured, anyone can send malicious queries.
* **Compromised User Credentials:** An attacker with legitimate user credentials could still send resource-intensive queries.
* **Internal Malicious Actor:**  A disgruntled or compromised internal user could intentionally disrupt the service.
* **Exploiting Application Vulnerabilities:** Vulnerabilities in the application using Cortex data could be exploited to inject malicious queries.
* **Automated Attacks:** Attackers can use scripts or bots to send a high volume of malicious queries simultaneously.

**Example Malicious Queries:**

* **High Cardinality:** `count by (user_id) (http_requests_total)` - If `user_id` has a very large number of unique values.
* **Aggregation over Large Dataset:** `avg_over_time(cpu_usage[1y])` - Calculating the average CPU usage over a year for all time series.
* **Cartesian Product:** `http_requests_total * errors_total` -  Without proper filtering, this can generate a massive number of combinations.
* **Complex Regular Expression:** `http_requests_total{path=~".*very_long_and_complex_regex.*"}`
* **Nested Query:** `sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (job) / ignoring(instance) group_left sum(rate(errors_total[5m])) by (job)` -  Can become expensive with large datasets.

**4. Impact Analysis (Detailed):**

* **Service Unavailability:**  Overloaded Queriers and Store Gateways can become unresponsive, leading to complete service outages. This directly impacts users and any dependent applications.
* **Slow Query Response Times:** Even if the service doesn't completely fail, response times can become unacceptably slow, frustrating users and impacting the usability of dashboards and alerts.
* **Impact on Dependent Applications:** Applications relying on Cortex data for monitoring, alerting, or other purposes will experience failures or inaccurate data. This can have cascading effects on other systems and business processes.
* **Increased Infrastructure Costs:**  Dealing with resource exhaustion might necessitate scaling up infrastructure, leading to increased operational expenses.
* **Delayed or Missed Alerts:** If the monitoring system itself is affected, critical alerts might be delayed or missed, potentially leading to more severe incidents.
* **Reputational Damage:** Service outages and performance issues can damage the reputation of the application and the organization.
* **Security Operations Overhead:** Investigating and mitigating resource exhaustion attacks consumes valuable time and resources for security and operations teams.

**5. Detailed Mitigation Strategies (Enhanced):**
