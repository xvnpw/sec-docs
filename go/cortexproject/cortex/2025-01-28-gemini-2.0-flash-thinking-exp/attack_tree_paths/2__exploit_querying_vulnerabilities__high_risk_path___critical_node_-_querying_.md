### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Query-Based Denial of Service

This section provides a detailed analysis of the "Query-Based Denial of Service" attack path, breaking down each sub-vector and exploring its technical details, vulnerabilities, exploitation, detection, mitigation, and impact.

#### 4.1. 2.2. Query-Based Denial of Service [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Description:** This attack vector focuses on leveraging the query processing capabilities of Cortex Queriers to cause a Denial of Service. By crafting or sending specific types of queries, an attacker aims to exhaust the resources of the Queriers, making them unavailable for legitimate users or significantly degrading their performance.

**Mechanism:** The core mechanism involves exploiting the resource consumption associated with query execution in Cortex Queriers. PromQL, while powerful, allows for complex queries that can be computationally expensive, require significant memory, or generate high I/O load. An attacker can exploit this by:

* **Crafting complex PromQL queries:**  Utilizing PromQL features to create queries that are inherently resource-intensive due to their complexity (e.g., nested aggregations, large time ranges, high cardinality series).
* **Sending a high volume of queries:**  Flooding the Queriers with a large number of even moderately complex queries in a short period, overwhelming their processing capacity.

**Vulnerability:** The underlying vulnerability lies in the potential for uncontrolled resource consumption during query processing. While Cortex likely has resource limits and query optimizations, these might be insufficient to prevent all forms of Query-Based DoS attacks, especially when attackers are sophisticated in crafting their queries or generating high query volumes.  Specifically, vulnerabilities could stem from:

* **Inefficient PromQL query execution:** Certain PromQL operations might be less optimized than others, leading to disproportionate resource consumption for specific query patterns.
* **Lack of granular resource control per query:**  If resource limits are applied globally or at a high level, it might be difficult to effectively isolate and mitigate the impact of individual resource-intensive queries.
* **Insufficient query validation and sanitization:**  While PromQL has syntax rules, it might not have robust mechanisms to prevent queries that are syntactically valid but semantically malicious in terms of resource consumption.

**Impact:** A successful Query-Based DoS attack can have significant impacts:

* **Querier Overload:**  CPU, memory, and I/O resources of Queriers become saturated, leading to performance degradation.
* **Slow Queries and Query Timeouts:** Legitimate user queries become slow to execute or time out completely, disrupting monitoring and alerting capabilities.
* **System Instability:** In extreme cases, Querier overload can lead to instability, crashes, and potentially cascading failures within the Cortex cluster.
* **Service Outage:**  If Queriers become completely unresponsive, the entire monitoring service can become unavailable, impacting critical observability functions.

#### 4.2. 2.2.1. Resource Intensive Queries [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Description:** This sub-vector focuses specifically on attacks that utilize resource-intensive queries to overwhelm Queriers. It differentiates between attacks that use a single, highly complex query and those that send a high volume of moderately complex queries.

**Mechanism:** The mechanism remains the same as the broader "Query-Based DoS" vector, but this sub-vector emphasizes the *type* of queries used â€“ those that are inherently resource-intensive.

**Vulnerability:** The vulnerabilities are also similar to the broader vector, but here, the focus is on the system's ability to handle and mitigate resource-intensive queries, regardless of whether they are sent individually or in bulk.

**Impact:** The impact is also consistent with the broader vector, leading to Querier overload, slow queries, timeouts, instability, and potential service outage.

##### 4.2.1.1. 2.2.1.1. Craft complex PromQL queries that consume excessive CPU, memory, or I/O on Queriers [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Description:** This is a highly targeted attack where the attacker crafts a single, meticulously designed PromQL query that is specifically engineered to consume excessive resources on the Querier when executed.

**Technical Details:**

* **PromQL Complexity:** Attackers can leverage advanced PromQL features to create complex queries. Examples include:
    * **Nested Aggregations:** Queries with multiple levels of aggregation (e.g., `sum(rate(metric[5m])) by (label)` aggregated again).
    * **Large Time Ranges:** Queries spanning very long time ranges, forcing the Querier to process vast amounts of data.
    * **High Cardinality Series:** Queries that operate on metrics with extremely high cardinality labels, leading to large intermediate datasets and processing overhead.
    * **Cartesian Products:**  Joins or operations that implicitly or explicitly create Cartesian products of large datasets, resulting in exponential resource consumption.
    * **Functions with High Computational Cost:**  Using PromQL functions that are computationally expensive, especially when applied to large datasets (e.g., `quantile_over_time` with high precision, complex regular expressions in `label_replace`).
    * **Subqueries:**  Using subqueries that themselves are resource-intensive, compounding the overall query cost.

* **Example PromQL Query (Illustrative - may not be directly exploitable without context):**

```promql
sum(
  count_over_time(
    {__name__=~".*"} [1h]
  ) by (__name__, instance, job)
) by (__name__)
```

This example, while simplified, demonstrates the concept of using `count_over_time` over a large time range and all metrics (`{__name__=~".*"}`) and then aggregating by multiple labels. In a real-world scenario, a more sophisticated query would be crafted to maximize resource consumption based on the specific characteristics of the target Cortex deployment.

**Vulnerability:**

* **Lack of Query Complexity Limits:**  Cortex might not have sufficient limits on the complexity of PromQL queries that can be executed. This could include limits on the number of aggregations, subqueries, time range size, or cardinality of series processed.
* **Inefficient Execution of Complex PromQL Features:**  Certain complex PromQL features might be implemented in a way that is not optimally efficient, leading to excessive resource consumption for specific query patterns.
* **Insufficient Query Analysis and Cost Estimation:**  The Querier might lack robust mechanisms to analyze incoming queries and accurately estimate their resource cost *before* execution. This makes it difficult to proactively reject or throttle resource-intensive queries.

**Exploitation Steps:**

1. **Reconnaissance:** The attacker might perform reconnaissance to understand the metrics being collected, their cardinality, and the typical query patterns used in the target Cortex deployment.
2. **Query Crafting:** Based on reconnaissance, the attacker crafts a complex PromQL query designed to maximize resource consumption on the Querier. This might involve experimenting with different PromQL features and query structures.
3. **Query Submission:** The attacker submits the crafted query to the Cortex Querier, either directly (if they have authorized access) or indirectly (e.g., through a compromised application that uses the Cortex API).
4. **Resource Exhaustion:** The Querier attempts to execute the complex query, leading to excessive CPU, memory, and/or I/O consumption.
5. **Denial of Service:**  The Querier becomes overloaded and unresponsive, causing a Denial of Service for legitimate users.

**Detection:**

* **Query Analysis:** Implement query analysis mechanisms to identify potentially complex or resource-intensive queries *before* execution. This could involve:
    * **Parsing and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Analysis:** Analyzing the structure of the PromQL query to identify complex operations and features.
    * **Query Cost Estimation:** Developing a model to estimate the resource cost of a query based on its complexity, time range, and potential data volume.
* **Resource Monitoring:**  Monitor resource utilization metrics of Queriers (CPU, memory, I/O) in real-time. Spikes in resource consumption coinciding with specific queries can indicate a potential DoS attack.
* **Query Performance Monitoring:** Track query execution times.  Significant increases in query latency can be a sign of overload or malicious queries.
* **Anomaly Detection:**  Establish baseline query patterns and resource utilization. Detect anomalies that deviate significantly from the baseline, potentially indicating malicious activity.
* **Logging and Auditing:** Log all queries executed by Queriers, including the query text, execution time, and resource consumption. This audit trail can be used for post-incident analysis and identifying malicious queries.

**Mitigation/Prevention:**

* **Query Complexity Limits:** Implement configurable limits on query complexity. This could include limits on:
    * **Number of aggregations/subqueries.**
    * **Maximum time range.**
    * **Cardinality of series processed.**
    * **Computational cost of specific PromQL functions.**
* **Query Cost Estimation and Throttling:** Develop a more sophisticated query cost estimation mechanism. Implement query throttling or rejection based on estimated cost. Queries exceeding predefined cost thresholds could be:
    * **Rejected outright.**
    * **Queued with lower priority.**
    * **Limited in resource allocation.**
* **Query Optimization:** Continuously optimize the query execution engine in Cortex Queriers to improve the performance of complex PromQL queries and reduce resource consumption.
* **Resource Limits and Isolation:**  Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, I/O) for Querier processes at the operating system level (e.g., using cgroups, namespaces). Consider resource isolation techniques to prevent resource contention between queries.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on query submission to prevent attackers from overwhelming Queriers with a flood of complex queries.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Ensure strong authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place to control access to the Cortex query API. Limit query access to only authorized users and applications.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While PromQL is a structured language, ensure proper input validation and sanitization to prevent any potential injection vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically focused on Query-Based DoS vulnerabilities to identify and address weaknesses proactively.

**Impact Assessment:**

* **High Impact:** Successful exploitation of this sub-vector can lead to a significant Denial of Service, impacting monitoring and alerting capabilities, potentially leading to delayed incident response and service disruptions.
* **Critical Risk:** Due to the potential for severe impact and the relative ease of crafting complex PromQL queries, this sub-vector is considered a high-risk path.

##### 4.2.1.2. 2.2.1.2. Send a high volume of legitimate but resource-intensive queries to overwhelm Queriers [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Description:** This attack vector focuses on overwhelming Queriers by sending a large volume of *legitimate* but still resource-intensive queries in rapid succession.  The queries themselves might not be individually as complex as in the previous sub-vector, but the sheer volume of requests saturates the Querier's processing capacity.

**Technical Details:**

* **Query Volume:** The key factor here is the *number* of queries sent within a short timeframe. Even moderately complex queries, when executed concurrently in large numbers, can exhaust Querier resources.
* **Query Concurrency:** Attackers can leverage concurrency to amplify the impact. By sending multiple queries in parallel, they can quickly overwhelm the Querier's ability to process requests.
* **Legitimate Queries:**  The queries used in this attack can be syntactically valid and even represent legitimate monitoring use cases (e.g., dashboards refreshing frequently, automated alerting systems). This makes detection and mitigation more challenging as simply blocking "complex" queries is not sufficient.

* **Example Scenario:** An attacker might simulate a large number of users simultaneously refreshing dashboards that contain moderately complex PromQL queries. Or, they might trigger a large number of alerts that each execute a resource-intensive query to evaluate alert conditions.

**Vulnerability:**

* **Insufficient Rate Limiting:**  Cortex might lack effective rate limiting mechanisms to control the number of queries processed per unit of time, especially at a granular level (e.g., per user, per application, per query type).
* **Limited Concurrency Control:**  The Querier might not have robust concurrency control mechanisms to manage a large number of concurrent queries efficiently.
* **Lack of Prioritization:**  All queries might be treated with equal priority, allowing a flood of resource-intensive queries to starve legitimate, time-sensitive queries (e.g., alert evaluation queries).

**Exploitation Steps:**

1. **Access Acquisition:** The attacker might gain access to the Cortex query API, either through compromised credentials or by exploiting vulnerabilities in applications that interact with Cortex.
2. **Query Generation/Replication:** The attacker identifies or generates a set of moderately resource-intensive PromQL queries. These could be queries observed in legitimate dashboards or alerts, or queries crafted to be just complex enough to consume significant resources without being flagged as overtly malicious.
3. **Flood Attack:** The attacker sends a high volume of these queries to the Cortex Querier in rapid succession, potentially using automated tools to increase the query rate and concurrency.
4. **Resource Saturation:** The Querier becomes overwhelmed by the high query volume, leading to resource saturation (CPU, memory, I/O).
5. **Denial of Service:**  The Querier becomes slow or unresponsive, causing a Denial of Service for legitimate users.

**Detection:**

* **Query Rate Monitoring:** Monitor the query rate to Queriers.  Sudden spikes in query volume, especially from specific sources or for specific query patterns, can indicate a flood attack.
* **Concurrency Monitoring:** Track the number of concurrent queries being processed by Queriers.  High concurrency levels can be a sign of an attack.
* **Source IP/User Analysis:** Analyze query sources (IP addresses, user identities if available).  A large number of queries originating from a single or small set of sources might be suspicious.
* **Query Pattern Analysis:**  Analyze the types of queries being sent.  A sudden increase in the volume of moderately complex queries, even if individually legitimate, can be indicative of a flood attack.
* **Resource Monitoring (as in 2.2.1.1):** Monitor Querier resource utilization.  High resource consumption coinciding with a high query rate is a strong indicator of a DoS attack.

**Mitigation/Prevention:**

* **Rate Limiting (Granular):** Implement granular rate limiting mechanisms to control query rates based on:
    * **Source IP address.**
    * **User identity (if authenticated).**
    * **Application/Client ID.**
    * **Query type or complexity (to some extent).**
* **Concurrency Limits:**  Implement limits on the maximum number of concurrent queries that a Querier can process.
* **Query Prioritization:** Implement query prioritization to ensure that critical queries (e.g., alert evaluation queries) are processed with higher priority than less critical queries (e.g., dashboard refreshes).
* **Queue Management:** Implement query queuing mechanisms to handle bursts of queries gracefully.  Queues should have limits to prevent unbounded growth and memory exhaustion.
* **Load Balancing:** Distribute query load across multiple Querier instances using load balancers to improve overall system capacity and resilience to DoS attacks.
* **Authentication and Authorization (as in 2.2.1.1):**  Enforce strong authentication and authorization to control access to the query API and limit the potential attack surface.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization (as in 2.2.1.1):**  Ensure proper input validation and sanitization to prevent any unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing (as in 2.2.1.1):** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential weaknesses.

**Impact Assessment:**

* **High Impact:** Similar to crafting complex queries, overwhelming Queriers with a high volume of legitimate queries can lead to a significant Denial of Service, disrupting monitoring and alerting.
* **High Risk:** This sub-vector is also considered a high-risk path due to the potential for significant impact and the relative ease of launching a flood attack, especially if rate limiting and concurrency controls are insufficient.
