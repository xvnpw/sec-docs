## Deep Analysis: Multi-tenancy Isolation Issues in Cortex

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

**Objective:** The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the "Multi-tenancy Isolation Issues" attack surface in Cortex. This involves identifying potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in Cortex's multi-tenancy implementation that could lead to unauthorized cross-tenant data access, resource manipulation, or service disruption. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights and recommendations to the development team for strengthening Cortex's multi-tenancy security posture and mitigating identified risks.  Ultimately, this analysis will help ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of tenant data within a multi-tenant Cortex environment.

### 2. Scope

**In Scope:**

*   **Cortex Components:**  This analysis will cover all core Cortex components involved in handling tenant IDs and enforcing multi-tenancy isolation, including:
    *   **Distributor:**  Focus on tenant ID extraction, validation, and routing of incoming write requests.
    *   **Ingester:**  Analysis of tenant ID association with time series data, data storage isolation, and query handling within the ingester.
    *   **Querier:**  Examination of tenant ID enforcement during query processing, data retrieval from ingesters and store-gateway, and prevention of cross-tenant data access.
    *   **Store-gateway (if applicable/configured):**  Analysis of tenant ID handling for long-term storage access and data retrieval.
    *   **Ruler:**  Investigation of tenant ID context in rule evaluation and alerting, ensuring rules from one tenant do not affect others.
    *   **Alertmanager (if integrated and tenant-aware):**  If Cortex Alertmanager integration is tenant-aware, its tenant isolation mechanisms will be considered.
    *   **API Gateway/Load Balancer (if relevant to tenant routing):** If external components are responsible for initial tenant routing or identification before requests reach Cortex, these will be considered in the context of tenant ID injection and potential bypasses.
    *   **Configuration:**  Review of Cortex configuration parameters related to multi-tenancy, authentication, authorization, and data isolation.
    *   **Code:**  Analysis of relevant source code sections in Cortex responsible for tenant ID handling, authentication, authorization, and data access control.

**Out of Scope:**

*   General security vulnerabilities in dependencies or underlying infrastructure not directly related to Cortex's multi-tenancy implementation.

*   Vulnerabilities in external systems that Cortex integrates with, unless they directly impact Cortex's multi-tenancy isolation.
*   Detailed performance analysis or optimization.

### 3. Methodology

This deep analysis will employ a combination of the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review (Static Analysis):**
    *   Manually review Cortex source code, focusing on modules responsible for tenant ID handling, authentication, authorization, data access control, and inter-component communication.
    *   Utilize static analysis tools (if applicable and feasible) to automatically identify potential code-level vulnerabilities such as insecure coding practices, authorization bypasses, or injection flaws related to tenant IDs.
    *   Focus on identifying areas where tenant IDs are parsed, validated, propagated, and used for access control decisions.

*   **Configuration Analysis:**
    *   Review default Cortex configurations and common deployment patterns to identify potential misconfigurations that could weaken multi-tenancy isolation.
    *   Analyze configuration parameters related to authentication, authorization, tenant ID enforcement, and data storage to identify insecure defaults or options.
    *   Examine documentation for configuration best practices and identify any ambiguities or gaps that could lead to misconfigurations.

*   **Threat Modeling:**
    *   Develop threat models specifically focused on multi-tenancy isolation in Cortex.
    *   Identify potential threat actors, attack vectors, and attack scenarios targeting multi-tenancy isolation.
    *   Map potential vulnerabilities to the STRIDE threat model (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) in the context of multi-tenancy.
    *   Consider attack scenarios such as:
        *   Tenant ID manipulation/injection.
        *   Authorization bypass due to flawed logic or missing checks.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Multi-tenancy Isolation Issues

This section delves into the deep analysis of the "Multi-tenancy Isolation Issues" attack surface, breaking it down into key areas and potential vulnerabilities.

**4.1. Tenant ID Handling and Enforcement:**

*   **Vulnerability:** **Inconsistent Tenant ID Extraction and Validation:**
    *   **Description:** If tenant IDs are extracted or validated inconsistently across different Cortex components (Distributor, Querier, Ingester, etc.), it could lead to scenarios where a request is processed under the wrong tenant context. For example, if the Distributor correctly validates the tenant ID but the Querier fails to do so, a cross-tenant query might be possible.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker could craft requests that bypass tenant ID validation in certain components while being accepted by others, leading to unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-tenant data leakage, unauthorized data modification.
    *   **Mitigation Check:** Verify that tenant ID extraction and validation logic is identical and consistently applied across all relevant Cortex components. Code review should focus on ensuring consistent parsing and validation routines.

*   **Vulnerability:** **Weak or Predictable Tenant ID Generation:**
    *   **Description:** If tenant IDs are easily guessable or predictable (e.g., sequential integers, simple patterns), an attacker might be able to enumerate and attempt to access data belonging to other tenants by simply trying different tenant IDs.
    *   **Exploitation:** Brute-force or dictionary attacks to guess valid tenant IDs and attempt unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-tenant data leakage, unauthorized data modification.
    *   **Mitigation Check:**  Tenant ID generation should use cryptographically secure random number generators to produce unpredictable and sufficiently long IDs. Configuration options for tenant ID generation should be reviewed.

*   **Vulnerability:** **Tenant ID Injection or Manipulation:**
    *   **Description:** If tenant IDs are passed through user-controlled input (e.g., HTTP headers, query parameters) without proper sanitization and validation, an attacker might be able to inject or manipulate tenant IDs to impersonate other tenants or bypass authorization checks.
    *   **Exploitation:**  Modifying HTTP headers (e.g., `X-Scope-OrgID`) or API request parameters to inject a different tenant ID.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-tenant data leakage, unauthorized data modification, resource manipulation.
    *   **Mitigation Check:**  Strictly validate and sanitize tenant IDs received from external sources. Ensure that tenant IDs are treated as opaque identifiers and not directly used in data access paths without proper validation. Input validation routines should be thoroughly reviewed.

**4.2. Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms:**

*   **Vulnerability:** **Authorization Bypass due to Logic Flaws:**
    *   **Description:**  Flaws in the authorization logic within Cortex components could allow requests to be processed even if the tenant is not authorized to access the requested resource. This could be due to incorrect conditional statements, missing authorization checks, or vulnerabilities in the authorization policy enforcement.
    *   **Exploitation:** Crafting specific requests that exploit logic flaws in the authorization code to bypass access controls.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-tenant data leakage, unauthorized data modification, resource manipulation.
    *   **Mitigation Check:**  Thorough code review of authorization logic in Distributor, Querier, Ingester, and other relevant components. Unit and integration tests should specifically cover authorization scenarios, including negative test cases for unauthorized access attempts.

*   **Vulnerability:** **Missing Authorization Checks:**
    *   **Description:**  In certain code paths or API endpoints, authorization checks based on tenant IDs might be missing entirely. This could be an oversight in development or a result of incomplete security implementation.
    *   **Exploitation:** Accessing API endpoints or triggering code paths that lack tenant-based authorization checks.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-tenant data leakage, unauthorized data modification, resource manipulation.
    *   **Mitigation Check:**  Perform a comprehensive audit of all API endpoints and code paths to ensure that tenant-based authorization checks are consistently applied wherever tenant-specific data or resources are accessed. Automated security scanning tools can help identify missing authorization checks.

*   **Vulnerability:** **Reliance on Weak Authentication Methods (if applicable):**
    *   **Description:** If Cortex relies on weak or easily bypassable authentication methods for tenant identification, it could undermine multi-tenancy isolation.  While Cortex itself might not handle authentication directly, misconfigurations in front-end proxies or API gateways could introduce weaknesses.
    *   **Exploitation:** Bypassing weak authentication mechanisms to impersonate tenants or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-tenant data leakage, unauthorized data modification, resource manipulation.
    *   **Mitigation Check:**  Ensure that robust authentication methods are used in conjunction with Cortex, especially if external authentication providers are integrated. Review the security configuration of any front-end proxies or API gateways used with Cortex.

**4.3. Data Access Control and Storage Isolation:**

*   **Vulnerability:** **Insecure Data Access Paths:**
    *   **Description:**  Even with tenant ID enforcement, vulnerabilities in data access paths within Cortex components could allow one tenant to access data belonging to another. This could occur if data is not properly segregated in memory, storage, or during inter-component communication.
    *   **Exploitation:** Exploiting flaws in data retrieval or processing logic to access data outside of the authorized tenant's scope.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-tenant data leakage.
    *   **Mitigation Check:**  Code review focusing on data access patterns in Ingester, Querier, and Store-gateway. Verify that data retrieval and processing logic strictly adheres to tenant ID boundaries.  Consider data segregation techniques at the storage level if applicable.

*   **Vulnerability:** **Data Leakage through Shared Resources (e.g., Caching):**
    *   **Description:** If shared resources like caches are not properly partitioned by tenant, data from one tenant might inadvertently leak into the cache and become accessible to another tenant.
    *   **Exploitation:**  Exploiting shared caching mechanisms to retrieve data belonging to other tenants.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-tenant data leakage.
    *   **Mitigation Check:**  Analyze caching mechanisms within Cortex components. Ensure that caches are tenant-aware and properly partitioned to prevent cross-tenant data leakage. Consider using tenant-specific cache keys or separate cache instances per tenant.

**4.4. Resource Isolation (Resource Exhaustion Impacting Other Tenants):**

*   **Vulnerability:** **Lack of Resource Quotas or Limits per Tenant:**
    *   **Description:** If Cortex does not enforce resource quotas or limits per tenant (e.g., CPU, memory, storage, query concurrency), a malicious or misbehaving tenant could consume excessive resources, impacting the performance and availability of other tenants (noisy neighbor problem). While not direct data leakage, this is a multi-tenancy isolation issue.
    *   **Exploitation:**  A tenant intentionally or unintentionally sending a large volume of data or complex queries to exhaust shared resources.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service or performance degradation for other tenants.
    *   **Mitigation Check:**  Review Cortex's resource management capabilities and configuration options for setting tenant-specific quotas and limits. Ensure that appropriate resource limits are configured to prevent resource exhaustion by individual tenants.

*   **Vulnerability:** **Inefficient Resource Sharing Mechanisms:**
    *   **Description:** Inefficient resource sharing mechanisms within Cortex components could lead to performance bottlenecks and resource contention, disproportionately affecting some tenants due to the actions of others.
    *   **Exploitation:**  Exploiting inefficient resource sharing to cause performance degradation for other tenants.
    *   **Impact:** Performance degradation or service disruption for other tenants.
    *   **Mitigation Check:**  Analyze resource sharing mechanisms within Cortex components, particularly in high-load scenarios. Identify potential bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation and scheduling to ensure fair resource distribution among tenants.

**4.5. Configuration Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Vulnerability:** **Misconfigured Multi-tenancy Settings:**
    *   **Description:** Incorrect or incomplete configuration of multi-tenancy settings in Cortex could weaken or disable tenant isolation. This could include disabling tenant ID enforcement, misconfiguring authentication/authorization providers, or failing to enable multi-tenancy features in certain components.
    *   **Exploitation:** Exploiting misconfigurations to bypass multi-tenancy isolation.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-tenant data leakage, unauthorized data modification, resource manipulation, service disruption.
    *   **Mitigation Check:**  Thoroughly review Cortex configuration documentation and best practices for multi-tenancy. Develop configuration validation scripts or tools to automatically check for misconfigurations that could weaken tenant isolation. Regular configuration audits are crucial.

*   **Vulnerability:** **Insecure Default Configurations:**
    *   **Description:** If default Cortex configurations are not secure by default regarding multi-tenancy isolation, new deployments might be vulnerable until explicitly secured.
    *   **Exploitation:** Exploiting insecure default configurations in newly deployed Cortex instances.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-tenant data leakage, unauthorized data modification, resource manipulation, service disruption.
    *   **Mitigation Check:**  Review default Cortex configurations and ensure they are secure by default regarding multi-tenancy.  Provide clear documentation and guidance on securing Cortex in multi-tenant environments.

**4.6. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Less Direct, but worth considering):**

*   **Vulnerability:** **Vulnerabilities in Dependencies Affecting Tenant Isolation:**
    *   **Description:** While less direct, vulnerabilities in underlying libraries or dependencies used by Cortex could potentially be exploited to bypass multi-tenancy isolation if they affect core functionalities like authentication, authorization, or data handling.
    *   **Exploitation:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in dependencies to gain unauthorized access or bypass security controls.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-tenant data leakage, unauthorized data modification, resource manipulation, service disruption.
    *   **Mitigation Check:**  Regularly monitor and update Cortex dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Perform dependency scanning to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
