### 2. Deep Analysis of Mitigation Strategy: Query Validation and Sanitization (LogQL & PromQL)

This section provides a detailed analysis of each component of the "Query Validation and Sanitization (LogQL & PromQL)" mitigation strategy.

#### 2.1. Query Parsing and Validation

*   **Description:** Implement robust parsing and validation of LogQL and PromQL queries within Cortex queriers before execution. Use a secure query parser within Cortex that can detect and reject potentially malicious or invalid queries.

*   **Deep Analysis:**
    *   **Effectiveness against Threats:**
        *   **Query Injection (High):**  Strong parsing and validation are the first line of defense against query injection. By rigorously checking the syntax and structure of queries, the system can identify and reject queries that deviate from expected patterns or contain potentially malicious code disguised as query components. This is crucial for preventing attackers from injecting arbitrary commands or logic into the query execution flow.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium):** Validation can help prevent information disclosure by enforcing access control rules and query constraints. For example, validation logic can check if the query attempts to access labels or metrics that the user is not authorized to view. Semantic validation can also detect queries that, while syntactically correct, are designed to extract sensitive information in unintended ways.
        *   **DoS (Query Overload) (Medium):**  Validation can play a role in preventing DoS attacks by identifying and rejecting resource-intensive queries before they are executed. This can include checks for overly broad queries (e.g., queries without time range limits or label filters), complex aggregations, or nested queries that could consume excessive CPU, memory, or I/O resources.

    *   **Cortex Context & Implementation:**
        *   Cortex already incorporates parsing for both LogQL and PromQL.  The `cortex/pkg/querier` and related packages likely contain the parsing logic.
        *   **Current Implementation (Partially Implemented):**  The "Partially implemented" status suggests that basic syntax checking is likely in place.  However, "more comprehensive" validation is needed. This could mean:
            *   **Semantic Validation:** Moving beyond syntax to understand the *meaning* of the query and validate its logic against security policies and resource limits.
            *   **Context-Aware Validation:**  Validating queries based on the user's roles, permissions, and the specific context of the query execution.
            *   **Input Type Validation:** Ensuring that inputs to functions and operators are of the expected types and within valid ranges.

    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Enhance Semantic Validation:** Implement deeper semantic analysis of queries to detect potentially harmful or unauthorized operations beyond basic syntax checks.
        *   **Resource Limit Validation:** Integrate validation with resource management to reject queries that exceed predefined resource limits (e.g., maximum series to fetch, query execution time).
        *   **Utilize Secure Parser Libraries:** Ensure the underlying parser libraries used are robust and regularly updated to address any parser vulnerabilities.
        *   **Centralized Validation Logic:**  Consider centralizing validation logic within a dedicated component or service to ensure consistency and ease of maintenance across different Cortex components.

#### 2.2. Parameterized Queries

*   **Description:** Where possible within Cortex query engine, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate query logic from user-provided input, reducing the risk of injection attacks.

*   **Deep Analysis:**
    *   **Effectiveness against Threats:**
        *   **Query Injection (High):** Parameterized queries are a highly effective technique to prevent injection attacks. By separating the query structure (the "template") from the user-provided data, they eliminate the possibility of user input being interpreted as part of the query logic. This is a standard best practice in database security and is equally applicable to query languages like LogQL and PromQL.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Low):** While primarily focused on injection, parameterized queries indirectly contribute to preventing information disclosure by ensuring queries are executed as intended and not manipulated by attackers to bypass access controls.
        *   **DoS (Query Overload) (Low):** Parameterized queries themselves don't directly prevent DoS, but they can improve query performance in some cases by allowing the query engine to pre-compile and optimize the query structure.

    *   **Cortex Context & Implementation:**
        *   **Missing Implementation:** The "Parameterized queries are not fully utilized" statement indicates a significant gap.  LogQL and PromQL, as query languages designed for time-series data, might not directly support traditional "prepared statements" in the same way as SQL databases. However, the *concept* of parameterization can be applied.
        *   **Potential Implementation Approaches:**
            *   **Templating Engine:**  Introduce a templating engine within the query frontend or queriers that allows defining query templates with placeholders for user-provided values (e.g., label values, metric names).
            *   **Function-Based Parameterization:**  Design functions or operators within LogQL/PromQL that accept user inputs as parameters and handle them securely, preventing interpretation as query logic.
            *   **Abstraction Layer:** Create an abstraction layer above the raw LogQL/PromQL query execution that handles parameterization and input binding before passing the query to the core engine.

    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Investigate Parameterization Feasibility:** Conduct a thorough investigation into how parameterized queries can be effectively implemented within the Cortex query engine, considering the specific characteristics of LogQL and PromQL.
        *   **Prioritize Key Query Areas:** Focus on implementing parameterization for query areas that are most vulnerable to injection attacks, such as queries that heavily rely on user-provided label values or regex patterns.
        *   **Develop Parameterization API:**  If a templating or function-based approach is chosen, develop a clear API for developers to define and use parameterized queries securely.

#### 2.3. Sanitization of User Input

*   **Description:** Sanitize user-provided inputs within Cortex queries (e.g., label values, regex patterns) to prevent injection of malicious code or unexpected characters.

*   **Deep Analysis:**
    *   **Effectiveness against Threats:**
        *   **Query Injection (High):** Sanitization is a crucial complementary measure to query validation and parameterization. Even with robust parsing and validation, there might be edge cases or complex query constructs where malicious input could slip through. Sanitization acts as a secondary defense layer by neutralizing potentially harmful characters or patterns in user inputs before they are processed by the query engine.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium):** Sanitization can help prevent unintended information disclosure by ensuring that user inputs do not inadvertently alter the query logic to access unauthorized data.
        *   **DoS (Query Overload) (Low):** Sanitization can indirectly contribute to DoS prevention by preventing malicious inputs from creating overly complex or resource-intensive queries.

    *   **Cortex Context & Implementation:**
        *   **Limited Sanitization (Partially Implemented):** The "Limited sanitization" status suggests that some basic sanitization might be in place, but it's not comprehensive.
        *   **Areas for Sanitization in LogQL/PromQL:**
            *   **Label Values:**  Sanitize label values provided in query filters (e.g., `{label="<user_input>"}`).  This is critical as label values are frequently user-controlled.
            *   **Regex Patterns:** Sanitize regex patterns used in label matching or string functions (e.g., `{label=~"<user_regex>"}`). Malicious regex patterns can be crafted to cause excessive backtracking and DoS or to bypass intended matching logic.
            *   **Metric Names (Less Critical but Consider):** While metric names are typically more controlled, sanitization might still be relevant if metric names can be dynamically constructed or influenced by user input in certain scenarios.

    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Comprehensive Sanitization Rules:** Define clear and comprehensive sanitization rules for all user-provided inputs in LogQL and PromQL queries. This should include:
            *   **Input Encoding/Escaping:**  Properly encode or escape special characters that have semantic meaning in LogQL/PromQL syntax (e.g., quotes, braces, operators).
            *   **Input Validation against Allowed Character Sets:**  Restrict user inputs to a defined set of allowed characters to prevent injection of unexpected or malicious characters.
            *   **Regex Sanitization:** Implement specific sanitization techniques for regex patterns, such as limiting regex complexity, escaping special regex characters, or using regex engines with DoS protection.
        *   **Context-Specific Sanitization:** Apply sanitization rules based on the context of the user input within the query. For example, sanitization for label values might differ from sanitization for regex patterns.
        *   **Regularly Review and Update Sanitization Rules:**  As LogQL and PromQL evolve and new vulnerabilities are discovered, regularly review and update sanitization rules to maintain their effectiveness.

#### 2.4. Query Allow-listing/Deny-listing

*   **Description:** Consider implementing query allow-lists or deny-lists within Cortex to restrict the types of queries that can be executed. This can be useful for enforcing security policies or preventing resource-intensive queries within Cortex.

*   **Deep Analysis:**
    *   **Effectiveness against Threats:**
        *   **Query Injection (Medium):** Allow-lists/deny-lists are not a primary defense against injection but can act as a preventative control by restricting the overall attack surface. By limiting the types of queries that can be executed, they can reduce the potential for attackers to find exploitable query patterns.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium):**  Allow-lists/deny-lists can be effective in enforcing access control policies and preventing unauthorized information disclosure. They can be used to restrict access to specific metrics, labels, or query operations based on user roles or permissions.
        *   **DoS (Query Overload) (High):**  Query allow-lists/deny-lists are highly effective in preventing DoS attacks caused by resource-intensive queries. By explicitly controlling the types of queries that are allowed, administrators can prevent users from executing queries that could overload the Cortex system.

    *   **Cortex Context & Implementation:**
        *   **Not Implemented (Missing Implementation):** The "Query allow-listing/deny-listing is not implemented" statement indicates a significant opportunity for improvement.
        *   **Implementation Approaches:**
            *   **Rule-Based System:** Implement a rule-based system where administrators can define rules based on various criteria, such as:
                *   **Query Structure:**  Allow/deny queries based on the presence or absence of specific functions, operators, or keywords.
                *   **Metric Names/Label Selectors:**  Restrict access to specific metrics or labels.
                *   **User Roles/Permissions:**  Apply different allow/deny lists based on user roles or permissions.
                *   **Query Complexity Metrics:**  Limit queries based on complexity metrics like the number of series matched, aggregation levels, or query execution time estimates.
            *   **Configuration-Based Allow/Deny Lists:**  Provide configuration options to define allow-lists and deny-lists in configuration files or through a management API.
            *   **Integration with Authentication/Authorization:**  Integrate allow-listing/deny-listing with Cortex's authentication and authorization mechanisms to enforce policies based on user identity and roles.

    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Prioritize Deny-listing for High-Risk Queries:** Initially focus on implementing deny-lists to block known high-risk query patterns or operations that are prone to DoS or information disclosure.
        *   **Develop Flexible Rule Engine:**  Design a flexible rule engine that allows administrators to define granular allow-list/deny-list rules based on various query characteristics and user contexts.
        *   **Provide User-Friendly Management Interface:**  Develop a user-friendly interface (e.g., CLI, web UI) for administrators to manage and update query allow-lists/deny-lists easily.
        *   **Start with a Conservative Approach:**  Begin with a conservative deny-list approach and gradually refine the rules based on monitoring and operational experience.

#### 2.5. Security Audits

*   **Description:** Regularly audit Cortex query validation and sanitization logic to identify and address any potential bypasses or vulnerabilities.

*   **Deep Analysis:**
    *   **Effectiveness against Threats:**
        *   **Query Injection (High):** Regular security audits are crucial for maintaining the effectiveness of query validation and sanitization over time. Audits can uncover subtle bypasses, logic flaws, or newly introduced vulnerabilities in the validation and sanitization logic.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium):** Audits help ensure that access control policies enforced through query validation and allow-listing/deny-listing remain effective and prevent unintended information disclosure.
        *   **DoS (Query Overload) (Medium):** Audits can identify weaknesses in DoS prevention mechanisms related to query validation and allow-listing/deny-listing, ensuring they continue to protect against resource-intensive queries.

    *   **Cortex Context & Implementation:**
        *   **Ongoing Requirement:** Security audits are not a one-time implementation but an ongoing process.
        *   **Audit Scope:** Audits should cover:
            *   **Code Reviews:**  Regular code reviews of the query parsing, validation, sanitization, and allow-listing/deny-listing logic.
            *   **Penetration Testing:**  Periodic penetration testing specifically focused on query-related vulnerabilities, attempting to bypass validation and sanitization mechanisms.
            *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities in query handling logic.
            *   **Security Logging and Monitoring:**  Review security logs and monitoring data related to query validation failures, sanitization events, and allow-list/deny-list enforcement to identify potential attack attempts or anomalies.

    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Establish Regular Audit Schedule:**  Define a regular schedule for security audits of query validation and sanitization logic (e.g., quarterly or bi-annually).
        *   **Involve Security Experts:**  Engage cybersecurity experts with expertise in query injection and application security to conduct thorough audits and penetration testing.
        *   **Automate Audit Processes:**  Automate parts of the audit process where possible, such as using static analysis tools and setting up automated vulnerability scanning.
        *   **Track and Remediate Findings:**  Establish a process for tracking audit findings, prioritizing remediation efforts, and verifying the effectiveness of implemented fixes.
