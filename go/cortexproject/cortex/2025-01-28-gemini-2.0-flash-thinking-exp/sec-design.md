### 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** Cortex

**Project Description:** Cortex is a cloud-native, horizontally scalable, multi-tenant, and durable monitoring system. It provides long-term storage and query capabilities for Prometheus, effectively functioning as a scalable Prometheus-as-a-Service platform. Cortex overcomes the limitations of single Prometheus servers by enabling the ingestion and querying of metrics at massive scale, with built-in multi-tenancy and long-term data retention.  It is designed for deployment in distributed environments, particularly Kubernetes.

**Project Repository:** [https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex)

### 2. Goals and Objectives

* **Scalability & Performance:** Achieve horizontal scalability to handle petabytes of time-series data and high-concurrency query loads with low latency.
* **Multi-tenancy & Isolation:** Provide secure and logically isolated environments for numerous independent tenants within a shared Cortex cluster, ensuring data privacy and preventing cross-tenant interference.
* **Long-Term Storage & Durability:** Offer reliable and cost-efficient long-term storage for Prometheus metrics, extending beyond the ephemeral storage of individual Prometheus instances and ensuring data persistence.
* **High Availability & Fault Tolerance:** Design for continuous operation and data availability, even in the face of individual component failures or infrastructure disruptions, through redundancy and fault tolerance mechanisms.
* **Prometheus Compatibility & Interoperability:** Maintain full compatibility with the Prometheus ecosystem, including PromQL, recording rules, alerting rules, and client libraries, enabling seamless migration and integration.
* **Cost Efficiency & Resource Optimization:** Optimize resource utilization across compute, storage, and network to minimize operational costs for large-scale metric ingestion and storage.
* **Observability & Monitoring:** Provide comprehensive internal observability into the Cortex system itself, exposing metrics, logs, and traces for performance monitoring, debugging, and capacity planning.
* **Security & Compliance:** Implement robust security measures to protect data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, addressing common security threats and facilitating compliance requirements.

### 5. Data Flow

The data flow within Cortex is primarily divided into two distinct paths: **Ingestion Path** (metrics coming in) and **Query Path** (metrics being queried).

**5.1. Ingestion Path Data Flow (Simplified):**

1. **Prometheus/Agent** scrapes metrics from monitored targets.
2. **Prometheus/Agent** sends `remote_write` requests containing metric samples to the **Distributor**.
3. **Distributor** authenticates the tenant, validates the request, and shards the samples based on series hash.
4. **Distributor** forwards sharded samples to the appropriate **Ingesters**.
5. **Ingesters** store samples in memory, encode them into chunks, and periodically flush chunks to **Object Storage** via **Store Gateway**.

**5.2. Query Path Data Flow (Simplified):**

1. **User/Dashboard** sends a PromQL query to the **Query Frontend** (recommended).
2. **Query Frontend** caches, optimizes, and forwards the query to **Queriers**.
3. **Queriers** identify relevant **Ingesters** (for recent data) and **Store Gateways** (for historical data).
4. **Queriers** query **Ingesters** and **Store Gateways** to retrieve necessary data.
5. **Store Gateways** fetch chunks from **Object Storage** and return them to **Queriers**.
6. **Queriers** merge, aggregate, and process data from all sources.
7. **Queriers** execute the PromQL query and return results to **Query Frontend** (or directly to the user).
8. **Query Frontend** caches results and returns them to the **User/Dashboard**.

* **Data Encryption:**
    * **Encryption at Rest:** Enable encryption at rest for object storage to protect stored metric data. Utilize object storage encryption features (e.g., AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, Azure Key Vault).
    * **Encryption in Transit:** Enforce TLS encryption for all external and internal communication channels, including `remote_write` requests, PromQL queries, and inter-component communication.

* **Network Security:**
    * **Network Policies:** Implement Kubernetes Network Policies or firewall rules to restrict network access between Cortex components and external networks, enforcing least privilege network access.
    * **Service Mesh (Optional):** Consider using a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) to enhance network security, observability, and traffic management within the Cortex cluster.

* **Access Control to Object Storage:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant Store Gateways and Compactors only the necessary permissions to access object storage, following the principle of least privilege.
    * **IAM Roles & Policies:** Utilize IAM roles and policies provided by cloud providers to manage access to object storage securely.

    * **SIEM Integration:** Integrate Cortex logs and security events with a SIEM system for real-time threat detection and incident correlation.

### 8. Deployment Model

*(No changes from previous version, section remains valid)*

Cortex is typically deployed in a distributed environment, often on Kubernetes, for scalability and high availability. Common deployment models include:

* **Kubernetes Deployment:**  Utilizing Kubernetes for container orchestration, service discovery, scaling, and rolling updates. This is the recommended and most common deployment model.
* **On-Premise Deployment (Bare Metal/VMs):** Deployment on physical servers or virtual machines, requiring manual configuration for clustering, service discovery, and scaling.
* **Cloud Provider Managed Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS):** Leveraging managed Kubernetes services offered by cloud providers for simplified deployment and management.

For production deployments, it is highly recommended to deploy Cortex in a highly available and fault-tolerant manner, with multiple replicas of each component and distributed storage.
