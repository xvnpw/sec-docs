# Attack Surface Analysis for cortexproject/cortex

## Attack Surface: [Metric Injection Attacks](./attack_surfaces/metric_injection_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious or malformed metric data into the Cortex ingestion pipeline.
*   **Cortex Contribution:** Cortex's distributed nature and ingestion pipeline, especially ingesters, are designed to receive and process large volumes of metrics. This pipeline can be targeted for injection attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends metrics with extremely long label names or values to an ingester, causing excessive memory consumption and leading to an Out-of-Memory (OOM) error, effectively DoS-ing the ingester.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) of Cortex ingestion and query services.
    *   Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk I/O) on ingesters and potentially other components.
    *   Data corruption or instability within Cortex.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict validation on incoming metrics at the distributor and ingester levels. Limit label name and value lengths, and restrict allowed characters.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure resource limits (CPU, memory) for ingesters to prevent resource exhaustion from malicious metrics.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on metric ingestion at the distributor or gateway level to prevent overwhelming the system.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection mechanisms to identify and potentially reject suspicious metric patterns.

## Attack Surface: [PromQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/promql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious PromQL queries, exploiting vulnerabilities in query processing or insufficient input sanitization.
*   **Cortex Contribution:** Cortex relies heavily on PromQL for querying metrics. If user-provided input is directly used in PromQL queries without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable to injection.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to filter metrics based on a user-provided label value. An attacker crafts a malicious label value like `label=~"user-.*|.*"` which, when incorporated into a PromQL query, could become highly resource-intensive, causing a DoS on queriers. Or, an attacker might attempt to use functions like `label_replace` in unexpected ways to extract data they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) of Cortex query services due to resource-intensive queries.
    *   Data exfiltration by crafting queries to access sensitive metrics beyond intended access.
    *   Information disclosure by gaining insights into internal system metrics or configurations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input before incorporating it into PromQL queries. Use parameterized queries or query builders to avoid direct string concatenation.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Restrict user access to only the metrics and data they need. Implement granular authorization policies.
    *   **Query Analysis and Limits:** Analyze incoming PromQL queries for complexity and resource usage. Implement query limits (e.g., maximum query duration, series limit, memory limit) to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   **PromQL Security Review:** Regularly review PromQL usage patterns and potential injection points in applications interacting with Cortex.

## Attack Surface: [Multi-tenancy Isolation Issues](./attack_surfaces/multi-tenancy_isolation_issues.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Cortex's multi-tenancy implementation allow one tenant to access data or resources belonging to another tenant.
*   **Cortex Contribution:** Cortex is designed for multi-tenancy, and relies on tenant IDs for data isolation. Weaknesses in tenant ID handling or enforcement can lead to isolation breaches.
*   **Example:** A misconfiguration or vulnerability in the distributor or querier components could allow requests from one tenant to be processed under the context of another tenant, leading to cross-tenant data access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-tenant data leakage and unauthorized access to sensitive metric data.
    *   Cross-tenant resource exhaustion, where one tenant can impact the performance or availability of other tenants.
    *   Compliance violations and reputational damage due to data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Tenant ID Enforcement:** Ensure tenant IDs are consistently and rigorously enforced across all Cortex components (distributor, ingester, querier, etc.).
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to verify tenant identity and control access to resources based on tenant ID.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically focused on multi-tenancy isolation to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Configuration Review:** Regularly review Cortex configuration to ensure proper multi-tenancy settings are in place and no misconfigurations exist that could weaken isolation.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to Cortex components or data.
*   **Cortex Contribution:** Cortex components expose HTTP APIs for various operations. If authentication and authorization are not correctly implemented or are vulnerable, these APIs become attack vectors.
*   **Example:** A Cortex deployment fails to properly configure authentication on the querier's API. An attacker can directly access the querier API without credentials and query all metrics, bypassing intended access controls. Or, a vulnerability in the authentication middleware allows bypassing authentication checks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive metric data.
    *   Unauthorized modification or deletion of metric data, rules, or configurations.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) by unauthorized users disrupting Cortex operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable and Enforce Authentication:**  Always enable and enforce authentication on all Cortex component APIs (distributor, ingester, querier, ruler, alertmanager, etc.). Use strong authentication methods like OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, or mutual TLS.
    *   **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to control access to Cortex resources based on user roles and permissions. Define granular roles with least privilege access.
    *   **Secure API Gateways:** Use secure API gateways in front of Cortex components to handle authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.
    *   **Regular Security Testing:** Conduct regular security testing and vulnerability scanning of Cortex APIs and authentication/authorization mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies used by Cortex components are exploited by attackers.
*   **Cortex Contribution:** Cortex, like most software, relies on numerous open-source libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect Cortex security.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a widely used Go library that Cortex depends on. If Cortex is not updated to a patched version, attackers could exploit this vulnerability to potentially gain remote code execution or cause other security breaches.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on Cortex components.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to vulnerable dependencies.
    *   Data breaches or information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning and Management:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Cortex dependencies.
    *   **Regular Updates and Patching:**  Keep Cortex and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches. Establish a process for timely patching of vulnerabilities.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to analyze Cortex's codebase and dependencies for security risks and license compliance.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases to stay informed about new vulnerabilities affecting Cortex dependencies.
