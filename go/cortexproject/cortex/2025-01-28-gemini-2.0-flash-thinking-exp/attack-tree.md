## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Data Ingestion Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - INGESTION]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_data_ingestion_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path___critical_node_-_ingestion_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **1.1.1.3. Inject metrics with excessive cardinality to cause performance issues (DoS):**
        * **Description:** Attacker sends metrics with a large number of unique label combinations.
        * **Mechanism:** High cardinality metrics increase memory usage, indexing load, and storage requirements in Ingesters and backend storage, leading to performance degradation and potential DoS.
        * **Impact:** Ingester overload, slow queries, system instability, potential service outage.
    * **1.2. Resource Exhaustion via Ingestion [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Description:** Attacker floods the Ingesters with a massive volume of metrics.
        * **Mechanism:** Overwhelms Ingesters' processing capacity, network bandwidth, and resource limits (CPU, memory).
        * **Impact:** Ingester overload, dropped metrics, slow ingestion, system instability, potential service outage.
        * **Sub-Vectors:**
            * **1.2.1. High Volume Metric Injection [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                * **1.2.1.1. Flood Ingesters with excessive metrics to cause DoS [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Simple flooding attack using high volume of metrics.
            * **1.2.2. High Cardinality Metric Injection [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                * **1.2.2.1. Inject metrics with rapidly changing labels to overwhelm Ingesters and storage [HIGH RISK PATH]:**  Combines high volume with high cardinality for amplified resource exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Querying Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - QUERYING]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_querying_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path___critical_node_-_querying_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **2.2. Query-Based Denial of Service [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Description:** Attacker crafts or sends queries that consume excessive resources on Queriers.
        * **Mechanism:** Exploits PromQL's expressiveness to create complex queries or sends a high volume of resource-intensive queries, overloading Queriers' CPU, memory, and I/O.
        * **Impact:** Querier overload, slow queries, query timeouts, system instability, potential service outage.
        * **Sub-Vectors:**
            * **2.2.1. Resource Intensive Queries [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                * **2.2.1.1. Craft complex PromQL queries that consume excessive CPU, memory, or I/O on Queriers [HIGH RISK PATH]:**  Focuses on crafting single, highly complex queries.
                * **2.2.1.2. Send a high volume of legitimate but resource-intensive queries to overwhelm Queriers [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Focuses on sending many moderately complex queries in rapid succession.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Storage Layer Vulnerabilities (Indirectly via Cortex) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - STORAGE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_storage_layer_vulnerabilities__indirectly_via_cortex___high_risk_path___critical_node_-_s_e9c13de9.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **3.1. Storage Access Control Bypass (Misconfiguration) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Description:** Attacker exploits misconfigured permissions on the backend storage (e.g., S3, GCS, Azure Blob).
        * **Mechanism:** Cloud storage services often rely on IAM policies. Misconfigurations can grant unintended public or cross-tenant access to the storage buckets used by Cortex.
        * **Impact:** Direct access to all metrics data, data breach, data manipulation, data deletion, complete compromise of metrics data.
        * **Sub-Vectors:**
            * **3.1.1. Misconfigured Backend Storage Permissions [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - STORAGE MISCONFIGURATION]:**
                * **3.1.1.1. If backend storage (S3, GCS, etc.) is misconfigured, attacker might directly access and manipulate data, bypassing Cortex access controls. [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Direct exploitation of storage misconfiguration.
    * **3.2.2. Direct Storage Manipulation (if access gained via 3.1) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Description:** Once storage access is gained via misconfiguration (3.1), attacker directly manipulates data in the storage backend.
        * **Mechanism:** Using cloud provider's CLI or SDKs, attacker can read, modify, or delete objects (chunks, indexes) in the storage buckets.
        * **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, data deletion, injection of malicious data, complete compromise of metrics data integrity and availability.
        * **Sub-Vectors:**
            * **3.2.2.1. Directly modify or delete data in backend storage if access is gained through misconfiguration or Store Gateway exploit. [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Direct manipulation of storage content.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Dependencies and Infrastructure [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - INFRASTRUCTURE]](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_dependencies_and_infrastructure__high_risk_path___critical_node_-_infrastructure_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **6.1. Vulnerabilities in Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Description:** Attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in outdated dependencies used by Cortex.
        * **Mechanism:** Cortex relies on various Go libraries and potentially other components. Outdated dependencies may contain known security vulnerabilities (e.g., RCE, DoS).
        * **Impact:** Depends on the vulnerability, can range from DoS to Remote Code Execution (RCE), potentially leading to full server compromise and control over Cortex components.
        * **Sub-Vectors:**
            * **6.1.1. Outdated Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                * **6.1.1.1. Exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated libraries or components used by Cortex (Go libraries, Prometheus, etc.). [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

        * **Description:** Attacker exploits misconfigurations in the underlying infrastructure where Cortex is deployed (network, OS, etc.).
        * **Mechanism:** Common misconfigurations include open ports, weak firewall rules, insecure network segmentation, and unpatched operating systems.
        * **Impact:** Direct access to Cortex components, potential for lateral movement, OS compromise, full server compromise, data breaches, DoS.
        * **Sub-Vectors:**
            * **6.2.1. Unsecured Network Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - NETWORK MISCONFIGURATION]:**
                * **6.2.1.1. Exploit open ports or insecure network configurations to access Cortex components directly. [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Exploiting network misconfigurations for direct component access.
