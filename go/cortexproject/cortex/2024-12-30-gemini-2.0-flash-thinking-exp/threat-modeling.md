### High and Critical Cortex Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Cortex project:

* **Threat:** Unauthorized Metric Access
    * **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Cortex query API. This could be achieved through compromised credentials specific to Cortex, exploiting authentication vulnerabilities *within Cortex*, or bypassing authorization checks *implemented by Cortex*. The attacker might then query and retrieve sensitive metrics intended for other tenants or internal use.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive business data, performance metrics, or other confidential information managed by Cortex. This could lead to competitive disadvantage, compliance violations, or reputational damage.
    * **Affected Component:** Query Frontend, Querier
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, mutual TLS) for accessing the Cortex query API.
        * Enforce strict authorization policies *within Cortex* to control which users or applications can access specific metrics.
        * Regularly rotate API keys and tokens used for authentication *with Cortex*.
        * Utilize network segmentation to restrict access to the Cortex query API.

* **Threat:** Metric Data Tampering
    * **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Cortex ingestion path. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the Cortex distributor or ingester components, or compromising application credentials used for pushing metrics *to Cortex*. The attacker might then inject false, misleading, or manipulated metric data.
    * **Impact:** Inaccurate monitoring, flawed alerting *from Cortex*, and potentially incorrect decision-making based on the tampered metrics stored in Cortex. This could lead to operational disruptions or misinterpretations of system health.
    * **Affected Component:** Distributor, Ingester API
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization for the metric ingestion endpoint *of Cortex*.
        * Use secure communication channels (HTTPS) for metric ingestion *to Cortex*.
        * Implement input validation and sanitization on the metric data being ingested *by Cortex*.
        * Consider using signed metrics or other integrity checks to verify the authenticity of the data sent to Cortex.

* **Threat:** Rule Manipulation Leading to False or Suppressed Alerts
    * **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Cortex ruler component. This could be through compromised credentials or exploiting vulnerabilities in the ruler API *of Cortex*. The attacker might then modify existing alerting or recording rules, create malicious rules, or delete critical rules.
    * **Impact:** Suppression of critical alerts *managed by Cortex*, leading to delayed incident detection and response. Creation of false alerts, causing unnecessary alarm and resource consumption *within Cortex*. Manipulation of recording rules could lead to inaccurate historical data *stored by Cortex*.
    * **Affected Component:** Ruler API, Ruler component
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing and modifying rules *within Cortex*.
        * Implement version control and auditing for rule changes *in Cortex*.
        * Regularly review and validate alerting and recording rules *configured in Cortex*.
        * Restrict access to the ruler component to authorized personnel only.

* **Threat:** Ingester Overload and Denial of Service
    * **Description:** An attacker floods the Cortex ingestion endpoint with a large volume of metrics. This can overwhelm the ingesters *within Cortex*, causing them to become unresponsive and leading to a denial of service for legitimate metric ingestion.
    * **Impact:** Inability to ingest new metrics *into Cortex*, leading to gaps in monitoring data and potentially missed alerts. This can severely impact operational visibility and incident response capabilities.
    * **Affected Component:** Distributor, Ingester API
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement rate limiting on the ingestion endpoint *of Cortex*.
        * Implement mechanisms to identify and block malicious sources of metric data *at the Cortex level*.
        * Ensure sufficient resource provisioning for the ingester components *of Cortex* to handle expected load and potential spikes.
        * Consider using admission control mechanisms *within Cortex* to limit the rate of incoming metrics per tenant.

* **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Cortex Components
    * **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Cortex codebase (e.g., in the ingesters, distributors, queriers, or ruler). This could allow them to gain unauthorized access *to Cortex*, execute arbitrary code *within Cortex*, or cause denial of service *of Cortex*.
    * **Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts, including data breaches *from Cortex*, system compromise *of the Cortex deployment*, and service disruption *of Cortex*.
    * **Affected Component:** Various Cortex components depending on the vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Cortex to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to Cortex.
        * Implement a vulnerability management program to identify and address potential weaknesses in the Cortex deployment.
        * Follow secure coding practices when contributing to or extending Cortex.

* **Threat:** Multi-tenancy Isolation Break
    * **Description:** In a multi-tenant Cortex deployment, an attacker exploits vulnerabilities or misconfigurations *within Cortex* to bypass tenant isolation and access metrics or resources belonging to other tenants.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data belonging to other tenants *within Cortex*, potential for data tampering or denial of service affecting other tenants *using the same Cortex instance*.
    * **Affected Component:** Distributor, Querier, Query Frontend
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully configure tenant isolation settings *within Cortex*.
        * Implement thorough testing to ensure tenant isolation is effective *in the Cortex deployment*.
        * Regularly review and audit tenant configurations *within Cortex*.
        * Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions to tenants *within Cortex*.
