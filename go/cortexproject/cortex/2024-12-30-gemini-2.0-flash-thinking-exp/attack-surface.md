Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Cortex, with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Data Injection via Ingestion API
    *   **Description:** Attackers send crafted time-series data to Cortex's ingestion endpoints (gRPC or HTTP).
    *   **How Cortex Contributes:** Cortex's core functionality relies on accepting and processing external time-series data. The ingestion API is a primary entry point.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends metrics with extremely long label values, causing ingesters to consume excessive memory and potentially crash.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) against ingesters, resource exhaustion, potential for data corruption or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on ingested data, including limits on label length, value length, and the number of labels per series.
        *   Apply rate limiting to ingestion endpoints to prevent overwhelming the system with data.
        *   Configure resource limits (CPU, memory) for ingesters to prevent a single tenant or attacker from consuming all resources.
        *   Consider using authentication and authorization to restrict who can send data.

*   **Attack Surface:** Query Injection through PromQL
    *   **Description:** Attackers craft malicious PromQL queries to exploit vulnerabilities in the query engine.
    *   **How Cortex Contributes:** Cortex uses PromQL as its query language, and vulnerabilities in its parsing or execution could be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a query that, when executed, consumes excessive resources in queriers or the store gateway, leading to a DoS. Another example could be attempting to bypass tenant isolation to access data from other tenants (if not properly enforced).
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service against query components, potential for unauthorized data access or exfiltration (depending on the severity of the vulnerability).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Cortex updated to benefit from security patches addressing query engine vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement strict access control and authorization for the query API, limiting who can execute queries.
        *   Consider using query analysis tools or techniques to identify and block potentially malicious queries.
        *   Enforce resource limits on query execution to prevent resource exhaustion.

*   **Attack Surface:** Unauthorized Access to Underlying Storage
    *   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the underlying object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) where Cortex stores data.
    *   **How Cortex Contributes:** Cortex relies on external object storage for long-term data persistence. The security of this storage directly impacts Cortex's security.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the S3 bucket used by Cortex and can read, modify, or delete stored time-series data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data loss, data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access control policies on the object storage, following the principle of least privilege.
        *   Enable encryption at rest for the object storage.
        *   Regularly audit access logs for the object storage.
        *   Secure the credentials used by Cortex to access the object storage.
