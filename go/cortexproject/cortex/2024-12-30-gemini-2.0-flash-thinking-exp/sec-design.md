    *   **Function:** Handles alerts generated by the Ruler.
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   Receives alerts from the Ruler.
        *   Groups, deduplicates, and silences alerts based on configured policies.
        *   Routes alerts to configured notification channels (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty) via various integrations.
    *   **Communication:** Receives alerts from the Ruler and sends notifications to external systems.

## 5. Data Flow

The typical data flow within Cortex can be broken down into two primary paths:

*   **Ingestion Path:**
    1. Prometheus instances scrape metrics from target applications.
    2. Prometheus instances send the scraped time-series data to the Cortex Distributor via the remote write API, typically using gRPC and the Prometheus protobuf format.
    3. The Distributor authenticates the request, validates the data, and forwards it to the appropriate Ingesters based on a consistent hashing mechanism applied to the metric labels.
    4. Ingesters store the data in-memory, replicate it to other Ingesters for redundancy, and build in-memory indexes.
    5. Periodically, Ingesters flush the in-memory data as compressed chunks to object storage (e.g., using formats like Snappy compression). They also write index metadata to the key-value store, linking the time series to the location of their chunks in object storage.

*   **Query Path:**
    1. A user or system sends a PromQL query to the Cortex Querier, typically via an HTTP API request.
    2. The Querier parses the PromQL query and determines the time range required.
    3. For recent data within the time range, the Querier sends gRPC requests to the Ingesters holding that data.
    4. For historical data within the time range, the Querier sends gRPC requests to the Store Gateway.
    5. The Store Gateway queries the key-value store to locate the index metadata for the requested time series.
    6. Using the index metadata, the Store Gateway retrieves the relevant compressed data chunks from object storage.
    7. The Querier receives data from both the Ingesters and the Store Gateway.
    8. The Querier merges and deduplicates the results from the different sources to provide a consistent view of the data.
    9. The Querier returns the query results to the user or system, typically in a JSON format.

## 6. Deployment Architecture

Cortex is designed for deployment in a distributed environment, commonly within a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes. A typical deployment involves:

*   **Multiple instances of each core component:** Ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability. These instances are typically stateless (except for Ingesters' in-memory data before flushing).
*   **Load balancers:** Distributing incoming traffic across multiple Distributor and Querier instances to ensure even load distribution and high availability.
*   **Object storage:** Such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage, providing durable and scalable storage for long-term metric data chunks.
*   **Key-value store:** Such as Amazon DynamoDB, Apache Cassandra, or Google Cloud Bigtable, used for storing index metadata that maps time series to their storage locations.
*   **Configuration management:** Tools like Helm charts or Kubernetes Operators are commonly used for managing deployments, configurations, and upgrades of the Cortex cluster.
*   **Service discovery:** Mechanisms within Kubernetes (or other orchestration platforms) allow components to discover and communicate with each other.
*   **Persistent Volumes (for Ingesters):** While mostly stateless, Ingesters might use persistent volumes for storing WAL (Write-Ahead Log) to ensure data durability before it's flushed to object storage.

## 7. Key Technologies

Cortex relies on several key technologies:

*   **Go:** The primary programming language used for developing most Cortex components, chosen for its performance and concurrency features.
*   **gRPC:** A high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework used for inter-service communication within the Cortex cluster, ensuring efficient and reliable communication.
*   **Prometheus:** The foundational technology for the data model, query language (PromQL), and remote read/write protocols that Cortex is built upon.
*   **Object Storage (e.g., S3, GCS):** Provides scalable and cost-effective storage for the bulk of the metric data.
*   **Key-Value Stores (e.g., DynamoDB, Cassandra):** Offers low-latency access for storing and retrieving index metadata.
*   **Kubernetes:** A popular container orchestration platform used for deploying, managing, and scaling Cortex deployments.

## 8. Security Considerations (Preliminary)

This section outlines preliminary security considerations that will be further explored during the threat modeling process. These are potential areas of vulnerability and security controls to consider:

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Inter-component authentication:** Securely authenticating communication between Cortex components (e.g., using mutual TLS).
    *   **API authentication:** Authenticating requests to Cortex APIs (e.g., using API keys, OAuth 2.0).
    *   **Tenant-based authorization:** Implementing granular authorization to control access to data and APIs based on the tenant ID, ensuring multi-tenancy isolation.
*   **Data Encryption:**
    *   **Encryption in transit:** Encrypting data exchanged between components and with external systems using TLS.
    *   **Encryption at rest:** Encrypting data stored in object storage and the key-value store using encryption mechanisms provided by the storage providers.
*   **Network Security:**
    *   **Network segmentation:** Isolating the Cortex cluster within a private network to limit exposure.
    *   **Firewall rules:** Implementing firewall rules to restrict network access to only necessary ports and IP addresses.
*   **Multi-tenancy Security:**
    *   **Resource isolation:** Implementing resource quotas and limits per tenant to prevent resource exhaustion by a single tenant.
    *   **Data isolation:** Ensuring strong separation of data between tenants to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   **Remote write validation:** Thoroughly validating incoming data from Prometheus instances to prevent injection attacks or malformed data.
    *   **PromQL validation:** Validating PromQL queries to prevent malicious or resource-intensive queries.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   Regularly scanning and updating dependencies to address known security vulnerabilities.
*   **Secrets Management:**
    *   Securely storing and managing sensitive credentials (e.g., API keys, database passwords) using dedicated secrets management solutions.
*   **Auditing and Logging:**
    *   Maintaining comprehensive audit logs of API calls, system events, and security-related activities for monitoring and incident response.
*   **Rate Limiting:**
    *   Implementing rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

## 9. Assumptions and Constraints

The following assumptions and constraints are relevant to this design:

*   **Reliable Network:** The design assumes a reasonably reliable and low-latency network connection between Cortex components for optimal performance.
*   **Scalable Backend Storage:** The design relies on the scalability, availability, and durability of the chosen object storage and key-value store backends.
*   **Prometheus Compatibility:** Maintaining compatibility with the Prometheus data model and remote write/read protocols is a core design principle.
*   **Stateless Components (Mostly):** Most Cortex components are designed to be stateless, facilitating horizontal scaling and resilience. Ingesters have some state in memory before flushing.
*   **Configuration Complexity:**  Deploying and managing a distributed system like Cortex can be complex and requires careful configuration.

## 10. Future Considerations

Potential future enhancements and considerations for Cortex include:

*   **Improved Query Performance:** Exploring further optimizations for query execution, especially for complex queries over large datasets.
