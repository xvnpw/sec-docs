**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application via Cortex (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker and serves as the root of all potential attack paths.

* **Exploit Ingester Weaknesses (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This path focuses on compromising the components responsible for receiving and initially storing time series data. Successful exploitation here can lead to data manipulation, denial of service, or further compromise of the system.

* **Exploit Ingester API Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This specific attack step targets vulnerabilities within the Ingester's API. Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to bypass normal security controls and directly interact with the Ingester in unintended ways.

* **Gain Code Execution on Ingester Node (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This is the critical outcome of exploiting API vulnerabilities in the Ingester. Achieving code execution grants the attacker full control over the Ingester node, allowing them to manipulate data, disrupt services, or use the node as a pivot point for further attacks.

* **Exploit Query Frontend Weaknesses (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This path focuses on compromising the component that acts as the gateway for PromQL queries. Exploiting weaknesses here can lead to unauthorized data access, resource exhaustion, or further system compromise.

* **Exploit Query Frontend API Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This specific attack step targets vulnerabilities within the Query Frontend's API. Successful exploitation can bypass security controls and allow direct, unauthorized interaction with the query processing mechanism.

* **Gain Code Execution on Query Frontend Node (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This is the critical outcome of exploiting API vulnerabilities in the Query Frontend. Achieving code execution grants the attacker full control over the Query Frontend node, allowing them to intercept or manipulate queries, exfiltrate data, or disrupt query services.

* **Exploit Querier API Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This specific attack step targets vulnerabilities within the Querier's API. Successful exploitation can bypass security controls and allow direct, unauthorized interaction with the data retrieval and processing components.

* **Gain Code Execution on Querier Node (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This is the critical outcome of exploiting API vulnerabilities in the Querier. Achieving code execution grants the attacker full control over the Querier node, allowing them to access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive time series data or disrupt query processing.

* **Exploit Store Gateway Weaknesses (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This path focuses on compromising the component responsible for accessing long-term storage. Exploiting weaknesses here can lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of historical time series data.

* **Exploit Store Gateway API Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This specific attack step targets vulnerabilities within the Store Gateway's API. Successful exploitation can bypass security controls and allow direct, unauthorized interaction with the storage access mechanisms.

* **Gain Code Execution on Store Gateway Node (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This is the critical outcome of exploiting API vulnerabilities in the Store Gateway. Achieving code execution grants the attacker full control over the Store Gateway node, allowing them to directly manipulate or exfiltrate data from the underlying storage.

* **Exploit Compactor API Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This specific attack step targets vulnerabilities within the Compactor's API. Successful exploitation can bypass security controls and allow direct, unauthorized interaction with the data compaction process.

* **Gain Code Execution on Compactor Node (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This is the critical outcome of exploiting API vulnerabilities in the Compactor. Achieving code execution grants the attacker full control over the Compactor node, potentially leading to data corruption or disruption of the compaction process.

* **Exploit Ruler Weaknesses (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This path focuses on compromising the component responsible for evaluating alerting and recording rules. Exploiting weaknesses here can lead to the injection of malicious rules, suppression of real alerts, or resource exhaustion.

* **Exploit Ruler API Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This specific attack step targets vulnerabilities within the Ruler's API. Successful exploitation can bypass security controls and allow direct, unauthorized interaction with the rule management and evaluation mechanisms.

* **Gain Code Execution on Ruler Node (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This is the critical outcome of exploiting API vulnerabilities in the Ruler. Achieving code execution grants the attacker full control over the Ruler node, allowing them to manipulate alerting rules, disable monitoring, or use the node for further attacks.

* **Exploit Configuration Weaknesses (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities related to how Cortex is configured. This can involve stealing credentials or leveraging misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access.

* **Credential Theft (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This specific attack step involves gaining unauthorized access to sensitive credentials used by Cortex, such as API keys, database passwords, or internal authentication tokens.

* **Gain Access to Internal Cortex Components or Underlying Infrastructure (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This is the critical outcome of successful credential theft. With stolen credentials, an attacker can gain access to other Cortex components or the underlying infrastructure where Cortex is deployed, leading to a broader compromise.

* **Exploit Dependencies (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This path focuses on exploiting known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries and services that Cortex relies on.

* **Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries or Services (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This specific attack step highlights the risk posed by publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in dependencies like Go libraries, gRPC, or Prometheus client libraries.

* **Gain Code Execution on Cortex Components (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This is the critical outcome of exploiting vulnerabilities in Cortex's dependencies. Successful exploitation can grant the attacker code execution on various Cortex components, depending on the vulnerable dependency, leading to significant compromise.
