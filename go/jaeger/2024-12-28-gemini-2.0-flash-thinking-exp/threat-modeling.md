### High and Critical Jaeger-Specific Threats

Here's a list of high and critical threats that directly involve Jaeger components:

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Span Data
    *   **Description:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information inadvertently included in span tags or logs. This could happen through unauthorized access to the Jaeger Query UI.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data like API keys, user credentials, internal system details, or business logic. This could lead to further attacks, data breaches, or compliance violations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Jaeger Client Library, Jaeger Collector, Jaeger Query.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict data sanitization practices within the application code before adding tags to spans.
        *   Regularly review span data to identify and remove any inadvertently included sensitive information.
        *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization for accessing the Jaeger Query UI.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) on Jaeger Agent
    *   **Description:** An attacker could flood the Jaeger agent with a large volume of spans from compromised clients or by directly sending forged spans. This could overwhelm the agent's resources and prevent it from processing legitimate spans.
    *   **Impact:** Jaeger agent becomes unresponsive, leading to dropped spans and incomplete tracing data. This can hinder monitoring and troubleshooting efforts.
    *   **Affected Component:** Jaeger Agent.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on the Jaeger agent to restrict the number of spans it accepts per unit of time.
        *   Deploy the Jaeger agent behind a firewall or network load balancer to filter malicious traffic.
        *   Monitor the agent's resource usage and configure alerts for unusual activity.

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Agent-Collector Communication)
    *   **Description:** If communication between the Jaeger agent and collector is not properly secured (e.g., not using TLS), an attacker could intercept and potentially modify spans in transit.
    *   **Impact:** Tampered tracing data, potentially leading to incorrect analysis and information disclosure if sensitive data is present in spans.
    *   **Affected Component:** Network communication between Jaeger Agent and Jaeger Collector.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS encryption for communication between the Jaeger agent and collector.
        *   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication between these components.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) on Jaeger Collector
    *   **Description:** An attacker could flood the collector with a large volume of spans from compromised agents or by directly sending forged spans. This could overwhelm the collector's resources and prevent it from processing legitimate spans.
    *   **Impact:** Jaeger collector becomes unresponsive, leading to dropped spans and incomplete tracing data. This can severely impact the tracing system's functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** Jaeger Collector.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on the Jaeger collector to restrict the number of spans it accepts per unit of time.
        *   Deploy the Jaeger collector behind a firewall or network load balancer.
        *   Monitor the collector's resource usage and configure alerts for unusual activity.
        *   Implement proper resource allocation and scaling for the collector.

*   **Threat:** Injection Attacks (Data Storage via Collector)
    *   **Description:** If the collector doesn't properly sanitize span data before storing it, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code or commands into the underlying data storage (e.g., NoSQL injection).
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access to the data storage, or denial of service on the data storage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Jaeger Collector.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the Jaeger collector before storing span data.

*   **Threat:** Authentication and Authorization Bypass (Jaeger Query)
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Jaeger Query UI could allow unauthorized users to access or modify tracing data without proper authentication or authorization.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive tracing information and potential manipulation of tracing data, leading to incorrect analysis or masking of malicious activity.
    *   **Affected Component:** Jaeger Query.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the Jaeger Query UI.
        *   Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to specific traces or data based on user roles.
        *   Regularly update the Jaeger Query component to patch known vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure (Trace Data via Jaeger Query)
    *   **Description:** Insufficient access controls on the Jaeger Query UI could allow users to view traces they are not authorized to see, potentially exposing sensitive application behavior or business logic.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive application behavior, performance characteristics, and potentially business logic.
    *   **Affected Component:** Jaeger Query.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement granular access controls on the Jaeger Query UI based on user roles and permissions.
        *   Consider filtering or masking sensitive data within the UI based on user authorization.

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Jaeger Query)
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Jaeger Query UI could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts that are executed in the browsers of other users when they view tracing data.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, redirection to malicious websites, or other malicious actions performed in the context of the victim's browser.
    *   **Affected Component:** Jaeger Query.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement proper input validation and output encoding in the Jaeger Query UI to prevent XSS attacks.
        *   Regularly scan the Jaeger Query UI for XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Educate users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links or content within the UI.
