Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve Bubble Tea and are classified as high or critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface: Malicious Input via Custom `tea.Msg` Types**
    *   **Description:** The application receives and processes custom message types (`tea.Msg`) that carry data. If this data is not validated or sanitized, attackers can inject malicious payloads.
    *   **How Bubble Tea Contributes:** Bubble Tea's core mechanism for handling events and state updates relies on passing these messages to the `Update` function. It provides the framework for this communication but doesn't enforce data validation.
    *   **Example:** An application receives a `ChatMessageMsg` with a `Text` field. An attacker sends a message where `Text` contains terminal escape sequences (e.g., to clear the screen or change text color unexpectedly) or data intended to exploit a vulnerability in how the application processes chat messages.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unexpected application behavior.
        *   Terminal manipulation, potentially misleading the user.
        *   Data corruption or injection into the application state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust validation for all data received within custom `tea.Msg` types in the `Update` function.
        *   **Sanitization:** Sanitize data to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or sequences before using it.
        *   **Type Checking:** Ensure the received message is of the expected type and structure.

*   **Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in Custom Bubble Tea Components**
    *   **Description:** If the application uses custom-built or third-party Bubble Tea components (models, commands, views), vulnerabilities within those components can introduce attack vectors.
    *   **How Bubble Tea Contributes:** Bubble Tea's modular nature allows for the creation and integration of custom components, extending its functionality. However, the security of these components is the responsibility of their developers.
    *   **Example:** A custom widget for displaying data from an external source might not properly sanitize the data, leading to terminal escape sequence injection or other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Any of the impacts listed above for other attack surfaces, depending on the vulnerability in the custom component.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be High or Critical depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review the code of custom components for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Security Audits:** Conduct security audits of custom components, especially if they handle sensitive data or external input.
        *   **Use Trusted Components:** If using third-party components, choose reputable and well-maintained libraries.
        *   **Isolate Components:** Design the application to minimize the impact of a vulnerability in a single component.
