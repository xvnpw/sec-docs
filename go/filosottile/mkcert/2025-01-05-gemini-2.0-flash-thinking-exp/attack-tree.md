## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via mkcert Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_mkcert_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker, highlighting the successful compromise of the application through vulnerabilities related to mkcert.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Trust in Locally Generated Certificates [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_trust_in_locally_generated_certificates__high_risk_path_.md)

* This path focuses on undermining the trust established by mkcert, allowing attackers to introduce malicious certificates that the application will accept.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Root CA Authority [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_root_ca_authority__critical_node_.md)

* The root CA is the foundation of trust. If compromised, attackers can generate valid certificates for any domain.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Root CA Private Key [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/access_root_ca_private_key__high_risk_path_.md)

* Gaining direct access to the root CA's private key allows attackers to sign arbitrary certificates.
    * Exploit File System Permissions: Weak permissions on the root CA key file allow unauthorized access.
        * Gain Local System Access [CRITICAL NODE]: Achieving local system access is often a prerequisite for exploiting file system permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Replace Legitimate Root CA [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/replace_legitimate_root_ca__high_risk_path_.md)

* Replacing the legitimate root CA with a malicious one allows attackers to control the trusted certificate authority.
    * Exploit File System Permissions: Requires write access to the root CA file location.
        * Gain Local System Access [CRITICAL NODE]: Often necessary to gain the required file system permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Generate Maliciously Signed Certificates](./attack_tree_paths/generate_maliciously_signed_certificates.md)

* This path explores methods of creating malicious certificates that the application might trust.
    * Use Compromised Root CA [HIGH RISK PATH]:  If the root CA is compromised, generating malicious certificates is straightforward.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Mismanagement of Generated Certificates [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mismanagement_of_generated_certificates__high_risk_path_.md)

* This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from improper handling and storage of generated certificates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Private Key Exposure [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/private_key_exposure__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

* Exposure of private keys allows attackers to impersonate the application and decrypt communication.
    * Insecure Storage of Private Keys [HIGH RISK PATH]: Storing private keys in easily accessible locations without proper protection.
        * Exploit File System Permissions: Weak permissions on directories containing private keys.
            * Gain Local System Access [CRITICAL NODE]: Facilitates exploitation of file system permissions.
    * Accidental Committing to Version Control [HIGH RISK PATH]:  Mistakenly including private keys in version control repositories.
