# Threat Model Analysis for filosottile/mkcert

## Threat: [Compromised Local Certificate Authority (CA)](./threats/compromised_local_certificate_authority__ca_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the private key of the locally trusted CA created by `mkcert`. This could happen through malware on a developer's machine exploiting vulnerabilities in how `mkcert` stores the key, or through insecure default permissions. The attacker can then generate valid-looking certificates for any domain *because they have compromised the core output of `mkcert`*.

**Impact:** The attacker can perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against developers or even internal systems by presenting these forged certificates. This allows them to intercept sensitive data, modify communications, or inject malicious content.

**Affected Component:** The locally generated Certificate Authority (CA) and its associated private key, a core component managed by `mkcert`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure `mkcert` is installed from trusted sources to avoid tampered versions.
* Implement strong security measures on developer machines to prevent malware that could target `mkcert`'s storage.
* Review and restrict access to the `mkcert` CA directory using file system permissions, ensuring `mkcert` itself sets appropriate permissions.
* Consider using disk encryption on developer machines to protect the CA key at rest, mitigating the impact of machine compromise on `mkcert`'s data.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of CA Certificate and Keys on Developer Machines](./threats/insecure_storage_of_ca_certificate_and_keys_on_developer_machines.md)

**Description:** The locally trusted CA certificate and private key generated by `mkcert` are stored on individual developer machines. If `mkcert` defaults to insecure storage locations or permissions, or if developers are not aware of the sensitivity of these files managed by `mkcert`, an attacker gaining physical or remote access could steal these sensitive files.

**Impact:** If the CA private key (generated and managed by `mkcert`) is compromised, the attacker can generate trusted certificates for any domain, leading to the same impacts as a compromised local CA (MITM attacks).

**Affected Component:** The locally generated Certificate Authority (CA) and its associated private key files, specifically the storage and permissions handled (or not handled securely) by `mkcert`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure `mkcert` is configured to store the CA and keys in a secure location with restricted permissions.
* Educate developers on the importance of securing their machines and the sensitivity of the files generated by `mkcert`.
* Implement full disk encryption on developer machines to protect `mkcert`'s sensitive data at rest.
* Avoid modifying default `mkcert` storage locations without understanding the security implications.

## Threat: [Compromised `mkcert` Binary](./threats/compromised__mkcert__binary.md)

**Description:** The `mkcert` binary itself could be compromised, either through a supply chain attack affecting the distribution of `mkcert`, or by downloading a malicious version. A compromised binary could generate backdoored certificates *through its intended functionality* or perform other malicious actions during the certificate generation process.

**Impact:**  Potentially widespread compromise of development environments, as developers would be generating and using malicious certificates *due to the compromised tool*. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or the introduction of vulnerabilities into the application.

**Affected Component:** The `mkcert` binary and the certificate generation process it directly controls.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Download `mkcert` from trusted and official sources (e.g., the GitHub repository releases).
* Verify the integrity of the downloaded binary using checksums or signatures provided by the `mkcert` developers.
* Keep the `mkcert` installation up-to-date to benefit from security patches released by the `mkcert` maintainers.
* Consider using package managers with security scanning capabilities to manage the installation and updates of `mkcert`.
