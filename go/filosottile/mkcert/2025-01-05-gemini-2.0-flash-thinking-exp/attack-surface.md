# Attack Surface Analysis for filosottile/mkcert

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Root CA Certificate](./attack_surfaces/compromised_root_ca_certificate.md)

**Description:** The private key of the root Certificate Authority (CA) generated by `mkcert` is compromised, allowing an attacker to forge trusted certificates for any domain.

**How mkcert Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `mkcert` generates this root CA certificate and its private key. The security of this key is paramount.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the machine where `mkcert` was run and retrieves the root CA's private key. They can then create a valid-looking certificate for `yourbank.com` and use it to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Impact:**  Complete trust compromise. Attackers can impersonate any website or service, leading to data theft, credential harvesting, and other severe security breaches.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure Storage:** Store the root CA private key securely. Limit access to the directory where `mkcert` stores it (typically the user's local certificate authority directory).
* **System Security:** Ensure the development machine where `mkcert` is run is secure and free from malware.
* **Key Rotation (Advanced):** While not a primary use case for `mkcert`, consider periodically regenerating the root CA and re-issuing development certificates if the development environment has a high-risk profile.
* **Avoid Sharing:** Do not share the root CA certificate or private key outside of the intended development team or environment.

## Attack Surface: [Root CA Installation on System Trust Stores](./attack_surfaces/root_ca_installation_on_system_trust_stores.md)

**Description:** `mkcert` installs its generated root CA certificate into the operating system's trusted root certificate store, making it trusted by all applications on that system.

**How mkcert Contributes to the Attack Surface:** This is a core function of `mkcert` to enable local trust for development certificates.

**Example:** A developer's machine with the `mkcert` root CA installed is compromised. An attacker can now generate malicious certificates that the compromised machine will inherently trust, potentially bypassing security measures.

**Impact:**  System-wide trust compromise on the developer's machine. Malicious applications or websites signed by the `mkcert` CA will be trusted.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Isolated Development Environments:** Use virtual machines, containers, or dedicated development machines to isolate the impact of the `mkcert` CA installation.
* **Removal After Use:** Consider removing the `mkcert` root CA from the system trust store when it's no longer needed for a specific project or after development is complete (`mkcert -uninstall`).
* **Awareness and Training:** Educate developers about the implications of installing custom root CAs and the importance of system security.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Generated Server Certificate Keys](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_generated_server_certificate_keys.md)

**Description:** The private keys for the individual server certificates generated by `mkcert` are exposed or stored insecurely.

**How mkcert Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `mkcert` generates these key pairs and stores them locally.

**Example:** A developer accidentally commits the private key for their development server to a public Git repository. An attacker can then use this key to impersonate the development server.

**Impact:**  Allows attackers to impersonate the specific development service, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or manipulation of development data.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure Key Storage:** Store the generated server certificate keys securely. Avoid storing them in version control systems.
* **`.gitignore`:** Ensure `.gitignore` files are configured correctly to prevent accidental inclusion of private key files.
* **Access Control:** Limit access to the directories where the certificate keys are stored.
* **Temporary Certificates:** Consider generating certificates only when needed and deleting them afterwards in highly sensitive development scenarios.

## Attack Surface: [Accidental Installation of Root CA on Production Systems](./attack_surfaces/accidental_installation_of_root_ca_on_production_systems.md)

**Description:** A developer mistakenly runs `mkcert -install` on a production server, installing the development root CA into the production system's trust store.

**How mkcert Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `mkcert` makes the installation process relatively easy, which can lead to accidental execution in unintended environments.

**Example:** A developer, intending to troubleshoot a local development issue, accidentally runs `mkcert -install` on a production server. This makes the development CA trusted in production.

**Impact:**  Severe security vulnerability in production. Anyone with the development CA's private key can now create trusted certificates for the production domain, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks against real users.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict Environment Separation:** Enforce strict separation between development and production environments.
* **Configuration Management:** Use configuration management tools to manage trusted certificates on production systems, preventing manual installation of development CAs.
* **Process Controls:** Implement clear procedures and checklists for deployments and system administration to prevent accidental execution of development commands on production systems.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure developers have only the necessary permissions on production systems.
