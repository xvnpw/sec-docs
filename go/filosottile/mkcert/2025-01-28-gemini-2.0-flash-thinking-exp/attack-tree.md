## Attack Tree Path: [1. Supply Chain Attack on mkcert Distribution [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__supply_chain_attack_on_mkcert_distribution__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises the `mkcert` project's distribution channels. This could involve:
    *   Compromising the GitHub repository where `mkcert` source code is hosted.
    *   Compromising the release process used to build and distribute `mkcert` binaries.
    *   Compromising any infrastructure involved in hosting or delivering `mkcert` binaries.
*   **Impact:** If successful, the attacker can inject malicious code into the `mkcert` binary. Users downloading and installing this compromised binary would unknowingly install malware.
*   **Criticality:** This is a critical node because it has the potential for widespread impact, affecting all users who download the compromised version of `mkcert`.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Malicious mkcert binary installs attacker-controlled root CA [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__malicious_mkcert_binary_installs_attacker-controlled_root_ca__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the direct consequence of a successful Supply Chain Attack. The malicious `mkcert` binary, when executed, would install an attacker-controlled root Certificate Authority (CA) into the user's system trust store.
*   **Impact:** Once the attacker's root CA is trusted, they can generate valid-looking certificates for any domain. This allows them to perform Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks against any HTTPS connection from the user's machine, including connections to the application being developed. They can also create phishing websites that appear to be trusted locally.
*   **Criticality:** This is a critical node because it represents the point where the attacker gains the ability to intercept and manipulate secure communications.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Man-in-the-Middle Attack during `mkcert -install` [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Network Interception]](./attack_tree_paths/3__man-in-the-middle_attack_during__mkcert_-install___high_risk_path___critical_node_-_network_inter_baff5ae9.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker positions themselves on the same network as a developer during the `mkcert -install` process. They then perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to intercept network traffic. Specifically, they target the download of the root CA certificate that `mkcert` attempts to download during installation.
    *   **Network Interception [CRITICAL NODE - Network Interception]:** The attacker uses techniques like ARP poisoning, DNS spoofing, or exploits a compromised network infrastructure to intercept network traffic between the developer's machine and the internet.
*   **Impact:** The attacker replaces the legitimate root CA certificate with their own attacker-controlled root CA certificate. The developer unknowingly installs this malicious root CA.
*   **Criticality:** This is a high-risk path because it directly leads to the user trusting a malicious root CA. Network Interception is a critical node within this path as it's the key action enabling the attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. User unknowingly installs attacker's root CA [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__user_unknowingly_installs_attacker's_root_ca__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the outcome of either a Supply Chain Attack or a MITM attack during installation. The user, without realizing it, has added an attacker-controlled root CA to their trusted root certificate store.
*   **Impact:**  As with the "Malicious mkcert binary installs attacker-controlled root CA" node, the attacker can now perform MITM attacks on any HTTPS connection from the user's machine and create locally trusted phishing sites.
*   **Criticality:** This is a critical node because it signifies the successful compromise of the user's trust store, enabling a wide range of attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Misuse/Misconfiguration of mkcert by Developers [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__misusemisconfiguration_of_mkcert_by_developers__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Developers, due to lack of awareness or misjudgment, misuse or misconfigure `mkcert` in ways that create security vulnerabilities. This path encompasses several sub-vectors:
    *   **Accidental Deployment of mkcert-Generated Certificates to Production [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Production Deployment of mkcert Certs]:** Developers mistakenly use `mkcert`-generated certificates in a production environment instead of proper certificates from a public Certificate Authority. This can happen through:
        *   Copying development certificates to production servers.
        *   Using automated scripts or configurations that inadvertently deploy `mkcert` certificates to production.
    *   **Lack of Developer Awareness/Training [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Developer Misunderstanding]:** Developers are not adequately trained on the security implications of `mkcert` and certificate management in general. This lack of understanding leads to misconfigurations and misuse.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Production Deployment of mkcert Certs [CRITICAL NODE - Production Deployment of mkcert Certs]](./attack_tree_paths/6__production_deployment_of_mkcert_certs__critical_node_-_production_deployment_of_mkcert_certs_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is a specific instance of developer misuse where `mkcert`-generated certificates are deployed to a production environment.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Private key exposure if production server is compromised [CRITICAL NODE - Private Key Exposure]:**  `mkcert` generates private keys locally. If these keys are deployed to production and the production server is compromised, the private keys are exposed.
    *   Lack of proper certificate management and revocation in production. `mkcert` certificates are not designed for production and lack the robust management features of certificates from public CAs.
    *   Potential browser warnings for end-users if they access the production application, as `mkcert` root CA is not trusted by default browsers. (Though, this is less of a security vulnerability and more of a usability issue in this context).
*   **Criticality:** This is a critical node because it directly leads to private key exposure in production, a severe security breach. Production Deployment of `mkcert` Certs is the critical action that triggers this.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Private Key Exposure [CRITICAL NODE - Private Key Exposure]](./attack_tree_paths/7__private_key_exposure__critical_node_-_private_key_exposure_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  This is the ultimate consequence of deploying `mkcert` certificates to production and the production server being compromised. The private keys associated with the `mkcert` certificates are exposed to the attacker.
*   **Impact:** With the private keys, the attacker can:
    *   Impersonate the application.
    *   Decrypt past communications if they were recorded.
    *   Potentially compromise other systems or applications if the same keys are reused (key reuse is a bad practice, but possible).
*   **Criticality:** This is a critical node because private key exposure is a fundamental security compromise, allowing for significant damage and unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Developer Misunderstanding [CRITICAL NODE - Developer Misunderstanding]](./attack_tree_paths/8__developer_misunderstanding__critical_node_-_developer_misunderstanding_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  This is a root cause, not a direct attack step. It refers to developers lacking sufficient understanding of the security implications of using `mkcert`, certificate management, and PKI concepts.
*   **Impact:** Developer misunderstanding increases the likelihood of all misuse and misconfiguration scenarios, especially accidental production deployment and overly permissive certificate generation.
*   **Criticality:** This is a critical node because it's a foundational issue. Addressing developer awareness and training is essential to prevent a wide range of security problems related to `mkcert` and certificate management.
