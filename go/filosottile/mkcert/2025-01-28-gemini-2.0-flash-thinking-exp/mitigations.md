# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for filosottile/mkcert

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to the Root CA Private Key](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to_the_root_ca_private_key.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify the Root CA Key Location:** Determine the default location where `mkcert` stores the Root CA and private key (typically within the user's home directory, e.g., `~/.local/share/mkcert` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/mkcert` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\mkcert` on Windows).
    2.  **Apply File System Permissions:** Use operating system-level file permissions to restrict read and write access to the Root CA directory and its contents.
        *   On Linux/macOS: Use `chmod 700 ~/.local/share/mkcert` (or equivalent path) to grant read, write, and execute permissions only to the owner (the developer user).
        *   On Windows: Use NTFS permissions to grant "Full Control" only to the developer user account and remove permissions for other users and groups.
    3.  **Avoid Sharing the Key:**  Explicitly instruct developers to never share the Root CA private key through any means (email, chat, version control, shared drives, etc.).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Root CA Private Key Compromise (High Severity) - If the private key is compromised, attackers can issue trusted certificates for any domain, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks, phishing, and code signing attacks.
*   **Impact:** High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access and misuse of the Root CA private key.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - File system permissions are generally left at default by developers, but awareness is raised during onboarding.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Enforce file system permission checks via automated scripts during developer environment setup.  Lack of automated checks to detect accidental sharing of the key.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Certificate Generation](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_certificate_generation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Developers Requiring mkcert:** Determine which developers genuinely need to generate local HTTPS certificates for their development tasks.
    2.  **Restrict mkcert Installation:** Only install `mkcert` on the machines of developers who have a documented need for it. Avoid a blanket installation across all development machines.
    3.  **Control Installation Process:**  Implement a controlled process for `mkcert` installation, potentially requiring approval or using a centralized software deployment system.
    4.  **Regularly Review Access:** Periodically review the list of developers with `mkcert` installed and revoke access for those who no longer require it (e.g., developers changing roles or projects).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Increased Attack Surface (Medium Severity) -  Wider distribution of `mkcert` increases the number of potential endpoints where the Root CA private key could be vulnerable if a developer machine is compromised.
    *   **Threat:** Accidental Misuse (Low Severity) - Reduces the chance of developers unintentionally using `mkcert` for purposes outside of local development if they don't have it installed.
*   **Impact:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the overall attack surface and potential for misuse by limiting the distribution of `mkcert`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented -  Onboarding documentation recommends installing `mkcert` only when needed, but no strict enforcement.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement a software inventory system to track `mkcert` installations and enforce an approval process for new installations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Short Certificate Validity Periods](./mitigation_strategies/short_certificate_validity_periods.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Script Certificate Generation:** Create scripts or wrappers around `mkcert` to automate certificate generation.
    2.  **Implement Validity Period Logic:** Modify these scripts to generate certificates with shorter validity periods than the default (e.g., 30 days, 90 days).  While `mkcert` doesn't directly support validity period flags, you can achieve this by scripting certificate regeneration.
    3.  **Automate Certificate Renewal Reminders:** Implement reminders or automated processes to prompt developers to regenerate certificates before they expire.
    4.  **Document Renewal Process:** Clearly document the certificate renewal process for developers.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Prolonged Exposure of Compromised Certificate (Medium Severity) - If a certificate is compromised (e.g., through a developer machine compromise), shorter validity periods limit the time window during which the compromised certificate can be misused.
*   **Impact:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the impact of a certificate compromise by limiting its lifespan.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No Implementation - Certificates are generated with default long validity periods.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Develop and deploy scripts for certificate generation with shorter validity periods. Implement automated renewal reminders.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Clearly Define Certificate Scope and Purpose](./mitigation_strategies/clearly_define_certificate_scope_and_purpose.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Document Approved Usage:** Create clear and concise documentation that explicitly states that `mkcert` certificates are ONLY for local development and testing.
    2.  **Prohibit Production Usage:**  Explicitly state that `mkcert` certificates MUST NOT be used in production, staging, or any publicly accessible environments.
    3.  **Onboarding and Training:**  Incorporate this scope definition into developer onboarding materials.
    4.  **Code Comments and Reminders:**  Include comments in relevant code sections (e.g., configuration files, deployment scripts) reminding developers about the restricted scope of `mkcert` certificates.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Accidental Production Usage (High Severity) - Prevents developers from mistakenly deploying `mkcert` certificates to production, which would lead to browser trust issues and potential security warnings for users.
    *   **Threat:** Misunderstanding of mkcert's Role (Low Severity) - Clarifies the intended use of `mkcert` and prevents developers from misusing it as a general-purpose certificate authority.
*   **Impact:** Medium Risk Reduction - Primarily reduces the risk of accidental misconfiguration and misuse due to lack of clarity.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - Scope is mentioned in onboarding documentation, but not consistently reinforced in code or automated checks.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Add explicit warnings in code templates and deployment scripts. Implement automated checks to detect `mkcert` certificate usage in non-development environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Automated Checks to Prevent Production Usage](./mitigation_strategies/automated_checks_to_prevent_production_usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify mkcert Certificate Characteristics:** Determine unique characteristics of `mkcert`-generated certificates (e.g., issuer name in the certificate, file path conventions).
    2.  **Implement Pipeline Checks:** Integrate automated checks into the CI/CD pipeline and deployment processes.
    3.  **Certificate File Path Checks:**  In deployment scripts, verify that certificate file paths are configured to point to trusted CA certificates and not local `mkcert` paths.
    4.  **Certificate Content Inspection:**  Implement scripts to inspect certificate files being deployed and check for `mkcert` issuer names or other identifying characteristics.
    5.  **Fail Deployment on Detection:** Configure the automated checks to fail the deployment process if `mkcert`-like certificates are detected in production configurations.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Accidental Production Usage (High Severity) -  Provides a strong technical control to prevent the deployment of `mkcert` certificates to production environments.
*   **Impact:** High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of accidental production deployment of inappropriate certificates.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No Implementation - No automated checks are currently in place to prevent production usage of `mkcert` certificates.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Develop and integrate automated checks into the CI/CD pipeline and deployment scripts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Clear Documentation and Guidelines](./mitigation_strategies/clear_documentation_and_guidelines.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create Dedicated Documentation:** Develop a specific document or section in the development guidelines dedicated to `mkcert` usage.
    2.  **Document Best Practices:**  Clearly document all the recommended mitigation strategies and best practices for using `mkcert` securely.
    3.  **Provide Step-by-Step Instructions:**  Include step-by-step instructions for generating, using, and managing `mkcert` certificates.
    4.  **Include Warnings and Prohibitions:**  Explicitly include warnings against production usage and emphasize the importance of securing the Root CA private key.
    5.  **Removal Instructions:**  Provide clear instructions on how to remove the `mkcert` Root CA from the system trust store when it's no longer needed.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Misconfiguration due to Lack of Knowledge (Medium Severity) - Provides developers with the necessary information to use `mkcert` correctly and securely, reducing misconfigurations.
    *   **Threat:** Inconsistent Practices (Low Severity) -  Ensures consistent and standardized usage of `mkcert` across the development team.
*   **Impact:** Medium Risk Reduction - Improves consistency and reduces errors due to lack of information and clear guidelines.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented -  Some documentation exists, but it's not comprehensive and lacks detailed guidelines on all mitigation strategies.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Create a dedicated and comprehensive `mkcert` usage guide, incorporating all best practices and mitigation strategies.
