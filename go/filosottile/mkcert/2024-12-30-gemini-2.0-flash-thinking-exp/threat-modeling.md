* **Threat:** Compromised mkcert CA Private Key
    * **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the private key of the root Certificate Authority (CA) *generated by `mkcert`*. This could happen through insecure storage on the system where `mkcert` was used, or potentially through exploiting a vulnerability in `mkcert` itself (though less likely). The attacker can then generate trusted certificates for any domain, effectively impersonating legitimate services.
    * **Impact:** Complete loss of trust in locally generated certificates. An attacker can perform man-in-the-middle attacks, intercept sensitive data, and potentially gain unauthorized access to systems by presenting forged, yet trusted, certificates.
    * **Affected Component:** The root CA private key file generated by `mkcert`.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Restrict file system permissions on the CA private key file to only necessary users.
        * Store the CA private key securely, even in development environments. Consider using dedicated secrets management tools.
        * Avoid committing the CA private key to version control systems.
        * Regularly review and potentially rotate the CA (though less common in typical `mkcert` usage).
        * Ensure the system where `mkcert` is run is secure.

* **Threat:** Accidental Deployment of Development Certificates to Production
    * **Description:** Developers mistakenly deploy certificates *generated by `mkcert`* to a production environment. These certificates are inherently less trusted than publicly signed certificates and are intended for local development.
    * **Impact:** Users will encounter browser warnings and trust errors, damaging the application's reputation and potentially preventing access.
    * **Affected Component:** The generated certificate files for specific domains.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement clear separation between development and production certificate management processes.
        * Automate certificate generation and deployment for production using a trusted Certificate Authority (e.g., Let's Encrypt).
        * Implement checks and alerts to prevent the deployment of `mkcert` certificates to production environments.

* **Threat:** Insecure Storage of Generated Certificates and Keys
    * **Description:** Certificates and their corresponding private keys *generated by `mkcert`* are stored in insecure locations with overly permissive access rights on the development machine. An attacker gaining access to the development environment could easily retrieve these keys.
    * **Impact:** An attacker can impersonate the application or services for which the certificates were generated, potentially intercepting traffic or gaining unauthorized access.
    * **Affected Component:** The generated certificate and private key files for specific domains.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Restrict file system permissions for certificate and key files to only necessary users.
        * Avoid storing certificates and keys in publicly accessible locations within the development environment.
        * Consider using secure storage mechanisms, even in development, if sensitive data is involved.

* **Threat:** Exposure of Development Certificates in Version Control
    * **Description:** Developers accidentally commit certificates and their private keys *generated by `mkcert`* to version control systems. This directly exposes the sensitive keys.
    * **Impact:** Anyone with access to the repository can obtain the private keys and impersonate the application or services.
    * **Affected Component:** The generated certificate and private key files.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement `.gitignore` rules to exclude certificate and key files.
        * Utilize tools that can scan repositories for accidentally committed secrets and implement pre-commit hooks to prevent such commits.
