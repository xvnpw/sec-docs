# Threat Model Analysis for filosottile/mkcert

## Threat: [Compromise of Root CA Private Key](./threats/compromise_of_root_ca_private_key.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `rootCA-key.pem` file generated by `mkcert`. This could happen through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in the developer's machine, social engineering, or insider threats. Once compromised, the attacker can generate valid-looking certificates for any domain.

**Impact:** Allows the attacker to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against development instances of the application or other services. They can intercept and potentially modify communication, steal credentials, or inject malicious content, all while appearing to have a valid certificate.

**Affected Component:** The core functionality of `mkcert` responsible for generating and storing the root CA key (`mkcert` CLI, file system storage of `rootCA.pem` and `rootCA-key.pem`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict file system permissions on the directory where `mkcert` stores the root CA key.
*   Avoid storing the root CA key in version control systems.
*   Consider using a dedicated, isolated environment (e.g., a virtual machine or container) for generating `mkcert` certificates.
*   Regularly review and potentially regenerate the root CA key (though this requires redistributing the root CA certificate to trusted stores).

## Threat: [Accidental Inclusion of Development Certificates in Production](./threats/accidental_inclusion_of_development_certificates_in_production.md)

**Description:** Developers might mistakenly include certificates and private keys generated by `mkcert` in the final production deployment package. This could happen due to improper build processes, lack of awareness, or inadequate separation of development and production configurations.

**Impact:** If the development certificate's private key is included in production, an attacker could use it to impersonate the application in a live environment, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and reputational damage. Since `mkcert` certificates are not issued by trusted public CAs, users might also encounter browser warnings, eroding trust.

**Affected Component:** The build and deployment process of the application, specifically the inclusion of files from the `mkcert` output directory.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict build and deployment pipelines that explicitly exclude development-specific files and directories.
*   Utilize `.gitignore` or similar mechanisms to prevent accidental commit of `mkcert` generated files.
*   Automate the process of generating and managing production certificates using trusted Certificate Authorities.
*   Conduct regular security audits of deployment packages to ensure no development artifacts are included.
