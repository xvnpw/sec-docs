# Attack Surface Analysis for ory/kratos

## Attack Surface: [Brute-Force Attacks on Public API Endpoints (Login, Registration)](./attack_surfaces/brute-force_attacks_on_public_api_endpoints__login__registration_.md)

**Description:** Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access by trying numerous username/password combinations or repeatedly creating accounts.

**How Kratos Contributes:** Kratos exposes public endpoints for login and registration, making them targets for brute-force attempts.

**Example:** An attacker uses automated tools to try thousands of password combinations against a known username on the `/self-service/login/api` endpoint.

**Impact:** Account compromise, denial of service due to resource exhaustion.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on login and registration endpoints within Kratos configuration.
* Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed attempts.
* Consider using CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms to prevent automated attacks.
* Monitor login attempts for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Account Takeover via Password Reset Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/account_takeover_via_password_reset_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the password reset flow to gain control of user accounts without knowing the original password.

**How Kratos Contributes:** Kratos manages the password reset process through its recovery flow and API endpoints. Insecure configuration or implementation can introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An attacker intercepts a password reset link and uses it to set a new password for the victim's account. Or, the password reset token is predictable and can be guessed.

**Impact:** Complete account compromise, access to sensitive user data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure password reset tokens are sufficiently long, random, and unpredictable.
* Implement strict validation of the email address during the reset process.
* Use time-limited password reset tokens.
* Implement email verification before allowing password resets.
* Consider using magic links for passwordless recovery as an alternative.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Admin API Access](./attack_surfaces/insecure_admin_api_access.md)

**Description:** Unauthorized access to Kratos's admin API allows attackers to manage identities, configurations, and potentially compromise the entire system.

**How Kratos Contributes:** Kratos provides a powerful admin API that, if not properly secured, becomes a major attack vector.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the admin API through leaked credentials or by exploiting a vulnerability in the authentication mechanism. They then create a new administrator account or modify existing user roles.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, data breaches, service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the admin API with strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, mutual TLS).
* Restrict access to the admin API to authorized personnel and IP addresses.
* Regularly rotate admin API keys.
* Implement robust authorization policies for admin API endpoints.
* Monitor admin API activity for suspicious behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Kratos UI (if used)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_kratos_ui__if_used_.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into the Kratos-provided user interface, which are then executed in the browsers of other users.

**How Kratos Contributes:** If using Kratos's default UI or extending it, vulnerabilities in the templates or code can allow for XSS attacks.

**Example:** An attacker injects a malicious script into a profile field that is then displayed on other users' profile pages, stealing their session cookies.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, credential theft, redirection to malicious sites.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement proper output encoding and sanitization in Kratos UI templates.
* Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
* Regularly update Kratos to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Webhook Configuration and Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_webhook_configuration_and_handling.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how webhooks are configured or how the receiving application handles webhook data.

**How Kratos Contributes:** Kratos allows configuring webhooks to trigger events in external systems. Insecure configuration or lack of verification can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker registers a malicious webhook URL that intercepts sensitive user data sent by Kratos. Or, the receiving application doesn't properly validate the webhook signature, allowing forged requests.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to integrated systems, potential for remote code execution on the receiving end.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for webhook delivery (e.g., using shared secrets and signature verification).
* Ensure the receiving application properly validates the webhook signature.
* Use HTTPS for webhook communication to protect data in transit.
* Carefully review and restrict the URLs allowed for webhook registration.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Session Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_session_management.md)

**Description:** Weaknesses in how Kratos manages user sessions can lead to session hijacking or fixation attacks.

**How Kratos Contributes:** Kratos handles session creation, storage, and invalidation. Misconfiguration can introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:**  Session cookies are not marked as `HttpOnly` or `Secure`, allowing JavaScript access or transmission over insecure connections.

**Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure Kratos to use secure session cookies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`).
* Implement proper session invalidation on logout and after periods of inactivity.
* Consider using short session lifetimes and requiring re-authentication.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration of OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect Flows (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_of_oauth_2_0__openid_connect_flows__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configured OAuth 2.0 or OIDC flows can lead to authorization bypasses or information leaks.

**How Kratos Contributes:** Kratos can act as an OAuth 2.0 authorization server or OpenID Connect provider. Misconfiguration of clients, scopes, or grants can introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:**  A client is configured with a weak or default client secret, allowing an attacker to impersonate the client. Or, overly permissive scopes grant access to more resources than intended.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully configure OAuth 2.0 clients with strong and securely stored client secrets.
* Define and enforce the principle of least privilege when configuring OAuth 2.0 scopes.
* Implement proper redirect URI validation to prevent authorization code interception.
* Regularly review and audit OAuth 2.0 client configurations.
