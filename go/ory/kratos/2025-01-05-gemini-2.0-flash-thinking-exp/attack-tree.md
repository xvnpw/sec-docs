## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force (Kratos API Rate Limiting Weakness)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_credential_stuffingbrute-force__kratos_api_rate_limiting_weakness_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage lists of compromised username/password pairs (credential stuffing) or systematically try different passwords (brute-force) against the Kratos login endpoint.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit insufficient rate limiting on login endpoint:**  If Kratos is not configured with strong rate limiting on its login endpoint, attackers can make a large number of login attempts in a short period, significantly increasing the likelihood of success in credential stuffing or brute-force attacks.
*   **Impact:** Successful login allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Password Reset Abuse](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_password_reset_abuse.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the password reset flow to gain control of a user's account without knowing the current password.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit flaws in password reset flow (e.g., token reuse, predictable tokens, lack of email verification):**  Vulnerabilities such as allowing the reuse of password reset tokens, generating predictable tokens, or failing to properly verify the user's email address before allowing a password reset can be exploited to bypass security measures and reset a victim's password.
*   **Impact:** Successful password reset allows the attacker to log in as the victim, leading to full account takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Information Disclosure via API](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_information_disclosure_via_api.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the Kratos Admin or Public APIs to access sensitive user data that should be protected.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit insufficiently protected Kratos Admin or Public API endpoints to retrieve sensitive user data:** If API endpoints are not properly secured with authentication and authorization mechanisms, attackers can bypass these controls and directly request and receive sensitive information about users.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data can lead to privacy breaches, identity theft, and other harmful consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Session Token Exposure](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_session_token_exposure.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers steal valid session tokens, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users without needing their credentials.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit vulnerabilities in how the application handles Kratos session tokens (e.g., insecure storage, transmission over HTTP):** If the application stores session tokens insecurely (e.g., in local storage without encryption), transmits them over unencrypted HTTP, or exposes them through other vulnerabilities, attackers can intercept or retrieve these tokens.
*   **Impact:** Stolen session tokens allow for immediate and complete account takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Account Takeover via Recovery Code Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_account_takeover_via_recovery_code_manipulation.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate the account recovery process, often by exploiting weaknesses in how recovery codes are generated, delivered, or validated, to gain access to an account.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit vulnerabilities in the generation, delivery, or validation of recovery codes:**  If recovery codes are predictable, sent insecurely, or if the validation process is flawed, attackers can potentially generate valid recovery codes for a target account and use them to gain access.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to account takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Gain Unauthorized Access to Admin API](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_gain_unauthorized_access_to_admin_api.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers bypass authentication and authorization controls to gain access to the powerful Kratos Admin API.
*   **Critical Node: Weak Authentication/Authorization:** Using default or easily guessable credentials for the Admin API, or having overly permissive access controls, allows attackers to gain entry easily.
*   **Critical Node: API Key Compromise:** If the API keys used to authenticate with the Admin API are leaked, stolen, or guessed, attackers can use them to gain access.
*   **Critical Node: Exploiting Network Exposure:** If the Admin API is accessible from untrusted networks due to misconfiguration, attackers can directly access it.
*   **Impact:**  Gaining access to the Admin API provides extensive control over Kratos and its identities.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Manipulate Identity Data via Admin API](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_identity_data_via_admin_api.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Once authenticated to the Admin API, attackers can directly create, modify, or delete user identities.
*   **Critical Node: Create, modify, or delete user identities to gain unauthorized access or disrupt the application:**  Attackers can create new administrative accounts, elevate their own privileges, modify existing accounts to gain access, or delete accounts to cause disruption.
*   **Impact:**  Can lead to account takeover, privilege escalation, and denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Modify Kratos Configuration via Admin API](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_modify_kratos_configuration_via_admin_api.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Attackers with Admin API access can alter Kratos's configuration settings.
*   **Critical Node: Alter Kratos settings to introduce vulnerabilities or bypass security measures:** Attackers can weaken security settings, disable features, or introduce new vulnerabilities through configuration changes.
*   **Impact:** This can have a wide-ranging impact, potentially weakening the entire security posture of the application and creating new attack vectors.
