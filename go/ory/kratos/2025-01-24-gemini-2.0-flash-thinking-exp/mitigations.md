# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ory/kratos

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Rate Limiting using Kratos's Built-in Features](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_rate_limiting_using_kratos's_built-in_features.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Configure Kratos's Rate Limiter:** Utilize Kratos's built-in rate limiting middleware, configured within the `courier.throttling` section of the `kratos.yml` configuration file.
2.  **Define Rate Limits in `kratos.yml`:** Set specific rate limits for critical endpoints like `/self-service/login/flows`, `/self-service/registration/flows`, `/self-service/recovery/flows`, and `/self-service/verification/flows` within the `kratos.yml` file. Define limits based on requests per IP address or user identifier within a defined time window (e.g., using `limit` and `burst` settings).
3.  **Integrate with External Rate Limiting (Optional):** If needed for more advanced or distributed rate limiting, configure Kratos to integrate with external rate limiting services like Redis by adjusting the `courier.throttling.strategy` and related settings in `kratos.yml`.
4.  **Monitor Rate Limiting Metrics:** Utilize Kratos's metrics endpoints (e.g., Prometheus) to monitor rate limiting effectiveness and adjust configurations as needed.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity): Attackers attempting to guess user credentials through repeated login attempts against Kratos endpoints.
*   Credential Stuffing Attacks (High Severity): Attackers using lists of compromised credentials against Kratos login endpoints.
*   Denial of Service (DoS) on Authentication Service (Medium Severity): Overwhelming the Kratos service with authentication-related requests.

**Impact:**
*   Brute-Force Attacks: High - Significantly reduces the effectiveness of brute-force attacks targeting Kratos authentication flows.
*   Credential Stuffing Attacks: High - Makes credential stuffing attacks against Kratos much less efficient and detectable.
*   Denial of Service (DoS) on Authentication Service: Medium - Mitigates DoS attempts focused on Kratos authentication endpoints.

**Currently Implemented:** Implemented in Kratos configuration file `kratos.yml` using the `courier.throttling` settings. Redis integration for distributed rate limiting is configured.

**Missing Implementation:**  Consider implementing dynamic rate limiting rules within Kratos based on request context or user behavior. Explore leveraging Kratos's metrics to trigger alerts on rate limiting thresholds being exceeded.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Password Reset Flow by Utilizing Kratos's Recovery Features](./mitigation_strategies/secure_password_reset_flow_by_utilizing_kratos's_recovery_features.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Configure Recovery Flows in Kratos:**  Utilize Kratos's built-in recovery flows, configured in `kratos.yml` under the `selfservice.recovery` section.
2.  **Customize Recovery Methods:** Configure enabled recovery methods (e.g., `code` via email or SMS) in `kratos.yml`. Ensure email or SMS providers are securely configured within Kratos's `courier` settings.
3.  **Token Expiration Settings:** Adjust token expiration times for recovery codes within `kratos.yml` (`selfservice.recovery.code.lifespan`) to ensure short validity periods.
4.  **Rate Limit Recovery Requests:** Kratos's rate limiting (as described above) should also apply to recovery initiation endpoints. Ensure rate limits are appropriately configured for `/self-service/recovery/methods/code/flows`.
5.  **Customize Recovery UI:** If using Kratos's UI, customize the recovery UI to avoid account existence disclosure. Ensure generic error messages are displayed regardless of whether an account exists for a given email.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Account Takeover via Password Reset Vulnerabilities (High Severity): Attackers exploiting weaknesses in Kratos's password reset process.
*   Account Enumeration (Medium Severity): Attackers attempting to discover valid usernames or email addresses by observing Kratos's password reset behavior.
*   Brute-Force Attacks on Password Reset Tokens (Medium Severity): Attackers trying to guess Kratos-generated password reset tokens.

**Impact:**
*   Account Takeover via Password Reset Vulnerabilities: High - Significantly reduces the risk of account takeover by leveraging Kratos's secure recovery flows.
*   Account Enumeration: Medium - Makes account enumeration attempts through Kratos recovery flows more difficult.
*   Brute-Force Attacks on Password Reset Tokens: Medium - Reduces the likelihood of successful brute-forcing of Kratos reset tokens due to short lifespans and secure generation.

**Currently Implemented:** Kratos recovery flows are enabled and configured in `kratos.yml` using email-based recovery. Token expiration is set. Rate limiting is applied to recovery endpoints.

**Missing Implementation:**  Consider adding SMS-based recovery as an alternative method within Kratos configuration. Review and customize the default recovery UI to further minimize account existence disclosure.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Secure Session Management by Configuring Kratos's Cookie Settings](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_secure_session_management_by_configuring_kratos's_cookie_settings.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Configure Cookie Flags in `kratos.yml`:**  Within the `session.cookie` section of `kratos.yml`, explicitly set `http_only: true` and `secure: true` to ensure session cookies are protected against client-side JavaScript access and transmitted only over HTTPS.
2.  **Session Expiration and Inactivity Timeout in `kratos.yml`:** Configure `session.lifespan` and `session.idle_lifespan` in `kratos.yml` to set appropriate session expiration times and inactivity timeouts. Shorter durations reduce the window for session hijacking.
3.  **Session Identifier Rotation (Review Kratos Documentation):**  Consult Kratos documentation for session identifier rotation configuration. If available, enable session ID rotation after login and during sensitive actions within Kratos's session management settings.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Session Hijacking (High Severity): Attackers stealing or intercepting Kratos session IDs.
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) based Session Theft (High Severity): Attackers using XSS to steal Kratos session cookies if `HttpOnly` is not set.
*   Session Fixation Attacks (Medium Severity): Attackers attempting session fixation attacks against Kratos sessions.

**Impact:**
*   Session Hijacking: High - Significantly reduces session hijacking risk by securing Kratos session cookies and limiting session lifespan.
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) based Session Theft: High - Prevents JavaScript-based theft of Kratos session cookies by enforcing `HttpOnly`.
*   Session Fixation Attacks: Medium - Reduces session fixation risk, especially if session ID rotation is implemented within Kratos.

**Currently Implemented:** `http_only: true` and `secure: true` are configured in `kratos.yml`. Session lifespan and idle lifespan are set.

**Missing Implementation:**  Session identifier rotation needs to be explicitly reviewed and configured within Kratos if supported by the current version.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Kratos's Schema Validation for API Requests](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_kratos's_schema_validation_for_api_requests.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define Schemas for Kratos APIs:** Leverage Kratos's schema validation capabilities, which are defined in OpenAPI specifications and used internally by Kratos.
2.  **Validate Input Data Against Schemas:** Ensure that when interacting with Kratos APIs (e.g., using the Kratos client libraries or directly making HTTP requests), input data is validated against the expected schemas before sending requests to Kratos.
3.  **Handle Validation Errors:** Properly handle validation errors returned by Kratos APIs. Implement error handling logic to inform users of invalid input and prevent unexpected behavior.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity): Prevents certain types of XSS by ensuring data conforms to expected formats and types, reducing the likelihood of injecting malicious scripts through API parameters.
*   SQL Injection (Medium Severity): Reduces the risk of SQL injection by validating input data types and formats, although Kratos itself primarily uses ORM/database abstraction.
*   API Abuse and Unexpected Behavior (Medium Severity): Prevents API abuse and unexpected application behavior caused by invalid or malformed input data sent to Kratos APIs.

**Impact:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Medium - Provides a layer of defense against certain XSS vectors by validating API inputs.
*   SQL Injection: Medium - Reduces SQL injection risk indirectly through input validation at the API level.
*   API Abuse and Unexpected Behavior: Medium - Improves API robustness and prevents issues caused by invalid input.

**Currently Implemented:** Kratos internally uses schema validation for its APIs. Client-side validation is partially implemented in the frontend application.

**Missing Implementation:**  Need to ensure consistent client-side validation against Kratos API schemas across all application components interacting with Kratos. Consider implementing server-side validation in application backend services interacting with Kratos APIs for defense-in-depth.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Kratos Configuration Secrets using a Dedicated Secret Management Solution](./mitigation_strategies/secure_kratos_configuration_secrets_using_a_dedicated_secret_management_solution.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Kratos Secrets in `kratos.yml`:** Review `kratos.yml` and identify all sensitive configuration parameters, including database connection strings (`dsn`), SMTP credentials (`courier.smtp`), encryption keys (`secrets.cookie_same_site`, `secrets.cipher`, `secrets.default`), and any API keys for integrated services.
2.  **Externalize Secrets:**  Instead of directly embedding secrets in `kratos.yml` or environment variables, configure Kratos to retrieve secrets from a dedicated secret management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager).
3.  **Configure Kratos to Use Secret Management:**  Adapt Kratos's configuration to use environment variables or configuration mechanisms that allow referencing secrets stored in the chosen secret management solution. Consult Kratos documentation for specific configuration options related to secret management.
4.  **Implement Access Control for Secrets:**  Ensure strict access control policies are implemented within the secret management solution, granting access to Kratos and authorized services only.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Exposure of Sensitive Kratos Secrets (High Severity): Accidental or intentional exposure of Kratos configuration secrets.
*   Unauthorized Access to Kratos Infrastructure (High Severity): Compromised Kratos secrets (like database credentials) leading to unauthorized access to the Kratos database or backend systems.
*   Data Breaches (High Severity): Compromised Kratos encryption keys potentially leading to decryption of sensitive data managed by Kratos.

**Impact:**
*   Exposure of Sensitive Kratos Secrets: High - Significantly reduces the risk of exposing Kratos configuration secrets.
*   Unauthorized Access to Kratos Infrastructure: High - Limits the impact of compromised systems by preventing easily accessible hardcoded secrets.
*   Data Breaches: High - Protects data managed by Kratos by securing encryption keys.

**Currently Implemented:** Database credentials for Kratos are currently stored as environment variables.

**Missing Implementation:**  Migrate all sensitive Kratos configuration secrets from environment variables to a dedicated secret management solution. Configure Kratos to retrieve secrets from the chosen solution. Implement access control policies for the secret management system.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Webhook Verification for Kratos Events (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_webhook_verification_for_kratos_events__if_applicable_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Configure Webhooks in Kratos (If Used):** If using Kratos webhooks (configured in `webhooks` section of `kratos.yml`), ensure webhooks are configured to send signed payloads.
2.  **Verify Webhook Signatures:** In the webhook receiver application, implement robust signature verification for all incoming webhook requests from Kratos. Use the configured webhook signing secret to verify the signature and ensure the webhook originates from Kratos and has not been tampered with in transit.
3.  **Use HTTPS for Webhook Endpoints:** Ensure webhook receiver endpoints are exposed over HTTPS to protect webhook data in transit.
4.  **Implement Access Control for Webhook Endpoints:** Protect webhook receiver endpoints with appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and abuse.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Webhook Forgery (High Severity): Attackers sending forged webhooks to the webhook receiver application, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data manipulation.
*   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Webhooks (Medium Severity): Attackers intercepting webhook communication if HTTPS is not used, potentially gaining access to sensitive data.
*   Webhook Endpoint Abuse (Medium Severity): Attackers abusing publicly accessible webhook endpoints if not properly secured.

**Impact:**
*   Webhook Forgery: High - Prevents webhook forgery by ensuring signature verification is enforced.
*   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Webhooks: Medium - Protects webhook data in transit by enforcing HTTPS.
*   Webhook Endpoint Abuse: Medium - Reduces the risk of webhook endpoint abuse through access control and signature verification.

**Currently Implemented:** Webhooks are not currently actively used in the project.

**Missing Implementation:** If webhooks are planned for future use, implement webhook signature verification in the webhook receiver application. Configure webhook signing in Kratos and ensure HTTPS is used for webhook endpoints.
