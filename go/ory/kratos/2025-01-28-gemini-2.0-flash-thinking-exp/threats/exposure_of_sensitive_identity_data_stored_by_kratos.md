### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the threat of **unauthorized access to the Kratos database and subsequent exposure of sensitive identity data**. The scope includes:

*   **Kratos Database Layer:**  Analysis of the database systems (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) used by Kratos for storing identity data. This includes database configuration, access controls, encryption at rest, and logging mechanisms.
*   **Data Storage Mechanisms:** Examination of how sensitive data is stored within the database, including data structures, potential vulnerabilities in data handling, and encryption implementations.
*   **Access Control to Database:**  Evaluation of the access control mechanisms in place to protect the database from unauthorized access, both from within the application environment and from external sources.
*   **Relevant Mitigation Strategies:**  Detailed examination and expansion of the mitigation strategies listed in the threat description, as well as identification of additional relevant security measures.

**Out of Scope:**

*   **Application Logic Vulnerabilities in Kratos:** This analysis does not cover vulnerabilities within the Kratos application code itself (e.g., authentication bypass, authorization flaws in APIs), unless they directly contribute to database access.
*   **Network-Level Attacks (excluding database access):**  General network attacks like DDoS or Man-in-the-Middle attacks are not directly within scope unless they are a precursor to database compromise.
*   **Social Engineering Attacks:**  Attacks targeting users directly to obtain credentials or information are not the primary focus, although the impact of data exposure could be exacerbated by such attacks.
*   **Compliance and Legal Aspects (in detail):** While data breach implications related to privacy violations are considered, a detailed legal and compliance analysis (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) is outside the scope.

#### 4.1. Threat Description Breakdown

*   **Threat Agent:**  The threat agent can be categorized as:
    *   **External Attackers:**  Malicious actors outside the organization seeking to gain unauthorized access for financial gain, espionage, or disruption. They may target publicly exposed database ports or exploit vulnerabilities in related systems to pivot to the database.
    *   **Malicious Insiders:**  Individuals with legitimate access to the internal network or systems who intentionally misuse their privileges to access and exfiltrate sensitive data. This could include disgruntled employees, contractors, or compromised internal accounts.
    *   **Accidental Insiders:**  Unintentional data exposure due to misconfiguration, weak security practices, or human error. While not malicious, the impact can be the same.
    *   **Opportunistic Attackers:**  Attackers who may not specifically target Kratos but exploit publicly known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations they discover during broad scans.

*   **Attack Vectors:** Potential attack vectors leading to database access include:
    *   **Direct Database Access Exploitation:**
        *   **SQL Injection:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in applications interacting with the database (potentially Kratos itself or related services) to execute malicious SQL queries and bypass access controls.
        *   **Database Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the database software (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) if not properly patched and updated.
        *   **Default Credentials/Weak Passwords:**  Using default database credentials or easily guessable passwords for database accounts.
        *   **Exposed Database Ports:**  Accidentally or intentionally exposing database ports directly to the internet without proper firewall protection.
    *   **Indirect Access via Compromised Systems:**
        *   **Compromised Application Server:**  Gaining access to the server hosting the Kratos application and then pivoting to the database server using stored credentials or network access.
        *   **Compromised Infrastructure Components:**  Compromising other systems within the network (e.g., monitoring systems, backup servers) that may have access to database credentials or network access to the database server.
        *   **Credential Stuffing/Password Spraying:**  Using compromised credentials from other breaches to attempt to log in to database management interfaces or related systems.
    *   **Insider Threat (Malicious or Accidental):**
        *   **Unauthorized Access by Internal Users:**  Employees or contractors with excessive database access privileges intentionally or accidentally accessing and exfiltrating data.
        *   **Misconfiguration of Access Controls:**  Incorrectly configured database access controls allowing broader access than intended.

*   **Vulnerabilities:**  Underlying vulnerabilities that could be exploited include:
    *   **Weak Database Access Controls:**
        *   Insufficiently restrictive firewall rules allowing unauthorized network access to the database.

        *   Lack of strong authentication mechanisms for database access (e.g., relying solely on passwords, not using multi-factor authentication for critical database accounts).
    *   **Lack of Encryption at Rest:**  Sensitive data stored in the database is not encrypted, making it easily readable if access is gained.
    *   **Insufficient Database Hardening:**
        *   Using default database configurations that are less secure.
        *   Disabling or not properly configuring security features provided by the database system.

    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Implement the principle of least privilege for database access. Grant users and applications only the minimum necessary permissions required for their functions.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Utilize RBAC to manage database access based on roles and responsibilities.
    *   **Strong Authentication:**
        *   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong password policies for all database accounts (minimum length, complexity, regular rotation).
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for all administrative and privileged database access.
        *   **Key-Based Authentication:**  Consider using key-based authentication instead of passwords for application access to the database where feasible.
    *   **Regular Access Reviews:**  Conduct regular reviews of database access permissions to identify and remove unnecessary privileges.

*   **Encrypt Sensitive Data at Rest in the Database:**
    *   **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE):**  Enable TDE provided by the database system (e.g., PostgreSQL TDE, MySQL TDE) to encrypt data at rest, including data files, log files, and backups.
    *   **Application-Level Encryption:**  Consider application-level encryption for highly sensitive data fields before storing them in the database. However, manage key management complexities carefully.
    *   **Key Management:**  Implement a robust key management system to securely store, manage, and rotate encryption keys. Avoid storing keys directly within the application code or database.

*   **Regularly Patch and Update the Database System:**
    *   **Patch Management Process:**  Establish a robust patch management process for the database system and underlying operating system.
    *   **Timely Patching:**  Apply security patches and updates promptly to address known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regularly scan the database system for vulnerabilities using automated vulnerability scanners.

*   **Implement Robust Database Access Logging and Monitoring:**
    *   **Comprehensive Logging:**  Enable comprehensive database logging to capture all relevant events, including:
        *   Authentication attempts (successful and failed).
        *   Database connections and disconnections.
        *   Data access and modification operations (especially for sensitive tables).
        *   Administrative actions.
    *   **Centralized Logging:**  Centralize database logs in a secure logging system (SIEM) for analysis and correlation.
    *   **Real-time Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement real-time monitoring of database activity and configure alerts for suspicious events, such as:
        *   Failed login attempts.
        *   Unusual data access patterns.
        *   Privilege escalations.
        *   Database errors and anomalies.
    *   **Log Retention:**  Retain database logs for a sufficient period for security investigations and compliance requirements.

*   **Additional Recommendations:**
    *   **Database Hardening:**  Implement database hardening best practices, including:
        *   Disabling unnecessary database features and services.
