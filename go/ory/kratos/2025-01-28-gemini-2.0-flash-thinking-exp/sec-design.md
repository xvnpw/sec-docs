# BUSINESS POSTURE

Ory Kratos is an open-source identity and access management (IAM) solution designed to handle authentication and authorization for modern applications and APIs. The primary business priority for adopting Ory Kratos is to offload the complexity of identity management from application developers, allowing them to focus on core business logic. This leads to faster development cycles and reduced operational overhead related to user management. Another key business goal is to enhance the security posture of applications by leveraging a dedicated and well-vetted IAM solution instead of building custom authentication and authorization mechanisms. For businesses operating online services, a robust IAM system like Ory Kratos is crucial for user acquisition, retention, and overall trust.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:

- Risk of service disruption due to misconfiguration or security vulnerabilities in Ory Kratos, impacting user access and business operations.
- Risk of data breaches exposing sensitive user information managed by Ory Kratos, leading to reputational damage, legal liabilities, and loss of customer trust.
- Risk of unauthorized access to applications and resources if Ory Kratos is not properly secured, potentially leading to data theft, service manipulation, or financial losses.
- Risk of vendor lock-in if Ory Kratos becomes too tightly integrated with business processes, making future migrations or changes difficult and costly.
- Risk of compliance violations if Ory Kratos does not meet regulatory requirements related to data privacy and security (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:

- User authentication and authorization: Ensuring only authorized users can access applications and resources.
- User account management: Securely managing user identities, credentials, and profiles.
- Identity verification and recovery: Providing secure mechanisms for user verification and account recovery.
- Policy enforcement: Enforcing access control policies to protect sensitive data and functionalities.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

- User credentials (passwords, MFA secrets): Highly sensitive, requiring strong encryption and secure storage.
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (e.g., names, email addresses, phone numbers): Sensitive, requiring protection against unauthorized access and disclosure, compliance with data privacy regulations.
- Session tokens and access tokens: Sensitive, requiring secure generation, storage, and transmission to prevent session hijacking and unauthorized access.
- Authorization policies and rules: Sensitive, as misconfiguration can lead to unauthorized access or denial of service.
- Audit logs: Moderately sensitive, containing information about user activities and system events, important for security monitoring and incident investigation.
