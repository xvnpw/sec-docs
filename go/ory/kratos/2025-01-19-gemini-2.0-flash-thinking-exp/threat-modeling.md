# Threat Model Analysis for ory/kratos

## Threat: [Exploitation of Weak Password Reset Flow](./threats/exploitation_of_weak_password_reset_flow.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities *within Kratos's* password reset flow, such as predictable reset tokens, lack of rate limiting *in Kratos*, or insecure handling of reset requests, to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. They could initiate password resets for target accounts and intercept or guess the reset tokens *generated by Kratos*.

**Impact:** Account takeover, leading to access to sensitive user data and potential misuse of the application on behalf of the compromised user.

**Affected Component:** Self-service password reset flow module, specifically token generation and validation *within Kratos*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Kratos is updated to the latest version with security patches.
* Verify that strong, unpredictable reset tokens are generated *by Kratos*.
* Implement rate limiting on password reset requests *within Kratos configuration*.
* Use secure communication channels (HTTPS) for password reset links.
* Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an additional layer of security.

## Threat: [Session Hijacking due to Insecure Cookie Handling](./threats/session_hijacking_due_to_insecure_cookie_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker might intercept or steal Kratos session cookies if *Kratos* is not configured to handle them securely. This could happen through man-in-the-middle attacks on insecure network connections. Once the cookie is obtained, the attacker can impersonate the legitimate user.

**Impact:** Complete account takeover, allowing the attacker to perform any action the legitimate user can.

**Affected Component:** Session management module, specifically cookie handling *within Kratos*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that Kratos is configured to set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies.
* Enforce HTTPS for all communication between the application and Kratos.
* Consider using the `SameSite` attribute for cookies to mitigate CSRF attacks.

## Threat: [Abuse of Kratos Admin API due to Insufficient Access Control](./threats/abuse_of_kratos_admin_api_due_to_insufficient_access_control.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to the Kratos Admin API credentials or exploits vulnerabilities *in Kratos's* authentication/authorization mechanisms for the Admin API could perform administrative actions, such as creating, deleting, or modifying user accounts, changing configurations, or even shutting down the service.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the identity system, potentially leading to widespread account takeovers, data breaches, and service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Admin API module, authentication and authorization mechanisms *within Kratos*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Restrict access to the Kratos Admin API to only authorized services and personnel.
* Use strong, unique credentials for the Admin API.
* Implement network segmentation to isolate the Kratos Admin API.
* Regularly audit access to the Admin API.
* Consider using API keys with limited scopes for programmatic access.

## Threat: [Data Breach through Exposed Kratos Database Credentials](./threats/data_breach_through_exposed_kratos_database_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker might gain access to the credentials used by Kratos to connect to its database. This could happen through misconfigured environment variables *used by Kratos*, exposed configuration files *of Kratos*, or vulnerabilities in the infrastructure hosting Kratos. With these credentials, the attacker could directly access and exfiltrate sensitive user data *from Kratos's database*.

**Impact:**  Large-scale data breach, exposing personal information, credentials, and other sensitive data of all users managed by Kratos. This can lead to significant financial and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Database connection module, configuration management *within Kratos*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) to store database credentials *used by Kratos*.
* Avoid storing credentials directly in Kratos's configuration files or environment variables.
* Implement proper access controls on the Kratos database.
* Encrypt the Kratos database at rest.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through API Rate Limiting Issues](./threats/denial_of_service_through_api_rate_limiting_issues.md)

**Description:** An attacker might flood *Kratos's* public APIs with requests, overwhelming the service and making it unavailable for legitimate users. This could be targeted at authentication endpoints, registration endpoints, or other publicly accessible APIs *provided by Kratos*.

**Impact:** Inability for users to log in, register, or manage their accounts, leading to service disruption and potential business impact.

**Affected Component:** API Gateway, Rate Limiting mechanisms *within Kratos*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure appropriate rate limits for all Kratos APIs.
* Implement mechanisms to detect and block malicious traffic.
* Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect Kratos endpoints.
