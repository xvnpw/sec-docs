# Attack Surface Analysis for ory/kratos

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Kratos Admin UI Access](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_kratos_admin_ui_access.md)

*   **Description:** The administrative interface of Kratos, used for managing identities and configurations, is accessible without proper authentication or authorization.
    *   **How Kratos Contributes:** Kratos provides a dedicated admin UI. If not correctly configured with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms, it becomes a direct entry point for malicious actors.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers the publicly accessible Kratos admin UI endpoint and, due to default or weak credentials, gains access to create, modify, or delete user accounts, or alter critical configurations.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the identity management system, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts, data breaches, and potential disruption of the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the Kratos Admin UI with strong authentication (e.g., API keys, mutual TLS).
        *   Restrict access to the Admin UI to authorized personnel and networks only.
        *   Change default credentials immediately upon deployment.
        *   Regularly audit access logs for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitable Custom Flows](./attack_surfaces/exploitable_custom_flows.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities introduced through the implementation of custom login, registration, recovery, or settings flows within Kratos.
    *   **How Kratos Contributes:** Kratos offers flexibility through custom flows. If developers implement these flows without proper security considerations, they can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A developer creates a custom registration flow that doesn't properly sanitize user input, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. When another user views the profile of the maliciously registered user, the script executes.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this can lead to XSS, information disclosure, account takeover, or other security breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing custom flows.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs within custom flow logic.
        *   Implement proper authorization checks within custom flows to prevent unauthorized actions.
        *   Regularly review and test custom flow implementations for security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Webhook Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_webhook_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the way the application handles webhook events triggered by Kratos.
    *   **How Kratos Contributes:** Kratos can be configured to send webhooks on various identity-related events. If the receiving application doesn't properly verify the source and content of these webhooks, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious webhook payload mimicking a legitimate Kratos event (e.g., password change) and sends it to the application's webhook endpoint. If the application doesn't verify the signature, it might incorrectly update user data based on the malicious payload.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to data manipulation, unauthorized actions, or even Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if the webhook processing logic makes external requests based on the payload.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always verify the signature of incoming webhooks using the shared secret configured in Kratos.
        *   Carefully validate and sanitize data received in webhook payloads.
        *   Avoid making external requests based on unvalidated data from webhooks.
        *   Implement proper error handling and logging for webhook processing.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Session Management Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_session_management_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfiguration of Kratos's session management leading to vulnerabilities like session fixation or insecure cookie handling.
    *   **How Kratos Contributes:** Kratos handles session management. Incorrect configuration can weaken the security of user sessions.
    *   **Example:** Kratos is configured to use non-HTTP-only cookies. An attacker can exploit an XSS vulnerability in the application to access the session cookie and hijack the user's session.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users and perform actions on their behalf.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that session cookies are configured with the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.
        *   Implement proper session invalidation upon logout and password changes.
        *   Consider using short session lifetimes and implementing mechanisms for session renewal.
        *   Protect against session fixation attacks by regenerating session IDs upon login.
