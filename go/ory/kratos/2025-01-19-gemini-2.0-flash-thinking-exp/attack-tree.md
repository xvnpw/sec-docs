# Attack Tree Analysis for ory/kratos

Objective: Compromise application using Ory Kratos by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within Kratos itself (focusing on high-likelihood and high-impact scenarios).

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**Compromise Application via Kratos Exploitation** **(Critical Node)**
*   Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses **(Critical Node)**
    *   Bypass Authentication **(Critical Node, High-Risk Path)**
        *   Exploit Weak Password Reset Flow **(High-Risk Path)**
            *   Predict/Brute-force Reset Token
            *   Intercept Reset Link (e.g., insecure transport)
        *   Exploit Session Management Vulnerabilities **(High-Risk Path)**
            *   Session Fixation
            *   Session Hijacking
                *   Obtain Session Token
                    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on Application (to steal token)
                    *   Network Sniffing (if insecure transport)
        *   Bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) **(High-Risk Path)**
            *   Social Engineering to Obtain MFA Token
            *   Rely on Insecure Recovery Codes
    *   Elevate Privileges **(Critical Node, High-Risk Path)**
        *   Exploit Insecure Default Configurations
    *   Exploit Logic Flaws in Authorization Checks **(High-Risk Path)**
*   Exploit Data Exposure Vulnerabilities **(Critical Node, High-Risk Path)**
    *   Access Sensitive User Data via API
        *   Exploit Lack of Proper Authorization Checks on Kratos API
    *   Access Kratos Database Directly (Less Likely, but possible if misconfigured) **(High-Risk Path)**
        *   Exploit Database Credentials Leakage
*   Exploit Configuration or Deployment Issues **(Critical Node, High-Risk Path)**
    *   Insecure Default Configuration
    *   Exposed Admin Interface/API
    *   Insecure Communication Channels
*   Exploit Vulnerabilities in Kratos Dependencies **(High-Risk Path)**
