### High and Critical Ory Kratos Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve Ory Kratos:

* **Threat:** Exposure of Kratos Admin API
    * **Description:** An attacker discovers and accesses the Kratos Admin API endpoints, which are intended for administrative tasks. This could be due to misconfiguration, lack of proper network segmentation, or exposed ports. The attacker might attempt to create, modify, or delete user identities, change system settings, or extract sensitive information directly from Kratos.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the identity management system managed by Kratos, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential service disruption for all applications relying on Kratos.
    * **Affected Component:** `Admin API` (Kratos component)
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Restrict access to the Kratos Admin API to authorized networks and IP addresses only.
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization for the Kratos Admin API (e.g., API keys, mutual TLS).
        * Ensure the Kratos Admin API is not exposed to the public internet.
        * Regularly audit access controls for the Kratos Admin API.

* **Threat:** Exploiting Default or Weak Secrets in Kratos
    * **Description:** An attacker gains access to default or easily guessable secrets used by Kratos for encryption, signing, or database access. This could happen if the default values are not changed during deployment or if weak secrets are chosen for Kratos configuration. The attacker can then decrypt sensitive data stored by Kratos, forge signatures used by Kratos, or gain unauthorized access to the underlying Kratos database.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches of user information managed by Kratos, ability to impersonate users managed by Kratos, bypass security measures enforced by Kratos, and potentially gain full control over the Kratos instance.
    * **Affected Component:** `Configuration` (Kratos component), `Secrets Management` (Kratos component)
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Change all default secrets provided by Kratos during initial setup.
        * Use strong, randomly generated secrets for all sensitive Kratos configurations.
        * Securely store and manage Kratos secrets, avoiding hardcoding them in configuration files.
        * Regularly rotate Kratos secrets.

* **Threat:** Session Fixation in Kratos
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts a valid Kratos session identifier and tricks a legitimate user into using that session ID within the Kratos authentication flow. This can be done by sending a link with a pre-set session cookie intended for Kratos or by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application interacts with Kratos's session management. Once the user authenticates through Kratos, the attacker can use the fixed Kratos session ID to impersonate the user within the applications relying on Kratos for authentication.
    * **Impact:** Account takeover within applications using Kratos for authentication, unauthorized access to user data and application features protected by Kratos.
    * **Affected Component:** `Session Management` (Kratos component), `Public API (Login Flow)` (Kratos component)
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure Kratos is configured to regenerate the session identifier after successful authentication.
        * Ensure that Kratos session cookies have the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags set.
        * The integrating application should not directly manipulate Kratos session cookies in an insecure manner.

* **Threat:** Insecure Password Reset Flow in Kratos
    * **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Kratos password reset flow. This could involve bypassing email verification implemented by Kratos, predicting password reset tokens generated by Kratos, or exploiting rate limiting issues on Kratos's password reset endpoints to perform brute-force attacks on reset codes. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to change a user's password managed by Kratos and gain unauthorized access to their account across applications relying on Kratos.
    * **Impact:** Account takeover across applications using Kratos for authentication, unauthorized access to user data and application features.
    * **Affected Component:** `Identity Management` (Kratos component), `Public API (Recovery Flow)` (Kratos component)
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure Kratos is configured to use strong, unpredictable, and time-limited password reset tokens.
        * Ensure Kratos's email verification mechanisms are robust and cannot be easily bypassed.
        * Configure rate limiting on Kratos password reset requests to prevent brute-force attacks.
        * Consider using multi-factor authentication for password resets within Kratos.

* **Threat:** Insecure Communication with Kratos
    * **Description:** Communication between the application and the Kratos instance is not properly secured using HTTPS. An attacker on the network can intercept sensitive data transmitted between the application and Kratos, such as Kratos session cookies, authentication tokens issued by Kratos, or user credentials being passed to Kratos.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data managed by Kratos, potential for session hijacking of Kratos sessions, or theft of credentials used with Kratos.
    * **Affected Component:** `SDK` (when interacting with Kratos), `Public API` (Kratos component), `Admin API` (Kratos component)
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Always use HTTPS for all communication between the application and the Kratos instance.
        * Ensure TLS certificates for the Kratos instance are valid and properly configured.
        * Enforce HTTPS at the network level for traffic to and from the Kratos instance.
