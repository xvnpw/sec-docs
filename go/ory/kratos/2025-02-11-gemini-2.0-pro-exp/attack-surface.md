# Attack Surface Analysis for ory/kratos

## Attack Surface: [1. Misconfigured Identity Schema](./attack_surfaces/1__misconfigured_identity_schema.md)

*   **Description:**  The identity schema defines the structure and attributes of user identities.  Errors or overly permissive configurations in this schema can lead to significant vulnerabilities, directly within Kratos's core functionality.
*   **How Kratos Contributes:** Kratos's core functionality *relies* on the identity schema.  Its flexibility, while powerful, introduces the risk of misconfiguration *within Kratos itself*.
*   **Example:** A schema allows users to modify a `role` trait via a self-service profile update (managed by Kratos), without proper validation or authorization checks.  A user changes their `role` from "user" to "admin".
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data leakage, account takeover, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Schema Validation:** Use Kratos's built-in JSON Schema validation to enforce the structure and data types of the schema.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Design the schema with the principle of least privilege within Kratos.  Only allow users to modify traits that are absolutely necessary *through Kratos's interfaces*.
    *   **Access Control:** Implement strict access control on schema modification *within Kratos*.  Only authorized administrators should be able to change the schema through Kratos's administrative APIs.
    *   **Auditing:** Regularly audit the schema and its usage *within Kratos* to identify potential issues.  Log all schema changes made through Kratos.
    *   **Input Validation:** Even if a trait *is* modifiable through Kratos, validate all user-provided input to prevent malicious data.  Use Kratos's validation features.
    *   **Pre/Post Hooks:** Use Kratos's pre- and post-hooks for flows (like registration or profile update) to perform additional validation and authorization checks *within Kratos's execution context* before committing changes to the identity.

## Attack Surface: [2. Weak or Default Secrets (Specifically `secrets.cookie` and `secrets.cipher`)](./attack_surfaces/2__weak_or_default_secrets__specifically__secrets_cookie__and__secrets_cipher__.md)

*   **Description:** Kratos uses secrets for critical functions like encrypting cookies (`secrets.cookie`) and encrypting/decrypting data at rest (`secrets.cipher`). Weak, default, or exposed secrets directly compromise Kratos's security.
*   **How Kratos Contributes:** These secrets are *fundamental* to Kratos's operation and security model.  Kratos *uses* these secrets directly.
*   **Example:** The default `secrets.cookie` value is used in a production deployment.  An attacker finds this default value in the documentation and uses it to forge valid session cookies, hijacking user sessions *managed by Kratos*.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, data decryption (if `secrets.cipher` is compromised), impersonation of Kratos services.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Secrets:** Generate strong, random secrets using a cryptographically secure random number generator *before deploying Kratos*.
    *   **Secrets Management:** Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and manage these secrets *outside of Kratos's configuration files*.
    *   **Rotation:** Implement a process for regularly rotating these secrets, *updating Kratos's configuration accordingly*.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to inject secrets into the Kratos process, *avoiding hardcoding in Kratos's configuration*.
    *   **Configuration File Permissions:** If using configuration files, ensure they have strict permissions (read-only by the Kratos process) *to protect the secrets used by Kratos*.

## Attack Surface: [3. Brute-Force and Credential Stuffing Attacks (Against Kratos's Login Flow)](./attack_surfaces/3__brute-force_and_credential_stuffing_attacks__against_kratos's_login_flow_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess passwords or use lists of compromised credentials to gain access to accounts *through Kratos's login flow*.
*   **How Kratos Contributes:** Kratos's login flow is the *direct target* of these attacks.  The vulnerability lies in how Kratos handles authentication attempts.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a list of common passwords to try to log in to multiple accounts *via Kratos's /sessions/whoami or login API endpoints*.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement strict rate limiting on Kratos's login flow, based on IP address, user, or other factors, *using Kratos's built-in rate-limiting capabilities*.
    *   **CAPTCHA:** Use a CAPTCHA *integrated with Kratos's login flow* to distinguish between human users and automated bots.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  *Strongly recommended.*  Utilize Kratos's built-in MFA support to significantly reduce the risk.
    *   **Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements) *within Kratos's identity schema and validation rules*.
    *   **Account Lockout:** Lock accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts *using Kratos's account locking features*.  Be mindful of potential denial-of-service.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor Kratos's logs for patterns of failed login attempts.

## Attack Surface: [4. Unvalidated Webhooks (Sent *by* Kratos)](./attack_surfaces/4__unvalidated_webhooks__sent_by_kratos_.md)

*   **Description:** Kratos can send webhooks to external services.  If these webhooks are not properly validated *by the receiving service*, attackers can forge requests.  The vulnerability is in the *receiving* service, but Kratos is the *sender*.
*   **How Kratos Contributes:** Kratos *initiates* the webhook communication.  The lack of validation on the *receiving end* is the primary issue, but Kratos's configuration determines *what* is sent and *when*.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers the webhook URL for a post-registration hook (sent *by* Kratos) and sends a forged request to create a new administrator account in a connected system.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions in connected systems, data manipulation, potential for wider system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Signature Verification:**  *Crucially important.*  Configure Kratos to *sign* webhooks using a shared secret.  The receiving service *must* verify the signature. This is a Kratos configuration setting.
    *   **HTTPS:** Configure Kratos to use HTTPS for all webhook communication.
    *   **Input Validation:** While primarily the receiver's responsibility, consider what data Kratos is sending in the webhook.  Minimize sensitive data.

## Attack Surface: [5. Insecure Third-Party Integrations (Misconfigured *within* Kratos)](./attack_surfaces/5__insecure_third-party_integrations__misconfigured_within_kratos_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in third-party identity providers or misconfigurations in the integration *within Kratos* can compromise Kratos users.
*   **How Kratos Contributes:** Kratos's configuration for integrating with third-party providers (OIDC, Social Login) is the direct point of vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A misconfigured OAuth 2.0 flow with a social login provider, *due to incorrect settings within Kratos's configuration*, allows an attacker to obtain a valid access token.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, data leakage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Provider Selection:** Choose reputable providers. (Not directly a Kratos mitigation, but important context).
    *   **Configuration Review:** Carefully review and test the integration configuration *within Kratos*.  Follow the provider's and Kratos's documentation precisely.
    *   **Token Handling:** Ensure Kratos is configured to handle access tokens, refresh tokens, and ID tokens securely, according to best practices and Kratos's documentation.
    *   **Scope Limitation:** Request only the minimum necessary scopes (permissions) from the third-party provider *within Kratos's configuration*.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Kratos and any related integration libraries up-to-date.

## Attack Surface: [6. Outdated Kratos Version](./attack_surfaces/6__outdated_kratos_version.md)

*   **Description:** Running an outdated version of Kratos exposes the application to known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. This is *entirely* about the Kratos version.
*   **How Kratos Contributes:** This is *directly* related to the version of Kratos being used.  The vulnerability exists *within* Kratos itself.
*   **Example:** An older version of Kratos has a known vulnerability in its session management that allows for session hijacking. An attacker exploits this vulnerability *in Kratos*.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but can range from denial-of-service to remote code execution and complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Update Kratos to the latest stable version.
    *   **Security Advisories:** Subscribe to Kratos's security advisories.
    *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test updates before deploying.
    *   **Rollback Plan:** Have a plan to roll back.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Keep track of Kratos's dependencies.
