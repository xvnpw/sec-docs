## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Identity Schema Definition and Management](./mitigation_strategies/strict_identity_schema_definition_and_management.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Identity Schema Definition and Management

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Requirements:** Determine the *minimum* necessary user data (traits).
    2.  **Define Schema (JSON Schema):** Create a JSON Schema within Kratos, defining each trait with:
        *   `type`: (e.g., `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `array`, `object`)
        *   `format`: (e.g., `email`, `date-time`, `uri`)
        *   `minLength`, `maxLength`: For strings.
        *   `pattern`: Regular expressions for complex validation.
        *   `enum`: For limited sets of allowed values.
        *   `required`: Mark mandatory traits.
        *   `readOnly`: For traits not modifiable after creation.
    3.  **Implement Versioning (Kratos Feature):** Use Kratos's built-in schema versioning. Each schema change creates a new version.
    4.  **Create Migration Scripts:** Develop database migration scripts *integrated with Kratos's migration system* to handle schema changes, updating existing user data.
    5.  **Test Migrations:** Thoroughly test migration scripts in a staging environment, leveraging Kratos's testing tools.
    6.  **Regular Audits:** Schedule regular audits of the identity schema *within Kratos's configuration*.
    7.  **Automated Checks:** Integrate schema validation checks into the CI/CD pipeline, using Kratos's CLI or API to validate the schema before deployment.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive User Data (High Severity):** Well-defined schema limits data stored.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Strict validation prevents trait manipulation.
    *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):** Strong password policies and validation.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Schema validation ensures consistency.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Schema Manipulation (Low Severity):** Well-formed schemas prevent exploits.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive User Data:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Account Takeover:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **DoS via Schema Manipulation:** Risk minimized.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic schema defined in `identity.schema.json`.
    *   Password strength requirements (regex).
    *   Email format validation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Schema versioning and Kratos-integrated migration scripts.
    *   Regular schema audits within Kratos.
    *   Automated schema validation in CI/CD using Kratos tools.
    *   `readOnly` attributes.
    *   `enum` restrictions.
    *   Additional server-side validation *within Kratos hooks*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Flow Configuration and Kratos-Specific Features](./mitigation_strategies/secure_flow_configuration_and_kratos-specific_features.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Flow Configuration and Kratos-Specific Features

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Pre-Built Flows:** Start with Kratos's pre-built flows and customize carefully.
    2.  **Document Flow Logic:** Document the intended logic of each flow, including custom steps.
    3.  **Rate Limiting (Kratos Feature):** Configure Kratos's *built-in* rate limiting for *each* flow:
        *   Login attempts (per IP/user).
        *   Registration attempts.
        *   Password recovery requests.
        *   Email verification requests.
        *   Use Kratos's configuration options for rate limiting.
    4.  **Session Management (Kratos Configuration):** Configure secure session management *within Kratos*:
        *   **Session Duration:** Set appropriate timeouts in Kratos's configuration.
        *   **Cookie Attributes:** Use `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` attributes via Kratos's cookie settings.
        *   **Session Invalidation:** Ensure sessions are invalidated upon logout, password change, etc., using Kratos's hooks and events.
    5.  **Thorough Testing (Kratos-Focused):** Perform extensive testing of all flows, using Kratos's testing utilities and focusing on Kratos-specific features.
    6.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review the flow configurations (YAML/JSON) *within Kratos*.
    7. **Kratos Hooks:** Implement server-side input validation and other security checks using Kratos *hooks* (e.g., pre-registration, post-login). This allows for custom logic *within* Kratos's execution flow.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass (Critical Severity):** Secure configuration and testing.
    *   **Account Enumeration (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting and error handling.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):** Kratos's rate limiting.
    *   **Session Hijacking (High Severity):** Secure session management within Kratos.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Kratos's rate limiting.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Account Enumeration:** Risk mitigated.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Risk significantly reduced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leveraging Kratos's Built-in Security Features and Hooks](./mitigation_strategies/leveraging_kratos's_built-in_security_features_and_hooks.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy:**  Leveraging Kratos's Built-in Security Features and Hooks

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Explore Kratos Features:** Thoroughly review the Kratos documentation to identify all available security-related features and configuration options.
    2.  **Implement Hooks:** Use Kratos *hooks* (pre- and post-hooks for various flows) to implement custom security logic:
        *   **Pre-Registration Hook:**  Perform additional validation before an account is created (e.g., check against a blacklist, verify data with an external service).
        *   **Post-Login Hook:**  Implement custom actions after successful login (e.g., update last login timestamp, trigger notifications).
        *   **Pre-Recovery Hook:**  Add extra security checks before allowing password recovery (e.g., require additional verification steps).
    3.  **Use Kratos's API:**  Interact with Kratos programmatically using its API for tasks such as:
        *   User management (creating, updating, deleting users).
        *   Session management (retrieving, invalidating sessions).
        *   Identity verification.
        *   Ensure API interactions are authenticated and authorized appropriately.
    4. **Configure Kratos's built-in features:**
        *   **Self-Service Flows:** Carefully configure self-service flows (registration, login, recovery, settings) to balance usability and security.
        *   **Error Handling:** Customize error messages to avoid revealing sensitive information (e.g., don't distinguish between "invalid username" and "invalid password").
        *   **Notification System:** Use Kratos's notification system (if enabled) to send security-related notifications to users (e.g., password change notifications, suspicious login alerts).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass (Critical Severity):** Hooks and API usage allow for custom security checks.
    *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):**  Hooks can add extra verification steps.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Hooks can enforce custom validation rules.
    *   **Various Flow-Specific Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity):** Hooks and careful configuration of self-service flows mitigate risks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Risk reduced by custom security logic.
    *   **Account Takeover:** Risk reduced by additional verification.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Risk reduced by custom validation.
    *   **Flow-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Risk mitigated by tailored security measures.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic self-service flows are configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Kratos *hooks* are not used.
    *   The Kratos API is not used extensively for security-related tasks.
    *   Custom error handling is not fully implemented within Kratos.
    *   Kratos's notification system is not utilized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Kratos Update and Configuration Management](./mitigation_strategies/kratos_update_and_configuration_management.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy:**  Kratos Update and Configuration Management

* **Description:**
    1.  **Stay Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Kratos to the latest stable version using Kratos's recommended update procedures.
    2.  **Monitor Release Notes:** Carefully review Kratos release notes and security advisories for critical updates and vulnerability fixes.
    3.  **Automated Updates (with Testing):** Consider automating Kratos updates, but *always* test updates in a staging environment *before* deploying to production, using Kratos's testing framework.
    4.  **Configuration Management:** Treat Kratos's configuration (YAML or JSON) as code:
        *   Store the configuration in a version control system (e.g., Git).
        *   Use a CI/CD pipeline to deploy configuration changes.
        *   Validate the configuration before deployment using Kratos's CLI or API.
    5. **Regularly review Kratos configuration:** Check for deprecated settings, inefficient configurations, or potential security weaknesses.
