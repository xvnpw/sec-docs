*   Lack of Adoption:  If the project fails to gain traction, it may not be sustainable in the long term.
*   Compliance Violations:  Failure to comply with regulations like GDPR, CCPA, etc., could result in significant fines and penalties.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Secure Development Practices: The project's GitHub repository shows evidence of secure coding practices, including code reviews, static analysis (GoSec), and dependency management. Described in CONTRIBUTING.md and SECURITY.md.
*   security control: API-First Design: This inherently limits the attack surface compared to traditional monolithic architectures.
*   security control: Use of Go: Go is a memory-safe language, reducing the risk of common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.
*   security control: Containerization (Docker): This provides isolation and helps manage dependencies, reducing the risk of environment-specific vulnerabilities. Described in Dockerfile.
*   security control: Support for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Kratos supports various MFA methods, enhancing account security. Described in documentation.
*   security control: Password Hashing: Kratos uses strong password hashing algorithms (bcrypt) to protect user credentials. Described in documentation.
*   security control: Session Management: Kratos provides secure session management capabilities, including token-based authentication and session invalidation. Described in documentation.
*   security control: OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Support: Kratos can act as an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider, enabling secure delegation of authorization. Described in documentation.
*   security control: Input validation: Kratos uses JSON Schema for input validation. Described in documentation.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Complexity of Configuration:  The flexibility of Kratos can lead to complex configurations, which, if done incorrectly, could introduce security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on External Dependencies:  Like any software, Kratos relies on external libraries and services.  Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could impact Kratos's security.
*   accepted risk: Open Source Nature: While beneficial, the open-source nature means that vulnerabilities are publicly disclosed, potentially giving attackers a window of opportunity before patches are applied.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Regular Penetration Testing: Conduct regular penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   Web Application Firewall (WAF): Deploy a WAF to protect against common web attacks.
*   Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS): Implement an IDPS to monitor network traffic and detect malicious activity.
*   Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Use a SIEM system to collect and analyze security logs, providing a centralized view of security events.
*   Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP): Consider RASP to provide an additional layer of protection at runtime.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for strong password policies (length, complexity, history).
    *   Enforcement of MFA for all users, or at least for privileged accounts.
    *   Secure storage of user credentials using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
    *   Protection against brute-force and credential stuffing attacks.
    *   Secure session management with appropriate timeouts and token invalidation.

*   Authorization:
    *   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.
    *   Fine-grained access control to resources and APIs.
    *   Regular review and auditing of user permissions.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all user inputs using a whitelist approach.
    *   Protection against common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
    *   Use of JSON Schema for API input validation.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms for all sensitive operations (e.g., password hashing, data encryption).
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Protection of data in transit using TLS/SSL.
    *   Consideration of data-at-rest encryption for sensitive data.

1.  Developer pushes code changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions workflow is triggered.
3.  The workflow checks out the code.
4.  Go modules are downloaded and managed.
5.  Static analysis tools (e.g., GoSec, linters) are run to identify potential security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
6.  Unit tests and integration tests are executed.
7.  If all checks and tests pass, the Go code is compiled into binaries.
8.  A Docker image is built, including the compiled binaries and necessary dependencies.
9.  The Docker image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   Dependency Management: Go modules are used to manage dependencies and ensure that known vulnerable versions are not used. Tools like `dependabot` can be used to automatically update dependencies.
*   Static Analysis: Static analysis tools (GoSec, linters) are used to identify potential security vulnerabilities and code quality issues before runtime.
*   Automated Testing: Unit tests and integration tests are run automatically to ensure that code changes do not introduce regressions or security flaws.
*   Containerization: Docker is used to package the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments and reducing the risk of environment-specific vulnerabilities.
*   Signed Commits: Developers should sign their commits to ensure the integrity of the codebase.
*   Supply Chain Security: Consider using tools like `cosign` to sign and verify container images, ensuring that they have not been tampered with.
