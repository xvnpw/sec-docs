# Threat Model Analysis for ory/hydra

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Hydra](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_hydra.md)

* **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the Hydra codebase. This could involve sending crafted requests to specific endpoints, manipulating input data, or leveraging flaws in Hydra's internal logic.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Hydra instance, potentially leading to unauthorized access to user data, client secrets, or the ability to manipulate authentication and authorization flows for all applications relying on this Hydra instance.
    * **Affected Component:** Core Hydra codebase (potentially affecting any module or function depending on the specific vulnerability).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Hydra to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Subscribe to Ory's security advisories and mailing lists for timely notifications.
        * Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block common attack patterns targeting Hydra.
        * Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Hydra deployment.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Client Settings leading to Authorization Bypass](./threats/misconfigured_client_settings_leading_to_authorization_bypass.md)

* **Description:** An attacker leverages incorrectly configured OAuth 2.0 client settings *within Hydra*. For example, a permissive `redirect_uris` setting could allow an attacker to register a malicious client and redirect users to their site after a legitimate authentication attempt, stealing the authorization code. Weak or default client secrets *configured in Hydra* could be brute-forced.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can impersonate legitimate clients, gain unauthorized access to user accounts and resources managed by applications using this Hydra instance, or redirect users to phishing sites after authentication.
    * **Affected Component:** Admin API (used for client configuration within Hydra), OAuth 2.0 Authorization Endpoint (within Hydra).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enforce strict validation and whitelisting of `redirect_uris` for all OAuth 2.0 clients *within Hydra*.
        * Mandate strong, randomly generated client secrets *during client registration in Hydra*.
        * Regularly review and audit client configurations *within Hydra*.
        * Implement rate limiting on client registration and update endpoints *in Hydra's Admin API*.
        * Consider using dynamic client registration with appropriate security measures *provided by Hydra*.

## Threat: [Bypassing Consent Flow](./threats/bypassing_consent_flow.md)

* **Description:** An attacker finds a way to circumvent the user consent flow *in Hydra*. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the consent endpoint *provided by Hydra*, manipulating consent requests sent to Hydra, or exploiting flaws in Hydra's consent logic.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can gain access to user data and resources without explicit user authorization, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions on behalf of the user for applications relying on Hydra's consent flow.
    * **Affected Component:** Consent Endpoint (within Hydra), OAuth 2.0 Authorization Endpoint (within Hydra).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure the consent endpoint *in Hydra* is properly secured and follows best practices.
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization for consent requests *processed by Hydra*.
        * Carefully configure consent request parameters and ensure their integrity.

## Threat: [Compromise of Hydra's Database](./threats/compromise_of_hydra's_database.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the underlying database used by Hydra. This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities in the database itself, misconfigurations in the database setup, or compromised credentials used by Hydra to access the database.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information including client secrets, user identifiers, consent decisions, and potentially other internal data used by Hydra. This could lead to widespread compromise of applications relying on Hydra.
    * **Affected Component:** Storage Backend (database used by Hydra).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure the database server and network infrastructure hosting Hydra's database.
        * Enforce strong authentication and authorization for database access.
        * Regularly patch and update the database software.
        * Encrypt sensitive data at rest within Hydra's database.
        * Implement database activity monitoring and auditing for Hydra's database.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Hydra's Admin API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_hydra's_admin_api.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Hydra's administrative API. This could be due to weak or default credentials for the Admin API, misconfigured access control policies for the Admin API, or vulnerabilities in the Admin API itself.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can manipulate Hydra's configuration, create or modify clients, revoke tokens, and potentially take complete control of the Hydra instance, impacting all applications relying on it.
    * **Affected Component:** Admin API (of Hydra).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure the Admin API with strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., mutual TLS, API keys with strict access control) provided by Hydra.
        * Limit access to the Admin API to authorized personnel and systems only.
        * Regularly rotate API keys used for Admin API access.
        * Implement auditing of Admin API actions.

## Threat: [Exploiting Weak or Default Signing/Encryption Keys](./threats/exploiting_weak_or_default_signingencryption_keys.md)

* **Description:** Hydra uses weak or default keys for signing JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) or encrypting sensitive data.
    * **Impact:** Attackers can forge JWTs issued by Hydra, potentially impersonating users or bypassing authorization checks. They might also be able to decrypt sensitive data managed by Hydra if encryption keys are compromised.
    * **Affected Component:** Token Endpoint (JWT signing within Hydra), potentially other modules involved in data encryption within Hydra.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure strong, randomly generated keys are used for signing and encryption *within Hydra's configuration*.
        * Regularly rotate signing and encryption keys *used by Hydra*.
        * Securely store and manage cryptographic keys *used by Hydra*.
