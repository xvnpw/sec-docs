## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Misconfigured Clients](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_misconfigured_clients.md)

- Weak Client Secrets [CRITICAL]:
    - Obtain Client Secret:
      - Brute-force Client Secret Endpoint (if exposed): Attacker attempts to guess the client secret by sending multiple requests with different potential secrets.
      - Exploit Information Disclosure in Application Configuration: Attacker finds the client secret exposed in configuration files, environment variables, or code repositories.
      - Social Engineering of Application Administrator: Attacker tricks an administrator into revealing the client secret.
    - Impersonate Client [CRITICAL]:
      - Obtain Access Token for Arbitrary User: Using the compromised client secret, the attacker requests an access token on behalf of the client, potentially for any user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Open Redirect Vulnerability in Client Configuration *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/open_redirect_vulnerability_in_client_configuration__high-risk_path.md)

- Redirect User to Malicious Site Post-Authentication:
    - Steal User Credentials: After successful authentication with Hydra, the user is redirected to an attacker-controlled site that mimics the application's login page to steal credentials.
    - Phishing Attack: The attacker's site attempts to trick the user into providing sensitive information.
    - Drive-by Download: The attacker's site attempts to install malware on the user's system.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Token Theft (if XSS is present)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_token_theft__if_xss_is_present_.md)

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Application UI (Hydra Context) [CRITICAL]:
    - Steal Access/Refresh Tokens [CRITICAL]: Attacker injects malicious scripts into the application's UI that can access and exfiltrate access and refresh tokens present in the browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Hydra's API [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_hydra's_api__critical_.md)

- Unauthenticated Access to Sensitive Endpoints (Hydra Bug/Misconfiguration) [CRITICAL]:
    - Retrieve Client Secrets [CRITICAL]: Attacker directly accesses API endpoints that should require authentication to retrieve client secrets.
    - Modify Client Configurations [CRITICAL]: Attacker directly accesses API endpoints to alter client configurations, such as redirect URIs or grant types.
  - Privilege Escalation via API Exploits [CRITICAL]:
    - Exploit Vulnerabilities in Admin API Endpoints [CRITICAL]: Attacker exploits security flaws in Hydra's administrative API endpoints.
    - Gain Administrative Control over Hydra [CRITICAL]: Successful exploitation grants the attacker full control over the Hydra instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Data Breach via Hydra [CRITICAL] *** HIGH-RISK PATH (Infrastructure Dependent) ***](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_data_breach_via_hydra__critical___high-risk_path__infrastructure_dependent_.md)

- Accessing Hydra's Database Directly (Requires Infrastructure Access) [CRITICAL]:
    - Exploit Vulnerabilities in Database Software [CRITICAL]: Attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in the database system used by Hydra.
    - Compromise Database Credentials [CRITICAL]: Attacker obtains valid credentials for accessing the database.
    - Retrieve Sensitive Data (Client Secrets, User Information) [CRITICAL]: Attacker directly queries the database to extract sensitive information like client secrets and user details.
