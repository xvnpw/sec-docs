# Attack Surface Analysis for ory/hydra

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Endpoint Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/authorization_endpoint_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in the `/oauth2/auth` endpoint that allow attackers to bypass authorization checks, manipulate the authorization flow, or redirect users to malicious sites.
    *   **How Hydra Contributes:** Hydra manages this critical endpoint for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect flows. Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in Hydra's implementation directly expose this surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious `redirect_uri` in the authorization request, and due to insufficient validation by Hydra, the user is redirected to a phishing site after authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data breaches, redirection to malicious sites, phishing attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate the `redirect_uri` against a pre-defined whitelist.
        *   Implement and enforce the `state` parameter to prevent CSRF attacks.
        *   Keep Hydra updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when integrating with Hydra's authorization flow.
        *   Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attempts on authorization requests.

## Attack Surface: [Token Endpoint Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/token_endpoint_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in the `/oauth2/token` endpoint that enable unauthorized token issuance, token theft, or manipulation.
    *   **How Hydra Contributes:** Hydra is responsible for issuing access and refresh tokens at this endpoint. Vulnerabilities here directly impact the security of the entire authentication and authorization system.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw allowing them to exchange an authorization code multiple times for access tokens, potentially gaining unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, data breaches, account takeover, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure client authentication is strong (e.g., using `client_secret_post` over HTTPS, or more secure methods like mutual TLS).
        *   Implement refresh token rotation to limit the lifespan and impact of compromised refresh tokens.
        *   Securely store and manage client secrets.
        *   Enforce proper scope validation during token issuance.
        *   Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on client credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of Admin API Credentials](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_admin_api_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** If the credentials used to access Hydra's `/admin` API are compromised, attackers gain full control over the Hydra instance.
    *   **How Hydra Contributes:** Hydra's admin API allows for management of clients, users (if using Hydra's user management), and configuration. Its security is paramount.
    *   **Example:** Weak passwords or leaked API keys for the Hydra admin interface allow an attacker to create rogue OAuth 2.0 clients or modify existing ones to grant themselves unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the OAuth 2.0 infrastructure, ability to issue arbitrary tokens, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, unique passwords for admin API access.
        *   Implement robust authentication mechanisms for the admin API (e.g., API keys with proper rotation, mutual TLS).
        *   Restrict access to the admin API to trusted networks and individuals.
        *   Regularly audit admin API access logs.
        *   Consider using a separate, dedicated network for Hydra's infrastructure.

## Attack Surface: [Client Credential Compromise](./attack_surfaces/client_credential_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** If OAuth 2.0 client IDs and secrets are compromised, attackers can impersonate legitimate applications.
    *   **How Hydra Contributes:** Hydra stores and manages client credentials. Weak storage or insecure transmission of these credentials increases the risk.
    *   **Example:** A client secret is hardcoded in a publicly accessible repository or leaked through a server misconfiguration. An attacker uses this secret to obtain access tokens as if they were the legitimate application.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user data, ability to perform actions on behalf of users, potential for further attacks leveraging the compromised client.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store client secrets securely using strong encryption methods (e.g., using a secrets management system).
        *   Avoid hardcoding client secrets in application code.
        *   Transmit client secrets over HTTPS.
        *   Implement mechanisms for rotating client secrets.
        *   Educate developers on the importance of secure client credential management.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Allowed Redirect URIs](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_allowed_redirect_uris.md)

*   **Description:** If the list of allowed redirect URIs for an OAuth 2.0 client is not properly configured, attackers can exploit this to perform open redirects.
    *   **How Hydra Contributes:** Hydra enforces the allowed redirect URIs configured for each client. Misconfiguration in Hydra directly leads to this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker registers a client with a wildcard redirect URI (e.g., `https://example.com/*`). They can then craft an authorization request that redirects the user to a malicious site after successful authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Phishing attacks, leakage of authorization codes or access tokens to malicious sites.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly define and validate allowed redirect URIs for each client.
        *   Avoid using wildcards in redirect URIs unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        *   Regularly review and audit the configured redirect URIs.

## Attack Surface: [JWKS Endpoint Compromise](./attack_surfaces/jwks_endpoint_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** If the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint (`/.well-known/jwks.json`) is compromised or the signing keys are leaked, attackers can forge valid JWTs.
    *   **How Hydra Contributes:** Hydra exposes this endpoint containing the public keys used to verify JWT signatures. Its integrity is crucial for trust in issued tokens.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the private signing keys used by Hydra. They can then create arbitrary JWTs that appear to be legitimately issued by Hydra, allowing them to bypass authentication in relying applications.
    *   **Impact:** Complete authentication bypass in systems relying on Hydra's JWTs, impersonation, unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store and manage the private signing keys used by Hydra.
        *   Rotate signing keys periodically.
        *   Restrict access to the server hosting Hydra and the key store.
        *   Implement strong access controls for managing the JWKS.
        *   Ensure the JWKS endpoint is served over HTTPS.
