## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Attacker Compromises Application via Hydra](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__attacker_compromises_application_via_hydra.md)

This is the root goal and inherently critical as it represents the successful compromise of the application through Hydra.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Bypass Authentication via Hydra Weakness](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__bypass_authentication_via_hydra_weakness.md)

This path focuses on bypassing the intended authentication mechanisms of Hydra.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Misconfiguration in Hydra's Authentication Flow](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_misconfiguration_in_hydra's_authentication_flow.md)

This sub-path highlights vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or insecure configuration of Hydra's authentication processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Weak or Default Client Secrets](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__weak_or_default_client_secrets.md)

* **Obtain Client Secret:** An attacker attempts to discover client secrets through various means, such as finding them in code repositories, configuration files, or through social engineering.
* **Use Client Credentials Grant with Weak Secret:** Once a weak client secret is obtained, the attacker can use the Client Credentials grant type to directly request an access token without user interaction, effectively bypassing authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Insecure Redirect URI Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__insecure_redirect_uri_configuration.md)

* **Identify Vulnerable Redirect URI:** The attacker identifies a client with a loosely configured redirect URI, potentially allowing wildcards or missing specific path restrictions.
* **Perform Authorization Code Injection Attack:** The attacker crafts a malicious authorization request and intercepts the authorization code intended for the legitimate redirect URI. They then exchange this code for an access token, gaining unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Hydra's Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_hydra's_implementation.md)

This path focuses on exploiting potential flaws within Hydra's codebase.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks against Hydra](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__denial_of_service__dos__attacks_against_hydra.md)

* **Resource Exhaustion:** The attacker sends a large volume of requests or specifically crafted requests to Hydra, aiming to exhaust its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth).
    * **Make Hydra Unavailable:**  Successful resource exhaustion leads to Hydra becoming unresponsive, disrupting the application's authentication and authorization functionality, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Abuse Hydra's Administrative Features](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__abuse_hydra's_administrative_features.md)

This path involves exploiting the administrative functionalities of Hydra for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Hydra Admin Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__compromise_hydra_admin_credentials.md)

* **Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing:** The attacker attempts to guess the administrator's password through repeated login attempts or by using lists of known credentials.
* **Exploit Admin Panel Authentication:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Hydra admin panel's authentication mechanism, such as SQL injection or authentication bypass flaws.
* **Obtain Credentials through Phishing:** The attacker uses social engineering techniques to trick the administrator into revealing their credentials.
* **Gain Full Control over Hydra:** Successful compromise of admin credentials grants the attacker complete control over Hydra's configuration and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Manipulate Hydra Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__manipulate_hydra_configuration.md)

This path is enabled by gaining administrative access.
* **Add Malicious Clients:** The attacker creates new OAuth 2.0 clients with overly permissive configurations or malicious redirect URIs to facilitate unauthorized access.
* **Modify Existing Client Configurations:** The attacker alters the configurations of existing clients to weaken their security, such as relaxing redirect URI restrictions or adding excessive grant types.
* **Disable Security Features:** The attacker disables crucial security features within Hydra, such as revocation checks or consent requirements.
* **Facilitate Unauthorized Access:** By manipulating the configuration, the attacker creates backdoors or weakens security measures, making it easier to gain unauthorized access to the protected application.
