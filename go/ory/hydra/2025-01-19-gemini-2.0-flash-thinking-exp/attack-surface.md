# Attack Surface Analysis for ory/hydra

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Client Registration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_client_registration.md)

**Description:** The process of registering OAuth 2.0 clients allows for configurations that weaken security.

**How Hydra Contributes:** Hydra manages the registration and configuration of OAuth 2.0 clients. Permissive settings within Hydra's client registration process directly introduce this risk.

**Example:** Allowing wildcard redirect URIs during client registration. An attacker could register a client with `https://attacker.example.com/*` as a redirect URI. A legitimate user could be tricked into authorizing the attacker's client, and the authorization code would be sent to the attacker's domain.

**Impact:** Account takeover, data breaches, unauthorized access to resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement a robust client registration process with manual approval for sensitive clients.
*   Enforce strict validation of redirect URIs and disallow wildcards where possible.
*   Educate developers on secure client configuration practices.
*   Regularly review and audit registered clients for insecure configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Exposed Client Secrets](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_exposed_client_secrets.md)

**Description:** Client secrets, used to authenticate confidential clients, are either easily guessable or unintentionally exposed.

**How Hydra Contributes:** Hydra stores and validates client secrets. If the storage is compromised or if Hydra allows the creation of weak secrets, it contributes to this risk.

**Example:** A developer sets the client secret to "password" during registration. An attacker could potentially guess this secret and impersonate the client. Alternatively, if Hydra's database is compromised, client secrets could be exposed.

**Impact:** Client impersonation, unauthorized access to resources, potential for further attacks leveraging the compromised client.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong client secret generation policies (minimum length, complexity).
*   Store client secrets securely using strong hashing algorithms.
*   Rotate client secrets periodically.
*   Avoid embedding client secrets in client-side code.
*   Consider using alternative authentication methods for clients where appropriate (e.g., mutual TLS).

## Attack Surface: [Open Redirect Vulnerability in Authorization Endpoint](./attack_surfaces/open_redirect_vulnerability_in_authorization_endpoint.md)

**Description:** The authorization endpoint allows manipulation of the `redirect_uri` parameter, potentially redirecting users to malicious sites after authentication.

**How Hydra Contributes:** Hydra's authorization endpoint processes the `redirect_uri` parameter. Insufficient validation of this parameter creates the vulnerability.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious authorization request with a `redirect_uri` pointing to a phishing site. A user clicking on this link and authenticating will be redirected to the attacker's site, potentially leading to credential theft.

**Impact:** Phishing attacks, credential theft, malware distribution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate the `redirect_uri` against a pre-defined whitelist of allowed URIs.
*   Avoid relying solely on client-provided `redirect_uri` without server-side verification.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for the `redirect_uri` parameter.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to Admin API](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to_admin_api.md)

**Description:** The Hydra Admin API, used for managing Hydra itself, is accessible without proper authentication or authorization.

**How Hydra Contributes:** Hydra provides the Admin API. Weak default credentials or misconfigured access controls on this API directly expose this attack surface.

**Example:** The Hydra Admin API is exposed on a public network with default credentials. An attacker could gain access and modify client configurations, create malicious clients, or even shut down the service.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Hydra instance, allowing attackers to control authentication and authorization for all applications relying on it.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the Admin API with strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, mutual TLS).
*   Restrict access to the Admin API to authorized networks or IP addresses.
*   Change default administrative credentials immediately upon deployment.
*   Implement proper authorization controls to limit the actions of different administrative users.

## Attack Surface: [JWT Secret Exposure](./attack_surfaces/jwt_secret_exposure.md)

**Description:** The secret used to sign JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) issued by Hydra is compromised.

**How Hydra Contributes:** Hydra generates and signs JWTs (access tokens, ID tokens). If the signing key is exposed, attackers can forge valid tokens.

**Example:** The JWT signing key is stored in a publicly accessible configuration file or is leaked through a vulnerability. An attacker can then create valid-looking access tokens to bypass authorization checks in applications relying on Hydra.

**Impact:** Complete bypass of authentication and authorization, allowing attackers to impersonate any user or client.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store the JWT signing key securely using secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
*   Rotate the JWT signing key periodically.
*   Ensure proper access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized access to the key.
*   Consider using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for enhanced key protection.

## Attack Surface: [Consent Management Bypass](./attack_surfaces/consent_management_bypass.md)

**Description:** Mechanisms intended to obtain user consent for data sharing or access are bypassed or circumvented.

**How Hydra Contributes:** Hydra handles the consent flow. Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in this flow can allow attackers to bypass user consent.

**Example:** A flaw in the consent endpoint allows an attacker to craft a request that automatically grants consent without user interaction. This could allow a malicious application to access user data without explicit permission.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user data, privacy violations, potential for data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust consent verification mechanisms.
*   Ensure that consent decisions are securely stored and enforced.
*   Regularly audit the consent flow for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Provide users with clear and understandable information about the data they are consenting to share.

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Injection in Public API](./attack_surfaces/parameter_injection_in_public_api.md)

**Description:** Malicious data is injected into parameters of Hydra's public API endpoints, potentially leading to unintended actions.

**How Hydra Contributes:** Hydra's public API endpoints process user-supplied parameters. Insufficient input validation can make these endpoints vulnerable to injection attacks.

**Example:** If Hydra uses a SQL database and input parameters for client lookup are not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject SQL code to extract sensitive data or manipulate the database.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, potential for denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all parameters in public API endpoints.
*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when accessing data.
