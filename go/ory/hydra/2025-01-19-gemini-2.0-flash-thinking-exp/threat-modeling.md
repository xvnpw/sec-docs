# Threat Model Analysis for ory/hydra

## Threat: [Malicious Client Registration](./threats/malicious_client_registration.md)

**Description:** An attacker registers a rogue OAuth 2.0 client application directly with Hydra. This malicious client can then be used to initiate fraudulent authorization flows, potentially tricking users into granting access to their accounts or resources. The attacker might craft a login page that mimics the legitimate application's, leveraging Hydra's authorization endpoint.
*   **Impact:**
    *   User Account Compromise: Attackers gain unauthorized access to user accounts and associated data managed by the applications relying on Hydra.
    *   Data Breach: Sensitive information accessible through the compromised accounts could be exposed.
    *   Reputational Damage: The reputation of applications using this Hydra instance suffers due to the security breach.
    *   Financial Loss: Potential financial losses due to fraudulent activities enabled by the malicious client.
*   **Affected Hydra Component:**
    *   Admin API (`/admin/clients`) - Used for client registration.
    *   Public API (`/oauth2/auth`) - Used for initiating authorization flows by the malicious client.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Client Whitelisting/Approval Process: Implement a strict process for approving new client registrations via the Hydra Admin API, potentially requiring manual review or verification.
    *   Rate Limiting on Client Registration: Limit the number of client registrations from a single IP address or entity interacting with the Hydra Admin API within a specific timeframe.
    *   Strong Authentication for Admin API: Secure the Hydra Admin API with strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., mutual TLS, API keys with strict access control) to prevent unauthorized client registration.
    *   Regularly Audit Registered Clients: Periodically review the list of clients registered within Hydra to identify and remove any suspicious or unauthorized entries.

## Threat: [Client Secret Leakage/Compromise](./threats/client_secret_leakagecompromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to a legitimate OAuth 2.0 client's secret managed by Hydra. This could happen through vulnerabilities in how Hydra stores or manages secrets, or through unauthorized access to Hydra's data store. With the client secret, the attacker can directly interact with Hydra's token endpoint to impersonate the legitimate client.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access Token Generation: The attacker can obtain access tokens directly from Hydra on behalf of the legitimate client without user interaction.
    *   Data Manipulation: The attacker can potentially access and modify resources protected by the OAuth 2.0 client using the fraudulently obtained tokens.
    *   Service Disruption: The attacker could potentially disrupt the service by making unauthorized requests to resources protected by the compromised client.
*   **Affected Hydra Component:**
    *   Token Endpoint (`/oauth2/token`) - Used for exchanging client credentials for tokens.
    *   Client Database - Where Hydra stores client secrets.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Storage of Client Secrets within Hydra: Ensure Hydra's configuration utilizes secure storage mechanisms for client secrets, including encryption at rest.
    *   Secret Rotation Policies within Hydra: Implement or leverage Hydra's features for regularly rotating client secrets.
    *   Access Control to Hydra's Data Store: Restrict access to the underlying database or storage mechanism used by Hydra to store client secrets.
    *   Monitor for Suspicious Token Requests: Implement monitoring and alerting on Hydra's token endpoint to detect unusual patterns in token requests associated with specific clients.

## Threat: [ID Token Manipulation (if Hydra's signing keys are compromised)](./threats/id_token_manipulation__if_hydra's_signing_keys_are_compromised_.md)

**Description:** If the private keys used by Hydra to sign ID tokens are compromised, an attacker can forge arbitrary ID tokens. Applications relying on the integrity of these signatures for authentication will be vulnerable.
*   **Impact:**
    *   User Impersonation: Attackers can create valid-looking ID tokens for any user, bypassing authentication in relying applications.
    *   Unauthorized Access: Attackers gain access to resources protected by applications trusting the forged ID tokens.
*   **Affected Hydra Component:**
    *   Token Endpoint (`/oauth2/token`) - Issues ID tokens signed with Hydra's keys.
    *   JWK Endpoint (`/.well-known/jwks.json`) - Provides the *public* keys, but compromise of the private key is the issue.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Storage and Management of Signing Keys: Implement robust security measures for storing and managing Hydra's private signing keys, including hardware security modules (HSMs).
    *   Key Rotation: Regularly rotate the signing keys used by Hydra.
    *   Access Control to Key Material: Strictly control access to the systems and storage mechanisms where Hydra's signing keys are held.
    *   Monitor for Unauthorized Key Access: Implement monitoring and alerting for any unauthorized access attempts to the key material.

## Threat: [Authorization Request Manipulation via Hydra's Authorization Endpoint](./threats/authorization_request_manipulation_via_hydra's_authorization_endpoint.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious authorization request targeting Hydra's authorization endpoint (`/oauth2/auth`). By carefully manipulating parameters like `scope` or `redirect_uri`, they might attempt to trick Hydra into granting broader permissions than intended or redirecting the user to a malicious site after authorization.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Scope Creep: The attacker gains access to more resources than the user intended to grant to the legitimate application.
    *   Redirection to Malicious Site: Users are redirected through Hydra to a phishing site or a site that could install malware, after a seemingly legitimate authorization flow.
*   **Affected Hydra Component:**
    *   Authorization Endpoint (`/oauth2/auth`) - Processes and validates authorization requests.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strict Redirect URI Validation in Hydra: Configure Hydra with a strict and enforced list of allowed redirect URIs for each registered client.
    *   Scope Validation within Hydra: Configure Hydra to enforce allowed scopes for each client and prevent requests for unauthorized scopes.
    *   State Parameter Enforcement: Ensure that applications using Hydra properly implement and validate the `state` parameter in authorization requests to prevent CSRF attacks and verify the integrity of the flow.

## Threat: [Consent Bypass or Manipulation via Hydra's Consent API](./threats/consent_bypass_or_manipulation_via_hydra's_consent_api.md)

**Description:** If vulnerabilities exist in how Hydra handles consent requests or if the consent API is improperly secured, an attacker might be able to bypass the user consent step or manipulate the consent decision. This could lead to unauthorized access to user data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access: Attackers can gain access to user data without the user's explicit consent.
    *   Privacy Violation: User privacy is directly compromised by bypassing the consent mechanism within Hydra.
*   **Affected Hydra Component:**
    *   Consent API (`/oauth2/auth/requests/consent`) - Handles consent requests and decisions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Configuration of Hydra's Consent Handlers: Ensure that Hydra's consent logic is securely configured and that any custom consent handlers are thoroughly reviewed for vulnerabilities.
    *   Strong Authentication for Consent API Interactions: If external systems interact with Hydra's consent API, ensure strong authentication and authorization are in place.
    *   Regular Security Reviews of Consent Flow: Conduct regular security reviews of Hydra's consent flow configuration and any related integrations.
    *   Minimize Custom Consent Logic: If possible, rely on Hydra's built-in consent features to reduce the attack surface and potential for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on Hydra](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_on_hydra.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to overwhelm Hydra's API endpoints with a large number of requests, causing it to become unavailable or unresponsive to legitimate requests. This directly impacts the authentication and authorization functionality provided by Hydra.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Service Disruption: Users are unable to log in or access protected resources due to Hydra's unavailability.
    *   Application Downtime: Applications relying on Hydra for authentication and authorization will experience downtime.
*   **Affected Hydra Component:**
    *   All API endpoints (`/admin/*`, `/oauth2/*`, etc.) - Vulnerable to being overloaded with requests.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rate Limiting within Hydra: Configure rate limiting directly within Hydra to limit the number of requests from a single source or for specific endpoints.
    *   Resource Monitoring and Scaling: Monitor Hydra's resource usage and scale the infrastructure as needed to handle expected and unexpected traffic volumes.
    *   Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of Hydra: Use a WAF to filter malicious traffic and protect against common DoS attack patterns targeting Hydra's endpoints.
    *   Proper Infrastructure Sizing for Hydra: Ensure the infrastructure hosting Hydra is adequately sized to handle anticipated peak loads.
    *   Implement Request Queuing or Throttling: Consider implementing request queuing or throttling mechanisms in front of Hydra to manage incoming traffic.
