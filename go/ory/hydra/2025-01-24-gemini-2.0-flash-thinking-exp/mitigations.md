# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ory/hydra

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Default Configuration Review and Hardening](./mitigation_strategies/secure_default_configuration_review_and_hardening.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Default Configuration Review and Hardening
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access Hydra Configuration:** Locate and access the `hydra.yml` configuration file or environment variables used to configure Hydra.
    2.  **Review Default Secrets:**  Specifically examine and identify default values for `SYSTEM_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL` secrets, and any other secrets defined in the default configuration.
    3.  **Generate Strong Secrets for Hydra:** Utilize a cryptographically secure random number generator to create strong, unique secrets specifically for Hydra's configuration parameters like `SYSTEM_SECRET` and database credentials.
    4.  **Replace Default Hydra Secrets:**  Replace all default secret values in `hydra.yml` or environment variables with the newly generated strong secrets.
    5.  **Disable Unnecessary Hydra Features:** Review Hydra's configuration for features that are not required for your application's OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect flows (e.g., specific grant types, authentication methods, unused plugins). Disable these features in the Hydra configuration to minimize the attack surface.
    6.  **Verify Hydra URL Configuration:**  Ensure that `URLS.SELF.PUBLIC` and `URLS.SELF.ADMIN` in Hydra's configuration are correctly set to HTTPS endpoints that accurately reflect the public and admin URLs of your deployed Hydra instance.
    7.  **Regular Hydra Configuration Review:** Establish a schedule for periodic reviews of Hydra's configuration to ensure it remains secure and aligned with current security best practices and application requirements.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Hydra Sensitive Information (High Severity):** Default Hydra secrets are publicly known or easily guessable, allowing unauthorized access to Hydra's internal components and sensitive data managed by Hydra.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Hydra Admin Interface (High Severity):** Default configurations might leave unnecessary Hydra features enabled or admin interfaces less protected, creating potential entry points for attackers to control Hydra.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks against Hydra Flows (Medium Severity):** Incorrect Hydra URL configurations (using HTTP instead of HTTPS for `URLS.SELF.PUBLIC` or `URLS.SELF.ADMIN`) can expose OAuth and OIDC communication to interception targeting Hydra.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Hydra Sensitive Information:** High reduction - Eliminates the risk of exploiting weak default Hydra secrets.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Hydra Admin Interface:** Medium reduction - Reduces the attack surface of Hydra by disabling unused features and potentially hardening admin access points (though admin access control is a separate strategy).
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks against Hydra Flows:** Medium reduction - Ensures secure communication channels are used for Hydra's core OAuth and OIDC functionalities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Default secrets have been changed during initial Hydra setup, but a systematic review of all Hydra configuration options and disabling unnecessary features is pending. HTTPS is enforced for Hydra public and admin URLs.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Systematic review of all Hydra configuration options, disabling unnecessary Hydra features, and establishing a schedule for regular Hydra configuration reviews.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Hydra Processes](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_hydra_processes.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for Hydra Processes
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Hydra Process User:** Determine the user account under which the `hydra server` and `hydra migrate` processes are executed.
    2.  **Restrict Hydra User Permissions:**  Configure the user account running Hydra to have only the minimum necessary permissions required for Hydra to function correctly. This includes:
        *   **Hydra File System Access:** Limit access to only directories and files that Hydra absolutely needs (e.g., Hydra configuration files, database files if local, logs, JWK storage if file-based). Deny write access to system directories and any unnecessary locations.
        *   **Hydra Network Access:** Restrict network access for the Hydra process to only the ports and protocols required for its operation (e.g., public and admin ports, database port).
        *   **Hydra System Capabilities:** Remove any unnecessary Linux capabilities granted to the Hydra process.
    3.  **Containerized Hydra Environments:** If deploying Hydra in containers (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes):
        *   **Non-Root Hydra Container User:** Ensure the Hydra container runs as a non-root user. Define a specific, less privileged user within the Dockerfile and use the `USER` instruction.
        *   **Kubernetes Security Context for Hydra:** In Kubernetes, utilize SecurityContext to further restrict the capabilities and permissions of the Hydra container, enforcing least privilege at the container level.
    4.  **Hydra Permission Verification:** Regularly verify the effective permissions of the Hydra processes to ensure they consistently adhere to the principle of least privilege and that no unintended privilege escalation occurs.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Hydra Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** If Hydra processes run with excessive privileges, vulnerabilities within Hydra itself or its dependencies could be exploited to escalate privileges to the underlying system.
    *   **Lateral Movement from Compromised Hydra (Medium Severity):**  If Hydra is compromised and running with broad permissions, it can be used as a pivot point to access other parts of the system or network beyond its intended scope.
    *   **Hydra Data Breach via File System Access (High Severity):**  Excessive file system access granted to Hydra could allow attackers to read or modify sensitive data stored on the file system if Hydra is compromised.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Hydra Privilege Escalation:** High reduction - Significantly limits the potential impact of vulnerabilities in Hydra that could lead to privilege escalation.
    *   **Lateral Movement from Compromised Hydra:** Medium reduction - Restricts an attacker's ability to move laterally within the system after initially compromising Hydra.
    *   **Hydra Data Breach via File System Access:** Medium reduction - Limits the attacker's potential access to sensitive data on the file system accessible by Hydra.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Hydra is running within a container, but the container user might not be explicitly defined as non-root and Kubernetes SecurityContext for Hydra is not fully configured. File system permissions for Hydra are generally restricted, but require a more detailed security-focused review.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Explicitly define a non-root user for the Hydra container in the Dockerfile, fully configure Kubernetes SecurityContext for the Hydra deployment, and conduct a detailed security audit of file system permissions specifically for the Hydra process user.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Segmentation and Isolation for Hydra](./mitigation_strategies/network_segmentation_and_isolation_for_hydra.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Network Segmentation and Isolation for Hydra
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dedicated Hydra Network Segment:** Deploy Ory Hydra within its own dedicated network segment (e.g., VLAN, subnet) if the infrastructure allows for network segmentation.
    2.  **Hydra Firewall Configuration:** Implement firewall rules to strictly control network traffic to and from the Hydra network segment.
        *   **Restrict Public Access to Hydra Public Port:** Limit public network access only to the necessary port used for Hydra's public interface (e.g., for OAuth 2.0 flows).
        *   **Isolate Hydra Admin Port:**  Restrict access to the Hydra Admin port to only trusted internal networks or specific administrator IP addresses. Ideally, this port should not be publicly accessible.
        *   **Control Hydra Outbound Traffic:**  Implement rules to control and monitor outbound network traffic from the Hydra segment, limiting connections to only necessary services (e.g., database, logging).
    3.  **Kubernetes Network Policies for Hydra:** In Kubernetes deployments, utilize Network Policies to enforce network segmentation at the pod level for Hydra. Define policies to restrict communication between Hydra pods and other pods within the cluster, allowing only essential connections.
    4.  **Secure Admin Access to Hydra:** For administrative access to Hydra's admin interface, enforce the use of secure channels like VPNs or bastion hosts. This further isolates the admin interface from direct exposure to public networks.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Network Access to Hydra (High Severity):**  Open network access to Hydra's admin or public interfaces can allow attackers from untrusted networks to directly interact with Hydra, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
    *   **Lateral Movement to/from Hydra (Medium Severity):** Network segmentation limits the potential for lateral movement. If other systems in the network are compromised, segmentation makes it harder for attackers to reach Hydra. Conversely, if Hydra is compromised, it's harder to use it to attack other systems.
    *   **Hydra Data Exfiltration via Network (Medium Severity):** Controlling outbound traffic from the Hydra segment can help prevent or detect data exfiltration attempts if Hydra is compromised.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Network Access to Hydra:** High reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of direct attacks against Hydra originating from untrusted networks.
    *   **Lateral Movement to/from Hydra:** Medium reduction - Limits the spread of attacks across the network, containing potential breaches.
    *   **Hydra Data Exfiltration via Network:** Medium reduction - Makes network-based data exfiltration from a compromised Hydra instance more difficult.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Hydra is deployed in a separate Kubernetes namespace, providing some logical isolation. Basic firewall rules are in place to restrict public access to the Hydra admin port.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Full network segmentation using VLANs or dedicated subnets, more granular firewall rules specifically for Hydra traffic, implementation of Kubernetes Network Policies for container-level isolation of Hydra, and enforcing VPN/Bastion host access for all Hydra administrative tasks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS for All Hydra Communication](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_https_for_all_hydra_communication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce HTTPS for All Hydra Communication
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Hydra TLS Certificate Configuration:** Obtain valid TLS/SSL certificates for the domains used for Hydra's public and admin interfaces. Ensure these certificates are correctly configured within Hydra's settings.
    2.  **Configure Hydra for HTTPS:**  Explicitly configure Hydra to use HTTPS for both `URLS.SELF.PUBLIC` and `URLS.SELF.ADMIN` settings in `hydra.yml` or environment variables. Specify the paths to the TLS certificate and private key files in Hydra's configuration if necessary.
    3.  **Force HTTPS Redirects for Hydra:** Configure any web servers or load balancers positioned in front of Hydra to automatically redirect all incoming HTTP requests to the corresponding HTTPS endpoints for both public and admin interfaces.
    4.  **Enable HSTS Header for Hydra:** Enable the HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header in the web server configuration serving Hydra's public and admin interfaces. This instructs browsers to always communicate with Hydra over HTTPS for a specified duration.
    5.  **Mutual TLS (mTLS) for Hydra Internal Communication (Optional):** For enhanced security of internal communication between Hydra components and other backend services, consider implementing mutual TLS (mTLS). Configure Hydra and other services to authenticate each other using client certificates in addition to standard TLS encryption.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Hydra Flows (High Severity):** Communication with Hydra over HTTP is vulnerable to interception, allowing attackers to steal sensitive data transmitted during OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect flows, such as access tokens, refresh tokens, and client secrets.
    *   **Hydra Session Hijacking (High Severity):** Unencrypted HTTP communication can allow attackers to intercept session cookies or tokens used by Hydra, potentially leading to session hijacking and impersonation of legitimate users or services interacting with Hydra.
    *   **Hydra Data Exposure in Transit (High Severity):** Sensitive data processed and transmitted by Hydra over HTTP is exposed in plaintext, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and data breaches.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Hydra Flows:** High reduction - Eliminates the risk of eavesdropping and data interception during communication with Hydra, securing OAuth and OIDC flows.
    *   **Hydra Session Hijacking:** High reduction - Prevents session hijacking attempts targeting Hydra through network sniffing of unencrypted traffic.
    *   **Hydra Data Exposure in Transit:** High reduction - Ensures that sensitive data handled by Hydra is encrypted during transmission, protecting it from exposure.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Fully implemented. HTTPS is enforced for both Hydra public and admin interfaces. Valid TLS certificates are configured for Hydra. HTTPS redirects are in place for Hydra. HSTS header is enabled for Hydra.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Mutual TLS (mTLS) for internal communication involving Hydra is not currently implemented and could be evaluated for future implementation to further strengthen security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Storage for Hydra Sensitive Data](./mitigation_strategies/secure_storage_for_hydra_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Storage for Hydra Sensitive Data
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Hydra Database Encryption at Rest:** Enable encryption at rest for the database system used by Hydra to store its data. This is typically a database-level feature that encrypts data files on disk, protecting sensitive information stored by Hydra.
    2.  **Hydra Secret Management System Integration:** Integrate Hydra with a dedicated secret management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to securely store and manage Hydra's sensitive secrets. This includes `SYSTEM_SECRET`, database credentials used by Hydra, OAuth 2.0 client secrets, and JWK private keys used for token signing by Hydra.
    3.  **Avoid Storing Hydra Secrets in Configuration Files:** Minimize or completely eliminate the practice of storing sensitive secrets directly within Hydra's configuration files (`hydra.yml`) or as environment variables. Instead, configure Hydra to retrieve secrets dynamically from the integrated secret management system at runtime.
    4.  **File System Encryption for Hydra JWKs (if file-based):** If JWKs or other sensitive configuration data for Hydra are stored in files on the file system, ensure that the underlying file system is encrypted to protect these files at rest.
    5.  **Access Control for Hydra Secrets Storage:** Implement strict access control policies for the secret management system and any file-based storage used for Hydra secrets. Limit access to these storage locations to only authorized Hydra services and personnel, following the principle of least privilege.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Hydra Data Breach at Rest (High Severity):** If the database or file system used by Hydra is compromised, unencrypted sensitive data stored by Hydra (client secrets, tokens, etc.) can be easily accessed by attackers.
    *   **Hydra Secret Exposure (High Severity):** Storing Hydra secrets in configuration files or environment variables increases the risk of accidental exposure or unauthorized access to these critical secrets.
    *   **Hydra Credential Theft from Storage (High Severity):**  Compromise of the database or file system used by Hydra can lead to the theft of credentials used for authentication and authorization within the Hydra system and related applications.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Hydra Data Breach at Rest:** High reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of data exposure in the event of a database or file system compromise affecting Hydra's data.
    *   **Hydra Secret Exposure:** High reduction - Centralized secret management for Hydra reduces the risk of accidental or unauthorized exposure of Hydra's sensitive secrets.
    *   **Hydra Credential Theft from Storage:** High reduction - Makes it significantly harder for attackers to obtain usable credentials even if they gain unauthorized access to Hydra's data storage.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Database encryption at rest is enabled for Hydra's database. Client secrets are stored in the encrypted database. `SYSTEM_SECRET` is currently stored as an environment variable. JWKs are stored in files with restricted permissions.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Integration with a dedicated secret management system (like HashiCorp Vault) to manage `SYSTEM_SECRET`, database credentials used by Hydra, and JWK private keys. Migration of `SYSTEM_SECRET` and database credentials out of environment variables and into the secret management system.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Redirect URI Validation and Whitelisting in Hydra](./mitigation_strategies/strict_redirect_uri_validation_and_whitelisting_in_hydra.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Redirect URI Validation and Whitelisting in Hydra
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Hydra Client Redirect URI Whitelisting:** For every OAuth 2.0 client registered within Hydra, explicitly define a whitelist of allowed redirect URIs. This is configured during client registration in Hydra.
    2.  **Enforce Exact Redirect URI Matching in Hydra:** Configure Hydra to strictly enforce exact matching of redirect URIs. Avoid using wildcard characters or overly permissive patterns when defining whitelisted redirect URIs for Hydra clients.
    3.  **Hydra Input Validation for Redirect URIs:** Hydra should perform robust input validation on the `redirect_uri` parameter in OAuth 2.0 authorization requests. Ensure that the provided `redirect_uri` exactly matches one of the whitelisted URIs configured for the client in Hydra.
    4.  **Regular Hydra Redirect URI Review and Update:** Establish a process for periodically reviewing and updating the whitelist of redirect URIs for each client registered in Hydra. Remove outdated or unnecessary entries and add new valid URIs as application requirements evolve.
    5.  **Hydra Error Handling for Invalid Redirect URIs:** Configure Hydra to implement proper error handling when an invalid redirect URI is detected in an authorization request. Hydra should return a clear error message to the client indicating the invalid redirect URI and log the invalid request for security monitoring and auditing purposes.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Hydra Open Redirect Vulnerability (High Severity):** Insufficient redirect URI validation in Hydra can lead to open redirect vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit this to redirect users to malicious websites after successful authentication through Hydra, potentially leading to credential theft or other attacks.
    *   **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Interception via Hydra (Medium Severity):** Lax redirect URI validation in Hydra can be exploited in certain scenarios to intercept OAuth 2.0 authorization codes by redirecting them to attacker-controlled endpoints.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Hydra Open Redirect Vulnerability:** High reduction - Eliminates the risk of open redirect vulnerabilities originating from improper redirect URI handling within Hydra.
    *   **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Interception via Hydra:** Medium reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of authorization code interception attacks related to redirect URI manipulation within Hydra's OAuth flows.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Redirect URIs are whitelisted for clients registered in Hydra, but the strictness of validation (exact matching enforcement) and the process for regular review and updates might need strengthening.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Verify and enforce strict exact matching for redirect URI validation in Hydra's configuration and client registration process. Implement a documented and regularly scheduled process for reviewing and updating redirect URI whitelists for all Hydra clients.
