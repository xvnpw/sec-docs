# Threat Model Analysis for ory/hydra

## Threat: [Misconfigured Client Registration](./threats/misconfigured_client_registration.md)

* **Description:** An attacker might register a malicious OAuth 2.0 client or compromise a legitimate client registration by exploiting overly permissive settings within Hydra. This includes setting broad grant types, weak redirect URI validation, or excessive scopes during client registration via Hydra's Admin API.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, data breaches, account takeover if a legitimate client is compromised and used to impersonate users.
    * **Hydra Component Affected:** Client Registration API, Admin API, Client Management Module
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict client registration policies and mandatory review processes.
        * Enforce the principle of least privilege for grant types and scopes during client registration.
        * Thoroughly validate and sanitize redirect URIs using allowlists and strict matching within Hydra's client configuration.
        * Regularly audit client configurations stored in Hydra and revoke unused or suspicious clients.
        * Implement automated configuration checks to detect misconfigurations during client registration using Hydra's APIs.

## Threat: [Client Secret Exposure/Compromise](./threats/client_secret_exposurecompromise.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could gain access to client secrets managed by Hydra if they are stored insecurely within Hydra's configuration or database, transmitted over insecure channels during client registration or updates via Hydra's Admin API, or leaked through vulnerabilities in Hydra itself.
    * **Impact:** Client impersonation, bypassing authorization checks enforced by Hydra, unauthorized access to resources protected by Hydra, potential data breaches.
    * **Hydra Component Affected:** Client Storage, Admin API, Client Credentials Grant Flow, Secrets Management within Hydra
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Store client secrets securely using dedicated secrets management systems integrated with Hydra (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets).
        * Rotate client secrets regularly using Hydra's Admin API or configuration management.
        * Avoid storing secrets directly in Hydra's configuration files if possible, leverage external secret stores.
        * Enforce HTTPS for all communication with Hydra's Admin API and any client interactions involving secrets.
        * Utilize PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) where applicable to minimize reliance on client secrets, especially for public clients interacting with Hydra.

## Threat: [Authorization Code Interception/Theft](./threats/authorization_code_interceptiontheft.md)

* **Description:** An attacker might intercept authorization codes generated by Hydra during the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow if the communication channel, specifically redirect URIs configured in Hydra, is not secure (e.g., HTTP redirect URI) or if vulnerabilities exist in Hydra's authorization endpoint.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts and protected resources by exchanging the stolen authorization code for an access token from Hydra's token endpoint.
    * **Hydra Component Affected:** Authorization Endpoint, Token Endpoint, OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant Flow
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enforce HTTPS for all redirect URIs configured in Hydra and all communication channels involving Hydra.
        * Implement PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) to mitigate authorization code interception, leveraging Hydra's PKCE support.
        * Ensure robust redirect URI validation and matching is configured within Hydra to prevent open redirects.

## Threat: [Access Token Theft/Hijacking](./threats/access_token_thefthijacking.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could steal or hijack access tokens issued by Hydra if they are transmitted or stored insecurely by the client application or if vulnerabilities exist in Hydra's token handling or issuance.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources by impersonating a legitimate user who obtained the token from Hydra.
    * **Hydra Component Affected:** Token Endpoint, Resource Server Integration (using tokens issued by Hydra), OAuth 2.0 Flows
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enforce HTTPS for all communication involving tokens issued by Hydra.

## Threat: [Refresh Token Theft/Abuse](./threats/refresh_token_theftabuse.md)

* **Description:** An attacker who steals a refresh token issued by Hydra can use it to obtain new access tokens even after the initial session expires. This could be due to insecure storage by the client application or vulnerabilities in Hydra's refresh token handling.
    * **Impact:** Persistent unauthorized access to user accounts and protected resources, potentially for extended periods, by abusing refresh tokens issued by Hydra.
    * **Hydra Component Affected:** Token Endpoint, Refresh Token Grant Flow, Token Storage within Hydra
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Securely store refresh tokens, ideally using secure storage mechanisms provided by the client application's platform.
        * Implement refresh token rotation, leveraging Hydra's refresh token rotation features if available, to invalidate old refresh tokens after use.
        * Limit refresh token lifetime and enforce expiration within Hydra's token configuration.

## Threat: [ID Token Manipulation/Forgery (OpenID Connect specific)](./threats/id_token_manipulationforgery__openid_connect_specific_.md)

* **Description:** If ID tokens issued by Hydra are not properly validated by relying applications or if the signing key used by Hydra is compromised, an attacker could forge or manipulate ID tokens. This could be due to insecure validation logic in applications or vulnerabilities in Hydra's key management.
    * **Impact:** Relying applications might incorrectly authenticate users based on forged ID tokens issued by Hydra, leading to unauthorized access, identity spoofing, and potential data breaches.
    * **Hydra Component Affected:** Token Endpoint, ID Token Generation, JWKS Endpoint, OpenID Connect Flow, Signing Key Management within Hydra
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**

        * Use established and well-vetted libraries for JWT (JSON Web Token) validation in applications consuming Hydra's ID tokens.
        * Securely manage the signing keys used by Hydra for ID tokens, protecting them from unauthorized access.
        * Enforce HTTPS for retrieving JWKS from Hydra and all communication involving ID tokens.

## Threat: [Data Breach of Hydra's Database](./threats/data_breach_of_hydra's_database.md)
