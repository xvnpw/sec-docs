# BUSINESS POSTURE

Ory Hydra is an OpenID Certified OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider that is designed for cloud native environments and microservices architectures. It is focused on providing secure authentication and authorization without managing user accounts or storing sensitive user data. It delegates user management to external identity providers.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide secure authentication and authorization for applications and services.
- Simplify identity management by delegating user management to external systems.
- Enable fine-grained access control based on OAuth 2.0 scopes and policies.
- Support modern authentication standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.
- Offer a scalable and performant authorization solution for cloud-native environments.
- Reduce the complexity and risk associated with building and maintaining a custom authorization server.
- Ensure compliance with industry security standards and best practices for authentication and authorization.

Business Risks:
- Availability and reliability of Ory Hydra service impacting all dependent applications.
- Security vulnerabilities in Ory Hydra potentially leading to unauthorized access to protected resources.
- Misconfiguration of Ory Hydra leading to security breaches or operational issues.
- Integration complexity with existing identity providers and applications.
- Performance bottlenecks in Ory Hydra affecting application responsiveness.
- Vendor lock-in if heavily reliant on Ory Hydra specific features.
- Compliance risks if Ory Hydra is not configured or used correctly in regulated industries.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards compliance. Implemented as core functionality of Ory Hydra.
- security control: Separation of concerns by delegating user authentication and management to external identity providers. Described in Ory Hydra documentation and architecture.
- security control: Policy-based access control using OAuth 2.0 scopes and access control policies. Implemented as core functionality of Ory Hydra.
- security control: HTTPS enforced for all communication. Recommended best practice and likely enforced in deployment configurations.
- security control: Secure storage of configuration and operational data in a database. Assumed based on typical application architecture.
- security control: Audit logging of security-relevant events. Likely implemented as a standard feature for security and compliance.
- security control: Input validation and output encoding to prevent common web vulnerabilities. Implemented within Ory Hydra codebase.
- security control: Regular security updates and patching. Part of Ory project maintenance and release cycle.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on external identity providers for user authentication security. Assumed to be managed by choosing reputable and secure identity providers.
- accepted risk: Complexity of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect configuration potentially leading to misconfigurations. Mitigated by documentation and best practices.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in underlying dependencies and libraries. Mitigated by dependency scanning and regular updates.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of Ory Hydra to protect against common web attacks.
- security control: Regularly perform penetration testing and vulnerability scanning of Ory Hydra deployments.
- security control: Implement rate limiting and request throttling to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
- security control: Use a dedicated and hardened database server for Ory Hydra data.
- security control: Implement robust monitoring and alerting for security events and anomalies.
- security control: Secure secret management for cryptographic keys and database credentials.
- security control: Implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to aggregate and analyze security logs.

Security Requirements:

    - requirement: Ory Hydra must support fine-grained authorization decisions based on user attributes and context.
    - requirement: Ory Hydra must provide APIs for policy management and enforcement.
    - requirement: Ory Hydra must support different authorization models like Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- Input Validation:
    - requirement: Ory Hydra must validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting).
    - requirement: Ory Hydra must sanitize and encode outputs to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    - requirement: Ory Hydra must implement input validation for all API endpoints and user interfaces.
    - requirement: Ory Hydra must handle invalid inputs gracefully and provide informative error messages without revealing sensitive information.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- User authentication and authorization for all applications and services relying on Ory Hydra.
- Access control to protected resources managed by Ory Hydra.
- Management of OAuth 2.0 clients and authorization policies.

Data Sensitivity:
- Configuration data: Sensitive, includes client secrets, database credentials, and policy definitions. High sensitivity.
- Audit logs: Potentially sensitive, may contain information about user access and application usage. Medium sensitivity.
- Database backups: Sensitive, contains all Ory Hydra data including configuration and operational data. High sensitivity.
- Access tokens and refresh tokens: Highly sensitive, compromise can lead to unauthorized access. High sensitivity (short-lived tokens reduce risk).
- Consent data: Potentially sensitive, depending on the data consented to. Medium to High sensitivity.

Data to Protect:
- Client secrets
- Database credentials
- Cryptographic keys
- Authorization policies
- Audit logs
- Database backups
- Access tokens and refresh tokens
- Consent data
