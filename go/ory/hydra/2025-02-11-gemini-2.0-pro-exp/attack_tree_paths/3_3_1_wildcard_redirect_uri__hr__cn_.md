# Deep Analysis: Wildcard Redirect URI in ORY Hydra

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Fully understand the mechanics of the "Wildcard Redirect URI" vulnerability within the context of ORY Hydra.
*   Assess the specific risks this vulnerability poses to our application and users.
*   Provide concrete, actionable recommendations for preventing and detecting this vulnerability in our implementation.
*   Educate the development team on secure redirect URI handling practices.
*   Ensure that our use of ORY Hydra is configured in a way that eliminates this attack vector.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the "Wildcard Redirect URI" vulnerability (attack tree path 3.3.1) as it applies to our application's use of ORY Hydra for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) flows.  It covers:

7.  **Testing Recommendations:**  Suggest specific tests to verify the effectiveness of mitigations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 3.3.1: Wildcard Redirect URI

### 2.1. Vulnerability Definition

A wildcard redirect URI vulnerability occurs when an OAuth 2.0 client's allowed redirect URIs are configured using wildcard characters (e.g., `*`, `?`, or regular expression patterns that are too broad).  This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary redirect URI during the authorization request.  The authorization server (ORY Hydra, in our case) will then redirect the user, along with the authorization code or access token, to the attacker-controlled URI.

**Why is this dangerous?**  The authorization code (in the authorization code flow) or the access token (in the implicit flow) is a valuable credential.  If an attacker obtains it, they can impersonate the user and access protected resources on their behalf.

### 2.2. ORY Hydra Specifics

ORY Hydra, like other OAuth 2.0/OIDC providers, enforces strict redirect URI validation to prevent this type of attack.  When creating or updating an OAuth 2.0 client in Hydra, you specify the allowed `redirect_uris`.  Hydra *strongly discourages* the use of wildcards and provides mechanisms to enforce precise URI matching.

Key Hydra configuration points:

*   **`redirect_uris` (Client Configuration):**  This array in the client configuration *must* contain the exact, full redirect URIs that the client is allowed to use.  No wildcards should be present.
*   **Strict URI Matching:** Hydra performs strict string comparison (or regular expression matching if explicitly configured, but this is discouraged for redirect URIs).  It does *not* perform partial matching or allow wildcard substitution unless explicitly (and insecurely) configured.
*   **Error Handling:** If a client attempts to use a redirect URI that is not in the allowed list, Hydra will reject the request and return an error (typically `invalid_request` or `unauthorized_client`).

### 2.3. Attack Scenario Walkthrough

Let's assume our legitimate application has a client configured in Hydra with a wildcard redirect URI (a highly insecure configuration):

```json
{
  "client_id": "my-vulnerable-client",
  "client_secret": "...",
  "grant_types": ["authorization_code"],
  "redirect_uris": ["https://my-app.com/*"], // VULNERABLE!
  "response_types": ["code"]
}
```

1.  **Attacker Crafts Malicious Link:** The attacker creates a link to our application's authorization endpoint, but with a malicious redirect URI:

    ```
    https://hydra.example.com/oauth2/auth?
    client_id=my-vulnerable-client&
    response_type=code&
    redirect_uri=https://attacker.com/steal-code&
    scope=openid profile email&
    state=some_random_state
    ```

2.  **User Clicks Link:** The attacker tricks a legitimate user into clicking this link (e.g., through phishing, social engineering, or a compromised website).

3.  **User Authenticates:** The user is redirected to ORY Hydra's login page.  They authenticate successfully.

4.  **Hydra Redirects (to the Attacker!):**  Because the `redirect_uris` configuration contains a wildcard (`https://my-app.com/*`), Hydra *incorrectly* considers `https://attacker.com/steal-code` to be a valid redirect URI.  It redirects the user's browser to the attacker's site, including the authorization code in the URL:

    ```
    https://attacker.com/steal-code?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&state=some_random_state
    ```

5.  **Attacker Steals Code:** The attacker's server receives the authorization code.

6.  **Attacker Exchanges Code for Token:** The attacker uses the stolen authorization code to make a request to Hydra's token endpoint:

    ```
    POST /oauth2/token
    client_id=my-vulnerable-client&
    client_secret=...&
    grant_type=authorization_code&
    code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&
    redirect_uri=https://attacker.com/steal-code  // Must match the initial redirect_uri
    ```

7.  **Attacker Gains Access:** Hydra issues an access token and ID token to the attacker.  The attacker can now use these tokens to access protected resources on behalf of the user.

### 2.4. Impact Assessment

*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  The attacker gains access to the user's data and resources.  The scope of access depends on the requested scopes (e.g., `openid`, `profile`, `email`, custom scopes).
*   **Integrity Violation:**  The attacker may be able to modify the user's data or perform actions on their behalf.
*   **Availability Impact:**  While not a direct consequence of this vulnerability, the attacker could potentially disrupt the user's access to the application.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful exploit could severely damage the reputation of our application and erode user trust.
*   **Legal and Compliance Issues:**  Data breaches can lead to legal penalties and regulatory fines, especially if sensitive user data is involved.

### 2.5. Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Never Use Wildcards:**  The most crucial mitigation is to *absolutely never* use wildcard characters in the `redirect_uris` array of your ORY Hydra client configurations.

2.  **Exact URI Matching:**  Specify the *complete, exact* redirect URIs that your application will use.  For example:

    ```json
    {
      "client_id": "my-secure-client",
      "client_secret": "...",
      "grant_types": ["authorization_code"],
      "redirect_uris": [
        "https://my-app.com/callback",
        "https://my-app.com/another-callback"
      ],
      "response_types": ["code"]
    }
    ```

3.  **Regular Expression (Use with Extreme Caution):** If you absolutely must use regular expressions (which is generally discouraged for redirect URIs), ensure they are extremely restrictive and thoroughly tested.  A poorly crafted regular expression can be just as dangerous as a wildcard.  Prefer exact matching whenever possible.  If you must use a regex, document *why* and have it reviewed by a security expert.

4.  **Client Configuration Review:**  Implement a process for regularly reviewing and auditing all ORY Hydra client configurations, specifically checking for any wildcard or overly permissive redirect URIs.

5.  **Code Review:**  Ensure that code reviews include checks for secure redirect URI handling.  Any code that interacts with ORY Hydra's API (e.g., creating or updating clients) should be scrutinized for potential vulnerabilities.

6.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant clients only the necessary permissions and scopes.  Avoid granting overly broad scopes that could increase the impact of a successful attack.

### 2.6. Detection and Monitoring

1.  **Configuration Audits:**  Regularly audit ORY Hydra client configurations, either manually or using automated scripts, to detect any wildcard or overly permissive redirect URIs.

2.  **Log Analysis:**  Monitor ORY Hydra's logs for any errors related to redirect URI validation (e.g., `invalid_request`, `unauthorized_client`).  These errors could indicate attempted exploits or misconfigurations.

3.  **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  Configure your IDS to detect suspicious patterns in network traffic, such as requests to the authorization endpoint with unusual redirect URIs.

4.  **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate ORY Hydra's logs with your SIEM system to correlate events and identify potential attacks.

5.  **Alerting:** Set up alerts for any detected misconfigurations or suspicious activity related to redirect URIs.

### 2.7. Testing Recommendations

1.  **Negative Testing:**  Attempt to initiate an authorization flow with a redirect URI that is *not* in the allowed list.  Verify that ORY Hydra rejects the request with an appropriate error.

2.  **Positive Testing:**  Test the authorization flow with each of the allowed redirect URIs.  Verify that the flow completes successfully and that the user is redirected to the correct URI.

3.  **Regular Expression Testing (if applicable):**  If you are using regular expressions for redirect URIs, thoroughly test them with a variety of valid and invalid inputs to ensure they are behaving as expected.

4.  **Penetration Testing:**  Engage a security professional to perform penetration testing on your application, specifically targeting the OAuth 2.0/OIDC flows and redirect URI handling.

5.  **Automated Security Scans:** Use automated security scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities, including misconfigured redirect URIs.

## 3. Conclusion

The "Wildcard Redirect URI" vulnerability is a serious security flaw that can lead to complete account compromise.  By adhering to the mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, and by maintaining a strong security posture throughout the development lifecycle, we can effectively eliminate this risk and ensure the security of our application and our users' data.
