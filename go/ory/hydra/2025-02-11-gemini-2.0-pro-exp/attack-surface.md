# Attack Surface Analysis for ory/hydra

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Secrets and Credentials](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_secrets_and_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Hydra relies on various secrets (system secret, database credentials, TLS certificates, client secrets). Improper management exposes these secrets.
    *   **Hydra Contribution:** Hydra's core functionality depends on the secure management of these secrets. Its configuration files and database store these sensitive values.  This is *entirely* within Hydra's domain.
    *   **Example:** A developer accidentally commits the `SYSTEM_SECRET` to a public GitHub repository.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of Hydra. Attackers can decrypt all data, forge tokens, and impersonate any client or user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   *Never* hardcode secrets in code or configuration files.
        *   Use strong, randomly generated secrets.
        *   Implement regular secret rotation.
        *   Use environment variables to inject secrets into Hydra's runtime environment.
        *   Regularly scan code repositories and logs for accidental secret exposure.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Transport Security (TLS/HTTPS)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_transport_security__tlshttps_.md)

*   **Description:** Failure to properly secure Hydra's endpoints (public and admin) with TLS allows for Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
    *   **Hydra Contribution:** Hydra exposes network endpoints for OAuth 2.0/OIDC flows, which *must* be secured with TLS.  The configuration of TLS is a direct responsibility of the Hydra deployment.
    *   **Example:** Hydra is deployed without TLS, or with an expired certificate, allowing an attacker on the same network to intercept authorization codes and tokens.
    *   **Impact:** Interception of sensitive data (tokens, authorization codes, user information), leading to unauthorized access and impersonation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS for *all* Hydra endpoints (public and admin).
        *   Use strong, modern TLS configurations (TLS 1.3, strong cipher suites).
        *   Regularly update and monitor TLS certificates.
        *   Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) to handle TLS termination, ensuring it's also securely configured.
        *   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for internal communication between Hydra and its database.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Admin API](./attack_surfaces/exposed_admin_api.md)

*   **Description:** The Hydra Admin API provides full control over Hydra's configuration. Exposing it publicly allows attackers to take over the system.
    *   **Hydra Contribution:** Hydra provides a powerful Admin API for managing clients, policies, and other configurations.  The exposure and protection of this API are *directly* related to Hydra's deployment.
    *   **Example:** The Admin API is accessible from the public internet without any authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control of Hydra by the attacker. They can create malicious clients, modify policies, and access all data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   *Never* expose the Admin API to the public internet.
        *   Use network segmentation (firewalls, VPCs) to restrict access to trusted networks only.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the Admin API (e.g., mTLS, API keys with limited scope).
        *   Consider using a VPN or bastion host for administrative access.

## Attack Surface: [Open Redirect Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/open_redirect_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** If Hydra doesn't properly validate the `redirect_uri`, attackers can redirect users to malicious sites after authentication.
    *   **Hydra Contribution:** Hydra uses the `redirect_uri` parameter as part of the OAuth 2.0 flow to redirect the user back to the client application. *Hydra's validation of this parameter is the key security control.*
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious authorization request with a `redirect_uri` pointing to their own website. After the user authenticates, Hydra redirects them to the attacker's site, which can then steal the authorization code or token.
    *   **Impact:** Token theft, phishing attacks, and potential compromise of user accounts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Hydra *must* strictly validate the `redirect_uri` against a pre-registered whitelist of allowed redirect URIs for each client.
        *   Avoid using wildcard matching in redirect URIs unless absolutely necessary and with careful consideration of the security implications.

## Attack Surface: [Unpatched Hydra Version](./attack_surfaces/unpatched_hydra_version.md)

* **Description:** Running an outdated version of Hydra with known vulnerabilities.
    * **Hydra Contribution:** Vulnerabilities may exist within Hydra's codebase itself. This is entirely within Hydra's domain.
    * **Example:** A known vulnerability in Hydra allows for remote code execution, and an attacker exploits this vulnerability because the system is not patched.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to complete system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a known, exploitable vulnerability exists) or High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Hydra to the latest stable version.
        * Monitor ORY Hydra security advisories and release notes.
        * Implement a robust patching process.
