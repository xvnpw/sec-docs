# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ory/hydra

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Client Registration and Verification (within Hydra)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_client_registration_and_verification__within_hydra_.md)

**1. Strict Client Registration and Verification (within Hydra)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Manual Approval (via Admin API):**  Use Hydra's Admin API to manually approve or reject client registration requests.  This prevents automated, malicious client creation.
    2.  **Redirect URI Whitelist (in `hydra.yml`):**  Configure Hydra (via `hydra.yml` or the Admin API) to *only* allow pre-approved, exact-match redirect URIs.  Prohibit wildcards in production.
    3.  **Client ID/Secret Generation (Hydra's responsibility):**  Rely on Hydra to generate unique, cryptographically strong client IDs (UUIDs) and secrets.
    4.  **Regular Client Review (via Admin API):**  Use Hydra's Admin API to periodically list and review registered clients.  Deactivate inactive or suspicious clients using the API.
    5.  **Client Secret Rotation (via Admin API):** Use Hydra's Admin API to update a client's secret. This should be done regularly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client Impersonation (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from registering malicious clients.
    *   **Open Redirect (if redirect URIs are abused) (Medium Severity):** Strict redirect URI validation within Hydra prevents this.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Client Impersonation:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Open Redirect:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Redirect URI whitelist is enforced in the Hydra configuration (`hydra.yml`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated client secret rotation via the Admin API is not yet implemented.
    *   Regular client review process using the Admin API is manual.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Client Authentication (Hydra Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/strong_client_authentication__hydra_configuration_.md)

**2. Strong Client Authentication (Hydra Configuration)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`private_key_jwt` Preference (in `hydra.yml` and client config):** Configure Hydra (via `hydra.yml`) to *prefer* `private_key_jwt` for client authentication.  When creating clients (via the Admin API), set the appropriate `token_endpoint_auth_method`.
    2.  **`tls_client_auth` Enforcement (in `hydra.yml` and client config):** For highly sensitive clients, configure Hydra to *require* `tls_client_auth`.  Set the `token_endpoint_auth_method` accordingly during client creation.
    3.  **`client_secret_basic` Discouragement (policy and client config):**  Avoid using `client_secret_basic` and `client_secret_post` whenever possible.  If used, ensure strong secrets (managed externally).
    4.  **Secret Strength (external, but impacts Hydra):** While Hydra doesn't directly enforce secret *strength* for `client_secret_basic/post`, the *system* generating/managing those secrets must enforce strong policies.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client Impersonation (High Severity):** Strong client authentication within Hydra makes impersonation very difficult.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (against `/oauth2/token`) (Medium Severity):** Significantly reduces effectiveness.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Client Impersonation:** Risk drastically reduced.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hydra is configured to support multiple authentication methods (`private_key_jwt`, `tls_client_auth`, etc.).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Enforcement of `private_key_jwt` or `tls_client_auth` for *all* sensitive operations is not yet complete (some endpoints still allow weaker methods).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Short-Lived Access Tokens and Refresh Token Rotation (Hydra Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/short-lived_access_tokens_and_refresh_token_rotation__hydra_configuration_.md)

**3. Short-Lived Access Tokens and Refresh Token Rotation (Hydra Configuration)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access Token Expiry (in `hydra.yml`):** Configure Hydra (via `hydra.yml`) to issue short-lived access tokens (e.g., `ttl.access_token: 15m`).
    2.  **Refresh Token Expiry (in `hydra.yml`):** Configure a reasonable refresh token lifetime (e.g., `ttl.refresh_token: 24h`).
    3.  **Refresh Token Rotation (in `hydra.yml`):** Ensure Hydra's built-in refresh token rotation is *enabled* (this is usually the default, but verify).
    4.  **Absolute Refresh Token Expiry (in `hydra.yml`):** Configure an absolute maximum lifetime for refresh tokens (e.g., `ttl.refresh_token_absolute: 30d`).
    5.  **Token Revocation Endpoint (`/oauth2/revoke`):** Ensure Hydra's `/oauth2/revoke` endpoint is enabled and accessible.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Token Leakage (High Severity):** Short lifespans and rotation minimize the impact.
    *   **Token Replay Attacks (Medium Severity):** Reduced effectiveness.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Token Leakage:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Token Replay Attacks:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Access and refresh token expiry are configured in `hydra.yml`.
    *   Hydra's built-in refresh token rotation is enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Absolute refresh token expiry is not yet configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting (Hydra Configuration and Reverse Proxy)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting__hydra_configuration_and_reverse_proxy_.md)

**4. Rate Limiting (Hydra Configuration and Reverse Proxy)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Endpoint-Specific Rate Limits (Reverse Proxy):** Configure rate limits in the reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Traefik) *in front of* Hydra.  This is crucial because Hydra itself doesn't have built-in, fine-grained rate limiting. Target:
        *   `/oauth2/auth`
        *   `/oauth2/token` (especially failed attempts)
        *   `/oauth2/revoke`
        *   `/userinfo`
        *   `/oauth2/keys`
    2. **Hydra Configuration for Global Limits:** While not fine-grained, review Hydra's configuration for any global connection limits or resource constraints that might help mitigate extreme DoS attacks.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents overwhelming Hydra.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (Medium Severity):** Slows down and deters attacks.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Similar to credential stuffing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic rate limiting is configured in the reverse proxy (Nginx).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Fine-grained, endpoint-specific rate limits in the reverse proxy are not yet fully optimized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Audience and Scope Restriction (Client Configuration via Admin API)](./mitigation_strategies/audience_and_scope_restriction__client_configuration_via_admin_api_.md)

**5.  Audience and Scope Restriction (Client Configuration via Admin API)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`aud` Claim (Client Configuration):** When creating or updating clients (via Hydra's Admin API), *always* set the `audience` field to the specific resource server(s) that should accept tokens issued to that client.
    2.  **Scope Limitation (Client Configuration):**  When creating or updating clients, grant only the *minimum necessary* scopes required for the client's functionality.  Avoid granting overly broad scopes.  Use Hydra's Admin API to manage this.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Token Misuse (Medium Severity):** Prevents a token intended for one service from being used to access another.
    *   **Excessive Permissions (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential damage if a client is compromised.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Token Misuse:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Excessive Permissions:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Scopes are defined and managed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent enforcement of the `aud` claim for all clients is not yet complete.  Some older clients may be missing this configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Hydra Configuration Review and Updates](./mitigation_strategies/hydra_configuration_review_and_updates.md)

**6.  Hydra Configuration Review and Updates**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regular `hydra.yml` Review:**  Periodically review Hydra's configuration file (`hydra.yml`) for security best practices.  Ensure settings like token lifetimes, CORS configuration, and enabled features are appropriate.
    2.  **Hydra Updates:**  Stay up-to-date with the latest stable version of ORY Hydra.  Monitor release notes and security advisories.  Update promptly when security patches are released.
    3. **CORS Configuration (in `hydra.yml`):**  Carefully configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings within Hydra's configuration.  Avoid using wildcard origins (`*`).  Specify only the allowed, trusted origins.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misconfiguration (High Severity):**  Addresses potential security weaknesses due to incorrect settings.
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Updates patch known security flaws in Hydra itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Misconfiguration:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hydra is updated semi-regularly.
    * CORS configuration is defined, but could be more restrictive.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal process for immediate updates upon security releases is not in place.
    *   Regular, scheduled reviews of `hydra.yml` are not yet formalized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [OpenID Connect Conformance Testing (Against Hydra)](./mitigation_strategies/openid_connect_conformance_testing__against_hydra_.md)

**7. OpenID Connect Conformance Testing (Against Hydra)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regular Testing:** Run the OpenID Connect Conformance Test Suite against your *deployed* Hydra instance.
    2.  **Automated Testing (Ideal):** Integrate the conformance tests into a CI/CD pipeline to run automatically.
    3.  **Issue Remediation:** Address any failures or warnings reported by the tests.  This may involve configuration changes to Hydra.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Non-Compliance with OIDC Specification (Medium Severity):** Ensures correct implementation, preventing interoperability and security issues.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior (Medium Severity):** Identifies deviations from the specification.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Non-Compliance/Unexpected Behavior:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Conformance testing is not yet implemented.

This refined list focuses solely on actions directly related to ORY Hydra's configuration and operation, providing a more targeted set of mitigation strategies.
