## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Scripting Code (if supported by custom widgets or embedded browsers)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_scripting_code__if_supported_by_custom_widgets_or_embedded_browsers_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript or other scripting code into UI elements, typically within custom widgets or embedded browser components if the application utilizes them.

**Mechanism:** This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how the custom widget handles user input or external content, or by manipulating data that populates these widgets.

**Potential Impact:** Successful injection can lead to full control over the application's functionality, access to sensitive data displayed within the application, and potentially even access to the underlying system depending on the application's privileges and the nature of the embedded component.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious URLs into Hyperlinks or Text](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_urls_into_hyperlinks_or_text.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious URLs into hyperlinks or text displayed within the application's UI.

**Mechanism:** This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles user-provided content or by manipulating data sources that populate the UI.

**Potential Impact:** When a user clicks on the malicious link, they could be redirected to phishing websites to steal credentials, tricked into downloading malware, or sent to other harmful online locations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overlay Malicious UI on Top of Legitimate Elements](./attack_tree_paths/overlay_malicious_ui_on_top_of_legitimate_elements.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker overlays a deceptive UI element on top of a legitimate one, tricking the user into interacting with the malicious element instead.

**Mechanism:** This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in Fyne's rendering or event handling mechanisms to draw elements on top of others unexpectedly.

**Potential Impact:** This can be used to steal credentials by presenting a fake login prompt, trick users into confirming malicious actions, or manipulate them into providing sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Excessive or Malformed Input to UI Fields](./attack_tree_paths/send_excessive_or_malformed_input_to_ui_fields.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker sends unexpectedly large amounts of data or malformed input to UI input fields.

**Mechanism:** This exploits a lack of proper input validation and sanitization within the application's code.

**Potential Impact:** This can lead to application crashes, denial of service by consuming excessive resources, or trigger unexpected behavior due to buffer overflows or other input-related vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Bugs in Fyne's Rendering Pipeline](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_bugs_in_fyne's_rendering_pipeline.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts specific UI configurations or provides data that triggers vulnerabilities within Fyne's rendering engine.

**Mechanism:** This requires identifying and exploiting specific bugs in how Fyne renders UI elements, potentially related to handling specific data types, sizes, or combinations of UI components.

**Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to application crashes, unexpected visual behavior, or in more severe cases, memory corruption or other security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors in Application-Specific Event Handling Code](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_in_application-specific_event_handling_code.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker triggers specific sequences of UI events that expose flaws in the application's custom event handling logic.

**Mechanism:** This relies on finding logical errors in the code that processes UI events, leading to unintended state changes or actions.

**Potential Impact:** The impact varies depending on the specific logic error, potentially leading to data corruption, unauthorized actions, or application instability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Handling of Event Data Leading to Exploitable Conditions](./attack_tree_paths/improper_handling_of_event_data_leading_to_exploitable_conditions.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates the data associated with UI events to trigger vulnerabilities in the application's event handlers.

**Mechanism:** This involves exploiting a lack of proper validation or sanitization of data received through event handlers, potentially leading to injection vulnerabilities or other exploitable conditions.

**Potential Impact:** The impact varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or other security compromises.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Fyne Application](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_fyne_application.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. Success at this level means the attacker has gained unauthorized control or access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit UI Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ui_manipulation.md)

This node is critical because successful exploitation opens up multiple avenues for attack, including injecting malicious content and spoofing the user interface, all of which can have significant impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Content into UI Elements](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_content_into_ui_elements.md)

This node is critical as it directly enables high-risk paths like injecting scripting code for full control or malicious URLs for phishing and malware distribution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Spoof UI Elements](./attack_tree_paths/spoof_ui_elements.md)

This node is critical because it directly enables the high-risk path of overlaying malicious UI elements, which can be used for credential theft and user manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rendering Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rendering_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

This node is critical because vulnerabilities in the rendering engine can lead to application crashes and unexpected behavior, impacting availability and potentially revealing underlying issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Event Handling Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_event_handling_mechanisms.md)

This node is critical because successful exploitation allows attackers to manipulate the application's behavior by triggering unintended actions or bypassing security checks through vulnerabilities in custom event handlers.
