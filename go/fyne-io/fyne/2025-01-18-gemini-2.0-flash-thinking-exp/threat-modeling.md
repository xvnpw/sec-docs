# Threat Model Analysis for fyne-io/fyne

## Threat: [Malicious Input in Text Fields](./threats/malicious_input_in_text_fields.md)

**Description:** An attacker enters specially crafted text into a text input field within the Fyne application. This input could contain escape sequences, format string specifiers, or other characters that, if not properly sanitized by Fyne's input handling, could be interpreted by the underlying system or libraries in unintended ways. This could lead to arbitrary code execution if the input is used in a vulnerable function or command *by Fyne or a component it uses*.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the application or even the underlying system. Data corruption or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Affected Fyne Component:** `widget.Entry` (text input widget), potentially affecting Fyne's internal input processing logic.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all text input fields, *utilizing Fyne's built-in validation mechanisms where available*.
*   Escape or reject potentially harmful characters *at the Fyne level*.
*   Avoid directly passing unsanitized input *received through Fyne widgets* to system commands or functions known to be vulnerable to format string bugs or injection attacks.

## Threat: [Malicious File Handling via Drag and Drop](./threats/malicious_file_handling_via_drag_and_drop.md)

**Description:** An attacker drags and drops a malicious file onto the Fyne application window. If *Fyne's drag and drop handling* doesn't properly validate the file type, content, or path, it could be tricked into processing a harmful file. This could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities (accessing files outside the intended directory) or execution of malicious scripts if *Fyne attempts to process or interact with the dropped file in a vulnerable way*.

**Impact:**  Access to sensitive files, execution of arbitrary code, potential compromise of the application or system.

**Affected Fyne Component:** Event handling for drag and drop events on relevant widgets or the main window *within Fyne's event system*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict validation of dropped files, including file type, size, and content *within the Fyne application's drag and drop event handlers*.
*   Sanitize file paths to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities *when handling dropped files through Fyne*.
*   Avoid directly executing dropped files without explicit user confirmation and thorough security checks *after Fyne has processed the drop event*.

## Threat: [Platform-Specific API Vulnerabilities](./threats/platform-specific_api_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Fyne's internal implementation interacts with underlying operating system APIs. Vulnerabilities in these APIs, or improper handling of data passed to or received from them *by Fyne's platform-specific backends*, could be exploited by an attacker. This could be specific to certain operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

**Impact:**  Depends on the specific API vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution on the affected platform.

**Affected Fyne Component:**  Platform-specific backend implementations within Fyne (e.g., `internal/driver/glfw` or similar).

**Risk Severity:** High (can be critical depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stay updated with security advisories for the target operating systems *and Fyne releases that address platform-specific issues*.
*   Be cautious when using Fyne features that directly interact with native APIs *and understand the underlying platform implications*.
*   Report any observed unexpected or potentially vulnerable behavior related to platform API interactions to the Fyne developers.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Go Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_go_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Fyne relies on various Go libraries. If any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, those vulnerabilities could be exploited in Fyne applications *through Fyne's usage of those libraries*. Attackers could leverage these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.

**Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.

**Affected Fyne Component:**  Indirectly affects the entire application through Fyne's dependency management and usage of vulnerable libraries.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability (can be critical or high).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Fyne and its dependencies to the latest versions *as Fyne updates often include dependency updates*.
*   Monitor Fyne release notes and security advisories for information on dependency updates and potential vulnerabilities.
*   Consider contributing to or supporting efforts to audit and secure Fyne's dependencies.
