# Attack Surface Analysis for fyne-io/fyne

## Attack Surface: [Image Handling Vulnerabilities via Malicious Images](./attack_surfaces/image_handling_vulnerabilities_via_malicious_images.md)

**Description:**  The application loads and renders an image file that is specifically crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying image decoding libraries used by Fyne.

**How Fyne Contributes:** Fyne provides widgets and functionalities to display images, relying on Go's standard `image` package or potentially other image decoding libraries.

**Example:** A specially crafted PNG or JPEG file could trigger a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issue in the image decoding library, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Sanitize and validate image files before loading and displaying them.
    * Consider using sandboxing or isolated processes for image decoding.
    * Keep Fyne and its dependencies (including Go's standard library) updated to patch known vulnerabilities in image handling.
* **Users:**
    * Be cautious about opening images from untrusted sources within the application.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Custom Widget Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_custom_widget_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  A custom widget developed for the Fyne application contains security flaws that can be exploited.

**How Fyne Contributes:** Fyne provides the framework for creating custom widgets, but the security of these widgets depends entirely on the developer's implementation.

**Example:** A custom widget that handles user input without proper sanitization could be vulnerable to injection attacks. A widget that interacts with external systems might have vulnerabilities in its communication logic.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, could range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Follow secure coding practices when developing custom widgets.
    * Thoroughly test and audit custom widgets for vulnerabilities.
    * Sanitize and validate all user input handled by custom widgets.
    * Avoid unnecessary system calls or external interactions within custom widgets.

## Attack Surface: [Drag and Drop of Malicious Files](./attack_surfaces/drag_and_drop_of_malicious_files.md)

**Description:** A user drags and drops a malicious file onto the Fyne application, and the application processes this file in a vulnerable way.

**How Fyne Contributes:** Fyne provides drag-and-drop functionality, allowing applications to receive dropped files.

**Example:** An application might attempt to parse a dropped file without proper validation, leading to a buffer overflow or other vulnerability if the file is maliciously crafted.

**Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Thoroughly validate the type and content of any files received via drag and drop before processing them.
    * Consider using sandboxing or isolated processes for handling dropped files.
    * Implement file size limits and other restrictions.
* **Users:**
    * Be cautious about dragging and dropping files from untrusted sources onto applications.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Preferences (if storing highly sensitive data)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_preferences__if_storing_highly_sensitive_data_.md)

**Description:** The application stores sensitive user preferences using Fyne's built-in preference mechanism without proper encryption or protection.

**How Fyne Contributes:** Fyne provides a simple API for storing application preferences (`Preferences()`). The underlying storage mechanism's security depends on the operating system.

**Example:** Storing API keys, passwords, or other sensitive information in plain text within the application's preferences could allow unauthorized access if the storage is compromised.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential compromise of user accounts or data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Avoid storing sensitive information in application preferences if possible.
    * If sensitive data must be stored, encrypt it before saving it using a robust encryption algorithm.
    * Consider using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms if available.
* **Users:**
    * Be aware of the sensitivity of information they are configuring within the application.
