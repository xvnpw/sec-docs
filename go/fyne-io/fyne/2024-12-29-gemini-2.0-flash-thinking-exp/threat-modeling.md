### High and Critical Fyne Application Threats

This list details high and critical threats that directly involve the Fyne UI toolkit.

*   **Threat:** Command Injection via Unsanitized Input in Entry Widget
    *   **Description:** An attacker could enter malicious commands into an `Entry` widget (text input field) if the application directly uses this input in system calls or shell commands without proper sanitization. The attacker might use shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&`) to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. This directly involves the `widget.Entry` component of Fyne.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the system running the application, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Fyne Component:** `widget.Entry`
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never directly use user input from `Entry` widgets in system calls or shell commands.
        *   If system interaction is necessary, use parameterized commands or dedicated libraries that handle escaping and sanitization.
        *   Implement strict input validation to allow only expected characters and formats.

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Improper Text Rendering in a Custom Widget
    *   **Description:** If a developer creates a custom widget that renders user-provided text without proper escaping, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code. When another user views this content, the injected script could execute in their application context, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting them to malicious sites, or performing actions on their behalf. This directly involves the custom widget functionality within Fyne.
    *   **Impact:**  Account compromise, data theft, unauthorized actions within the application.
    *   **Affected Fyne Component:** Custom widgets, potentially involving `canvas` or external rendering libraries within Fyne.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize and escape user-provided text before rendering it in custom widgets.
        *   If using web technologies for rendering within a custom widget, follow standard web security practices for preventing XSS.
        *   Review and audit custom widget code for potential injection vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via File Selection Dialog
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the file selection dialog (e.g., `dialog.NewFileOpen`) to access files or directories outside the intended scope. By entering relative paths like `../`, the attacker might be able to browse and potentially access sensitive files on the user's system that the application should not have access to. This directly involves the `dialog` component of Fyne.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data, potential for data modification or deletion if the application also allows saving files.
    *   **Affected Fyne Component:** `dialog.NewFileOpen`, `dialog.NewFileSave`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict the initial directory and allowed file types in the file selection dialog to limit the attacker's ability to navigate to sensitive areas.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize the selected file path before performing any file operations.
        *   Operate with the least necessary privileges.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities in Fyne's Underlying Libraries
    *   **Description:** Fyne relies on various Go libraries. If any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, applications using Fyne could inherit those vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities if they are present in the deployed application. This directly involves the dependencies that Fyne uses.
    *   **Impact:**  Wide range of potential exploits depending on the vulnerable dependency, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Fyne Component:**  Indirectly affects the entire Fyne framework and applications built with it.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Can range from Low to Critical depending on the specific vulnerability, but vulnerabilities leading to remote code execution are Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Fyne and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address vulnerable dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Fyne and its dependencies.
