* **Insecure Custom Widgets:**
    * **Description:** Developers can create custom widgets to extend Fyne's functionality. If these widgets are not implemented securely, they can introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **How Fyne Contributes:** Fyne provides the API and mechanisms for creating and integrating custom widgets. The framework itself doesn't enforce security within these custom implementations.
    * **Example:** A custom widget rendering user-provided HTML without proper sanitization could be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks within the application's context.
    * **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary code within the application, data theft, UI manipulation, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure Coding Practices: Developers should follow secure coding practices when implementing custom widgets, including input validation, output encoding, and avoiding known vulnerabilities.
        * Code Reviews: Conduct thorough code reviews of custom widget implementations.
        * Sandboxing (if feasible): Explore options for sandboxing custom widget code to limit its access and potential impact.

* **Unvalidated Data Binding:**
    * **Description:** Fyne's data binding feature allows UI elements to be directly linked to application data. If user input is directly bound to sensitive data or application logic without validation, it can be exploited.
    * **How Fyne Contributes:** Fyne provides the `Bind` mechanism, which, if used carelessly, can directly connect untrusted input to critical application state.
    * **Example:** A text input field bound directly to a setting that controls administrative privileges. A malicious user could enter a value that elevates their privileges.
    * **Impact:** Privilege escalation, modification of application state, unexpected behavior, potential for further exploitation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Input Validation: Always validate user input before binding it to application data or using it in critical operations.
        * Data Sanitization: Sanitize user input to remove potentially harmful characters or code.
        * Use Intermediary Logic: Instead of directly binding to sensitive data, bind to an intermediary variable and perform validation and sanitization in the application logic before updating the sensitive data.

* **Malicious Custom Themes:**
    * **Description:** If the application allows users to load or apply custom themes, a malicious theme could exploit vulnerabilities in Fyne's theme handling or introduce malicious visual elements.
    * **How Fyne Contributes:** Fyne provides mechanisms for loading and applying custom themes. If not handled carefully, this can introduce an attack vector.
    * **Example:** A malicious theme could include specially crafted image files that exploit vulnerabilities in Fyne's image loading library, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, potential for code execution (depending on underlying vulnerabilities).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Theme Validation: Implement strict validation of custom theme files before loading them.
        * Sandboxing: If possible, load themes in a sandboxed environment to limit their potential impact.
        * Restrict Theme Sources: Limit the sources from which users can load themes.
        * User Awareness: Educate users about the risks of using untrusted custom themes.

* **External Process Interaction (Command Injection via Fyne):**
    * **Description:** If the Fyne application uses system calls or interacts with external processes based on user input or UI actions, it can be vulnerable to command injection if input is not properly sanitized.
    * **How Fyne Contributes:** While Fyne itself doesn't directly execute arbitrary commands, if the application uses Fyne's UI elements to gather input that is then used to construct commands for external processes, it becomes a vector.
    * **Example:** A text field in the Fyne application allows a user to enter a filename to be processed by an external tool. If the application doesn't sanitize the filename, an attacker could inject malicious commands (e.g., `file.txt & rm -rf /`).
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the user's system, potentially leading to data loss, system compromise, or further attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid System Calls with User Input: Minimize the use of system calls or external process execution based on user input.
        * Input Sanitization: If system calls are necessary, rigorously sanitize all user-provided input before using it in commands.
        * Use Parameterized Commands: When interacting with external processes, use parameterized commands or APIs that prevent command injection.
        * Principle of Least Privilege: Run external processes with the minimum necessary privileges.
