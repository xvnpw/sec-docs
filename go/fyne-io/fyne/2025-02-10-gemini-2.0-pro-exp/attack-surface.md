# Attack Surface Analysis for fyne-io/fyne

## Attack Surface: [Rendering Engine Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/rendering_engine_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying graphics rendering engine (OpenGL, Metal, Vulkan) *through* Fyne's interaction with it.  This is the most critical Fyne-specific attack surface.
*   **How Fyne Contributes:** Fyne acts as an intermediary between the application code and the graphics API.  Bugs in Fyne's rendering logic, its handling of graphics data, or insufficient input sanitization before passing data to the graphics API could expose vulnerabilities.  This is *not* just about vulnerabilities in the graphics drivers themselves (though those are important), but specifically about how Fyne *uses* those drivers.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a specially designed SVG image with an extremely large number of nested elements or malformed path data.  When Fyne attempts to render this image, it doesn't sufficiently limit the complexity or sanitize the input, leading to a buffer overflow or other error in the graphics driver *because of how Fyne passed the data*. This could cause a crash (DoS) or, in rare cases, potentially lead to arbitrary code execution (ACE) if the driver vulnerability is severe enough.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) is highly likely.  Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) is rare but possible, depending on the underlying graphics driver vulnerability and how Fyne interacts with it.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (DoS is likely, ACE is rare but severe).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Fyne developers *must* perform rigorous fuzz testing of the rendering engine with a wide variety of inputs, including malformed and edge-case data.  Implement robust error handling and *strict* bounds checking for *all* graphics operations within Fyne's code.  Implement input sanitization and complexity limits for *any* user-provided content that is rendered, *before* passing it to the graphics API. This includes images, text (especially with complex formatting), and custom widget drawing. Consider sandboxing the rendering process if feasible.
    *   **Users:** Keep system graphics drivers up-to-date.  This mitigates the underlying driver vulnerabilities, but doesn't fully address the risk if Fyne itself has flaws in how it uses the driver. Avoid opening files from untrusted sources within the Fyne application.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe External Resource Loading (Specifically *through* Fyne APIs)](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_external_resource_loading__specifically_through_fyne_apis_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities related to how Fyne applications load external resources (images, files, etc.) *specifically when using Fyne's resource loading APIs*. This is distinct from general file handling vulnerabilities.
*   **How Fyne Contributes:** Fyne provides APIs (like `fyne.LoadResourceFromPath`, `canvas.NewImageFromFile`, etc.) for loading resources.  If these APIs *themselves* have flaws in path sanitization or resource type validation, they introduce a direct vulnerability.  The key here is that the vulnerability is in *Fyne's code*, not just in a general file handling mistake by the application developer.
*   **Example:**  An attacker discovers that `fyne.LoadResourceFromPath` (hypothetically) doesn't properly handle symbolic links or relative paths containing ".." sequences on a particular operating system.  They craft a malicious application package that includes a specially crafted symbolic link.  When the Fyne application uses `fyne.LoadResourceFromPath` to load a resource, the attacker is able to access files outside the application's intended directory (path traversal).  *Or*, a vulnerability in an image parsing library is triggered *because* Fyne's `canvas.NewImageFromFile` didn't perform sufficient checks on the image file before passing it to the underlying library.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) (through vulnerable libraries that Fyne uses), Path Traversal (if Fyne's path handling is flawed), Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Fyne developers *must* ensure that *all* resource loading APIs (e.g., `fyne.LoadResourceFromPath`, `canvas.NewImageFromFile`, etc.) perform rigorous path sanitization and validation *before* interacting with the underlying operating system or libraries.  This includes handling symbolic links, relative paths, and different operating system path conventions correctly.  Validate resource types and sizes *before* passing them to potentially vulnerable parsing libraries.  Keep underlying libraries (image decoders, font renderers, etc.) up-to-date, and monitor for security advisories related to those libraries.
    *   **Users:**  Avoid opening files from untrusted sources within the Fyne application. This is a general precaution, but it's particularly important if there are concerns about Fyne's resource handling.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Inter-Process Communication (IPC) (If Used and facilitated by Fyne)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_inter-process_communication__ipc___if_used_and_facilitated_by_fyne_.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in any IPC mechanisms used by the Fyne application, specifically if Fyne provides or facilitates this IPC.
    * **How Fyne Contributes:** If Fyne provides any helper functions, wrappers, or default configurations for IPC, and these are insecure, then Fyne directly contributes to the attack surface.
    * **Example:** A Fyne application uses a Fyne-provided (hypothetical) IPC helper that defaults to an unsecured named pipe. A malicious application connects to the pipe and sends crafted messages, causing the Fyne application to crash or behave unexpectedly.
    * **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data manipulation, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (if poorly implemented IPC is used and facilitated by Fyne).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** If Fyne provides any IPC functionality, ensure it uses secure mechanisms by default (e.g., authenticated and encrypted channels). Provide clear documentation on secure IPC usage. Implement robust input validation and access controls for IPC messages. Follow the principle of least privilege.
        * **Users:** No direct user mitigation, relies on secure development.
