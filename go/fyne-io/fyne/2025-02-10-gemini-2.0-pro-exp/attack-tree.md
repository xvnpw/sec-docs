## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Fyne's Rendering/GUI Components](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_fyne's_renderinggui_components.md)

*   **1.1 Input Validation Bypass [HIGH]:**
    *   **Description:**  The attacker attempts to bypass Fyne's built-in input validation mechanisms for widgets like `Entry`, `TextGrid`, etc., to inject malicious data.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement robust input validation *within the application logic*, in addition to Fyne's validation.
        *   Fuzz test all input widgets with unexpected characters, large inputs, and boundary conditions.
        *   Sanitize all user-provided input before using it in any sensitive operations (e.g., file paths, database queries, drawing operations).
        *   Regularly review Fyne's source code for input handling in relevant widgets.

    *   **1.1.1 ... (Example: Entry Widget Bypass) [HIGH]:**
        *   **Description:** Specifically targeting the `Entry` widget (or similar text input widgets) to inject malicious code or data that bypasses expected validation.  This could involve injecting special characters, exceeding length limits, or exploiting type confusion vulnerabilities.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Same as 1.1, with a specific focus on the `Entry` widget and its configuration.

*   **1.4 Canvas API Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Fyne's `canvas` package, which provides low-level drawing capabilities.  This is a critical area because it can lead to direct manipulation of graphics memory.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Be extremely careful with input data and memory management when using the `canvas` API.
        *   Avoid using untrusted data directly in drawing operations.
        *   Thoroughly review the `canvas` package source code for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Use memory safety tools (e.g., Valgrind, AddressSanitizer) during development and testing.
        *   Validate all coordinates, sizes, and transformations used in drawing operations.
        *   Consider using a higher-level abstraction if possible, rather than directly manipulating the `canvas` API.

    *   **1.4.1 ... (Example: Raster Image Buffer Overflow) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:**  A specific vulnerability where the attacker provides a malformed or oversized image to the `canvas.Raster` object, causing a buffer overflow and potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Strictly validate the size and format of all image data before passing it to `canvas.Raster`.
            *   Use memory safety tools to detect buffer overflows.
            *   Consider using a safer image loading library if possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Fyne's Data Handling/Storage Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_fyne's_data_handlingstorage_mechanisms.md)

*   **2.2 File I/O Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how Fyne handles file input/output operations. This is a critical area because it can lead to arbitrary file access, data exfiltration, or RCE.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Always validate file paths provided by the user, even if they come from a Fyne file dialog.
        *   Use Fyne's APIs to restrict file access to specific directories (sandboxing).
        *   Avoid using absolute paths.
        *   Use the most restrictive file permissions possible.
        *   Sanitize file names and paths to prevent path traversal attacks.
        *   Review Fyne's file I/O implementation for potential vulnerabilities.

    *   **2.2.1 ... (Example: Path Traversal) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:**  A specific vulnerability where the attacker uses specially crafted file paths (e.g., containing "../" sequences) to access files outside of the intended directory.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement robust path sanitization to remove or escape any characters that could be used for path traversal.
            *   Use a whitelist approach to allow access only to specific files or directories.
            *   Avoid constructing file paths directly from user input.
