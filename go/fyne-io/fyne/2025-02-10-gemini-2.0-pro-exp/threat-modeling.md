# Threat Model Analysis for fyne-io/fyne

## Threat: [Threat 1: Buffer Overflow in Fyne's Rendering Engine](./threats/threat_1_buffer_overflow_in_fyne's_rendering_engine.md)

*Description:* An attacker crafts malicious input (e.g., a specially designed image, text string, or custom widget data) that, when processed by Fyne's rendering engine, causes a buffer overflow. This could overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The attacker might exploit a vulnerability in how Fyne handles image scaling, text layout, or custom widget rendering.
*Impact:* Arbitrary code execution on the user's system, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*Affected Fyne Component:* `fyne.io/fyne/v2/canvas` (and related sub-packages like `canvas/raster`, `canvas/text`), potentially platform-specific rendering backends (OpenGL, etc.).
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Fyne developers should conduct rigorous fuzz testing of the rendering engine with various inputs.
        *   Implement robust bounds checking in all rendering-related code.
        *   Use memory-safe languages or techniques (Go's built-in bounds checking helps, but vulnerabilities are still possible).
        *   Regularly audit the rendering code for potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
    *   **Application Developer:**
        *   Keep Fyne updated to the latest version.
        *   Validate and sanitize all user-provided data *before* passing it to Fyne widgets, especially images and text.
        *   Avoid using overly complex or custom-drawn widgets unless absolutely necessary and thoroughly tested.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Cross-Context Scripting (XCS) in `widget.Entry` or `widget.RichText` (with `widget.Webview`)](./threats/threat_2_cross-context_scripting__xcs__in__widget_entry__or__widget_richtext___with__widget_webview__ad74389f.md)

*Description:* If an application displays user-provided text in a `widget.Entry` or `widget.RichText` without proper sanitization, and this text is later used within a `widget.Webview`, an attacker could inject malicious scripts. This leverages the interaction between Fyne widgets and a web context.
*Impact:* The attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of the `widget.Webview`, potentially accessing local files (if the webview is configured to allow it) or communicating with external servers.
*Affected Fyne Component:* `fyne.io/fyne/v2/widget.Entry`, `fyne.io/fyne/v2/widget.RichText`, `fyne.io/fyne/v2/widget.Webview` (specifically when used together).
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:
    *   **Developer:**
        *   *Always* sanitize and escape user-provided text before displaying it in a `widget.Entry` or `widget.RichText`, especially if that text might be used in a `widget.Webview` later.
        *   Use HTML escaping if the text might be used in a `widget.Webview`.
        *   Configure the `widget.Webview` securely:
            *   Disable JavaScript if it's not absolutely necessary.
            *   Restrict access to local files using appropriate settings.
            *   Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) within the webview.
    * **Application Developer:**
        * Avoid mixing contexts. If possible, don't use user input from Fyne widgets directly within a `widget.Webview`. If you must, perform thorough sanitization.

## Threat: [Threat 3: Information Disclosure via `fyne.io/fyne/v2/storage` (if Fyne's implementation is flawed)](./threats/threat_3_information_disclosure_via__fyne_iofynev2storage___if_fyne's_implementation_is_flawed_.md)

*Description:*  While *application developers* are responsible for encrypting sensitive data, a hypothetical vulnerability *within Fyne's `storage` implementation itself* could lead to information disclosure.  For example, if Fyne incorrectly handles file permissions, uses a predictable storage location, or has a bug in its abstraction layer that bypasses platform-specific security mechanisms. This is distinct from the application developer *misusing* the API.
*Impact:* Disclosure of sensitive information stored using Fyne's `storage` API, even if the application developer *attempts* to encrypt it (because the underlying Fyne implementation is flawed).
*Affected Fyne Component:* `fyne.io/fyne/v2/storage`.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:
    *   **Fyne Developer:**
        *   Thoroughly audit the `storage` implementation on all supported platforms to ensure it correctly uses platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (Keychain, Credential Manager, etc.).
        *   Ensure that file permissions are set correctly to prevent unauthorized access.
        *   Avoid using predictable or easily guessable storage locations.
        *   Provide clear documentation on the security guarantees of the `storage` API and any limitations.
    *   **Application Developer:**
        *   Keep Fyne updated.
        *   While you *should* encrypt data yourself, be aware that a Fyne bug could still expose it.  Consider using platform-specific APIs directly for highly sensitive data if you have concerns about Fyne's `storage` implementation.

## Threat: [Threat 4: DLL Hijacking on Windows (Affecting Fyne's Dependencies)](./threats/threat_4_dll_hijacking_on_windows__affecting_fyne's_dependencies_.md)

*Description:* Fyne (or one of its dependencies) loads a DLL from an insecure location on Windows. An attacker places a malicious DLL with the same name in a directory that's searched before the legitimate DLL's location (e.g., the application's directory, the current working directory). When the application loads the DLL, it loads the malicious one instead.
*Impact:* Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application.
*Affected Fyne Component:* Any Fyne component that uses external DLLs (this is platform-specific and depends on Fyne's dependencies).
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Ensure that all DLLs are loaded from trusted locations (e.g., the system directory, a signed application directory).
        *   Use absolute paths when loading DLLs.
        *   Use the `SetDllDirectory` function to restrict the DLL search path.
        *   Digitally sign all DLLs.
    *   **Application Developer/User:**
        *   Install the application in a secure location (e.g., `Program Files`).
        *   Avoid running the application from untrusted directories.
        *   Keep the operating system and antivirus software up to date.
