# Attack Surface Analysis for fyne-io/fyne

## Attack Surface: [Custom Widget Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_widget_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Security flaws introduced by developers when creating custom UI widgets in Fyne.

**How Fyne Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Fyne provides the framework for creating custom widgets, but the security of these widgets depends entirely on the developer's implementation. Fyne doesn't inherently enforce security measures within custom widget code.

**Example:** A custom widget displaying user-provided HTML without proper sanitization, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact:**  Can range from minor UI disruptions to complete application compromise, depending on the vulnerability. XSS can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or malicious actions performed on behalf of the user.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Implement robust input validation and sanitization within custom widget logic.
    * Avoid directly rendering unsanitized user input.
    * Follow secure coding practices when handling data within widgets.
    * Regularly review and test custom widget code for vulnerabilities.
* **Users:**  Difficult to mitigate directly as it's a developer issue. Be cautious about applications from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Drag and Drop Security Issues](./attack_surfaces/drag_and_drop_security_issues.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the implementation of drag and drop functionality in Fyne applications.

**How Fyne Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Fyne allows developers to implement drag and drop. Improper handling of dragged data can introduce security risks.

**Example:** An application might automatically process dragged files without proper validation, allowing an attacker to drag a malicious executable into the application's data directory. Or, path traversal vulnerabilities if the application doesn't sanitize the paths of dragged files.

**Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, file system manipulation, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Thoroughly validate the type and content of dragged data.
    * Implement checks to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities when handling dragged files.
    * Request explicit user confirmation before processing dragged files.
* **Users:**
    * Be cautious about dragging and dropping files from untrusted sources into applications.

## Attack Surface: [External Resource Loading Exploits](./attack_surfaces/external_resource_loading_exploits.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities related to how Fyne applications load external resources like images or fonts.

**How Fyne Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Fyne provides mechanisms for loading external resources. If these mechanisms are not used securely, they can be exploited.

**Example:** Loading an image from an untrusted source that contains a buffer overflow vulnerability, potentially leading to code execution. Or, loading a specially crafted font that exploits vulnerabilities in the font rendering library.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial of service, application crashes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Only load resources from trusted sources.
    * Implement checks on the integrity and validity of external resources.
    * Use secure protocols (HTTPS) for fetching remote resources.
* **Users:**
    * Be cautious about applications that load resources from arbitrary URLs.
