## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE 1. Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_1__exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

This node represents the broad category of attacks that exploit weaknesses in how the application processes user input received through Fyne widgets. Successful exploitation can lead to various forms of injection and control flow manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE 1.1.2. Command Injection through Unsanitized Input Passed to OS Commands](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_1_1_2__command_injection_through_unsanitized_input_passed_to_os_comma_ded77ab2.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker crafts malicious input (e.g., through a text field) that, when processed by the application, is directly passed to a system command without proper sanitization.
* Exploitation: The attacker leverages shell metacharacters or command separators within the input to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
* Impact: Critical - Full control over the system where the application is running.
* Mitigation: Never directly pass user input to system commands. Use parameterized commands or secure alternatives. Implement strict input validation and sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH 1.1.4. Injection into External Services via Data Binding](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_1_4__injection_into_external_services_via_data_binding.md)

* Attack Vector: The application uses Fyne's data binding feature to send user-controlled data to external services (e.g., databases, APIs) without proper sanitization.
* Exploitation: An attacker injects malicious code or commands (e.g., SQL injection, API calls) into the data that is bound and sent to the external service.
* Impact: Significant - Compromise of the external service, data breaches, data manipulation.
* Mitigation: Sanitize data before using it in external service requests, even if it's bound through Fyne. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions. Follow secure API usage guidelines.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE 3. Exploit Operating System Interaction Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_3__exploit_operating_system_interaction_vulnerabilities.md)

This node encompasses vulnerabilities arising from how the Fyne application interacts with the underlying operating system. Weaknesses in file system operations, system calls, or other OS-level interactions can be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE 3.1. Path Traversal via File Dialogs](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_3_1__path_traversal_via_file_dialogs.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker uses Fyne's file dialogs to select file paths that navigate outside the intended directories, accessing unauthorized files or directories.
* Exploitation: By manipulating the selected path (e.g., using "../" sequences), the attacker can bypass intended access restrictions and potentially read sensitive files or overwrite critical system files.
* Impact: Significant - Access to sensitive files, potential for system compromise if critical files are modified.
* Mitigation: Fyne should sanitize paths returned by file dialogs. Application developers should validate and sanitize file paths before using them. Implement proper file access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE 4. Exploit Data Storage and Persistence Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_4__exploit_data_storage_and_persistence_vulnerabilities.md)

This node focuses on vulnerabilities related to how the application stores and persists data, especially if Fyne provides built-in storage mechanisms. Insecure storage can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE 4.1. Insecure Local Storage](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_4_1__insecure_local_storage.md)

* Attack Vector: The application uses Fyne's local storage mechanisms to store sensitive data without proper encryption or access controls.
* Exploitation: An attacker can directly access the local storage files (e.g., through file system access) and read the sensitive data.
* Impact: Significant - Data breach, exposure of confidential information.
* Mitigation: Fyne should provide secure storage options or encourage developers to use secure storage practices. Application developers should encrypt sensitive data stored locally. Implement appropriate file system permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE 5.1. Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Update Process](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_5_1__man-in-the-middle_attack_on_update_process.md)

* Attack Vector: If the application uses an insecure update mechanism, an attacker can intercept the update process.
* Exploitation: The attacker intercepts the communication between the application and the update server, replacing the legitimate update with a malicious one.
* Impact: Critical - Application compromise, malware installation, complete control over the application's execution.
* Mitigation: Fyne's update mechanism should use HTTPS for secure communication and verify the signatures of updates to ensure authenticity and integrity.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH 6.1. Phishing Attacks Mimicking Fyne UI Elements](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_6_1__phishing_attacks_mimicking_fyne_ui_elements.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker creates fake UI elements (windows, dialogs, buttons) that visually resemble legitimate Fyne components within the application's interface.
* Exploitation: The attacker tricks the user into interacting with the fake UI elements, leading them to unknowingly provide sensitive information (e.g., credentials, personal data) or perform unintended actions.
* Impact: Significant - Data theft, account compromise, unauthorized actions performed by the user.
* Mitigation: Application developers should use clear branding and visual cues to distinguish their application from generic system prompts. User education is crucial to help users identify phishing attempts. Implement mechanisms to verify the authenticity of UI elements if feasible.
