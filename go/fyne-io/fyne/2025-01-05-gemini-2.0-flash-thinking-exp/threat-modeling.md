# Threat Model Analysis for fyne-io/fyne

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)-like Attacks within the GUI](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss_-like_attacks_within_the_gui.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts or HTML into user-controlled data fields that are then rendered by Fyne widgets (like `Label` or `RichText`). This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's context, UI manipulation (e.g., displaying fake login prompts), or information theft by redirecting user actions.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application, UI spoofing, information disclosure, session hijacking (within the application).
*   **Affected Fyne Component:** `widget.Label`, `widget.RichText`, potentially custom widgets, data binding mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input sanitization for all user-provided data displayed in UI elements.
    *   Use Fyne's built-in sanitization functions where available.
    *   Avoid directly embedding unsanitized user input into rendering contexts.
    *   Consider Content Security Policy (CSP)-like mechanisms if applicable within Fyne's rendering context (though this is less direct than web CSP).

## Threat: [Drag and Drop Vulnerabilities](./threats/drag_and_drop_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could drag and drop malicious files or data onto the application, exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's file handling or data processing logic *within Fyne's drag and drop API*. This could lead to path traversal, buffer overflows, or execution of malicious code.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, file system access, denial of service.
*   **Affected Fyne Component:** `widget. ড্রপকন্টেইনার`, `fyne. ড্রপহ্যান্ডলার`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of dropped files and data within the ` ড্রপহ্যান্ডলার`.
    *   Avoid directly executing dropped files.
    *   Use secure file handling practices, avoiding direct path manipulation based on user input received through the drag and drop API.
    *   Implement appropriate file type checks and restrictions within the ` ড্রপহ্যান্ডলার`.

## Threat: [File System Access Vulnerabilities](./threats/file_system_access_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly handled file paths or permissions within the Fyne application, particularly when using Fyne's file dialogs or storage APIs, could allow attackers to access or modify files outside the intended application sandbox. This could occur when the application uses user-provided input from these components to construct file paths without proper validation.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, modification or deletion of important data.
*   **Affected Fyne Component:** `dialog.FileDialog`, `storage.FileOpen`, `storage.FileSave`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of all user-provided file paths obtained from Fyne's file dialogs and storage APIs.
    *   Use absolute paths or relative paths from a known safe directory.
    *   Avoid constructing file paths directly from user input obtained from these Fyne components.
    *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when accessing the file system.

## Threat: [Process Execution and Command Injection](./threats/process_execution_and_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses Fyne's capabilities or underlying Go libraries to execute external processes, improper input sanitization could lead to command injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the user's system with the privileges of the application. This is relevant if Fyne provides any wrappers or utilities that facilitate process execution without proper safeguards.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the user's system, potential system compromise.
*   **Affected Fyne Component:**  Potentially through any Fyne API that wraps `os/exec` or provides process execution functionality (though Fyne doesn't directly expose this extensively, it's relevant if developers build on top of Fyne and use these Go features).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid executing external processes if possible.
    *   If necessary, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization.
    *   Never construct command strings directly from user input.
    *   Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to execute external processes.

## Threat: [Build System Vulnerabilities](./threats/build_system_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Go toolchain or other build dependencies used to compile the Fyne application could potentially introduce security flaws into the final executable. This is indirectly related to Fyne as it's a dependency in the build process.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of malware or vulnerabilities into the application.
*   **Affected Fyne Component:**  The entire application, as the vulnerability is introduced during the build process, which includes Fyne.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use trusted and verified build environments.
    *   Employ checksum verification for build tools and dependencies, including Fyne.
    *   Consider using reproducible builds to ensure the integrity of the build process.
