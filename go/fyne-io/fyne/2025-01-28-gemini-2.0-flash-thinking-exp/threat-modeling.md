# Threat Model Analysis for fyne-io/fyne

## Threat: [Improper Input Sanitization in Fyne UI Elements (High Severity)](./threats/improper_input_sanitization_in_fyne_ui_elements__high_severity_.md)

*   **Threat:** Improper Input Sanitization in Fyne UI Elements
*   **Description:** An attacker inputs malicious data into Fyne UI elements (e.g., `Entry`, `TextArea`). The application fails to sanitize this input, and it's used in a way that allows command injection or arbitrary code execution. For example, unsanitized input from a `fyne.Entry` is directly passed to `os/exec.Command`, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with the application's privileges.
*   **Impact:** **Critical:** Arbitrary code execution on the user's system, full system compromise, data breach, complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   **Fyne Component Affected:** `Entry`, `TextArea`, `Select`, and other input UI elements; Application Logic handling input, specifically interaction with system commands or other sensitive operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Treat all input from Fyne UI elements as untrusted. Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization *before* using it in any application logic, especially when interacting with system resources or external systems.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Command Construction:**  Never directly construct system commands using user input. If system interaction is necessary, use parameterized commands or safer alternatives that prevent command injection.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Fyne application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential command injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Review and Security Audits:** Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits to identify and eliminate potential input sanitization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Event Handlers leading to Critical Logic Bypass (High Severity)](./threats/insecure_event_handlers_leading_to_critical_logic_bypass__high_severity_.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Event Handlers leading to Critical Logic Bypass
*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the application's UI or event flow to bypass critical security checks implemented in Fyne event handlers. This allows them to circumvent authentication, authorization, or access control mechanisms, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality. For example, by rapidly clicking buttons or manipulating UI elements in an unexpected order, an attacker bypasses a multi-step authentication process implemented in button click event handlers.
*   **Impact:** **High:** Bypass of critical security controls, unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, privilege escalation, potential data breach, significant compromise of application security.
*   **Fyne Component Affected:** Fyne Event Handling mechanism (e.g., `Button.OnTapped`, `MenuItem.OnActivated`), Application Logic within event handlers responsible for security enforcement.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Security Logic Outside Event Handlers:**  Move critical security logic (authentication, authorization, access control) outside of UI event handlers into dedicated security modules or functions. Event handlers should *call* these secure modules, not implement the core security logic directly.
    *   **State Management and Validation:** Implement robust state management to track application state and validate user actions against the current state, preventing bypass through UI manipulation.
    *   **Server-Side Validation (if applicable):** If the Fyne application interacts with a backend server, enforce security checks and validation on the server-side as well, preventing client-side bypasses from being effective.
    *   **Security Testing of Event Flows:**  Thoroughly test different event flows and UI interactions to identify potential bypass vulnerabilities in event handling logic.

## Threat: [Critical Vulnerabilities in Fyne Dependencies (High to Critical Severity)](./threats/critical_vulnerabilities_in_fyne_dependencies__high_to_critical_severity_.md)

*   **Threat:** Critical Vulnerabilities in Fyne Dependencies
*   **Description:** Fyne relies on external Go packages and system libraries. A critical vulnerability is discovered in one of these dependencies (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability in an image processing library or a critical security flaw in a networking library used by Fyne). An attacker can exploit this dependency vulnerability through the Fyne application, potentially leading to remote code execution or other severe impacts.
*   **Impact:** **High to Critical:**  Remote code execution, application compromise, data breach, denial of service, depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability. Impact can be system-wide if the vulnerability allows for privilege escalation.
*   **Fyne Component Affected:** Fyne dependencies (Go packages, system libraries).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity and exploitability of the dependency vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Proactive Dependency Monitoring:** Implement proactive monitoring of Fyne dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools and security advisories.
    *   **Rapid Dependency Updates:** Establish a process for rapidly updating Fyne and its dependencies to the latest versions as soon as security patches are released for identified vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Pinning and Review:** Pin dependency versions to ensure consistent builds and carefully review dependency updates for potential security regressions or newly introduced vulnerabilities.
    *   **Supply Chain Security:**  Consider the security of the entire software supply chain, including the sources of Fyne dependencies and the build process.
