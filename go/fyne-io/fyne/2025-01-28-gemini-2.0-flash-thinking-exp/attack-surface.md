# Attack Surface Analysis for fyne-io/fyne

## Attack Surface: [Input Sanitization within Fyne Widgets](./attack_surfaces/input_sanitization_within_fyne_widgets.md)

*   **Description:** Failure to properly sanitize user input received through Fyne widgets can lead to injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Fyne Contribution:** Fyne provides widgets for user input, and the lack of built-in sanitization directly places the responsibility and risk on the developer.
*   **Example:** An application uses a `Label` widget to display text from an `Entry` widget without sanitization. If a user enters input intended for command injection, and the application uses this unsanitized input in a system call, command injection can occur.
*   **Impact:** Command Injection, SQL Injection, Data Manipulation, or Remote Code Execution depending on how the unsanitized input is used in the application's backend or system interactions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to strictly control the format and content of user inputs accepted by Fyne widgets.
    *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:**  Encode or escape user-provided data before using it in any context where injection is possible (system calls, database queries, etc.).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Minimize the privileges of the application process to limit the impact of successful injection attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Image Processing Bugs in Fyne Rendering Engine](./attack_surfaces/image_processing_bugs_in_fyne_rendering_engine.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within Fyne's rendering engine, specifically in image processing components, can be exploited by providing malicious images, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service.
*   **Fyne Contribution:** Fyne's core functionality includes rendering UI elements, which involves image loading and processing. Bugs in this Fyne-specific code directly create this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A Fyne application displays images using Fyne's image widgets. A specially crafted image file (e.g., a malformed PNG or JPEG) is loaded by Fyne's rendering engine. A buffer overflow vulnerability in Fyne's image decoding code is triggered, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service (application crash).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Fyne Updates:**  Keep the Fyne library updated to the latest version. Fyne developers actively address and patch vulnerabilities in the rendering engine.
    *   **Report Vulnerabilities:** If you discover potential rendering engine vulnerabilities, immediately report them to the Fyne project maintainers.
    *   **Limit Image Sources:** If feasible, restrict the sources of images processed by the application to trusted origins.

## Attack Surface: [Font Rendering Issues in Fyne Rendering Engine](./attack_surfaces/font_rendering_issues_in_fyne_rendering_engine.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in font rendering libraries or Fyne's font handling within its rendering engine can be exploited through specially crafted fonts, potentially leading to crashes or unexpected behavior, and in severe cases, code execution.
*   **Fyne Contribution:** Fyne handles font rendering as part of its UI rendering process. Vulnerabilities in Fyne's font handling or underlying font libraries directly contribute to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A Fyne application renders text using a font loaded by Fyne. A specially crafted malicious font file is processed by Fyne's rendering engine. A vulnerability in the font parsing or rendering code is triggered, leading to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption, potentially enabling code execution.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application crash), potentially Remote Code Execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Fyne Updates:** Keep Fyne updated to benefit from security patches in font handling and rendering.
    *   **Font Source Control:**  If possible, control the fonts used by the application and avoid loading fonts from untrusted sources.
    *   **Report Vulnerabilities:** Report any suspected font rendering vulnerabilities to the Fyne project.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Fyne Rendering](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_fyne_rendering.md)

*   **Description:** Maliciously crafted UI elements or rapid UI updates within a Fyne application can exhaust system resources (CPU, GPU, memory) through the rendering process, leading to denial-of-service.
*   **Fyne Contribution:** Fyne's rendering engine is responsible for drawing the UI. Inefficient rendering or vulnerabilities in how Fyne handles complex UI elements can be exploited to cause resource exhaustion.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a Fyne UI definition with an extremely large number of UI elements or triggers rapid, continuous UI updates. Fyne's rendering engine struggles to process this, consuming excessive CPU and memory, eventually leading to application unresponsiveness or crash (DoS).
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application unresponsiveness or crash).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **UI Element Limits:** Implement limits on the number of UI elements that can be dynamically created or rendered at once.
    *   **Rate Limiting UI Updates:**  Implement rate limiting for UI updates to prevent excessive rendering load.
    *   **Efficient UI Design:** Design UI layouts and animations to be efficient and avoid unnecessary complexity that could strain the rendering engine.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor application resource usage (CPU, memory) to detect and respond to potential resource exhaustion attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Event Handling Vulnerabilities in Fyne](./attack_surfaces/event_handling_vulnerabilities_in_fyne.md)

*   **Description:**  The event handling mechanism in Fyne could be exploited if not robust. Maliciously crafted events or event floods might lead to denial-of-service or unexpected application behavior.
*   **Fyne Contribution:** Fyne's event system is fundamental to application interactivity. Vulnerabilities in how Fyne processes and dispatches events can be directly exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker floods the Fyne application with a large number of events (e.g., mouse clicks, key presses). If Fyne's event handling is not designed to handle such floods, it could lead to excessive CPU usage, memory exhaustion, or application unresponsiveness (DoS). In more complex scenarios, vulnerabilities in event dispatch logic could potentially be exploited for unexpected behavior.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application unresponsiveness or crash), potentially unexpected application behavior.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting Event Processing:** Implement rate limiting on event processing to prevent event floods from overwhelming the application.
    *   **Robust Event Handlers:** Ensure event handlers are efficient and avoid resource-intensive operations within event handlers that could be easily triggered by malicious events.
    *   **Fyne Updates:** Keep Fyne updated to benefit from any fixes or improvements in event handling robustness.
