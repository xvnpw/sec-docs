## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Core GUI Component Vulnerabilities -> Input Injection via Widget](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_core_gui_component_vulnerabilities_-_input_injection_via_widget.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to inject malicious input strings into Fyne GUI widgets like Text Entry fields, Lists, or other input components.
*   **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    *   **Crafted Input String to Overflow Buffer in Widget Rendering/Handling (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Description:**  A specially crafted input string, when processed by the Fyne widget's rendering or input handling code, causes a buffer overflow. This can overwrite adjacent memory regions.
        *   **Impact:**  Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and full system compromise.
        *   **Mitigation:** Fuzz testing Fyne widgets with various input types and sizes, rigorous memory safety checks in Fyne's widget rendering and input handling code, using memory-safe programming practices.
    *   **Exploit Heap Overflow in Image/Canvas Rendering (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Description:**  If Fyne uses heap-allocated memory for rendering images or canvas elements, vulnerabilities like heap overflows can occur.  Crafted image data or canvas operations could trigger this.
        *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and full system compromise.
        *   **Mitigation:** Memory safety audits of Fyne's image and canvas rendering code, using memory-safe image processing libraries, input validation for image data and canvas operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities (Go Runtime, Libraries used by Fyne)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__go_runtime__libraries_used_by_fyne_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target known vulnerabilities in the Go runtime environment or third-party libraries that Fyne depends on. These vulnerabilities are then exploited through the Fyne application.
*   **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    *   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Go's Networking, Crypto, or other libraries that Fyne utilizes (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Description:**  Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (e.g., from CVE databases) in the Go standard library components used by Fyne, such as networking libraries (for network-related Fyne features) or cryptographic libraries (if Fyne uses crypto functions).
        *   **Impact:**  Can range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution, depending on the specific vulnerability. Crypto vulnerabilities can compromise data confidentiality and integrity.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Regularly update the Go runtime to the latest stable version, monitor security advisories for Go, and promptly apply security patches.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in third-party Go libraries that Fyne depends on (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in any third-party Go libraries that Fyne directly or indirectly depends on.
        *   **Impact:**  Impact depends on the vulnerability and the role of the vulnerable library. Could range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution, or data breaches.
        *   **Mitigation:** Maintain an inventory of Fyne's dependencies, regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools, and update vulnerable libraries promptly. Consider using dependency management tools that aid in security updates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application-Specific Misuse of Fyne (Developer Errors) -> Insecure Handling of User Input via Fyne Widgets](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application-specific_misuse_of_fyne__developer_errors__-_insecure_handling_of_user_input_via_e3f66984.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities arising from insecure handling of user input *within the application code* when using Fyne widgets. This is due to developer errors, not Fyne framework flaws.
*   **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    *   **Command Injection via Text Entry Widget (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Description:**  The application takes user input from a Fyne Text Entry widget and directly executes it as a system command without proper sanitization or validation.
        *   **Impact:**  Critical - Full system compromise. Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the application.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Never execute user-provided input as system commands directly. If command execution is necessary, use parameterized commands or secure libraries to prevent injection. Implement strict input validation and sanitization.
    *   **Path Injection via File/Directory Selection Widgets (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Description:** The application uses file paths or directory paths selected by the user through Fyne's file/directory selection widgets without proper validation. This can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.
        *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized file access, data disclosure, potentially file manipulation or deletion outside the intended scope.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Sanitize and validate file paths obtained from Fyne file dialogs. Ensure that the application restricts file access to intended directories and prevents traversal to parent directories or sensitive system locations. Use secure file access APIs and avoid constructing file paths directly from user input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application-Specific Misuse of Fyne (Developer Errors) -> Logic Flaws in Application Code Interacting with Fyne](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application-specific_misuse_of_fyne__developer_errors__-_logic_flaws_in_application_code_int_750febc8.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit logic flaws in the application's code that interacts with Fyne features, particularly in areas like state management and UI updates. These flaws are application-specific and not inherent to Fyne itself.
*   **Nodes within this Path (While not marked as Critical Nodes individually, the path is high-risk):**
    *   **State Management Errors leading to UI Manipulation:**
        *   **Description:** Flaws in the application's state management logic, especially when updating the UI using Fyne, can allow attackers to manipulate the UI in unintended ways. This could bypass access controls, reveal hidden data, or trigger unintended application behavior.
        *   **Impact:** Logic bypass, unauthorized access to features or data, data disclosure, application malfunction.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Thoroughly review and test application state management logic, especially around UI updates. Use clear state management patterns and ensure proper access control checks are enforced in the application logic, not just the UI.
    *   **Race Conditions in UI Updates and Data Processing:**
        *   **Description:** Race conditions can occur when UI updates triggered by Fyne events and background data processing are not properly synchronized. This can lead to inconsistent application state, UI glitches, and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.
        *   **Impact:** UI inconsistencies, data corruption, potential for logic bypass or denial of service if race conditions lead to application crashes or hangs.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Implement proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, channels in Go) to protect shared state when updating the UI and processing data concurrently. Thoroughly test for race conditions, especially in event handlers and background tasks that interact with the UI.
