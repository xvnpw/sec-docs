## 5. Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates the typical data flow within a Fyne application, focusing on the path of user interaction events and the rendering pipeline. This simplified model highlights the key stages of event processing and UI updates.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "User Interaction"
    A["User Input (Keyboard, Mouse, Touch)"] --> B["OS Input Events"]
    end
    subgraph "Driver Layer"
    B --> C["Driver Input Handler"]
    C --> D["Fyne Input Events"]
    end
    subgraph "Fyne Core Layer"
    D --> E["Event Management System"]
    E --> F["Widget Event Handlers"]
    F --> G["Application Logic"]
    G --> H["Widget State Update"]
    H --> I["Layout Engine"]
    I --> J["Canvas Renderer"]
    end
    subgraph "Driver Layer"
    J --> K["Driver Rendering API (OpenGL, Vulkan, Software)"]
    K --> L["OS Graphics System"]
    end
    subgraph "Display"
    L --> M["Screen Display"]
    end
```

**Data Flow Description:**

1. **User Input:** A user interacts with the application through input devices such as keyboard, mouse, or touch screen.
2. **OS Input Events:** The operating system captures these physical inputs and translates them into platform-specific input events.
3. **Driver Input Handler:** The Fyne driver, specific to the running platform, receives these OS input events.
4. **Fyne Input Events:** The driver converts the platform-specific events into Fyne's abstract, platform-independent input event model (e.g., `KeyDown`, `MouseClick`, `TouchDown`).
5. **Event Management System:** Fyne's core event management system receives these abstract input events.
6. **Widget Event Handlers:** The event system routes events to the appropriate widgets based on focus, event propagation rules, and widget hierarchy. Widget-specific event handlers (e.g., button click handlers, text entry change handlers) are then invoked.
7. **Application Logic:** Widget event handlers typically trigger application-specific logic to respond to user interactions and update application state.
8. **Widget State Update:** Application logic may modify the state of widgets, such as changing button labels, updating list data, or modifying text entry content.
9. **Layout Engine:** When widget states change, the layout engine recalculates the arrangement of widgets within containers to maintain proper positioning and sizing, ensuring a responsive UI.
10. **Canvas Renderer:** The canvas renderer is responsible for drawing widgets and their content onto the canvas based on their current state, layout, and theme.
11. **Driver Rendering API:** The driver utilizes platform-specific graphics APIs (OpenGL, Vulkan, Software rendering) to perform the actual rendering operations on the underlying graphics system.
12. **OS Graphics System:** The OS graphics system handles low-level rendering tasks and manages the display output.
13. **Screen Display:** The final rendered output is presented to the user on the screen.

## 6. Security Considerations (Initial)

This section outlines initial security considerations for Fyne, categorized for clarity and serving as a starting point for comprehensive threat modelling. Security in Fyne, like any GUI framework, is a shared responsibility between the toolkit developers and application developers.

**Categories of Security Considerations:**

* **Input Security:**
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Fyne applications must rigorously validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities such as injection attacks. This includes command injection (if applications interact with shell commands), and potentially UI injection if dynamic UI generation is used. Fyne widgets should also internally sanitize input to prevent vulnerabilities within the toolkit itself.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS) via Input:** Maliciously crafted inputs could potentially overwhelm the application or Fyne's input processing, leading to DoS. Input handling should be robust and resource-conscious.

* **System Security:**
    * **Memory Safety:** Go's inherent memory safety features significantly reduce the risk of memory-related vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and dangling pointers. However, developers should still adhere to secure coding practices, especially when using `unsafe` Go code or interacting with external C libraries (though Fyne minimizes this).
    * **Dependency Management:** Secure dependency management is crucial to prevent supply chain attacks. Fyne's use of Go modules necessitates regular auditing and updating of dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
    * **Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Fyne's driver layer interacts directly with the OS. Vulnerabilities in platform-specific graphics drivers, windowing systems, or input handling mechanisms could indirectly affect Fyne applications. Fyne drivers should be designed to minimize exposure to and mitigate potential OS-level vulnerabilities.
    * **Resource Management:** Improper resource management within Fyne or in applications built with it (e.g., memory leaks, excessive CPU usage, file handle exhaustion) could lead to DoS. Fyne should be designed for resource efficiency, and developers should be mindful of resource usage in their applications.

* **Data Security:**
    * **Data Storage Security:** Applications using Fyne's `storage` package to store sensitive data must implement appropriate security measures, such as encryption at rest and secure storage practices. Fyne should provide guidance and potentially built-in features to facilitate secure data storage.
    * **Data Handling in Widgets:**  Widgets that handle sensitive data (e.g., password fields) should be designed to minimize exposure of that data in memory and during rendering.

* **Application Security (Developer Responsibility):**
    * **Secure Coding Practices:** Developers using Fyne are responsible for adopting secure coding practices in their application logic, event handlers, and data handling routines. Fyne provides the building blocks, but secure application development is paramount.
    * **WebAssembly (WebGL) Security:** When running in WebGL environments, Fyne applications operate within the browser's security sandbox. Developers must be aware of browser security policies, Content Security Policy (CSP), and potential cross-site scripting (XSS) risks if the application interacts with external web resources or dynamically generates web content.
    * **Update Mechanism:** A secure and reliable update mechanism for Fyne itself and for applications built with Fyne is essential to address security vulnerabilities promptly and deliver patches effectively.

**Future Threat Modelling:**

This design document will be the foundation for a detailed threat modelling exercise. This process will involve:

* **Asset Identification:**  Pinpointing critical assets within the Fyne system, such as user data, application code, the rendering pipeline, and system resources.
* **Threat Identification:**  Brainstorming potential threats targeting these assets, including injection attacks, DoS, privilege escalation, data breaches, and supply chain attacks.
* **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Analyzing Fyne's architecture and components to identify potential weaknesses that could be exploited by the identified threats.
* **Risk Assessment:**  Evaluating the likelihood and potential impact of each threat and vulnerability combination.
* **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Formulating and implementing mitigation strategies to reduce or eliminate the identified risks, including secure coding guidelines, architectural improvements, and security features.

* **Testing Framework:** Go's built-in testing framework (`testing` package) for unit and integration testing.

## 8. Deployment Model

Fyne applications offer flexible deployment options across various platforms:

* **Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux):** Deployment as standalone, native executable applications. Distribution can be through platform-specific packages (e.g., `.exe` for Windows, `.app` for macOS, `.deb` or `.rpm` for Linux distributions) or as cross-platform archives (e.g., `.zip`, `.tar.gz`).
* **Mobile (iOS, Android):** Deployment as mobile applications packaged and distributed through platform-specific app stores (Apple App Store, Google Play Store). This requires utilizing platform-specific build tools and workflows (e.g., Xcode for iOS, Android Studio for Android).
* **Web (WebGL):** Deployment as web applications that run within modern web browsers supporting WebGL. These applications can be hosted on standard web servers and accessed via URLs, leveraging browser-based security sandboxes.
