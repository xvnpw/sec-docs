## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using Wox Launcher - High-Risk Areas

**Objective:** Compromise application that uses Wox by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within Wox itself.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application via Wox Exploitation (Attacker Goal)
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Wox Plugin Vulnerabilities
        * **[CRITICAL NODE]** User Installs Malicious Plugin
        * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Compromise Plugin Repository/Distribution Channel
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Vulnerability in Existing Plugin
            * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Crafted Input via Wox Search
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Core Wox Vulnerabilities
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Command Injection
            * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Crafted Input in Wox Search/Custom Commands
        * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Exploit Bugs in Wox's Interaction with OS
    * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Exploit Wox Update Mechanism
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Update Process
            * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Intercept and Replace Update Package with Malicious Version

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Exploit Wox Plugin Vulnerabilities:**
    * This path represents the risk introduced by Wox's plugin system. Attackers can leverage malicious plugins or vulnerabilities in legitimate plugins to compromise the application. This is a high-risk area due to the potential for significant access granted to plugins and the reliance on user trust or the security of plugin distribution channels.
* **Exploit Vulnerability in Existing Plugin -> Crafted Input via Wox Search:**
    * This specific path highlights the danger of vulnerabilities within plugins that can be triggered through user input via the Wox search bar. If a plugin doesn't properly sanitize input, attackers can inject malicious code or commands that the plugin will execute.
* **Exploit Core Wox Vulnerabilities:**
    * This path focuses on vulnerabilities within the core Wox application itself. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can directly compromise the application and the underlying system.
* **Exploit Core Wox Vulnerabilities -> Command Injection:**
    * This path specifically targets the risk of command injection vulnerabilities within Wox. If Wox doesn't properly sanitize user input used in executing system commands (e.g., through custom commands), attackers can inject arbitrary commands that will be executed with the privileges of the Wox process.
* **Exploit Wox Update Mechanism -> Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Update Process:**
    * This path describes the risk of attackers intercepting the Wox update process and replacing legitimate updates with malicious versions. This can lead to widespread compromise as users unknowingly install malware disguised as an update.

**Critical Nodes:**

* **User Installs Malicious Plugin:**
    * This is a critical point of failure. If a user installs a plugin with malicious intent, that plugin can have significant access to the system and potentially the application's data and functionality. This often relies on social engineering tactics to trick users.
* **Compromise Plugin Repository/Distribution Channel:**
    * This node represents a critical failure in the plugin ecosystem. If the repository or distribution channel for Wox plugins is compromised, attackers can inject malicious plugins that will be distributed to unsuspecting users, leading to widespread compromise.
* **Crafted Input in Wox Search/Custom Commands:**
    * This node highlights the critical impact of command injection vulnerabilities. If an attacker can successfully inject commands through the Wox search bar or custom commands, they can execute arbitrary code on the system, leading to a severe compromise.
* **Exploit Bugs in Wox's Interaction with OS:**
    * This critical node represents vulnerabilities in how Wox interacts with the underlying operating system. Exploiting these bugs can lead to privilege escalation, allowing attackers to gain higher levels of access and control over the system.
* **Intercept and Replace Update Package with Malicious Version:**
    * This node represents a critical point of failure in the update process. If an attacker can successfully intercept and replace the legitimate Wox update package with a malicious one, they can compromise all systems that install the fake update, leading to a widespread and severe impact.
