**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Gemini (AI Language Model)

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed design overview of the ngrok system, a reverse proxy service that establishes secure tunnels from public-facing URLs to services running on private networks. This document is specifically tailored to facilitate subsequent threat modeling activities by providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's architecture, components, and data flow.

## 2. Goals

* Provide a clear, detailed, and accurate architectural overview of the ngrok system.
* Thoroughly identify key components and elucidate their interactions within the system.
* Precisely describe the data flow within the ngrok infrastructure, highlighting critical pathways.
* Emphasize initial security considerations, providing a strong foundation for threat analysis and risk assessment.

## 3. Non-Goals

* In-depth implementation details of the ngrok Agent or Cloud Service codebase.
* Granular performance metrics, benchmarking results, or optimization techniques.
* Exhaustive listing of all configuration options, command-line arguments, or API parameters.
* Discussion of ngrok's business model, pricing structures, or service level agreements (SLAs).

## 4. High-Level Architecture

The ngrok system operates on a client-server model, connecting the **ngrok Agent (Client)** running on a user's private network to the **ngrok Cloud Service (Server)**, a globally accessible infrastructure. This connection creates a secure tunnel through which traffic can flow.

```

**Key Interactions:**

* The **ngrok Agent**, initiated by the user, establishes an outbound, mutually authenticated, and encrypted tunnel to the **ngrok Cloud Service**.
* The **ngrok Cloud Service** assigns a unique, publicly accessible URL (or allows the use of custom domains) to this established tunnel.
* Incoming requests directed to this public URL are intercepted by the **ngrok Cloud Service**.
* The **ngrok Cloud Service** routes these requests through the established tunnel to the specific **ngrok Agent** that created it.
* The **ngrok Agent** then proxies these requests to the designated **Local Service** running on the user's machine.
* Responses from the **Local Service** traverse the reverse path, back through the tunnel and the **ngrok Cloud Service**, to the originating **Internet User**.

## 5. Component Design

This section provides a more detailed breakdown of the key components within the ngrok system.

### 5.1. ngrok Agent (Client)

* **Purpose:**  Acts as the secure endpoint on the user's private network, facilitating the connection to the ngrok Cloud Service and proxying traffic.
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Initiating and maintaining a persistent, mutually authenticated, and encrypted TLS connection to the ngrok Cloud Service.
    * Authenticating itself to the ngrok Cloud Service using API keys, OAuth tokens, or other credentials managed by the Control Plane.
    * Receiving traffic forwarded from the ngrok Cloud Service and proxying it to the configured Local Service.
    * Receiving responses from the Local Service and sending them back through the secure tunnel to the ngrok Cloud Service.
    * Managing the lifecycle of the tunnel (e.g., starting, stopping, reconnecting).
    * Optionally implementing features like request inspection, modification (through plugins or configuration), and local authentication enforcement.

### 5.2. ngrok Cloud Service

* **Purpose:** The core infrastructure responsible for managing tunnels, assigning public URLs, routing traffic, and providing management interfaces.
* **Key Components:**

    * **5.2.1. Tunnel Router:**
        * **Purpose:**  The central routing engine responsible for mapping incoming public requests to the correct active client tunnels.
        * **Responsibilities:**
            * Receiving decrypted HTTP/S requests from the TLS Termination Proxy.
            * Performing a lookup based on the hostname or tunnel identifier in the request to determine the appropriate active ngrok Agent.
            * Forwarding the request to the specific Regional Edge Server that maintains the connection to the target ngrok Agent.
            * Managing the state of active tunnels and their associated metadata.

    * **5.2.2. TLS Termination Proxy:**
        * **Purpose:**  Handles the termination of TLS/SSL connections originating from internet users, ensuring secure communication.
        * **Responsibilities:**
            * Decrypting incoming HTTPS traffic using server-side TLS certificates.
            * Performing certificate validation and potentially other security checks on the incoming connection.
            * Optionally re-encrypting traffic for internal communication within the ngrok Cloud Service (although often the connection to the Tunnel Router is within a trusted network).
            * Forwarding the decrypted HTTP request to the Tunnel Router.

    * **5.2.3. Global Load Balancer:**
        * **Purpose:**  Distributes incoming internet traffic across multiple geographically distributed Regional Edge Servers to ensure high availability and reduce latency.
        * **Responsibilities:**
            * Distributing incoming requests based on factors like geographic proximity, server load, and health status.
            * Performing health checks on Regional Edge Servers to ensure traffic is only routed to healthy instances.
            * Providing a single point of entry for internet traffic destined for ngrok tunnels.

    * **5.2.4. Regional Edge Servers:**
        * **Purpose:**  Serve as the entry points into the ngrok Cloud Service, establishing and maintaining the secure, persistent connections with individual ngrok Agents.
        * **Responsibilities:**
            * Accepting connections from ngrok Agents and establishing mutually authenticated and encrypted TLS tunnels.
            * Receiving forwarded requests from the Tunnel Router destined for connected ngrok Agents.
            * Forwarding these requests through the established secure tunnel to the appropriate ngrok Agent.
            * Receiving responses from the ngrok Agent and forwarding them back to the Tunnel Router (which then routes them back to the internet user).

    * **5.2.5. Control Plane (API, Dashboard, Authentication):**
        * **Purpose:** Provides the management interface for users to interact with the ngrok service, manage their accounts, and configure tunnels.
        * **Responsibilities:**
            * Handling user registration, login, and authentication (using methods like passwords, multi-factor authentication, and potentially integration with third-party identity providers).
            * Providing a RESTful API for programmatic management of tunnels, domains, and other resources.
            * Offering a web-based dashboard for users to monitor tunnel status, configure settings, and view usage.
            * Managing user accounts, API keys, authentication tokens, and billing information.
            * Enforcing authorization policies to control access to resources and actions.

## 6. Data Flow

This section details the step-by-step journey of a request from an internet user to a locally running service exposed through ngrok.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant "Internet User" as IU
    participant "Global Load Balancer" as GLB
    participant "Regional Edge Server" as RES
    participant "TLS Termination Proxy" as TTP
    participant "Tunnel Router" as TR
    participant "ngrok Agent" as NA
    participant "Local Service" as LS

    IU->>GLB: HTTPS Request to ngrok URL
    GLB->>RES: Forward Request
    RES->>TTP: Forward Request
    TTP->>TTP: TLS Decryption
    TTP->>TR: HTTP Request
    TR->>TR: Lookup Tunnel Mapping
    TR->>RES: Route to Client's Edge Server
    RES->>NA: Forward HTTP Request (Encrypted Tunnel)
    NA->>LS: Forward HTTP Request
    LS->>NA: HTTP Response
    NA->>RES: Forward HTTP Response (Encrypted Tunnel)
    RES->>TR: Forward HTTP Response
    TR->>TTP: Forward HTTP Response
    TTP->>TTP: TLS Encryption
    TTP->>RES: Forward HTTPS Response
    RES->>GLB: Forward HTTPS Response
    GLB->>IU: HTTPS Response
```

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Internet User initiates a request:** An **Internet User (IU)** sends an HTTPS request to the public URL provided by ngrok.
2. **Global Load Balancer receives the request:** The request arrives at the **Global Load Balancer (GLB)** of the ngrok Cloud Service.
3. **Load Balancer distributes the request:** The **GLB** selects an appropriate **Regional Edge Server (RES)** based on its load balancing algorithm and forwards the request.
4. **Regional Edge Server receives the request:** The chosen **RES** receives the incoming HTTPS request.
5. **TLS Termination:** The **RES** forwards the request to the **TLS Termination Proxy (TTP)**. The **TTP** decrypts the HTTPS traffic, exposing the underlying HTTP request.
6. **Forwarding to Tunnel Router:** The **TTP** forwards the decrypted HTTP request to the **Tunnel Router (TR)**.
7. **Tunnel Router Lookup:** The **TR** examines the hostname or tunnel identifier in the HTTP request to determine the corresponding active ngrok Agent.
8. **Routing to Client's Edge Server:** The **TR** identifies the specific **RES** that maintains the active, encrypted tunnel with the target **ngrok Agent (NA)** and routes the request to that **RES**.
9. **Forwarding to ngrok Agent:** The identified **RES** forwards the HTTP request through the established, encrypted tunnel to the **NA**.
10. **Forwarding to Local Service:** The **NA** receives the request and proxies it to the configured **Local Service (LS)** running on the user's machine.
11. **Local Service processes the request:** The **LS** handles the request and generates an HTTP response.
12. **Response back to ngrok Agent:** The **LS** sends the HTTP response back to the **NA**.
13. **Response through the tunnel:** The **NA** sends the HTTP response back through the encrypted tunnel to the **RES**.
14. **Response through Tunnel Router:** The **RES** forwards the HTTP response back to the **TR**.
15. **Response Encryption:** The **TR** forwards the HTTP response back to the **TTP**. The **TTP** encrypts the HTTP response using TLS.
16. **Response through Load Balancer:** The **TTP** forwards the HTTPS response back to the originating **RES**, which then forwards it to the **GLB**.
17. **Response to Internet User:** The **GLB** sends the HTTPS response back to the originating **IU**.

## 7. Security Considerations

This section expands on the security aspects of the ngrok system, providing a more detailed foundation for threat modeling.

* **Tunnel Security:**
    * **Mutual TLS Authentication:** The connection between the ngrok Agent and the ngrok Cloud Service utilizes mutual TLS authentication, ensuring both the client and server authenticate each other, preventing unauthorized clients from connecting.
    * **End-to-End Encryption:** The tunnel itself provides end-to-end encryption for the traffic passing through it, protecting data in transit.
* **TLS Termination Security:**
    * **Secure Key Management:** Private keys used for TLS termination are securely managed and protected.
    * **Regular Certificate Rotation:** TLS certificates are regularly rotated to minimize the impact of potential key compromise.
    * **Vulnerability Scanning:** The TLS termination infrastructure is regularly scanned for vulnerabilities.
* **Authentication and Authorization:**
    * **Strong API Key Management:** API keys used for client authentication should be treated as secrets and managed securely by users.
