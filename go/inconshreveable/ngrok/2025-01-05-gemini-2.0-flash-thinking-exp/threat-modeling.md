# Threat Model Analysis for inconshreveable/ngrok

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Public Access due to Missing `ngrok` Protection](./threats/unauthenticated_public_access_due_to_missing__ngrok__protection.md)

**Threat:** Unauthenticated Public Access due to Missing `ngrok` Protection

* **Description:**  A developer might forget to configure any form of access control within `ngrok` (even basic username/password in paid tiers), making the tunnel directly accessible to anyone on the internet. Attackers simply navigate to the `ngrok`-provided URL.
* **Impact:** Full, unauthenticated access to the locally running application, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized actions, and resource abuse.
* **Affected Component:** `ngrok` Tunnel (Public URL), `ngrok` Agent Configuration
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Always configure appropriate access controls within `ngrok`, even for development environments. Utilize `ngrok`'s authentication features (if available in your plan).
    * Automate `ngrok` configuration to enforce security settings.
    * Regularly review active `ngrok` tunnels and their access settings.

## Threat: [Account Takeover of `ngrok` Account](./threats/account_takeover_of__ngrok__account.md)

**Threat:** Account Takeover of `ngrok` Account

* **Description:** If an attacker gains access to the `ngrok` account credentials (through phishing, credential stuffing, leaked credentials, etc.), they can fully control the user's `ngrok` tunnels. This allows them to redirect traffic, expose unintended services, or even terminate legitimate tunnels.
* **Impact:** Complete loss of control over `ngrok` tunnels, potential redirection of traffic to malicious sites, exposure of other local services, and disruption of legitimate use.
* **Affected Component:** `ngrok` Account Management, `ngrok` API
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Enforce strong, unique passwords for the `ngrok` account.
    * Mandate and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the `ngrok` account.
    * Regularly review authorized devices and API keys associated with the `ngrok` account.
    * Monitor `ngrok` account activity for suspicious logins or configuration changes.

## Threat: [Malicious Tunnel Creation via Compromised `ngrok` Account](./threats/malicious_tunnel_creation_via_compromised__ngrok__account.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Tunnel Creation via Compromised `ngrok` Account

* **Description:**  An attacker who has compromised an `ngrok` account can create new, unauthorized tunnels. These tunnels could be used to expose malicious services running on the attacker's machine, potentially targeting other users or systems.
* **Impact:**  Exposure of malicious content or services using the compromised user's `ngrok` account, potentially leading to further attacks or reputational damage.
* **Affected Component:** `ngrok` Account Management, `ngrok` API, `ngrok` Tunnel Creation
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Secure the `ngrok` account with strong passwords and MFA.
    * Regularly monitor the active tunnels associated with the account and investigate any unfamiliar tunnels.
    * Implement alerts for new tunnel creations.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information through `ngrok` Web Interface or Logs (Account Compromise)](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_through__ngrok__web_interface_or_logs__account_compromise_.md)

**Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information through `ngrok` Web Interface or Logs (Account Compromise)

* **Description:** If an attacker compromises an `ngrok` account, they gain access to the `ngrok` web interface and potentially logs. This could reveal sensitive information about the tunnel configuration, traffic patterns, or even parts of the request/response data passing through the tunnel.
* **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information about the application, its users, or internal systems.
* **Affected Component:** `ngrok` Web Interface, `ngrok` Logging System
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Secure the `ngrok` account with strong credentials and MFA.
    * Be mindful of the type of data being transmitted through `ngrok` and its potential visibility in the `ngrok` interface and logs.
    * Understand `ngrok`'s data retention policies and consider their implications.
