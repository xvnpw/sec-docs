# Attack Surface Analysis for inconshreveable/ngrok

## Attack Surface: [Public Exposure of Internal Services](./attack_surfaces/public_exposure_of_internal_services.md)

**Description:** Making a previously internal service accessible on the public internet.

**How ngrok Contributes:** `ngrok` creates a publicly accessible URL (often on the `ngrok.io` domain) that directly tunnels to the locally running application.

**Example:** A developer is testing a new API endpoint locally and uses `ngrok` to share it with a remote colleague for feedback. An attacker discovers this `ngrok` URL and begins probing the API for vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the application, data breaches, exploitation of vulnerabilities, potential compromise of the underlying system.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*  Use `ngrok`'s authentication features (if available in your plan) to restrict access.
*  Implement strong authentication and authorization within the application itself.
*  Avoid exposing sensitive or production-like data through `ngrok` tunnels.
*  Use `ngrok` tunnels for the shortest time necessary and terminate them when not in use.
*  Consider IP whitelisting if supported by your `ngrok` plan.

## Attack Surface: [Reliance on ngrok's Security](./attack_surfaces/reliance_on_ngrok's_security.md)

**Description:** The security of the application is now partially dependent on the security of `ngrok`'s infrastructure and services.

**How ngrok Contributes:** All traffic passes through `ngrok`'s servers, making the application vulnerable to any security weaknesses in their platform.

**Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in `ngrok`'s handling of TLS connections, potentially allowing attackers to intercept traffic passing through the tunnel.

**Impact:** Data interception, man-in-the-middle attacks, potential compromise of the application if `ngrok`'s infrastructure is breached.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*  Stay informed about `ngrok`'s security practices and any reported vulnerabilities.
*  Use HTTPS within the application itself to provide an additional layer of encryption.
*  Avoid transmitting highly sensitive data through `ngrok` if possible.
*  Consider the security reputation and track record of `ngrok` as a service provider.

## Attack Surface: [ngrok Account Compromise](./attack_surfaces/ngrok_account_compromise.md)

**Description:**  If the `ngrok` account used to create the tunnel is compromised, attackers can control the tunnel.

**How ngrok Contributes:** `ngrok` tunnels are managed through user accounts. Gaining access to the account allows manipulation of existing tunnels or creation of new ones.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to a developer's `ngrok` account credentials and terminates the active tunnel, disrupting access to the application being tested. They could also create a new tunnel to a malicious service.

**Impact:** Denial of service, unauthorized access, potential redirection of traffic to malicious sites, exposure of other local services.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*  Use strong, unique passwords for `ngrok` accounts.
*  Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on `ngrok` accounts.
*  Regularly review and revoke API keys associated with `ngrok` accounts if they are not needed.
*  Monitor `ngrok` account activity for suspicious logins or tunnel creations.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure ngrok Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_ngrok_configuration.md)

**Description:**  Misconfiguring `ngrok` can lead to unintended exposure or weakened security.

**How ngrok Contributes:**  `ngrok` offers various configuration options, and incorrect settings can create vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A developer forgets to set up basic authentication for their `ngrok` tunnel, leaving the application accessible to anyone with the URL.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access, potential exploitation of application vulnerabilities, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*  Always configure authentication for `ngrok` tunnels when exposing sensitive applications.
*  Understand the implications of different `ngrok` configuration options.
*  Use the principle of least privilege when configuring tunnels.
*  Avoid exposing unnecessary ports or services through `ngrok`.
