# Deep Analysis: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on ngrok (Custom Domains, Misconfigured TLS)

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanics, risks, and mitigation strategies for Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks targeting ngrok deployments that utilize custom domains and are potentially vulnerable due to misconfigured TLS settings.  This analysis aims to provide actionable guidance for developers to prevent such attacks.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following scenario:

*   **ngrok Usage:**  The application uses ngrok to expose a local development server to the internet.
*   **Custom Domain:**  The developer is using a custom domain (e.g., `myapp.example.com`) instead of a randomly generated ngrok subdomain.
*   **TLS Misconfiguration:** The primary vulnerability is the incorrect or incomplete configuration of TLS termination at the ngrok edge, *specifically* when using a custom domain.  This includes scenarios where:
    *   The developer uses HTTP instead of HTTPS with the custom domain.
    *   The developer attempts to handle TLS termination locally (on their development server) instead of letting ngrok handle it, but does so incorrectly.
    *   The developer uses a custom certificate with ngrok but misconfigures the ngrok client or server settings related to that certificate.
*   **Attacker Position:** The attacker is positioned to intercept network traffic between the ngrok client (running on the developer's machine) and the ngrok server.  This could be due to:
    *   Compromised Wi-Fi network.
    *   DNS spoofing/poisoning.
    *   ARP spoofing.
    *   Compromised router or ISP.

This analysis *excludes* MitM attacks that are unrelated to the custom domain/TLS misconfiguration aspect (e.g., attacks targeting the ngrok service itself, or attacks that would succeed even with proper TLS configuration).

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Technical Explanation:**  A detailed explanation of how ngrok handles custom domains and TLS termination, including the correct configuration process.
2.  **Attack Scenario Walkthrough:**  Step-by-step description of how an attacker could exploit the misconfiguration to perform a MitM attack.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Detailed breakdown of the potential consequences of a successful attack.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive:**  In-depth explanation of the recommended mitigation strategies, including specific ngrok configuration examples and best practices.
5.  **Verification Techniques:**  Methods to verify that the mitigation strategies are correctly implemented and effective.

## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1 Technical Explanation: ngrok, Custom Domains, and TLS

*   **ngrok's Role:** ngrok creates a secure tunnel from a public endpoint (on the ngrok server) to a local port on the developer's machine.  This allows external access to a service running locally without requiring direct port forwarding or firewall modifications.

*   **Default ngrok Subdomains:** By default, ngrok provides randomly generated subdomains (e.g., `xxxx-xx-xx-xx-xx.ngrok-free.app`).  These subdomains automatically use HTTPS, with TLS termination handled by the ngrok server.  This is generally secure.

*   **Custom Domains:** ngrok allows users to use their own custom domains (e.g., `myapp.example.com`).  This requires configuring DNS records (typically a CNAME record) to point the custom domain to the ngrok server's domain.

*   **TLS Termination:**  TLS termination is the process of decrypting HTTPS traffic.  With ngrok, there are two primary options for custom domains:

    1.  **ngrok-Managed TLS (Recommended):**  ngrok automatically provisions and manages a TLS certificate for the custom domain.  This is the easiest and most secure option.  The developer simply uses the `--domain` option with their custom domain when starting the ngrok client (e.g., `ngrok http --domain=myapp.example.com 80`).  ngrok handles the rest.

    2.  **Developer-Managed TLS (Advanced):** The developer provides their own TLS certificate and key to ngrok.  This requires more configuration and is generally only necessary in specific scenarios.  The developer uses the `--domain` option along with `--tls-crt` and `--tls-key` to specify the certificate and key files.

*   **The Vulnerability:** The MitM vulnerability arises when a developer uses a custom domain *without* correctly configuring ngrok-managed TLS or providing a valid, properly configured developer-managed certificate.  If the developer uses HTTP instead of HTTPS with the custom domain, or if they misconfigure the TLS settings, the traffic between the client and the ngrok server is not encrypted, allowing an attacker to intercept it.

### 4.2 Attack Scenario Walkthrough

1.  **Developer Setup (Incorrect):** A developer wants to expose their local web application running on port 80 using the custom domain `myapp.example.com`.  They configure a CNAME record pointing `myapp.example.com` to `their-region.ngrok.io`.  However, they start ngrok using `ngrok http 80` *without* specifying the `--domain` option or using HTTPS.  They mistakenly believe that the CNAME record alone is sufficient.

2.  **Attacker Positioning:** An attacker is on the same Wi-Fi network as the developer (e.g., a public coffee shop).  The attacker uses a tool like `ettercap` or `bettercap` to perform ARP spoofing, positioning themselves as the gateway for the developer's machine.

3.  **User Access:** A user attempts to access `myapp.example.com`.  The user's browser sends an HTTP request.

4.  **Interception:** Because the developer used `ngrok http 80`, the traffic between the developer's machine and the ngrok server is unencrypted.  The attacker, due to ARP spoofing, intercepts this HTTP request.

5.  **Data Modification (Optional):** The attacker can modify the request before forwarding it to the ngrok server.  For example, they could inject malicious JavaScript code.

6.  **Response Interception:** The ngrok server forwards the (potentially modified) request to the developer's local application.  The application responds, and the response is sent back through the ngrok server.  The attacker intercepts the unencrypted response.

7.  **Data Exfiltration/Modification:** The attacker can read the response (potentially containing sensitive data like session cookies, user credentials, or API keys).  They can also modify the response before sending it back to the user's browser.  For example, they could change the content of a webpage or redirect the user to a phishing site.

### 4.3 Impact Assessment

*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  Sensitive data transmitted between the user and the application (and between the ngrok client and server) can be read by the attacker.  This includes:
    *   Usernames and passwords.
    *   Session cookies.
    *   API keys.
    *   Personal data.
    *   Financial information.
    *   Source code (if exposed).

*   **Integrity Violation:**  The attacker can modify requests and responses, leading to:
    *   Injection of malicious code (e.g., XSS, CSRF).
    *   Data tampering.
    *   Account hijacking.
    *   Defacement of the application.
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.

*   **Reputational Damage:**  If users are affected by the attack, it can damage the developer's and the application's reputation.

*   **Legal and Financial Consequences:**  Depending on the nature of the data compromised, there could be legal and financial repercussions.

### 4.4 Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive

The primary mitigation strategy is to **always use HTTPS and correctly configure TLS termination with ngrok when using custom domains.**

1.  **ngrok-Managed TLS (Strongly Recommended):**

    *   **Command:** `ngrok http --domain=myapp.example.com 80` (replace `myapp.example.com` with your custom domain and `80` with your local port).
    *   **Explanation:** This command tells ngrok to:
        *   Listen for HTTP traffic on your local port 80.
        *   Use the custom domain `myapp.example.com`.
        *   Automatically provision and manage a TLS certificate for `myapp.example.com`.
        *   Terminate TLS at the ngrok edge, ensuring encrypted communication between the user's browser and the ngrok server.
    *   **DNS Configuration:** Ensure your DNS records (CNAME) are correctly configured to point your custom domain to the appropriate ngrok server address.
    *   **Verification:** Access your application using `https://myapp.example.com`.  Your browser should show a padlock icon, indicating a secure connection.  Inspect the certificate to ensure it's issued to your custom domain and is valid.

2.  **Developer-Managed TLS (Advanced - Use Only If Necessary):**

    *   **Obtain a Certificate:** Obtain a valid TLS certificate and private key for your custom domain from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
    *   **Command:** `ngrok http --domain=myapp.example.com --tls-crt=path/to/your/certificate.crt --tls-key=path/to/your/private.key 80`
    *   **Explanation:** This command tells ngrok to:
        *   Use the specified certificate and key for TLS termination.
        *   The certificate and key must be in PEM format.
    *   **DNS Configuration:**  Same as with ngrok-managed TLS.
    *   **Verification:** Same as with ngrok-managed TLS.  Additionally, verify that the certificate presented by ngrok matches the certificate you provided.

3.  **Enforce HTTPS on the Application Side (Defense in Depth):**

    *   Even with ngrok handling TLS termination, it's good practice to configure your local application to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.  This provides an extra layer of security.  The specifics of this depend on your web server and framework (e.g., configuring redirects in Apache, Nginx, or your application code).

4. **Avoid using `--region` with custom domains if not necessary.**
    * If you are using a custom domain, ngrok will automatically select the closest region to the client. Specifying a region manually can, in rare cases, lead to routing issues.

### 4.5 Verification Techniques

1.  **Browser Inspection:**  Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the connection to your application.  Verify that:
    *   The connection is HTTPS.
    *   The certificate is valid and issued to your custom domain.
    *   The certificate chain is trusted.

2.  **Online SSL/TLS Checkers:**  Use online tools like SSL Labs' SSL Server Test (https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) to analyze your domain's TLS configuration.  These tools can identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

3.  **ngrok Dashboard:**  The ngrok dashboard provides information about your tunnels, including the domain and TLS status.  Check the dashboard to ensure your tunnel is using HTTPS and the correct domain.

4.  **Penetration Testing (Advanced):**  Consider performing penetration testing to simulate a MitM attack and verify the effectiveness of your mitigations.  This should be done in a controlled environment.

5. **`curl` command:**
    ```bash
    curl -v https://myapp.example.com
    ```
    The `-v` (verbose) option will show the TLS handshake details. Look for:
    *   `*  Trying <ngrok_server_ip>...`
    *   `* Connected to myapp.example.com (<ngrok_server_ip>) port 443 (#0)`
    *   `*  subject: CN=myapp.example.com` (or similar, confirming your domain)
    *   `*  issuer: ...` (confirming a valid issuer)
    *   `> GET / HTTP/1.1` (or HTTP/2)
    *   `< HTTP/1.1 200 OK` (or similar, confirming a successful response)

By following these mitigation strategies and verification techniques, developers can significantly reduce the risk of MitM attacks when using ngrok with custom domains. The key takeaway is to prioritize HTTPS and proper TLS configuration.
