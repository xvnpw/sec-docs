# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for inconshreveable/ngrok

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong ngrok Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_ngrok_authentication.md)

1.  **Choose Authentication Method:** Decide between `--basic-auth` (username/password) or `--oauth` (using a provider like Google or GitHub).  `--oauth` is generally preferred.
2.  **Basic Auth:** If using `--basic-auth`, generate a *strong, unique* password. Use a password manager.  Command: `ngrok http --basic-auth="username:very_strong_password" 8080`.
3.  **OAuth:** If using `--oauth`, select a supported provider. Configure the OAuth provider correctly, obtaining client ID and secret from the provider's developer console. Command: `ngrok http --oauth=google --oauth-allow-domain=yourdomain.com 8080` (adjust parameters). Ensure minimum necessary permissions.
4.  **Authtoken:** *Always* use an `authtoken`. Obtain it from the `ngrok` dashboard: `ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTHTOKEN`.
5.  **Regular Rotation:** Rotate the `basic-auth` password or OAuth client secret regularly (e.g., every few months). For `--oauth`, revoke and regenerate the client secret.
6.  **Documentation:** Document the method, credentials (securely!), and rotation schedule.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Critical):** Prevents access without credentials.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: High):** Strong passwords/OAuth make brute-forcing difficult.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (Severity: High):** Unique passwords prevent reuse of stolen credentials.
    *   **Session Hijacking (Severity: High):** Adds a layer of protection (though HTTPS is primary).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `--authtoken` is configured. `--basic-auth` is used with a moderately strong password in `start_dev.sh`.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Password rotation is not implemented. `--oauth` is not used. Documentation is incomplete.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Tunnel Lifetime](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_tunnel_lifetime.md)

1.  **Start on Demand:** Only start the tunnel when *absolutely necessary*.
2.  **Stop Immediately:** Shut down the tunnel *immediately* after use.
3.  **Scripting:** Use scripts to automate starting and stopping (e.g., `start_dev.sh`, `stop_dev.sh`).
4.  **Time Limits:** Consider automatic shutdown after a period (e.g., 2 hours) using scripts or external tools.
5.  **Monitoring:** Periodically check for unnecessarily running tunnels.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Opportunistic Attacks (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the window for attackers to find the service.
    *   **Persistent Threats (Severity: High):** Makes establishing persistence harder.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Low):** Reduces `ngrok` resource consumption.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Opportunistic Attacks:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Persistent Threats:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** `start_dev.sh` starts the tunnel, but no `stop_dev.sh` exists. Manual stopping is instructed, but not enforced.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Dedicated stop script missing. Automatic time limits not implemented. Monitoring not formalized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Expose Only Necessary Ports](./mitigation_strategies/expose_only_necessary_ports.md)

1.  **Identify Required Port:** Determine the *exact* port the application listens on (e.g., 8080).
2.  **Specific Command:** Use `ngrok http` with the specific port: `ngrok http 8080`. *Do not* use `ngrok http` without a port.
3.  **Verification:** After starting, verify only the intended port is exposed (using `netstat` or `ss`).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintended Service Exposure (Severity: Medium):** Prevents exposing other services.
    *   **Port Scanning (Severity: Low):** Makes discovering other services harder.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintended Service Exposure:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Port Scanning:** Risk slightly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** `start_dev.sh` correctly specifies the port (8080).

*   **Missing Implementation:** Verification after tunnel start is not automated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Never Use ngrok for Production](./mitigation_strategies/never_use_ngrok_for_production.md)

1.  **Development/Testing Only:** `ngrok` is *strictly* for development, testing, and demos.
2.  **Production Deployment:** Use proper methods (cloud platforms, dedicated servers, Kubernetes, etc.).
3.  **Policy Enforcement:** Enforce a policy prohibiting `ngrok` in production.
4.  **Alternative Solutions:** Provide alternatives for sharing work (staging environments, etc.).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **All Production-Related Risks (Severity: Critical):** `ngrok` is unsuitable for production security, reliability, and scalability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Production-Related Risks:** Risk eliminated.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Understood in principle, but no formal policy exists.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Written policy needed. Guidelines on production deployment alternatives needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize ngrok's Paid Features (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_ngrok's_paid_features__if_applicable_.md)

1. **Reserved Domains/TCP Addresses:** If using a paid plan, reserve a domain or TCP address for a stable endpoint. Command example (domain): `ngrok http --domain=your-reserved-domain.ngrok.io 8080`.
2. **Connection Limits:** Set limits on simultaneous connections to mitigate DoS attacks.  This is configured through the `ngrok` dashboard or API.
3. **IP Whitelisting/Restrictions:** Restrict access to the tunnel based on IP address. Configure through the `ngrok` dashboard or API.
4. **Webhooks:** Use webhooks to receive real-time notifications about tunnel events (connections, disconnections, errors).  This allows for proactive monitoring and response.
5. **ngrok Dashboard Monitoring:** Regularly check the dashboard for unusual activity.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **DoS Attacks (Severity: Medium):** Connection limits help mitigate.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):** IP whitelisting restricts access.
    *   **Tunnel Discovery (Severity: Low):** Reserved domains make guessing the tunnel URL harder (but rely on obscurity, not security).
    *   **Lack of Visibility (Severity: Medium):** Webhooks and dashboard provide monitoring capabilities.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **DoS Attacks:** Risk reduced (depending on limit configuration).
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (with proper IP whitelisting).
        *   **Tunnel Discovery:** Risk slightly reduced.
        *   **Lack of Visibility:** Improved monitoring and alerting.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Not applicable (currently using the free tier).

*   **Missing Implementation:** All paid features are not utilized.  If a paid plan is adopted, these features should be evaluated and implemented as appropriate.
