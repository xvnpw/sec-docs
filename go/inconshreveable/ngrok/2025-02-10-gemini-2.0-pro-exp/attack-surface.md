# Attack Surface Analysis for inconshreveable/ngrok

## Attack Surface: [1. Unintentional Service Exposure](./attack_surfaces/1__unintentional_service_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Exposing services that were never intended for public access.
*   **How `ngrok` Contributes:** `ngrok` bypasses network firewalls and NAT, making any listening port on the local machine potentially accessible from the internet.  This is `ngrok`'s *core function*, and thus directly contributes.
*   **Example:** A developer accidentally starts `ngrok` pointing to a local database server (e.g., port 3306 for MySQL) that contains sensitive customer data, without any authentication.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential data breaches, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Port Control:** Explicitly specify the *exact* port and local address (e.g., `127.0.0.1:8080`) to be exposed via `ngrok`'s configuration.  Avoid exposing entire ranges or default ports.
    *   **Service Hardening:** Ensure *all* services running on the machine, even those not intended for public access, are configured securely with strong authentication and authorization.  This is a general best practice, but `ngrok`'s exposure makes it critical.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Configure local firewall rules (even with `ngrok` in use) to restrict access to sensitive ports from all sources except localhost.  This provides a layer of defense even if `ngrok` is misconfigured.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run `ngrok` and the target application with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [2. Vulnerable Service Exposure](./attack_surfaces/2__vulnerable_service_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Exposing a service that has known or unknown vulnerabilities.
*   **How `ngrok` Contributes:** Provides a direct, publicly accessible route to the vulnerable service, bypassing network-level protections that might otherwise mitigate the risk.  `ngrok` makes the vulnerability *reachable*.
*   **Example:** Exposing an outdated version of a web application with a known remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability via `ngrok`.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Patching:** Keep the exposed service and all its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.  This is always important, but `ngrok`'s exposure makes it critical.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the exposed service for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secure Configuration:** Follow security best practices for configuring the exposed service (e.g., disabling unnecessary features, using strong passwords).
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider using a WAF to filter malicious traffic and protect against common web application attacks.  While the WAF isn't directly related to `ngrok`, it's a crucial mitigation because `ngrok` exposes the service.

## Attack Surface: [3. Compromised `ngrok` Client/Authtoken](./attack_surfaces/3__compromised__ngrok__clientauthtoken.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the `ngrok` client or the authtoken.
*   **How `ngrok` Contributes:** The `ngrok` client and authtoken are the *direct* control mechanisms for the tunnel.  Compromise of these is a compromise of `ngrok` itself.
*   **Example:** An attacker steals the `ngrok` authtoken from a developer's `.bash_history` file or a compromised CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can create new tunnels, redirect traffic, expose additional services, and potentially access other resources on the local network *through* the compromised `ngrok` instance.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Authtoken Storage:** Store the authtoken securely using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management solution.  Never commit it to version control.  This directly protects the `ngrok` credential.
    *   **Regular Authtoken Rotation:** Periodically rotate the `ngrok` authtoken. This limits the window of opportunity for an attacker using a stolen token.
    *   **Endpoint Protection:** Protect the machine running the `ngrok` client with strong endpoint security measures (antivirus, EDR). This reduces the risk of the client itself being compromised.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** If possible, enable MFA for the `ngrok` account. This adds an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access to the `ngrok` account.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the ngrok client with a dedicated, non-privileged user account.

## Attack Surface: [4. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (without HTTPS)](./attack_surfaces/4__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks__without_https_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and potentially modifies traffic between the client and the exposed service.
*   **How `ngrok` Contributes:** If `ngrok` is used to expose an HTTP service (without TLS), the traffic is unencrypted *through the `ngrok` tunnel*.  `ngrok` is the conduit for the vulnerable traffic.
*   **Example:** An attacker on a public Wi-Fi network intercepts the unencrypted HTTP traffic between a user and an `ngrok` tunnel, stealing login credentials.
*   **Impact:** Data interception, credential theft, session hijacking, injection of malicious content.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always Use HTTPS:** *Never* expose services over plain HTTP via `ngrok`.  Ensure the exposed service is configured to use HTTPS with a valid TLS certificate.  This encrypts the traffic *through* the `ngrok` tunnel.
    *   **End-to-End Encryption:** Terminate TLS on *your* server, not at the `ngrok` edge, to ensure that `ngrok` only sees encrypted traffic. This provides the strongest protection.
