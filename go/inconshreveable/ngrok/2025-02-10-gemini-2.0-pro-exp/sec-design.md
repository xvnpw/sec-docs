Okay, let's create a design document for ngrok based on the provided GitHub repository.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Ngrok is a mature, widely-used product.  The primary business goal is to provide a reliable and secure way for developers and organizations to expose local services to the internet.  This includes use cases like testing webhooks, demonstrating software without deployment, remote access to devices, and building networked applications.  Maintaining a strong reputation for security and reliability is paramount, as ngrok is often used in production environments and handles potentially sensitive traffic.

Business Priorities:

*   Reliability and Uptime:  Ngrok must be highly available and resilient to failures. Downtime directly impacts users' ability to work and can damage ngrok's reputation.
*   Security:  Protecting user data and preventing unauthorized access to exposed services is critical.  A security breach could have severe consequences for both ngrok and its users.
*   Ease of Use:  Ngrok's value proposition is its simplicity.  The user experience must remain straightforward, even as new features are added.
*   Scalability:  The service must be able to handle a large and growing number of concurrent users and tunnels.
*   Performance:  Tunnels should have low latency and high throughput to provide a good user experience.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Service Disruption:  Outages or performance degradation impacting a large number of users.
*   Data Breach:  Unauthorized access to user data or exposed services.
*   Abuse of Service:  Malicious actors using ngrok for phishing, malware distribution, or other illegal activities.
*   Reputational Damage:  Negative publicity resulting from security incidents, service disruptions, or poor customer support.
*   Competition:  Emergence of competing services that offer better features, performance, or pricing.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on the repository and general knowledge of ngrok):

*   security control: TLS Encryption:  All traffic between the ngrok client and server, and optionally between the ngrok server and the public internet, is encrypted using TLS. (Implemented in client and server software, documented in ngrok documentation).
*   security control: Authentication:  Users authenticate with ngrok using accounts and API keys. (Implemented in client and server software, documented in ngrok documentation).
*   security control: Tunnel Authentication:  Ngrok supports various methods for authenticating incoming requests to tunnels, including basic auth, OAuth, and webhooks. (Implemented in server software, configurable by users).
*   security control: Access Control:  Ngrok provides features for restricting access to tunnels based on IP address or other criteria. (Implemented in server software, configurable by users).
*   security control: Input Validation: Ngrok server and client validate input to prevent attacks. (Implemented in client and server software).
*   security control: Regular Security Audits: Ngrok likely undergoes regular security audits and penetration testing. (Assumed based on industry best practices).
*   security control: Secure Coding Practices: The development team likely follows secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities. (Assumed based on industry best practices).
*   security control: Dependency Management: The project uses Go modules, which helps manage dependencies and track vulnerabilities. (Visible in go.mod and go.sum files).
*   security control: Automated testing: The repository contains automated tests. (Visible in test files).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: User Misconfiguration:  Users may misconfigure their tunnels or exposed services, leading to security vulnerabilities. Ngrok provides documentation and tools to help users configure their services securely, but ultimately the responsibility lies with the user.
*   accepted risk: Zero-Day Exploits:  Like all software, ngrok is potentially vulnerable to zero-day exploits.  Ngrok likely has a process for rapidly patching and deploying fixes for newly discovered vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: DDoS Attacks: Ngrok's infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to DDoS attacks. Ngrok likely employs DDoS mitigation techniques, but a sufficiently large attack could still cause service disruption.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.
*   Offer two-factor authentication (2FA) for user accounts.
*   Provide more granular access control options for tunnels.
*   Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the service.
*   Regularly conduct static and dynamic code analysis to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
*   Implement a bug bounty program to incentivize security researchers to report vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All users must be authenticated before accessing ngrok services.
    *   API keys should be used for programmatic access.
    *   Support for strong password policies.
    *   Consider offering two-factor authentication (2FA).

*   Authorization:
    *   Access to tunnels should be controlled based on user roles and permissions.
    *   Implement fine-grained access control lists (ACLs) for managing tunnel access.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All input from clients and the public internet must be validated to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Implement strict validation rules for tunnel names, hostnames, and other parameters.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, up-to-date TLS configurations for all encrypted communication.
    *   Securely store sensitive data, such as API keys and user credentials.
    *   Use cryptographically secure random number generators.

## BUILD

The ngrok project is primarily written in Go. The repository includes a `Makefile` and references to GitHub Actions, indicating an automated build process.

Build Process:

1.  **Developer:** A developer writes code and commits it to the ngrok repository on GitHub.
2.  **GitHub Actions Trigger:** A push to the repository or a pull request triggers a GitHub Actions workflow.
3.  **Checkout Code:** The workflow checks out the code from the repository.
4.  **Setup Go:** The workflow sets up the Go environment.
5.  **Dependency Management:**  `go mod download` is likely used to download and verify project dependencies (based on `go.mod` and `go.sum`).
6.  **Static Analysis (SAST):**  A SAST tool (e.g., `go vet`, `staticcheck`, or a commercial tool) is likely run to analyze the code for potential vulnerabilities.
7.  **Linting:** A linter (e.g., `golangci-lint`) is likely run to enforce code style and identify potential errors.
8.  **Unit Tests:**  `go test` is used to run unit tests and ensure code quality.
9.  **Build:**  `go build` is used to compile the ngrok client and server binaries.
10. **Containerization (Likely):**  The binaries are likely packaged into Docker containers for deployment.
11. **Image Scanning (Likely):** A container image scanning tool (e.g., Trivy, Clair) is likely used to scan the Docker images for vulnerabilities.
12. **Artifact Storage:** The built binaries and/or Docker images are stored in a repository (e.g., GitHub Packages, Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
13. **Release (Optional):**  If the build is triggered by a tagged commit, a new release may be created on GitHub.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   Tunnel Creation and Management:  Ensuring that users can reliably create and manage tunnels.
*   Traffic Routing:  Ensuring that traffic is routed securely and efficiently between clients and exposed services.
*   Authentication and Authorization:  Protecting user accounts and preventing unauthorized access to tunnels.
*   API Availability:  Ensuring that the ngrok API is available for managing accounts and tunnels.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   User Account Data (email addresses, hashed passwords, API keys):  High sensitivity.
*   Tunnel Configuration Data (tunnel names, hostnames, authentication credentials):  High sensitivity.
*   Traffic Data (data transmitted through tunnels):  Variable sensitivity, depending on the user's application.  Potentially very high sensitivity.
*   Logs (system logs, audit logs):  Medium to high sensitivity, depending on the content.
