# Threat Model Analysis for inconshreveable/ngrok

## Threat: [Unintentional Service Exposure](./threats/unintentional_service_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and accesses services running on the developer's machine that were not intended for public access.  This occurs because the developer misconfigures the ngrok client, exposing the wrong port or service. The attacker might scan for open ports on the ngrok-provided URL or use common port numbers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breaches (if databases or internal APIs are exposed).
    *   Compromise of the development machine (if remote access services are exposed).
    *   Exposure of sensitive configuration information.
*   **Affected Component:** ngrok client (tunnel configuration).  This is *directly* related to how the developer uses the ngrok client.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Explicit Port Forwarding:** *Always* specify the exact local port to expose (e.g., `ngrok http 8080`). Never expose entire network interfaces.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Configure local firewall rules on the development machine, but the primary mitigation is correct ngrok usage.
    *   **Tunnel Termination:** Immediately terminate ngrok tunnels when they are no longer needed.
    *   **ngrok Whitelisting (if available):** Use ngrok's IP whitelisting features.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review active ngrok tunnels.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack (Custom Domains, Misconfigured TLS)](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack__custom_domains__misconfigured_tls_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts traffic between the ngrok server and the client. This is most likely when using a custom domain *without* correctly configuring TLS termination at the ngrok edge. The attacker relies on the developer's misconfiguration of ngrok's custom domain features.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Interception of sensitive data.
    *   Modification of requests and responses.
    *   Loss of confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Affected Component:** ngrok client (custom domain configuration), ngrok server (TLS termination). This directly involves the ngrok client's configuration and how it interacts with the ngrok server's TLS setup.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always Use HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS.
    *   **Proper TLS Configuration:** If using a custom domain, ensure TLS termination is correctly configured on the ngrok side, using ngrok's managed certificates or providing your own and configuring ngrok appropriately. Use the `--domain` option with HTTPS.

## Threat: [Request/Response Tampering (Unencrypted Traffic)](./threats/requestresponse_tampering__unencrypted_traffic_.md)

*   **Description:** If the connection between the ngrok server and the local application uses HTTP (not HTTPS), an attacker can modify requests/responses. This is a direct result of the developer choosing to use an unencrypted tunnel with the ngrok client.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Injection of malicious code or data.
    *   Manipulation of application behavior.
    *   Data corruption.
*   **Affected Component:** ngrok client (tunnel configuration - HTTP vs. HTTPS). This is entirely dependent on the ngrok client's configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory HTTPS:** *Always* use HTTPS for the ngrok tunnel (`ngrok http https://localhost:8080`).
    *   **Local HTTPS Enforcement:** While good practice, the primary mitigation is using HTTPS with ngrok.

## Threat: [ngrok Client Vulnerability (Hypothetical)](./threats/ngrok_client_vulnerability__hypothetical_.md)

*   **Description:** A security vulnerability exists in the ngrok *client* software. An attacker could exploit this to gain access to the developer's machine. This is a direct threat to the ngrok client itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromise of the development machine.
    *   Potential for data theft or further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** ngrok client software.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (but likelihood is generally low, assuming prompt patching)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Updated:** Always use the latest version of the ngrok client.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the ngrok client with minimal privileges.
