## Attack Tree Path: [1. Abuse ngrok Features/Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/1__abuse_ngrok_featuresconfiguration.md)

*   **1. Abuse ngrok Features/Configuration:** Exploiting intended features or misconfigurations of `ngrok` itself. This is the top-level category for the high-risk paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tunnel Hijacking](./attack_tree_paths/tunnel_hijacking.md)

    *   **Tunnel Hijacking:** A general category of attacks where the attacker gains unauthorized access to the ngrok tunnel.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Predict Tunnel Names](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_predict_tunnel_names.md)

        *   **1.2 Predict Tunnel Names:**
            *   **Description:** If predictable tunnel names are used (e.g., the default random names *without* an authtoken), an attacker could potentially guess the tunnel URL and access the exposed application. The risk is significantly reduced by using authtokens.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (With authtokens; High without)
            *   **Impact:** High (Full access to the exposed application)
            *   **Effort:** Very Low (Brute-forcing or guessing)
            *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring connection attempts; easier with intrusion detection)
            *   **Actionable Insights:**
                *   **Mandatory:** Use `ngrok` authtokens. This is the primary mitigation.
                *   Consider using custom subdomains (paid feature) for added obscurity.
                *   Monitor `ngrok` logs for unusual connection attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Info](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_info.md)

    *   **Expose Sensitive Info:** A category of attacks where sensitive information is unintentionally made accessible through the ngrok tunnel.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Unintended Exposure (e.g., .env files, logs) `[CRITICAL]`](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_unintended_exposure__e_g____env_files__logs____critical__.md)

        *   **2.1 Unintended Exposure (e.g., .env files, logs) `[CRITICAL]`:**
            *   **Description:** Developers might accidentally expose sensitive information (API keys, database credentials, `ngrok` authtokens) through the tunnel. This is often due to misconfigured web servers that serve files they shouldn't (like `.env` files, configuration files, or log files containing sensitive data). This is the *most critical* vulnerability to address.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration)
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to complete compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Very Low (Simply browsing to common file paths)
            *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (If the attacker accesses the files, it's immediately obvious; the key is to *prevent* access)
            *   **Actionable Insights:**
                *   **Crucial:** Configure your web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) *correctly* to *deny* access to sensitive files and directories. Use `.htaccess` (Apache) or server block configurations (Nginx) to explicitly block access to `.env`, log files, and any other files that should not be publicly accessible. This is the *highest priority* mitigation.
                *   Review your web server's document root and ensure it only contains the necessary files for your application.
                *   Use a web application firewall (WAF) to add an extra layer of protection and block requests for known sensitive file paths.
                *   Regularly audit your application and server configuration for potential exposure points.
