# Attack Surface Analysis for inconshreveable/ngrok

## Attack Surface: [Public Exposure of Internal Services](./attack_surfaces/public_exposure_of_internal_services.md)

*   **Description:** Previously internal services, meant to be accessed only within a private network, become accessible from the public internet.
*   **Ngrok Contribution:** Ngrok's core functionality directly creates public URLs that tunnel traffic to local services, bypassing network boundaries.
*   **Example:** A developer uses ngrok to expose a local development database admin panel. They forget to disable the tunnel, and it remains publicly accessible. An attacker discovers the ngrok URL and gains full access to the database, leading to data exfiltration of sensitive customer information.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized data modification, service disruption, potential lateral movement to other internal systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize Exposure:** Only expose services through ngrok when absolutely necessary and for the shortest possible duration.
    *   **Strong Authentication & Authorization:** Implement robust authentication (e.g., multi-factor authentication, strong passwords, API keys) and authorization mechanisms within the exposed service itself.
    *   **Ngrok Basic Auth (as secondary layer):** Utilize ngrok's built-in basic authentication as an additional security layer, but do not rely on it as the primary defense.
    *   **Regularly Audit Active Tunnels:** Implement a process to regularly review and immediately shut down ngrok tunnels that are no longer required.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the exposed service within a segmented network to limit potential damage from a breach.

## Attack Surface: [Ngrok Infrastructure Dependency and Compromise](./attack_surfaces/ngrok_infrastructure_dependency_and_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Reliance on a third-party service (ngrok) introduces risks associated with the security and integrity of their infrastructure.
*   **Ngrok Contribution:** All traffic to exposed services is routed through ngrok's servers, making the application vulnerable if ngrok's infrastructure is compromised.
*   **Example:** An attacker successfully compromises ngrok's infrastructure. They are able to intercept traffic flowing through active tunnels, including sensitive API requests and responses intended for a testing environment, leading to exposure of API keys and business logic.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, loss of confidentiality, service disruption, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks, compromise of internal systems if tunnel configuration is exposed.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **HTTPS End-to-End:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication through the ngrok tunnel, ensuring encryption from the client to the backend service to protect data in transit even if ngrok's infrastructure is compromised.
    *   **Data Minimization:** Avoid transmitting highly sensitive production data through ngrok tunnels, especially for prolonged periods. Use it primarily for development and testing with non-production data.
    *   **Monitor Ngrok Status & Security Announcements:** Stay informed about ngrok's service status, security updates, and any reported security incidents to react promptly to potential issues.
    *   **Consider Alternatives for Sensitive Environments:** For environments handling highly sensitive data or requiring stringent security, evaluate self-hosted or more controlled alternatives to ngrok for exposing services.
    *   **Review Ngrok's Security Practices:** Understand and assess ngrok's security policies, data handling practices, and incident response procedures to evaluate the level of risk.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration and Management of Ngrok Tunnels](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_and_management_of_ngrok_tunnels.md)

*   **Description:** Improper configuration or inadequate management of ngrok tunnels can create significant security vulnerabilities.
*   **Ngrok Contribution:** Ngrok's flexible configuration options, if misused, can unintentionally widen the attack surface.
*   **Example:** A developer, aiming for convenience, configures a tunnel with overly permissive settings, such as a wildcard subdomain (`*.ngrok.io`) or disables authentication entirely. This unintentionally exposes a wider range of internal services than intended. An attacker exploits a vulnerability in one of these unintentionally exposed services.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to multiple services, data breaches across different systems, service disruption, potential for lateral movement.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Tunnel Configuration:** Configure tunnels to expose only the absolutely necessary services and specific endpoints required for the intended purpose.
    *   **Specific and Non-Guessable Subdomains:** Utilize specific, non-descriptive, and ideally randomly generated subdomains instead of wildcard subdomains to limit discoverability and scope.
    *   **Short-Lived and Ephemeral Tunnels:** Use tunnels for the shortest possible duration and ensure they are automatically terminated when no longer actively needed. Avoid long-running or persistent tunnels, especially outside of dedicated development environments.
    *   **Secure Tunnel Configuration Storage:** Store ngrok configuration securely and avoid embedding API keys or authentication tokens directly in code or publicly accessible configuration files. Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management systems.
    *   **Automated Tunnel Management with Security Checks:** If automating tunnel creation, implement security checks and validation within the automation process to prevent misconfigurations and enforce security best practices.
