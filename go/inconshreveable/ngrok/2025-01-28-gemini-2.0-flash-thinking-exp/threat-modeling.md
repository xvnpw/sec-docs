# Threat Model Analysis for inconshreveable/ngrok

## Threat: [Unintentional Public Exposure of Development/Staging Environments](./threats/unintentional_public_exposure_of_developmentstaging_environments.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could discover the public ngrok URL of a development or staging environment. They might then access sensitive data, configuration details, or functionalities not intended for public access. This could be achieved by guessing URLs, finding them in public code repositories, or through misconfiguration.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive information, unauthorized access to internal systems, potential for further attacks on internal infrastructure.
*   **Ngrok Component Affected:** Ngrok Tunnel, Public URL generation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement authentication and authorization on the application even in development/staging.
    *   Restrict access to sensitive data and functionalities in non-production environments.
    *   Regularly audit active ngrok tunnels and disable unnecessary ones.
    *   Use ngrok's paid features for access control if needed.

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure of Production Services (Misuse)](./threats/accidental_exposure_of_production_services__misuse_.md)

*   **Description:** A developer might mistakenly or intentionally use ngrok to expose a production service. An attacker could then bypass production security controls and directly access the production environment through the ngrok tunnel.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of production environment, data breach, service disruption, reputational damage, financial loss.
*   **Ngrok Component Affected:** Ngrok Agent, Tunnel Creation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Establish strict policies against using ngrok in production.
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for unauthorized ngrok usage in production networks.
    *   Enforce network segmentation to limit ngrok's reach into production environments.
    *   Educate developers on the risks of using ngrok in production.

## Threat: [Ngrok Account Compromise](./threats/ngrok_account_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** If an attacker gains access to the ngrok account credentials (e.g., through phishing, credential stuffing, or weak passwords), they could create unauthorized tunnels, potentially intercept traffic, or disrupt existing tunnels.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal services, data interception, denial of service, potential for further attacks using compromised account.
*   **Ngrok Component Affected:** Ngrok Account Management, API Access.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong, unique passwords for ngrok accounts.
    *   Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on ngrok accounts.
    *   Restrict access to ngrok account credentials to authorized personnel.
    *   Regularly audit ngrok account activity and tunnel configurations.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Tunnel Creation and Usage](./threats/unauthorized_tunnel_creation_and_usage.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might create ngrok tunnels without authorization, potentially exposing unintended services or creating security risks. This could be due to lack of awareness or malicious intent.
*   **Impact:** Unintended exposure of services, potential security vulnerabilities, violation of security policies, resource misuse, leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.
*   **Ngrok Component Affected:** Ngrok Agent, Tunnel Creation Process.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Establish clear policies and guidelines for ngrok usage.
    *   Implement a process for requesting and approving ngrok tunnel creation.
    *   Monitor and log ngrok tunnel creation and usage.
    *   Use ngrok's organization management features for access control if available.

## Threat: [Long-Lived and Forgotten Tunnels](./threats/long-lived_and_forgotten_tunnels.md)

*   **Description:** Tunnels created for temporary purposes might be forgotten and left running indefinitely. These long-lived tunnels can become security vulnerabilities over time if not properly maintained or secured, increasing the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit exposed services.
*   **Impact:** Increased attack surface over time, potential for exploitation of vulnerabilities in exposed services, resource wastage, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access if vulnerabilities are found.
*   **Ngrok Component Affected:** Ngrok Tunnel Management, Tunnel Lifecycle.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement policies for tunnel lifecycle management, including expiration dates.
    *   Regularly audit active ngrok tunnels and disable forgotten or unnecessary ones.
    *   Encourage developers to document the purpose and lifespan of tunnels.
    *   Automate tunnel cleanup processes where possible.
