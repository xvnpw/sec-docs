## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

    *   **2.1: Exposure of Development Environment Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
        *   **2.1.1: Access to Debug Endpoints (e.g., `/debug`, `/admin`) (CRITICAL NODE)**
        *   **2.1.2: Access to Unsecured Development Databases (if exposed via the tunnel) (CRITICAL NODE)**

## Attack Tree Path: [AND 1: Establish Connection via Ngrok Tunnel (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/and_1_establish_connection_via_ngrok_tunnel__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This path represents the fundamental step an attacker needs to take to interact with the application exposed through ngrok. It involves discovering the ngrok URL and then accessing the tunnel.
*   **Attack Vectors within the Path:**
    *   Discovering the Ngrok URL (various methods as detailed in the full tree).
    *   Accessing the Ngrok Tunnel (the subsequent step, focusing on the critical node below).

## Attack Tree Path: [AND 1.2: Access the Ngrok Tunnel (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/and_1_2_access_the_ngrok_tunnel__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** This node represents the point where the attacker attempts to gain entry through the ngrok tunnel. The success of this step is crucial for further exploitation.
*   **Attack Vectors within the Node:**
    *   Exploiting the lack of authentication (the high-risk path below).
    *   Bypassing any weak authentication mechanisms (as detailed in the full tree).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1: No Authentication Enabled (Default, if not configured) (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_no_authentication_enabled__default__if_not_configured___high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** This is the most direct and easily exploitable vulnerability. If ngrok is used without configuring any authentication, the tunnel is publicly accessible to anyone who knows the URL.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Simply accessing the ngrok URL in a web browser or using command-line tools. No credentials or bypass techniques are needed.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Low

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1: Exposure of Development Environment Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_exposure_of_development_environment_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This path highlights the risks associated with using ngrok to expose development environments. These environments often have weaker security configurations and contain vulnerabilities not present in production.
*   **Attack Vectors within the Path:**
    *   Accessing debug endpoints (critical node below).
    *   Accessing unsecured development databases (critical node below).
    *   Accessing development secrets or keys.
    *   Exploiting known vulnerabilities in development dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1: Access to Debug Endpoints (e.g., `/debug`, `/admin`) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_access_to_debug_endpoints__e_g____debug____admin____critical_node_.md)

**Description:** Development environments frequently include debug endpoints that provide detailed information about the application's state, allow for administrative actions, or expose sensitive data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Guessing or discovering common debug endpoint URLs (e.g., `/debug`, `/admin`, `/swagger`, `/metrics`).
    *   Using tools that automatically scan for common debug endpoints.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2: Access to Unsecured Development Databases (if exposed via the tunnel) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_access_to_unsecured_development_databases__if_exposed_via_the_tunnel___critical_node_.md)

**Description:** If the development database is running locally and accessible through the ngrok tunnel without proper authentication or access controls, it becomes a prime target for attackers.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Using default database credentials.
    *   Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the database software.
    *   Using database management tools to connect to the exposed database.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depending on database configuration)
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2.6: Session Hijacking (if session management is weak and exposed via the tunnel) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2_6_session_hijacking__if_session_management_is_weak_and_exposed_via_the_tunnel___high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:**  When an application's session management is weak, the public accessibility provided by ngrok can make it easier for attackers to intercept or manipulate session identifiers, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Attack Vectors within the Path:**
    *   Stealing session cookies (if not properly secured).
    *   Exploiting session fixation vulnerabilities.
