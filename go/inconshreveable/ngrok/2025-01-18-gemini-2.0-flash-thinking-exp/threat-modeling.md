# Threat Model Analysis for inconshreveable/ngrok

## Threat: [ngrok Account Compromise Leading to Tunnel Hijacking](./threats/ngrok_account_compromise_leading_to_tunnel_hijacking.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the `ngrok` account credentials used to create the tunnel. They could then create their own tunnels using the compromised account, potentially redirecting traffic intended for the legitimate application to a malicious server or intercepting sensitive data.

**Impact:** Data interception, man-in-the-middle attacks, redirection to phishing sites, potential compromise of the local machine if the attacker gains control over the tunnel endpoint.

**Affected Component:** `ngrok` account management, `ngrok` tunnel creation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use strong, unique passwords for the `ngrok` account.
*   Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the `ngrok` account if available.
*   Regularly review authorized tunnels and API keys associated with the account.
*   Restrict the number of users who have access to the `ngrok` account.

## Threat: [Abuse of the Publicly Accessible URL for Malicious Purposes](./threats/abuse_of_the_publicly_accessible_url_for_malicious_purposes.md)

**Description:** Attackers discover the `ngrok` URL and use it to perform actions against the local application that were not intended, such as resource exhaustion, brute-force attacks, or exploiting application-level vulnerabilities *through the ngrok tunnel*.

**Impact:** Denial of service, unauthorized access or modification of data, potential compromise of the local machine.

**Affected Component:** `ngrok` tunnel, publicly generated URL.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting and other security measures within the application itself.
*   Use `ngrok`'s features for access control where appropriate.
*   Avoid sharing the `ngrok` URL unnecessarily.

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure of Production Environments via ngrok](./threats/accidental_exposure_of_production_environments_via_ngrok.md)

**Description:** Developers mistakenly use `ngrok` to expose a production environment to the public internet, bypassing standard security controls and exposing sensitive data and functionalities *through the ngrok tunnel*.

**Impact:** Critical data breaches, complete compromise of the production environment, significant financial and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** `ngrok` client, `ngrok` tunnel.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Clearly define and enforce policies regarding the use of `ngrok`.
*   Implement technical controls to prevent the use of `ngrok` in production environments (e.g., network restrictions, automated checks).
*   Educate developers about the risks of using `ngrok` in production.

## Threat: [Tunnel Hijacking via Custom Domains without Proper Verification](./threats/tunnel_hijacking_via_custom_domains_without_proper_verification.md)

**Description:** If using custom domains with `ngrok`, an attacker could potentially claim the domain if proper verification procedures are not followed, allowing them to intercept traffic intended for the application *through the ngrok tunnel*.

**Impact:** Redirection of traffic to malicious sites, data interception, potential compromise of users interacting with the hijacked domain.

**Affected Component:** `ngrok` custom domain configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly follow `ngrok`'s documentation for verifying ownership of custom domains.
*   Regularly review and manage custom domain configurations.
