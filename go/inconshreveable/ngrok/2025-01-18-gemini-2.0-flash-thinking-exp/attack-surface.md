# Attack Surface Analysis for inconshreveable/ngrok

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Internal Services](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_internal_services.md)

* **Description:** Making services intended for local or private network access publicly available via an ngrok tunnel.
    * **How ngrok Contributes:** ngrok's core functionality is to create a publicly accessible URL that forwards traffic to a locally running service. This inherently exposes the service to the internet.
    * **Example:** A developer uses `ngrok http 8080` to expose a development web server running on their local machine. This server might lack production-level security measures.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential for remote code execution if vulnerabilities exist in the exposed service, data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Use Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms within the application itself, even for development environments.
        * **Restrict Access by IP (ngrok Paid Feature):** Utilize ngrok's IP restriction features (available in paid plans) to limit access to specific IP addresses or ranges.
        * **Regularly Review Active Tunnels:** Maintain a clear record of active ngrok tunnels and terminate them when no longer needed.
        * **Educate Developers:** Train developers on the risks of exposing internal services and the importance of secure configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised ngrok Account or Authtoken](./attack_surfaces/compromised_ngrok_account_or_authtoken.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gains access to the ngrok account or authtoken used to create the tunnel.
    * **How ngrok Contributes:** The ngrok authtoken acts as a credential to create and manage tunnels. If compromised, an attacker can create their own tunnels to the application.
    * **Example:** A developer accidentally commits their ngrok authtoken to a public repository. An attacker finds it and creates a malicious tunnel pointing to the same local port.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application, potential for data exfiltration, redirection of traffic to malicious servers, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Securely Store and Manage Authtokens:** Treat ngrok authtokens as sensitive credentials. Avoid storing them in code or version control. Use environment variables or secure secret management tools.
        * **Regularly Rotate Authtokens:** Periodically change the ngrok authtoken to limit the impact of a potential compromise.
        * **Monitor ngrok Account Activity:** Regularly review the activity logs in the ngrok dashboard for any suspicious or unauthorized tunnel creations.
        * **Use ngrok's Team Features:** If working in a team, utilize ngrok's team features for better control and management of tunnels and authtokens.
