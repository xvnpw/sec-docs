## Updated Vulnerability List for mousetrap project

After reviewing the `mousetrap` project and applying the specified filtering criteria for external attackers and high-rank vulnerabilities, no vulnerabilities meeting these requirements were identified.

Based on the analysis, the `mousetrap` library, in its publicly available instance, does not present any high-rank security vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker that are not caused by insecure code patterns in projects using the library, are not related to missing documentation, or are not denial of service vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the updated vulnerability list remains empty, as no vulnerabilities satisfying the given conditions were found.
