- **Vulnerability Name:** Server‐Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via LoadURL Function

- **Description:**
  The library provides functions (e.g. `LoadURL` and `LoadURLs` in *load.go*) that accept a URL string and fetch its contents using the standard library’s `http.Get()` call. No input validation, domain whitelisting, or explicit timeout is applied to the URL parameter. An external attacker who can influence the URL input (for example, via a misconfigured or public instance that loads property files based on user input) can supply a malicious URL. By pointing the URL to internal resources (e.g. cloud metadata endpoints or otherwise restricted IP addresses), the attacker could force the application to fetch internal data.

  **Step‑by‑step how to trigger:**
  1. Identify that the application (using this library) supports loading configuration properties from remote URLs using functions such as `MustLoadURL()` or `LoadURL()`.
  2. Supply a URL value that points to an internal or otherwise restricted network address. For example, an attacker might supply a URL such as `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` or another internal service.
  3. When the application invokes the URL‑loading function, it will blindly issue an HTTP request via `http.Get(url)`. The response is then processed and loaded without any checks restricting outbound requests.
  4. By observing error responses, logs, or (depending on the application’s behavior) the properties loaded into memory, the attacker may infer sensitive internal data or use the library as a foothold to perform further network probing.

- **Impact:**
  An attacker who can force the application to load properties from an arbitrary URL can use SSRF to:
  - Access information about internal network services that are not otherwise exposed externally.
  - Potentially retrieve sensitive data (e.g. internal metadata, credentials, or configuration details).
  - Use the internal access as a stepping stone for further attacks against internal systems.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The function does perform a minimal check on the HTTP response’s status code and Content‑Type header (only accepting responses with status code 200 and specific textual content types). However, this check only affects the interpretation (encoding) of the response and does not restrict which URLs can be fetched.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **URL Validation / Whitelisting:** No mechanism to validate user‑supplied URLs against a whitelist of approved hosts or IP ranges is present.
  - **Timeout / Request Context:** The use of the default `http.Get()` (via the global HTTP client) does not enforce a specific timeout or restrict outbound network calls.
  - **Network Restriction:** There is no check to prevent requests to internal or loopback IP addresses.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The application must use the properties library function(s) that load remote URLs (e.g. `LoadURL` or `MustLoadURL`).
  - An attacker must be able to supply (or influence) the URL input—either directly via a user‑accessible configuration parameter, an API endpoint, or indirect configuration file upload.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In *load.go*, the `LoadURL` function starts with:
    ```go
    resp, err := http.Get(url)
    if err != nil {
      return nil, fmt.Errorf("properties: error fetching %q. %s", url, err)
    }
    ```
    Here the input `url` is passed verbatim to `http.Get()` without any validation or filtering.
  - The response is then checked only for a 404 (with an option to ignore) and then that the response code is 200. The Content‑Type header is used solely to select the encoding but is not used to verify that the URL belongs to an allowed domain.
  - No additional security controls (such as timeouts or request context with deadline) are applied.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup a Controlled Test Server:**
     - Spin up a local HTTP server (or use an internal test service) that simulates an internal resource and returns a plain‑text response (e.g. “secret=value”).
  2. **Invoke the Vulnerable Function:**
     - Call `MustLoadURL("http://<test-server-address>/...")` (or use the equivalent `LoadURL` function) from the application instance.
  3. **Verify Request Behavior:**
     - Confirm that the library makes an HTTP GET request to the supplied URL and that the response is processed into properties.
  4. **Simulate Malicious Request:**
     - Then, supply a URL pointing to a sensitive internal IP address (for example, `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`) and observe that the library attempts to retrieve data from that URL.
  5. **Check Impact:**
     - If the application logs the error or (in misconfigured deployments) loads the remote data, then this demonstrates that the function does not restrict the outgoing request to approved domains.

  This test case proves that an external attacker with influence on the URL input could trigger the application to perform an SSRF request, thereby accessing internal services.
