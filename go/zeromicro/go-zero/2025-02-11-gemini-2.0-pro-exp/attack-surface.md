# Attack Surface Analysis for zeromicro/go-zero

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Internal Service Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_internal_service_exposure.md)

*   **Description:**  Internal services or administrative endpoints are exposed due to misconfiguration of `go-zero`'s routing and API gateway.
*   **go-zero Contribution:** `go-zero`'s automatic route generation and `.api` file configuration are the *direct* mechanisms that, if misused, lead to this exposure. The framework's design choices necessitate careful route management.
*   **Example:** An endpoint `/api/internal/admin/users` is exposed because of a wildcard route (`/api/internal/*`) in the `go-zero` `.api` file.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data, system compromise, data modification, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Explicit Route Definitions:**  Define *all* routes explicitly in `go-zero`'s `.api` files.  Avoid overly broad wildcards.  Review all routes.
    *   **Mandatory Authentication/Authorization (go-zero Middleware):**  Use `go-zero`'s middleware system to enforce authentication and authorization *at the gateway level* for *every* route, including internal ones.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Audit the `go-zero` API gateway configuration and routing rules regularly.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Bypass](./attack_surfaces/middleware_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers bypass security controls implemented in `go-zero` middleware.
*   **go-zero Contribution:** This is *directly* related to `go-zero`'s middleware system.  The vulnerability arises from how developers use or misuse this core `go-zero` feature.
*   **Example:**  Authentication middleware is placed *after* logging middleware in the `go-zero` configuration, leading to sensitive data being logged before authentication.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access, data breaches, privilege escalation, logging of sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Middleware Ordering (go-zero Configuration):**  Carefully plan and enforce the correct order of middleware within `go-zero`'s configuration.  Authentication/authorization *must* come first.
    *   **Middleware Auditing:**  Thoroughly audit the code and configuration of *all* middleware used with `go-zero` (custom and third-party).
    *   **Secure Coding Practices (go-zero Middleware):**  Follow secure coding practices when developing custom `go-zero` middleware.

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated gRPC Input (go-zero gRPC Support)](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_grpc_input__go-zero_grpc_support_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in input validation within `go-zero` gRPC service handlers.
*   **go-zero Contribution:** `go-zero`'s built-in support for gRPC is the *direct* enabler of this attack surface. While Protobuf provides type checking, content validation is the developer's responsibility *within the go-zero context*.
*   **Example:** A `go-zero` gRPC service receives a malicious payload that bypasses basic Protobuf type checks but causes an error within the handler logic.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, data corruption, unexpected application behavior.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Protobuf Validation (with go-zero):** Use Protobuf validation libraries (e.g., `protoc-gen-validate`) in conjunction with `go-zero`'s gRPC implementation.
    *   **Handler-Level Validation (go-zero gRPC Handlers):** Implement thorough input validation *within* each `go-zero` gRPC service handler, even with Protobuf validation.

## Attack Surface: [Rate Limiting Bypass / DoS (go-zero `ratelimit` Middleware)](./attack_surfaces/rate_limiting_bypass__dos__go-zero__ratelimit__middleware_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers bypass `go-zero`'s built-in rate limiting or cause a denial of service.
*   **go-zero Contribution:** This attack surface is *directly* related to `go-zero`'s `ratelimit` middleware.  The vulnerability stems from its configuration and potential bypasses.
*   **Example:**  An attacker bypasses the `go-zero` `ratelimit` middleware due to misconfiguration or by using a distributed attack.
*   **Impact:**  Service unavailability, performance degradation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Rate Limiting Configuration (go-zero `ratelimit`):**  Carefully configure `go-zero`'s `ratelimit` middleware with appropriate thresholds and time windows for *each* endpoint.
    *   **Multi-Layered Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at multiple layers (consider external tools in addition to `go-zero`).

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data in Configuration/Logs (go-zero Configuration and Logging)](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_in_configurationlogs__go-zero_configuration_and_logging_.md)

* **Description:** Sensitive information is stored insecurely in `go-zero` configuration files or logged by `go-zero`'s logging system.
* **go-zero Contribution:** This is *directly* related to how developers use `go-zero`'s configuration (YAML files) and logging features. The framework provides these mechanisms, and their misuse creates the vulnerability.
* **Example:** A database password is hardcoded in a `go-zero` `config.yaml` file, or sensitive data is logged using `go-zero`'s logger at the DEBUG level.
* **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, system compromise.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Environment Variables (with go-zero):** Use environment variables for sensitive data, leveraging `go-zero`'s support for loading configuration from them.
    * **Log Sanitization (go-zero Logging Middleware):** Customize `go-zero`'s logging middleware to redact or mask sensitive data *before* logging.
    * **Log Level Control (go-zero Logging):** Use appropriate log levels in `go-zero` (avoid DEBUG in production).
    * **.gitignore:** Exclude `go-zero` configuration files containing sensitive data from version control.
