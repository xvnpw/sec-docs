# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for zeromicro/go-zero

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Route Definition (using `go-zero`'s routing)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_route_definition__using__go-zero_'s_routing_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Route Definition

**Description:**
1.  **Review `*.api` Files:** Examine all `*.api` files for wildcard routes (`*`) or overly broad path parameters.
2.  **Refactor to Explicit Paths:** Replace wildcards with specific paths.  Example: `/api/items/*` becomes `/api/items/{itemID}` and `/api/items`.
3.  **Route Grouping (`group`):** Use `go-zero`'s `group` feature in `*.api` files to logically organize routes and apply middleware consistently.
    ```go
    @server(
        group: user
        prefix: /api/v1/users
        middleware: AuthMiddleware
    )
    service user-api {
        @handler getUser
        get /{userID} (GetUserReq) returns (GetUserResp)
    }
    ```
4.  **(Ideal - but requires custom tooling):** Integrate a script into your CI/CD pipeline to analyze `*.api` files for dangerous route patterns. This is *not* a built-in `go-zero` feature, but leverages the structure of `*.api` files.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unintended Endpoint Exposure (High Severity):** Prevents access to internal APIs or administrative endpoints.
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk of leaking data through poorly defined routes.
*   **Bypassing Authentication/Authorization (High Severity):** Ensures protected routes have middleware.

**Impact:**
*   **Unintended Endpoint Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
*   **Bypassing Authentication/Authorization:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low, *if* middleware is correctly used).

**Currently Implemented:** Partially. `user-api` uses specific paths. `product-api` has wildcards. No CI/CD analysis.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `product-api`: Refactor wildcard routes.
*   CI/CD: Implement automated route analysis (custom tooling).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authentication and Authorization (using `go-zero`'s middleware)](./mitigation_strategies/authentication_and_authorization__using__go-zero_'s_middleware_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Authentication and Authorization Enforcement (via Middleware)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Protected Routes:** Determine which endpoints need authentication and authorization.
2.  **`jwtx` Middleware (or Custom):** Use `go-zero`'s `jwtx` middleware (or a custom one) in your `*.api` file to validate JWTs. Configure globally or on route groups:
    ```go
    @server(
        middleware: AuthMiddleware // Global
    )
    service my-api { ... }

    @server(
        group: protected
        middleware: AuthMiddleware // Group-specific
    )
    service my-api { ... }
    ```
3.  **Authorization *within Handlers* (Not Directly `go-zero`):**  While `go-zero` provides the *mechanism* for authentication (middleware), the *authorization logic* (checking permissions) must be implemented *within your handlers*. This is *not* a direct `go-zero` feature, but it's *enabled* by the middleware.
4.  **Consistent Application:** Ensure *every* protected route has authentication middleware.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthenticated access.
*   **Bypassing Authentication (High Severity):** Ensures authentication checks are performed.
*   **(Indirectly) Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** The middleware *enables* authorization checks in handlers, which mitigate this.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
*   **Bypassing Authentication:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced *indirectly* (High to Low, dependent on handler logic).

**Currently Implemented:** `jwtx` middleware is implemented globally.

**Missing Implementation:**  Authorization checks within handlers are inconsistent (see previous, more complete list). This is *not* a `go-zero` feature gap, but a handler implementation gap.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation (using `go-zero`'s `validate` tag)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation__using__go-zero_'s__validate__tag_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation (via `validate` tag)

**Description:**
1.  **Request Structs:** Define request structs for all API endpoints.
2.  **`validate` Tag:** Use the `validate` tag in your request structs to specify validation rules:
    ```go
    type CreateUserReq struct {
        Username string `json:"username" validate:"required,min=3,max=20"`
        Email    string `json:"email" validate:"required,email"`
    }
    ```
3.  **Automatic Validation:** `go-zero` automatically validates requests against these rules *before* handlers are executed.
4.  **(Not Directly `go-zero`):**  Handler-level validation is still recommended for complex business rules.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents many injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, command, XSS - *if combined with output encoding*).
*   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Prevents invalid data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Helps prevent DoS attacks exploiting input parsing.
*   **Business Logic Errors (Medium Severity):** Prevents errors from invalid input.

**Impact:**
*   **Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Medium).
*   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
*   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low/Medium).
*   **Business Logic Errors:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).

**Currently Implemented:** `validate` tags are used in *most* request structs.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `product-api`: Some request structs are missing `validate` tags.
*   Handler-level validation is inconsistent (not a `go-zero` feature gap).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting (using `go-zero`'s `ratelimit` middleware)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting__using__go-zero_'s__ratelimit__middleware_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Rate Limiting (via `ratelimit` Middleware)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Targets:** Determine which endpoints need rate limiting.
2.  **`ratelimit` Middleware:** Use `go-zero`'s `ratelimit` middleware in your `*.api` file:
    ```go
    @server(
        middleware: RateLimitMiddleware
    )
    service my-api { ... }
    ```
3.  **Configuration:** Configure `limit`, `burst`, `period`, and `key` within the middleware.
4.  **(Not Directly `go-zero`):** Differentiated limits (per endpoint, user role, etc.) require custom logic, often within the `key` function or by using multiple instances of the middleware.
5.  **(Not Directly `go-zero`):** Informative error responses (429 Too Many Requests, `Retry-After` header) are best practice, but require custom handler logic.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Protects against DoS attacks.
*   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Helps prevent brute-force attacks.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Prevents resource consumption.
*   **API Abuse (Medium Severity):** Prevents abusive clients.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Medium).
*   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
*   **API Abuse:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).

**Currently Implemented:** `ratelimit` middleware is implemented globally.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Differentiated rate limits (not a direct `go-zero` feature).
*   Informative error responses (not a direct `go-zero` feature).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Circuit Breaker (using go-zero's `breaker` middleware)](./mitigation_strategies/circuit_breaker__using_go-zero's__breaker__middleware_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Circuit Breaker (via `breaker` Middleware)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Targets:** Determine which endpoints need circuit breaker. Usually it is used for external services calls.
2.  **`breaker` Middleware:** Use `go-zero`'s `breaker` middleware in your `*.api` file:
        ```go
        @server(
            middleware: BreakerMiddleware
        )
        service my-api { ... }
        ```
3. **Configuration:** Configure circuit breaker parameters.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cascading Failures (High Severity):** Prevents failures in one service from cascading to other services.
*   **Service Unavailability (High Severity):** Improves service resilience by preventing requests to failing services.

**Impact:**
*   **Cascading Failures:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Medium).
*   **Service Unavailability:** Risk reduced (High to Low).

**Currently Implemented:** Not implemented.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Implement `breaker` middleware for external services calls.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeout (using go-zero's `timeout` middleware)](./mitigation_strategies/timeout__using_go-zero's__timeout__middleware_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Timeout (via `timeout` Middleware)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Targets:** Determine which endpoints need timeout.
2.  **`timeout` Middleware:** Use `go-zero`'s `timeout` middleware in your `*.api` file:
    ```go
    @server(
        middleware: TimeoutMiddleware
    )
    service my-api { ... }
    ```
3. **Configuration:** Configure timeout parameters.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Prevents long-running requests from blocking resources.
*   **Service Unavailability (High Severity):** Improves service resilience by preventing requests to hang indefinitely.

**Impact:**
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
*   **Service Unavailability:** Risk reduced (High to Low).

**Currently Implemented:** Not implemented.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Implement `timeout` middleware for all endpoints.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration Loading (using go-zero's config)](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_loading__using_go-zero's_config_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Configuration Loading

**Description:**
1. **Define Configuration Struct:** Create a Go struct that represents your application's configuration.
2. **Use `conf.MustLoad`:** Use the `conf.MustLoad` function (or `conf.Load`) from `go-zero`'s `core/conf` package to load configuration from a file (YAML, JSON, TOML).
    ```go
    var c Config
    conf.MustLoad("etc/my-api.yaml", &c)
    ```
3. **Environment Variable Overrides:** Use the `env` tag in your configuration struct to allow environment variables to override values from the configuration file. This is crucial for secrets.
    ```go
    type Config struct {
        Database struct {
            Host     string `yaml:"host"`
            Port     int    `yaml:"port"`
            User     string `yaml:"user"`
            Password string `yaml:"password" env:"DB_PASSWORD"` // Override from env
        } `yaml:"database"`
    }
    ```
4. **(Not Directly `go-zero`):**  For production, use a secrets management service (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) and inject secrets into environment variables. `go-zero`'s `env` tag support makes this integration seamless.

**Threats Mitigated:**
* **Credential Exposure (High Severity):**  The `env` tag, *when used with environment variables and a secrets manager*, significantly reduces this risk.  `go-zero` provides the *mechanism* for secure loading.
* **Configuration Errors (Low Severity):** `conf.MustLoad` helps ensure that the configuration file is valid and can be parsed.

**Impact:**
* **Credential Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low, *when used correctly*).
* **Configuration Errors:** Risk reduced (Low to Negligible).

**Currently Implemented:** `conf.MustLoad` is used. Environment variables are used for *some* secrets.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent use of environment variables for *all* secrets.
*   Integration with a secrets management service (not a `go-zero` feature gap).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Logging (using go-zero's `logx`)](./mitigation_strategies/logging__using_go-zero's__logx__.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Structured Logging (via `logx`)

**Description:**
1.  **Use `logx`:** Use `go-zero`'s `logx` package for all logging.
2.  **Structured Logging:** Use `logx.WithContext(ctx).Infof(...)` or similar methods to log in a structured (JSON) format.  Include relevant context:
    ```go
    logx.WithContext(ctx).Infow("User logged in", logx.Field("userID", userID))
    ```
3.  **Log Levels:** Use appropriate log levels (debug, info, warn, error, fatal).
4.  **(Not Directly `go-zero`):** Log aggregation, monitoring, and alerting are crucial, but they are *external* to `go-zero`. `go-zero` provides the *logging mechanism*.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **(Indirectly) Intrusion Detection (Medium Severity):** Structured logs *enable* better intrusion detection when combined with log analysis tools.
*   **(Indirectly) Incident Response (Medium Severity):** Structured logs provide valuable information for investigations.

**Impact:**
*   **Intrusion Detection:** Risk reduced *indirectly* (Medium to Low/Medium).
*   **Incident Response:** Risk reduced *indirectly* (Medium to Low/Medium).

**Currently Implemented:** `logx` is used, but not always with structured logging.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent use of structured logging with `logx.WithContext`.
*   Log aggregation, monitoring, and alerting (not `go-zero` features).
