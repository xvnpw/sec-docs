Okay, let's create a design document for the go-zero project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a robust and performant web and RPC framework for building microservices in Go.
*   Simplify the development of microservices by offering built-in features like service discovery, load balancing, circuit breaking, and rate limiting.
*   Reduce development time and effort by providing code generation tools and a consistent development experience.
*   Improve the reliability and resilience of microservices through built-in fault tolerance mechanisms.
*   Enable easy integration with other systems and services.
*   Offer a framework that is easy to learn and use, even for developers new to microservices.
*   Maintain high performance and low resource consumption.

Business Risks:

*   Inconsistent adoption: If the framework is not widely adopted, community support and the availability of third-party integrations may be limited.
*   Complexity: While aiming for simplicity, the framework might introduce its own complexities, especially for larger, more intricate systems.
*   Performance bottlenecks: If not carefully designed and used, the framework's features (like middleware) could introduce performance overhead.
*   Security vulnerabilities: Any vulnerabilities in the framework could expose applications built with it to significant risks.
*   Vendor lock-in: Adopting go-zero might lead to a degree of vendor lock-in, making it harder to switch to other frameworks later.
*   Maintenance and updates: The long-term maintenance and updates of the framework are crucial for its continued viability.
*   Lack of specific features: The framework may not cover all the specific needs of every project, requiring custom solutions or workarounds.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: API Gateway features: go-zero includes built-in features for API gateway functionality, such as routing, middleware, and request/response transformations. (Described in go-zero documentation and examples).
*   security control: Rate limiting: go-zero provides built-in rate limiting capabilities to protect services from abuse and overload. (Described in go-zero documentation and examples).
*   security control: Circuit breaking: go-zero includes circuit breaking functionality to prevent cascading failures in distributed systems. (Described in go-zero documentation and examples).
*   security control: Timeout control: go-zero allows developers to set timeouts for requests to prevent resource exhaustion. (Described in go-zero documentation and examples).
*   security control: Middleware support: go-zero's middleware architecture allows developers to implement custom security logic, such as authentication and authorization. (Described in go-zero documentation and examples).
*   security control: Secure by default configurations (mitigation for common web vulnerabilities): While not explicitly stated, well-designed frameworks often have secure defaults. (Needs verification in go-zero documentation and code).
*   security control: Dependency management: Go's module system helps manage dependencies and their security. (Implicit in Go development).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The framework's reliance on third-party libraries introduces the risk of vulnerabilities in those dependencies.
*   accepted risk: The framework's code generation tools, while convenient, could potentially introduce vulnerabilities if not carefully designed and used.
*   accepted risk: Misconfiguration of security features (like rate limiting or circuit breaking) could lead to denial-of-service or other security issues.
*   accepted risk: The framework itself might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement authentication and authorization middleware: Ensure robust authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place for all APIs.
*   Implement input validation and sanitization: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
*   Use secure coding practices: Follow secure coding guidelines to minimize vulnerabilities.
*   Regularly update dependencies: Keep all dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Perform security audits and penetration testing: Regularly assess the security of applications built with go-zero.
*   Implement logging and monitoring: Monitor application logs for suspicious activity.
*   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF): A WAF can provide an additional layer of security against common web attacks.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All APIs should require authentication, except for explicitly defined public endpoints.
    *   Support multiple authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0, API keys).
    *   Securely store and manage user credentials.
    *   Implement robust password policies.
*   Authorization:
    *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege.
    *   Authorize access to resources based on user roles and permissions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all user inputs against a strict whitelist of allowed characters and formats.
    *   Sanitize all user inputs to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks.
    *   Validate data types, lengths, and ranges.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms for encryption and hashing.
    *   Securely manage cryptographic keys.
    *   Use HTTPS for all communication.
    *   Protect sensitive data at rest using encryption.

## BUILD

The build process for go-zero projects typically involves the following steps:

1.  Developer writes code and commits it to a version control system (e.g., Git).
2.  A Continuous Integration (CI) system (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI) detects the changes.
3.  The CI system checks out the code.
4.  The CI system runs linters (e.g., `golangci-lint`) to check for code style and potential errors.
5.  The CI system runs unit tests and integration tests.
6.  The CI system builds the Go binaries using `go build`.
7.  The CI system builds Docker images using `docker build`.  This step often uses a Dockerfile that defines the build environment and dependencies.
8.  The CI system runs security scanners on the code (SAST - Static Application Security Testing) and on the Docker images (container scanning). Examples include `gosec` for Go code and `trivy` or `clair` for container images.
9.  The CI system pushes the Docker images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, AWS Elastic Container Registry).
10. The CI system might also trigger deployments to a staging or production environment.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer(("Developer")) -- "Commits code" --> VCS(("Version Control System (Git)"))
    VCS -- "Triggers build" --> CI(("CI System (GitHub Actions)"))
    CI -- "Runs linters" --> Linters(("Linters (golangci-lint)"))
    CI -- "Runs tests" --> Tests(("Tests (go test)"))
    CI -- "Builds binaries" --> GoBuild(("go build"))
    CI -- "Builds Docker images" --> DockerBuild(("docker build"))
    CI -- "Runs SAST" --> SAST(("SAST (gosec)"))
    CI -- "Runs container scanning" --> ContainerScanning(("Container Scanning (trivy)"))
    CI -- "Pushes images" --> ContainerRegistry(("Container Registry"))
    ContainerRegistry -- "Used for deployment" --> Kubernetes(("Kubernetes Cluster"))
```

Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   security control: Version Control System (Git): Tracks code changes and allows for auditing and rollbacks.
*   security control: CI System (GitHub Actions): Automates the build process and ensures consistency.
*   security control: Linters (golangci-lint): Enforces code style and detects potential errors.
*   security control: Tests (go test): Ensures code functionality and helps prevent regressions.
*   security control: SAST (gosec): Scans Go code for security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Container Scanning (trivy): Scans Docker images for known vulnerabilities in dependencies and the operating system.
*   security control: Secure Container Registry: Stores Docker images securely and controls access.
*   security control: Signed Commits: Ensures the integrity and authenticity of code commits.
*   security control: Dependency Management: Go modules help manage dependencies and their versions, reducing the risk of using vulnerable libraries.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   API availability and responsiveness: The APIs provided by go-zero applications are critical for business operations. Any downtime or performance degradation can directly impact users and business processes.
*   Data integrity and consistency: The data stored and processed by go-zero applications must be accurate and consistent. Data corruption or loss can have severe consequences.
*   User authentication and authorization: Secure access control is essential to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized actions.
*   Integration with external systems: The ability to reliably integrate with other systems and services is often crucial for business operations.

Data Sensitivity:

*   User data (PII): Personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, and other personal details must be protected according to privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
*   Financial data: If the application handles financial transactions or data, this data is highly sensitive and requires strong protection.
*   Authentication credentials: Usernames, passwords, API keys, and other credentials must be stored and handled securely.
*   Business-sensitive data: This may include proprietary information, trade secrets, or other data that could harm the business if exposed.
*   Application data: Data specific for application business logic.
