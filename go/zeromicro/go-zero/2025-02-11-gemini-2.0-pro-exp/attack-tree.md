## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Authentication/Authorization Mechanisms [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_authenticationauthorization_mechanisms__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most critical area, as it governs access to the entire application.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **1.1 JWT Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **1.1.1 Algorithm Confusion [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Action:** The attacker crafts a JWT, setting the "alg" field to "none" and providing an empty signature.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High (Complete authentication bypass)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
            *   **Mitigation:**  go-zero's JWT validation must strictly enforce the expected algorithm and reject tokens with "alg": "none" or invalid signatures.
        *   **1.1.2 Weak Secret Key [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Action:** The attacker attempts to guess or brute-force the JWT secret key.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High (Complete authentication bypass)
            *   **Effort:** Medium to High
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
            *   **Mitigation:** Use a strong, randomly generated secret key (at least 32 bytes for HS256, 2048 bits for RS256) and store it securely. Implement key rotation.
    *   **1.2 Bypass Authorization Checks:**
        *   **1.2.1 Incorrect Middleware Order [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Action:** The attacker exploits a misconfiguration where authentication/authorization middleware is placed *after* middleware that accesses sensitive data.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
            *   **Mitigation:** Carefully review the middleware chain and ensure authentication/authorization middleware is executed *before* any sensitive operations.
        *   **1.2.2 Missing Authorization Checks [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Action:** The attacker identifies and accesses API endpoints that lack proper authorization checks.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
            *   **Mitigation:**  Ensure all API endpoints that require authorization have the appropriate middleware applied.  Use a consistent authorization policy across the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit RPC Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_rpc_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Focuses on vulnerabilities within go-zero's `zrpc` component.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **2.1 Unauthenticated RPC Calls [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Action:** The attacker directly calls RPC endpoints without providing authentication credentials.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
        *   **Mitigation:** Enforce authentication on *all* RPC endpoints, even those considered "internal."
    *   **2.2 Input Validation Flaws in RPC Handlers [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Action:** The attacker sends malformed or unexpected data to RPC endpoints to trigger vulnerabilities.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict input validation on all RPC handlers. Use a schema validation library if possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit API Gateway Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_api_gateway_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Focuses on vulnerabilities within go-zero's `gateway` component.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **3.1 Routing Misconfigurations [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Action:** The attacker exploits misconfigured routing rules to access internal services or endpoints.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:**  Configure the gateway with least privilege routing.  Regularly review and audit routing rules.
    *   **3.2 Bypass Gateway Authentication/Authorization [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Action:** The attacker attempts to access backend services directly, bypassing the gateway.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:**  Do *not* rely solely on the gateway for security.  Backend services must have their own independent authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Focuses on vulnerabilities within go-zero's dependencies.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **4.1 Vulnerabilities in go-zero's dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Action:** The attacker exploits a known vulnerability in one of go-zero's dependencies.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** Varies (depending on the vulnerability)
        *   **Effort:** Low (if a public exploit is available)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (with SCA tools)
        *   **Mitigation:** Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in dependencies. Keep dependencies updated.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Misconfiguration of go-zero Features](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_misconfiguration_of_go-zero_features.md)

    *   **5.4. Insecure default configurations [HIGH-RISK PATH]**

        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Varies

        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
        *   **Mitigation:** Never rely on default configurations for security-sensitive settings. Explicitly configure all security-related parameters. Review configuration files thoroughly.
