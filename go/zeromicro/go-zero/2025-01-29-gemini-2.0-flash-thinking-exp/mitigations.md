## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust API Rate Limiting and Throttling using go-zero Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/robust_api_rate_limiting_and_throttling_using_go-zero_middleware.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Identify critical API endpoints:** Determine which API endpoints in your go-zero API service are most vulnerable to abuse or resource exhaustion.
    2.  **Implement go-zero's rate limiting middleware:** Utilize `go-zero/rest/httpx.RateLimit` middleware within your go-zero API gateway service. This middleware is specifically designed for go-zero REST APIs.
    3.  **Configure rate limits in `api.yaml`:** Define rate limits directly within your go-zero API service's configuration file (`api.yaml`). This allows for declarative configuration of rate limiting within the go-zero framework.
    4.  **Customize error responses using go-zero handlers:**  Ensure rate-limited requests return informative HTTP status codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) and clear error messages by customizing go-zero's error handling mechanisms within your API handlers.
    5.  **Test rate limiting within go-zero environment:** Thoroughly test rate limiting configurations within your go-zero application deployment to ensure effectiveness and avoid unintended blocking of legitimate traffic.
**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks - **Severity: High**
    *   Brute-force attacks (e.g., password guessing) - **Severity: Medium**
    *   Resource exhaustion - **Severity: Medium**
**Impact:**
    *   DoS attacks - **Impact: High**
    *   Brute-force attacks - **Impact: Medium**
    *   Resource exhaustion - **Impact: High**
**Currently Implemented:** API Gateway service, using `go-zero/rest/httpx.RateLimit` middleware configured in the `api.yaml` file. Rate limits are defined for login and resource creation endpoints.
**Missing Implementation:** Rate limiting is not yet implemented for RPC services. Needs custom gRPC interceptors as go-zero's built-in middleware is for REST APIs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization in go-zero API and RPC Handlers](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_in_go-zero_api_and_rpc_handlers.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Define input schemas using go-zero request structs:** Clearly define the expected data types, formats, and constraints for all API and RPC request parameters using go-zero's request struct definitions within your service logic.
    2.  **Implement validation logic within go-zero handlers:** Utilize Go's standard library or validation libraries directly within your go-zero API and RPC handlers to validate incoming request data against the defined schemas. This keeps validation logic tightly integrated with your go-zero service code.
    3.  **Sanitize user inputs within go-zero handlers:** Sanitize validated inputs within your go-zero handlers to remove or encode potentially harmful characters or code snippets before processing or storing data.
    4.  **Handle validation errors gracefully using go-zero error responses:** Return informative error responses to clients when validation fails, leveraging go-zero's error handling mechanisms to provide consistent and structured error responses.
    5.  **Regularly review and update validation rules in go-zero services:** Keep validation rules up-to-date within your go-zero services as application requirements and security threats evolve.
**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - **Severity: High**
    *   SQL Injection (if applicable) - **Severity: High**
    *   Command Injection - **Severity: High**
    *   Data integrity issues - **Severity: Medium**
**Impact:**
    *   XSS, SQL Injection, Command Injection - **Impact: High**
    *   Data integrity issues - **Impact: Medium**
**Currently Implemented:** Input validation is partially implemented in API handlers using basic type checks within go-zero handlers. RPC handlers rely mostly on protobuf type checking.
**Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive input validation and sanitization are missing in both API and RPC handlers. Need to implement robust validation using a dedicated validation library and sanitize inputs consistently across all go-zero handlers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Mutual TLS (mTLS) for go-zero RPC/gRPC Communication](./mitigation_strategies/mutual_tls__mtls__for_go-zero_rpcgrpc_communication.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Generate TLS certificates for go-zero services:** Generate TLS certificates specifically for your go-zero RPC services and clients.
    2.  **Configure go-zero RPC services for mTLS in service configuration:** Configure go-zero RPC services to require client certificates and use TLS by setting TLS options within the go-zero RPC server configuration.
    3.  **Configure go-zero RPC clients for mTLS in client configuration:** Configure go-zero RPC clients to present their certificates to the server during connection establishment by setting TLS options within the go-zero RPC client configuration.
    4.  **Enforce certificate verification in go-zero services and clients:** Ensure that both go-zero services and clients are configured to verify the validity of presented certificates against a trusted CA or configured certificate pool within their TLS configurations.
    5.  **Certificate rotation and management for go-zero services:** Implement a process for regular certificate rotation and secure management of private keys used by go-zero services to maintain security.
**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks - **Severity: High**
    *   Unauthorized service access - **Severity: High**
    *   Spoofing and impersonation - **Severity: Medium**
**Impact:**
    *   MITM attacks - **Impact: High**
    *   Unauthorized service access - **Impact: High**
    *   Spoofing and impersonation - **Impact: Medium**
**Currently Implemented:** mTLS is partially implemented between the API Gateway and some backend RPC services. TLS configuration is done directly in go-zero service code.
**Missing Implementation:** mTLS is not consistently implemented across all go-zero RPC services. Certificate management is manual. Need to extend mTLS to all inter-service communication and automate certificate management, potentially integrating with go-zero's configuration system.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using go-zero Middleware/Interceptors](./mitigation_strategies/role-based_access_control__rbac__using_go-zero_middlewareinterceptors.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Define roles and permissions relevant to go-zero services:** Define roles and permissions that align with the functionalities and resources exposed by your go-zero API and RPC services.
    2.  **Implement authorization middleware/interceptors in go-zero:** Develop or utilize go-zero middleware for API services and interceptors for RPC services to enforce RBAC policies. These components are designed to integrate seamlessly with go-zero's request handling pipeline.
    3.  **Integrate with go-zero authentication system:** Integrate RBAC with your go-zero application's authentication system to retrieve user roles after successful authentication, potentially leveraging go-zero's context propagation features.
    4.  **Enforce least privilege principle within go-zero services:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions required to perform their tasks within the context of your go-zero application.
    5.  **Centralized policy management (optional) for go-zero RBAC:** Consider using a centralized policy management system for more complex RBAC scenarios in go-zero, potentially integrating it with go-zero's configuration or dependency injection mechanisms.
**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality - **Severity: High**
    *   Privilege escalation - **Severity: Medium**
    *   Data breaches due to compromised accounts - **Severity: Medium**
**Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access - **Impact: High**
    *   Privilege escalation - **Impact: Medium**
    *   Data breaches - **Impact: Medium**
**Currently Implemented:** Basic authorization checks are implemented in some API endpoints based on user roles stored in JWT claims, using custom middleware in go-zero API service. RPC services lack RBAC.
**Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive RBAC is missing across both API and RPC services. Need to implement a consistent RBAC framework using go-zero middleware/interceptors and potentially integrate with a policy engine for complex scenarios.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration Management using go-zero Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_management_using_go-zero_configuration.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Separate configuration from go-zero code using `conf` package:** Store configuration settings outside of your go-zero application code, utilizing go-zero's `conf` package and configuration files (e.g., `.yaml`).
    2.  **Use environment variables for sensitive configuration in go-zero deployments:** Store sensitive configuration values as environment variables in your go-zero application deployments, leveraging go-zero's ability to read environment variables during configuration loading.
    3.  **Implement secrets management (external system) for go-zero:** Integrate with a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to securely manage secrets used by your go-zero application, accessing secrets through environment variables or go-zero's configuration loading mechanisms.
    4.  **Avoid hardcoding secrets in go-zero code or configuration files:** Never hardcode secrets directly within your go-zero application code or configuration files.
    5.  **Restrict access to go-zero configuration files and secrets management:** Limit access to go-zero configuration files and secrets management systems to authorized personnel and processes only, ensuring secure configuration management within your go-zero environment.
**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive credentials - **Severity: High**
    *   Unauthorized access to infrastructure - **Severity: Medium**
**Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive credentials - **Impact: High**
    *   Unauthorized access to infrastructure - **Impact: Medium**
**Currently Implemented:** Configuration is separated from code using `go-zero/core/conf` and `.yaml` files. Environment variables are used for some sensitive settings, leveraging go-zero's configuration loading.
**Missing Implementation:** Secrets management system is not yet implemented. Sensitive secrets are currently stored as environment variables or encrypted configuration files. Need to integrate with a secrets management system like HashiCorp Vault to improve secret security and leverage go-zero's configuration to access secrets securely.
