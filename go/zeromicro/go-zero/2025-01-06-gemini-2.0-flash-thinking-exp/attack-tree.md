## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Go-Zero Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_go-zero_application__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Successful exploitation of any of the underlying high-risk paths and critical nodes will lead to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit RPC Communication Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rpc_communication_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_start_.md)

This path focuses on weaknesses in how the application communicates using Go-Zero's RPC framework. It is high-risk because RPC often exposes core application logic and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization in RPC Calls [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization_in_rpc_calls__critical_node_.md)

If an attacker can bypass authentication or authorization, they gain unauthorized access to RPC endpoints and can execute privileged actions or access sensitive data. This is a critical node as it unlocks significant control over the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak or Missing JWT Validation [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_or_missing_jwt_validation__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in JWT validation, such as using insecure algorithms (`alg=none`), key confusion issues, or by brute-forcing weak secrets. Successful exploitation allows them to forge valid JWTs and impersonate legitimate users or services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Custom Authentication Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_custom_authentication_logic.md)

If the application implements custom authentication logic, vulnerabilities in this logic (e.g., flawed checks, bypasses) can be exploited to gain unauthorized access. This is a high-risk area if custom logic is not thoroughly tested and reviewed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate or Intercept RPC Messages [HIGH RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_or_intercept_rpc_messages__high_risk_path_start_.md)

This path involves compromising the integrity or confidentiality of RPC messages exchanged between clients and servers or between microservices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

If the application deserializes untrusted data without proper validation, attackers can inject malicious payloads that, upon deserialization, lead to arbitrary code execution on the server. This is a critical node due to the severe impact of remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Perform Replay Attacks [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/perform_replay_attacks__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers can capture valid RPC requests and resend them to perform unauthorized actions. This is a high-risk path if the application lacks proper replay protection mechanisms (e.g., nonces, timestamps).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Message Integrity Checks [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_message_integrity_checks__high_risk_path_.md)

If RPC messages are not protected with integrity checks (e.g., message signing or MAC), attackers can intercept and modify the message content in transit without detection, potentially leading to data manipulation or unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Microservice Architecture Specifics](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_microservice_architecture_specifics.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Inter-Service Communication [HIGH RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_inter-service_communication__high_risk_path_start_.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from communication between different microservices within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Perform Man-in-the-Middle Attacks between Services [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/perform_man-in-the-middle_attacks_between_services__high_risk_path_.md)

If communication between microservices is not properly secured (e.g., lacks TLS or mTLS), attackers can intercept and potentially modify requests and responses exchanged between services, compromising data integrity and confidentiality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Mutual TLS (mTLS) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_mutual_tls__mtls___critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

Without mTLS, services cannot reliably verify the identity of other communicating services. This allows attackers to impersonate legitimate services, potentially gaining unauthorized access to resources and data. This is a critical node as it undermines trust within the microservice architecture.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_start_.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities related to how the application's configuration is managed and protected.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Configuration Data [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_configuration_data__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

If configuration files or environment variables contain sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys) and are not properly protected, attackers can gain access to this data. This is a critical node as it provides attackers with credentials and secrets that can be used for further attacks and system compromise.
