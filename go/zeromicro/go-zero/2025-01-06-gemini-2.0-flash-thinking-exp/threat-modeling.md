        *   Implement robust and well-tested rate limiting algorithms using Go-Zero's provided middleware.
        *   Track requests based on multiple factors (e.g., IP address, user ID) configurable within Go-Zero's rate limiting.
        *   Monitor rate limiting effectiveness and adjust configurations within the Go-Zero API Gateway as needed.

## Threat: [Insecure Inter-Service RPC Communication](./threats/insecure_inter-service_rpc_communication.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Inter-Service RPC Communication
    *   **Description:** An attacker could eavesdrop on or intercept communication between Go-Zero services if TLS encryption is not properly configured or enforced for RPC calls made using Go-Zero's `zrpc` framework. They could also perform man-in-the-middle attacks to modify or inject messages within the Go-Zero RPC communication.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential data transmitted between Go-Zero services could be exposed, leading to data breaches. Modified messages could compromise the integrity of services within the Go-Zero application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS encryption for all inter-service RPC communication within the Go-Zero application using `zrpc` configuration.
        *   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication between Go-Zero services.
        *   Ensure proper certificate management and rotation for Go-Zero services.

## Threat: [Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities in RPC](./threats/serializationdeserialization_vulnerabilities_in_rpc.md)

*   **Threat:** Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities in RPC
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious payloads that exploit vulnerabilities in the serialization or deserialization process used by Go-Zero's `zrpc` framework (e.g., Protocol Buffers). This could lead to remote code execution or denial of service on a receiving Go-Zero service.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the affected Go-Zero service, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code or disrupt service availability within the Go-Zero application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Go-Zero and its dependencies (including the protobuf library used by `zrpc`) up to date with the latest security patches.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization on all data received through Go-Zero RPC calls.
        *   Avoid using insecure or deprecated serialization formats within the Go-Zero `zrpc` framework.

## Threat: [Configuration Injection](./threats/configuration_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Configuration Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in how Go-Zero applications load and process configuration files (e.g., `etc` files). This might involve injecting malicious configuration values that could alter the application's behavior or expose sensitive information managed by the Go-Zero configuration system.
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to arbitrary code execution within the Go-Zero application, information disclosure of Go-Zero managed configurations, or service disruption depending on the injected configuration values.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to Go-Zero configuration files and directories.
        *   Sanitize and validate configuration values before using them within the Go-Zero application.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in Go-Zero configuration files; use secure secret management solutions.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Secrets in Configuration](./threats/insecure_storage_of_secrets_in_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Storage of Secrets in Configuration
    *   **Description:** Developers might unintentionally store sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or other secrets directly within Go-Zero configuration files (e.g., `.etc` files) or environment variables used by the Go-Zero application without proper encryption or secure storage mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to other systems or data used by the Go-Zero application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) with Go-Zero.
        *   Avoid storing secrets directly in Go-Zero configuration files or environment variables.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest if it must be stored locally for the Go-Zero application.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom API Gateway Middleware](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_api_gateway_middleware.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Custom API Gateway Middleware
    *   **Description:** Developers might create custom middleware for the Go-Zero API Gateway that contains security flaws. These flaws could be exploited by attackers to bypass security checks implemented within the Go-Zero gateway, gain unauthorized access, or cause other harm to the Go-Zero application.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom middleware, but could range from information disclosure to remote code execution within the context of the Go-Zero API Gateway.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies from Medium to Critical depending on the vulnerability. (Including as potential for High/Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom middleware for the Go-Zero API Gateway.
        *   Thoroughly review and test custom middleware for security vulnerabilities before deploying with the Go-Zero application.
        *   Consider using established and well-vetted middleware libraries where possible within the Go-Zero framework.

## Threat: [Code Generation Template Vulnerabilities (`goctl`)](./threats/code_generation_template_vulnerabilities___goctl__.md)

*   **Threat:** Code Generation Template Vulnerabilities (`goctl`)
    *   **Description:** If the code generation templates used by Go-Zero's `goctl` tool contain security vulnerabilities, the generated code might inherit these vulnerabilities. Attackers could potentially exploit these flaws in deployed Go-Zero applications.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the generated code, but could include injection vulnerabilities, insecure defaults, or other security weaknesses within the Go-Zero application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High, depending on the nature of the vulnerability. (Including as potential for High)
