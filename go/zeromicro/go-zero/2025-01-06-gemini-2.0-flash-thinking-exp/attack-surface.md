# Attack Surface Analysis for zeromicro/go-zero

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal in API Definitions](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_in_api_definitions.md)

**Description:**  Attackers could potentially manipulate API route definitions to access unintended internal endpoints or resources.
*   **How go-zero Contributes:**  The way `go-zero` parses and interprets the `.api` definition files for routing can be vulnerable if not handled carefully. Misconfigurations or lack of proper sanitization in the routing logic can lead to this.
*   **Example:** An API definition like `/admin/{file}` might allow an attacker to access files outside the intended directory by sending a request to `/admin/../sensitive.conf`.
*   **Impact:** Access to sensitive configuration files, internal APIs, or even the underlying operating system.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation in Route Definitions:**  Carefully define route parameters and use regular expressions or other validation mechanisms to restrict allowed characters and patterns.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic File Paths in Routes:**  Minimize or eliminate the use of user-controlled input directly in file paths within API definitions.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of API Definitions:**  Review `.api` files for potential path traversal vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Tampering via API Definitions](./attack_surfaces/parameter_tampering_via_api_definitions.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate request parameters to send unexpected or malicious data, potentially bypassing validation or exploiting vulnerabilities in the handler logic.
*   **How go-zero Contributes:** `go-zero` relies on the `.api` file to define request parameters and their types. Insufficient or missing validation rules in the `.api` or the handler functions can make the application susceptible.
*   **Example:** An API expecting an integer for `user_id` might not properly handle a string value, leading to unexpected behavior or errors that an attacker could exploit.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, application crashes, unauthorized actions, or injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Comprehensive Input Validation in `.api` Files:**  Utilize the validation features provided by `go-zero` in the `.api` definition to enforce data types, ranges, and patterns.
    *   **Server-Side Validation in Handler Logic:**  Always perform robust server-side validation in the handler functions, even if client-side validation is present. Do not solely rely on the `.api` definition for security.
    *   **Use Strong Typing:** Leverage Go's strong typing system to enforce data types throughout the application.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Internal Endpoints through API Gateway](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_internal_endpoints_through_api_gateway.md)

**Description:**  Internal or administrative endpoints intended for internal use are inadvertently exposed through the API gateway without proper authentication or authorization.
*   **How go-zero Contributes:**  Misconfiguration in the `.api` file or the gateway routing rules can lead to internal endpoints being accessible from the public internet.
*   **Example:** An endpoint like `/admin/users/delete` intended for internal administrators is accidentally exposed and can be accessed by anyone.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive functionality, data breaches, or the ability to disrupt the application's operation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly Define Public vs. Private Endpoints:** Clearly delineate between public and private endpoints in the `.api` definitions.
    *   **Implement Robust Authentication and Authorization:**  Use `go-zero`'s middleware capabilities to implement strong authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth) and authorization mechanisms for all endpoints, especially those handling sensitive operations.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate internal services and restrict access to the API gateway from the public internet.
    *   **Regularly Review API Gateway Configuration:**  Audit the `.api` files and gateway configuration to ensure that only intended endpoints are publicly accessible.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware/Interceptors](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_middlewareinterceptors.md)

**Description:** Security flaws introduced in custom middleware components (for HTTP) or interceptors (for gRPC) can create new attack vectors.
*   **How go-zero Contributes:** `go-zero` provides mechanisms for developers to create custom middleware and interceptors to handle cross-cutting concerns. Vulnerabilities in these custom components directly impact the application's security.
*   **Example:** A custom authentication middleware might have a bypass vulnerability allowing unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization flaws, information leaks, or other security breaches depending on the middleware's functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices for Middleware/Interceptors:**  Follow secure coding principles when developing custom middleware and interceptors.
    *   **Thorough Testing of Custom Components:**  Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for custom middleware and interceptors, specifically focusing on security aspects.
    *   **Security Reviews of Custom Code:**  Conduct code reviews of custom middleware and interceptors to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Leverage Existing, Well-Tested Middleware:**  Prefer using well-established and vetted middleware libraries where possible instead of writing custom code from scratch.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure gRPC Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_grpc_communication.md)

**Description:** Internal communication between `go-zero` services using gRPC might be vulnerable if not properly secured.
*   **How go-zero Contributes:** `go-zero` encourages the use of gRPC for internal service communication. If not configured correctly, this communication can be susceptible to eavesdropping or tampering.
*   **Example:** Lack of TLS encryption for gRPC communication allows an attacker on the network to intercept and read the messages.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, man-in-the-middle attacks, or the ability to manipulate internal service interactions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable TLS Encryption for gRPC:**  Configure `go-zero` gRPC services to use TLS for secure communication.
    *   **Implement Mutual TLS (mTLS):**  For enhanced security, use mTLS to verify the identity of both the client and the server in gRPC communication.
    *   **Secure Service Discovery:**  Ensure that the service discovery mechanism used by `go-zero` is secure and prevents unauthorized registration of malicious services.
