## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Throttling](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_throttling.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rate Limiting and Throttling using Go-Zero Middleware
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify critical API endpoints:** Determine endpoints vulnerable to abuse or resource exhaustion.
        2.  **Define rate limits:** Set request limits per time window for each critical endpoint.
        3.  **Implement rate limiting middleware:** Utilize go-zero's built-in `ratelimit` middleware. This middleware can be configured in your `api` service configuration file or programmatically in your code.
        4.  **Configure middleware:** In your `api` service's configuration (`*.yaml`), define the `Ratelimit` section. Specify `Seconds` (time window), `Quota` (max requests), and optionally `Key` (rate limit key, default is client IP). Apply this middleware to specific routes or globally. Example in `*.yaml`:

            ```yaml
            RestConf:
              # ... other configurations ...
              Ratelimit:
                Seconds: 1
                Quota: 100
            ```
        5.  **Test and monitor:** Test rate limiting and monitor its effectiveness. Adjust limits as needed.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity): Prevents overwhelming the application with excessive requests.
        *   Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity): Limits login attempts, making brute-force attacks less effective.
        *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity): Protects backend services from overload.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   DoS Attacks: High reduction in risk. Go-zero's rate limiting effectively mitigates volumetric DoS attacks.
        *   Brute-Force Attacks: Medium reduction in risk. Slows down brute-force attempts.
        *   Resource Exhaustion: Medium reduction in risk. Helps prevent resource depletion.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in the `api` gateway service using go-zero's `ratelimit` middleware in the configuration file. Configured for `/login` and `/resource` endpoints with initial limits defined in `*.yaml`.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Rate limiting is not configured for all API endpoints. Dynamic rate limit adjustments based on real-time traffic are missing.  More granular rate limiting based on user roles or API keys using custom `Key` function in middleware is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization at the Gateway](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_at_the_gateway.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation using Go-Zero Request Validation
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Define request structs:** In your `api` service handlers, define request structs using Go structs. Use struct tags like `validate:"required,email"` to specify validation rules.
        2.  **Utilize `rest.Handler` for validation:** Go-zero's `rest.Handler` automatically performs validation based on these struct tags when binding request parameters.
        3.  **Define validation rules:** Use tags from libraries like `github.com/go-playground/validator/v10` (implicitly used by go-zero) to define validation rules for each field (e.g., `required`, `email`, `min`, `max`, `len`, `regexp`).
        4.  **Handle validation errors:** Go-zero automatically returns 400 Bad Request for validation failures. Customize error responses if needed by implementing custom error handling logic within your handlers.
        5.  **Sanitize input data (manual):** While go-zero handles validation, sanitization needs to be implemented manually in your handler logic after successful validation, using Go's standard libraries or external sanitization libraries.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Injection Attacks (High Severity): Prevents SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection, and XSS by validating user inputs.
        *   Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity): Ensures data processed is in the expected format.
        *   Application Errors (Medium Severity): Prevents crashes due to malformed input.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Injection Attacks: High reduction in risk. Go-zero's validation is a crucial defense against injection.
        *   Data Integrity Issues: Medium reduction in risk. Improves data quality.
        *   Application Errors: Medium reduction in risk. Increases application stability.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic input validation is implemented in some API Gateway handlers using go-zero's request validation with struct tags for data type and `required` fields.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive validation rules using more advanced tags are not defined for all API endpoints. Input sanitization is not consistently applied after validation. Custom error responses for validation failures are not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authentication and Authorization at the Gateway](./mitigation_strategies/authentication_and_authorization_at_the_gateway.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Authentication and Authorization using Go-Zero Middleware
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Choose authentication mechanism:** Select JWT or OAuth 2.0. JWT is common for API authentication.
        2.  **Implement authentication middleware:** Create a custom go-zero middleware to handle authentication. This middleware will:
            *   Extract authentication tokens (e.g., JWT from headers).
            *   Verify token signature and validity.
            *   Set user context (e.g., user ID, roles) in the request context using `context.WithValue`.
        3.  **Implement authorization middleware:** Create another custom go-zero middleware for authorization. This middleware will:
            *   Retrieve user context from the request context.
            *   Check user permissions against defined access control policies based on the requested endpoint or resource.
            *   Allow or deny access.
        4.  **Apply middleware in API routes:** In your `api` service's route configuration (`*.api` file), apply these middleware to specific routes or route groups using the `middleware` keyword. Example in `*.api`:

            ```
            service api {
                @server(
                    middleware: AuthMiddleware, AuthorizationMiddleware
                )
                group user {
                    post /user/profile(UserProfileRequest) returns (UserProfileResponse)
                }
            }
            ```
        5.  **Centralize user identity management:** Integrate with a central user identity provider for user management.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity): Prevents unauthorized users from accessing resources.
        *   Privilege Escalation (High Severity): Limits attackers from gaining higher privileges.
        *   Data Breaches (High Severity): Reduces data breach risk by controlling access.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Access: High reduction in risk. Go-zero middleware provides strong access control.
        *   Privilege Escalation: High reduction in risk. Prevents unauthorized privilege gain.
        *   Data Breaches: High reduction in risk. Significantly reduces breach likelihood.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** JWT-based authentication is implemented in the API Gateway using a custom go-zero middleware. Basic role-based authorization is partially implemented using another custom middleware. Middleware is applied to some routes in `*.api` file.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Fine-grained authorization policies are not fully defined and enforced for all API endpoints. Integration with a dedicated authorization service for complex logic is missing. OAuth 2.0 support is not implemented. Middleware application is not consistent across all protected routes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Service-to-Service Authentication and Authorization (mTLS)](./mitigation_strategies/service-to-service_authentication_and_authorization__mtls_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure gRPC Communication with TLS in Go-Zero
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Generate TLS certificates:** Generate TLS certificates for each microservice.
        2.  **Configure gRPC server for TLS:** In your go-zero gRPC service configuration (`*.yaml`), configure the `ListenOn` address to use `grpcs://` scheme instead of `grpc://`. Provide paths to your server certificate (`CertFile`) and private key (`KeyFile`) in the `Conf` section. Example in `*.yaml`:

            ```yaml
            RpcServerConf:
              ListenOn: grpcs://0.0.0.0:9001
              CertFile: etc/server.crt
              KeyFile: etc/server.key
            ```
        3.  **Configure gRPC client for TLS:** When creating gRPC clients in other go-zero services using `zrpc.MustNewClient`, configure the `DialOption` to include `grpc.WithTransportCredentials(credentials.NewTLS(tlsConfig))` where `tlsConfig` is configured to trust the server's certificate.
        4.  **Enforce TLS in service communication:** Ensure all service-to-service communication uses `grpcs://` and properly configured TLS clients.
        5.  **Implement service account-based authorization (manual):**  Authorization logic based on service identity needs to be implemented manually within your gRPC service handlers, checking client certificates or other service identity mechanisms.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity): Prevents eavesdropping and tampering of inter-service communication.
        *   Unauthorized Service Access (High Severity): Ensures only authorized services can communicate.
        *   Data Breaches (High Severity): Reduces data breach risk by protecting inter-service data.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   MITM Attacks: High reduction in risk. TLS provides strong encryption for gRPC.
        *   Unauthorized Service Access: High reduction in risk. TLS and service account authorization enhance security.
        *   Data Breaches: High reduction in risk. Protects sensitive data in transit.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** TLS is configured for gRPC communication between some microservices using `grpcs://` and certificate configuration in `*.yaml`.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** TLS is not enabled for all service-to-service communication. mTLS (mutual TLS) for client certificate verification is not fully implemented. Service account-based authorization logic within gRPC handlers is missing. Certificate management and rotation are not automated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration Validation and Auditing](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_validation_and_auditing.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configuration Validation using Go-Zero Configuration Loading
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Define configuration structs:** Define Go structs to represent your configuration in `*.yaml` files. Use struct tags to define data types and potentially validation rules (though go-zero's built-in validation is primarily for request parameters, not config).
        2.  **Use `conf.MustLoad` for loading:** Utilize `conf.MustLoad(configFile, &configStruct)` from `go-zero/core/conf` to load configuration from `*.yaml` files into your defined structs. `MustLoad` will panic if configuration loading fails, ensuring early detection of configuration errors.
        3.  **Implement custom validation logic (manual):** After loading configuration using `conf.MustLoad`, implement custom validation logic in your code to further validate configuration values and ensure they meet specific requirements or constraints.
        4.  **Configuration Auditing (external):** Go-zero itself doesn't provide built-in configuration auditing. Implement auditing externally by using version control for `*.yaml` files and tracking changes through Git history or dedicated configuration management tools.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Misconfigurations (Medium Severity): Invalid configuration settings can lead to vulnerabilities or errors.
        *   Unauthorized Configuration Changes (Medium Severity): Undetected changes can introduce security issues.
        *   Compliance Violations (Low Severity): Lack of validation and auditing can lead to compliance issues.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Misconfigurations: Medium reduction in risk. `conf.MustLoad` and custom validation help prevent misconfigurations.
        *   Unauthorized Configuration Changes: Medium reduction in risk. Version control provides some auditing capabilities.
        *   Compliance Violations: Low reduction in risk. Improves compliance posture.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Configuration loading using `conf.MustLoad` is implemented in all go-zero services. Configuration structs are defined in Go code.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Formal configuration schemas are not explicitly defined beyond Go structs. Comprehensive custom validation logic is not implemented after loading. Automated auditing of configuration changes beyond Git history is missing.
