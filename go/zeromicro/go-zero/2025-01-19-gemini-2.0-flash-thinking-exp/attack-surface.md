# Attack Surface Analysis for zeromicro/go-zero

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Custom Middleware](./attack_surfaces/insecure_custom_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities introduced by developers implementing custom middleware for authentication, authorization, logging, or other functionalities within the go-zero framework.
    *   **How go-zero Contributes:** go-zero's middleware architecture provides the framework for integrating custom logic into the request handling pipeline. Insecurely implemented custom middleware directly exposes vulnerabilities within this go-zero structure.
    *   **Example:** A custom authentication middleware within a go-zero service might have a logic flaw allowing bypass with a specific header value, granting unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, information disclosure, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test all custom middleware code developed for go-zero applications.
        *   Adhere to secure coding practices when developing go-zero middleware.
        *   Consider using well-established and vetted middleware libraries instead of custom implementations where feasible within the go-zero ecosystem.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within custom go-zero middleware.
        *   Conduct security code reviews and penetration testing specifically targeting custom middleware within the go-zero application.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured CORS Policies](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_cors_policies.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies in the go-zero API gateway allow unauthorized cross-origin requests.
    *   **How go-zero Contributes:** go-zero's API gateway component is responsible for handling CORS configurations. Misconfiguration within the go-zero gateway directly leads to this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** Setting `AllowOrigin: "*"` in the go-zero gateway configuration for a production environment allows any website to make requests, potentially leading to malicious scripts accessing user data.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), data theft, session hijacking.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure CORS policies within the go-zero API gateway, specifying only trusted origins.
        *   Avoid using wildcard origins (`*`) in production go-zero gateway configurations.
        *   Thoroughly understand the implications of different CORS headers (e.g., `AllowCredentials`) when configuring the go-zero gateway.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Internal RPC Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_internal_rpc_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Lack of encryption and authentication for communication between internal services using go-zero's RPC framework.
    *   **How go-zero Contributes:** go-zero's built-in RPC framework, based on gRPC, facilitates communication between services. If TLS/SSL and proper authentication are not configured within the go-zero RPC setup, the communication is vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the internal network could eavesdrop on RPC calls between go-zero services, potentially intercepting sensitive data or manipulating requests.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to internal services, manipulation of internal state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all internal RPC communication between go-zero services.
        *   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for strong authentication between go-zero services.
        *   Avoid relying solely on network segmentation for securing communication between go-zero services.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or secrets stored insecurely in configuration files or environment variables used by the go-zero application.
    *   **How go-zero Contributes:** go-zero applications rely on configuration files (typically YAML) and environment variables for settings. If these mechanisms are used to store sensitive data without proper protection, it becomes an attack surface.
    *   **Example:** Database credentials hardcoded in a YAML configuration file used by a go-zero service, which is then committed to a public repository.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application and associated resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files used by go-zero.
        *   Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and integrate them with the go-zero application.
        *   Use environment variables for sensitive configuration in go-zero, ensuring proper access controls and secure management.
        *   Never commit sensitive data to version control systems used for go-zero application code.
