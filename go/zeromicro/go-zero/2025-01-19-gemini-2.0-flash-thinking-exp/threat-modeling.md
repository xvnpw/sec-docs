# Threat Model Analysis for zeromicro/go-zero

## Threat: [Misconfigured API Gateway Route Authorization](./threats/misconfigured_api_gateway_route_authorization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit misconfigured route authorization rules in the API gateway to gain unauthorized access to internal services or endpoints. They might craft requests targeting specific routes that lack proper authentication or authorization checks, allowing them to bypass intended access controls.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or execution of privileged actions on backend services. This could lead to data breaches, financial loss, or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Go-Zero Component:** `rest` module (API Gateway handler and middleware)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization middleware in the API gateway.
        *   Define explicit authorization rules for each API endpoint.
        *   Regularly review and audit API gateway route configurations.
        *   Utilize Go-Zero's built-in authentication and authorization features.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege when defining access rules.

## Threat: [Inadequate API Gateway Rate Limiting](./threats/inadequate_api_gateway_rate_limiting.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could launch a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by sending a large volume of requests to the API gateway, overwhelming backend services. Without proper rate limiting, the gateway will forward these requests, potentially causing service degradation or outages.
    *   **Impact:** Service unavailability, impacting legitimate users. Resource exhaustion on backend services, potentially leading to cascading failures.
    *   **Affected Go-Zero Component:** `rest` module (API Gateway middleware)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting middleware in the API gateway.
        *   Configure appropriate rate limits based on expected traffic and service capacity.
        *   Consider different rate limiting strategies (e.g., per IP, per user).
        *   Utilize Go-Zero's built-in rate limiting features.
        *   Monitor API traffic and adjust rate limits as needed.

## Threat: [Insecure go-rpc Serialization/Deserialization](./threats/insecure_go-rpc_serializationdeserialization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious payloads that, when serialized and sent via go-rpc, could exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying serialization/deserialization libraries. This could lead to remote code execution or other unexpected behavior on the receiving service.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, or data corruption on the affected microservice.
    *   **Affected Go-Zero Component:** `rpc` module (go-rpc client and server)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest versions of Go-Zero and its dependencies, including the underlying gRPC library.
        *   Be aware of known vulnerabilities in serialization libraries used by gRPC.
        *   Consider using secure serialization formats and practices.
        *   Implement input validation even within RPC handlers.

## Threat: [Lack of Mutual TLS (mTLS) for Service Communication](./threats/lack_of_mutual_tls__mtls__for_service_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could potentially eavesdrop on or tamper with communication between microservices if mTLS is not implemented. Without mutual authentication, it's harder to verify the identity of communicating services, potentially allowing for man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches through eavesdropping, unauthorized access to services through impersonation, and potential data manipulation.
    *   **Affected Go-Zero Component:** `rpc` module (go-rpc client and server transport)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for all inter-service communication.
        *   Ensure proper certificate management and rotation.
        *   Enforce mTLS at the network level if possible.

## Threat: [Insufficient Input Validation in go-rpc Handlers](./threats/insufficient_input_validation_in_go-rpc_handlers.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could send malformed or malicious data in RPC requests. If the receiving service doesn't properly validate this input, it could lead to vulnerabilities like injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection if the service interacts with a database) or unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, denial of service, or even remote code execution depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Go-Zero Component:** `rpc` module (RPC handler functions)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement thorough input validation and sanitization within each RPC handler.
        *   Define clear data schemas and enforce them.
        *   Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Be cautious when deserializing data from RPC requests.

## Threat: [Service Registry Poisoning](./threats/service_registry_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could compromise the service registry (e.g., etcd, Consul) and register malicious service instances. This could redirect traffic intended for legitimate services to attacker-controlled servers, allowing them to intercept data or cause service disruptions.
    *   **Impact:**  Redirection of traffic to malicious servers, data interception, denial of service, and potential compromise of user data.
    *   **Affected Go-Zero Component:** `zrpc` module (service discovery integration)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure access to the service registry using authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   Implement network segmentation to restrict access to the service registry.
        *   Monitor the service registry for unauthorized changes.
        *   Use secure communication protocols for interactions with the service registry.

## Threat: [Storing Sensitive Information in Plain Text Configuration](./threats/storing_sensitive_information_in_plain_text_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently store sensitive information like database credentials or API keys in plain text configuration files. If these files are compromised, attackers can gain access to this sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to databases, external services, or other critical resources.
    *   **Affected Go-Zero Component:** Configuration loading mechanisms (`config` package)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files.
        *   Utilize environment variables for sensitive configuration.
        *   Use secure configuration management solutions like HashiCorp Vault or similar secret management tools.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest if it must be stored in configuration.

## Threat: [Insecure Access Control to Configuration](./threats/insecure_access_control_to_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** If access to configuration files or configuration management systems is not properly controlled, attackers could modify configurations to gain unauthorized access, disrupt the application, or inject malicious settings.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application, service disruption, or introduction of malicious configurations.
    *   **Affected Go-Zero Component:** Configuration loading mechanisms (`config` package) and deployment infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access control policies for configuration files and systems.
        *   Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to authorized personnel.
        *   Audit configuration changes.
        *   Store configuration securely and restrict access to the storage location.
