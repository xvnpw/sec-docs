## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization in Gateway](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization_in_gateway.md)

* **Exploit Weaknesses in Custom Auth Middleware (High-Risk Path):**
    * Attackers target vulnerabilities in the logic of custom authentication middleware, such as improper token validation, flawed session management, or logic errors that allow bypassing authentication checks.
* **Exploit Default or Misconfigured Auth Settings (High-Risk Path):**
    * Attackers exploit default credentials, weak secrets, permissive CORS policies, or other misconfigurations in the gateway's authentication setup to gain unauthorized access.
* **Inject Malicious Headers to Impersonate Users (High-Risk Path):**
    * Attackers attempt to inject or manipulate HTTP headers (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For`, custom authentication headers) to bypass authentication or impersonate legitimate users, gaining access to protected resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in Custom Auth Middleware](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_custom_auth_middleware.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_middleware.md)

* **Inject Malicious Data that Bypasses Middleware Validation (High-Risk Path):**
    * Attackers craft requests containing malicious data that bypasses the validation logic implemented in custom middleware, potentially leading to further exploitation in backend services or information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data that Bypasses Middleware Validation](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_that_bypasses_middleware_validation.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Service Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_service_logic.md)

* **Trigger Business Logic Errors via Crafted RPC Requests (High-Risk Path):**
    * Attackers send carefully crafted RPC requests designed to trigger unexpected behavior or errors in the service's business logic, potentially leading to data manipulation, unauthorized actions, or denial of service.
* **Exploit Input Validation Issues in RPC Handlers (High-Risk Path):**
    * Attackers exploit the lack of proper input validation in RPC handlers to inject malicious code or data, leading to vulnerabilities like SQL injection (if the service interacts with a database) or remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Business Logic Errors via Crafted RPC Requests](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_business_logic_errors_via_crafted_rpc_requests.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Configuration Data](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

* **Exploit Insecure Storage of Configuration Files (High-Risk Path):**
    * Attackers exploit insecure storage of configuration files containing sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys) in plain text or with overly permissive access controls to gain access to critical secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Storage of Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_storage_of_configuration_files.md)

Attackers exploit insecure storage of configuration files containing sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys) in plain text or with overly permissive access controls to gain access to critical secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Configuration Values](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_configuration_values.md)

* **Leverage Default or Weak Configuration Settings (High-Risk Path):**
    * Attackers exploit default or weak configuration settings (e.g., default passwords, insecure ports, permissive access controls) that were not properly changed or hardened during deployment, providing an easy entry point for compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Default or Weak Configuration Settings](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_default_or_weak_configuration_settings.md)

Attackers exploit default or weak configuration settings (e.g., default passwords, insecure ports, permissive access controls) that were not properly changed or hardened during deployment, providing an easy entry point for compromise.
