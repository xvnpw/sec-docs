# Threat Model Analysis for k3s-io/k3s

## Threat: [K3s Server Node Compromise](./threats/k3s_server_node_compromise.md)

*   **Threat:** K3s Server Node Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains root access to the operating system of a K3s server node. This could be achieved through exploiting OS vulnerabilities, using stolen credentials, or social engineering. Once in, the attacker can manipulate the kube-apiserver, etcd, and other critical **K3s** components.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the Kubernetes cluster. The attacker can deploy malicious workloads, steal secrets, disrupt services, and potentially pivot to other infrastructure.
    *   **Affected K3s Component:** Operating System of the K3s server node, kube-apiserver, etcd, controller-manager, scheduler.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly patch and update the operating system of K3s server nodes.
        *   Harden the OS by disabling unnecessary services and applying security benchmarks.
        *   Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for server access.
        *   Restrict SSH access to authorized personnel and use key-based authentication.
        *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS).
        *   Monitor server logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [API Server Unauthorized Access](./threats/api_server_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Threat:** API Server Unauthorized Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the kube-apiserver without proper authentication or authorization. This could be due to misconfigured RBAC, exposed API ports, or exploiting authentication bypass vulnerabilities within **K3s's** implementation of the API server. The attacker can then interact with the cluster as an unauthorized user.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the attacker's privileges, they could view sensitive information, modify cluster resources, deploy malicious pods, or cause a denial of service.
    *   **Affected K3s Component:** kube-apiserver, RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., client certificates, OIDC).
        *   Implement and regularly review RBAC configurations, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
        *   Restrict network access to the kube-apiserver to authorized networks.
        *   Enable and monitor API audit logs for suspicious activity.
        *   Keep **K3s** updated to patch known API server vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [etcd Data Breach](./threats/etcd_data_breach.md)

*   **Threat:** etcd Data Breach
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the etcd datastore, which holds the cluster's state and secrets. This could happen through exploiting vulnerabilities in etcd itself, compromising the server node where etcd runs (as part of **K3s**), or through misconfigured access controls within **K3s**.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information including secrets, configurations, and cluster state. This can lead to credential theft, data breaches, and the ability to manipulate the cluster.
    *   **Affected K3s Component:** etcd.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable encryption at rest for etcd data.
        *   Secure etcd client communication with TLS certificates and mutual authentication.
        *   Restrict network access to etcd to only authorized components (kube-apiserver).
        *   Regularly backup etcd data to a secure location.
        *   Monitor etcd logs for unauthorized access attempts.

## Threat: [Kubelet Compromise on Agent Node](./threats/kubelet_compromise_on_agent_node.md)

*   **Threat:** Kubelet Compromise on Agent Node
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the kubelet process running on a **K3s** agent node. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the kubelet, compromising the agent node's OS, or through misconfigurations within **K3s**.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code within containers running on that node, potentially escalating privileges, accessing sensitive data within the node, or disrupting workloads.
    *   **Affected K3s Component:** kubelet on agent nodes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update **K3s** and the kubelet to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Harden the operating system of agent nodes.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for kubelet access (though generally managed by the control plane).
        *   Enforce Pod Security Admission (or Pod Security Policies in older versions) to restrict container capabilities.
        *   Monitor kubelet logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Container Escape](./threats/container_escape.md)

*   **Threat:** Container Escape
    *   **Description:** An attacker manages to escape the confines of a container running on a **K3s** agent node. This could be achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities in the container runtime (**containerd**, which is used by **K3s**), kernel vulnerabilities, or misconfigurations in container security settings within **K3s**.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker gains access to the underlying node's file system and resources, potentially leading to node compromise, access to sensitive data, or the ability to impact other containers on the same node.
    *   **Affected K3s Component:** containerd (container runtime), underlying operating system kernel.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the container runtime (**containerd**) and the underlying kernel updated.
        *   Minimize container privileges by avoiding running containers as root.
        *   Utilize security context constraints (or Pod Security Admission) to restrict container capabilities (e.g., using `seccomp` profiles, `AppArmor` or `SELinux`).
        *   Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious Container Images](./threats/malicious_container_images.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Container Images
    *   **Description:** Deploying container images that contain malware, vulnerabilities, or backdoors. While not directly a **K3s** vulnerability, **K3s** is the platform executing these images, making it a critical concern. This could be due to using untrusted image registries or failing to scan images for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the application and potentially the underlying **K3s** nodes, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected K3s Component:** Container runtime (containerd), image pull process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only pull container images from trusted registries.
        *   Implement a process for scanning container images for vulnerabilities before deployment.
        *   Use image signing and verification to ensure image integrity.
        *   Regularly update base images and rebuild application images to patch vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Compromised Supply Chain for K3s Components](./threats/compromised_supply_chain_for_k3s_components.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Supply Chain for K3s Components
    *   **Description:**  Malicious actors compromise the supply chain of **K3s** itself or its dependencies, injecting vulnerabilities or backdoors into the **K3s** binaries or related software.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of **K3s** deployments, potentially allowing attackers to gain control of clusters.
    *   **Affected K3s Component:** **K3s** binaries, dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Download **K3s** binaries from official and trusted sources.
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded binaries using checksums or signatures.
        *   Stay informed about security advisories related to **K3s** and its dependencies.
        *   Consider using tools that provide supply chain security analysis.
