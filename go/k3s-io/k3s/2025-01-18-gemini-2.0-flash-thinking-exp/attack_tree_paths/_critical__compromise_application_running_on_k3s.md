## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Application Running on K3s

This document provides a deep analysis of the attack tree path "**[CRITICAL] Compromise Application Running on K3s**". We will define the objective, scope, and methodology of this analysis before delving into the specific attack vectors and potential mitigations.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities that could lead to the compromise of an application running on a K3s cluster. This includes identifying the steps an attacker might take, the weaknesses they could exploit, and the potential impact of such a compromise. Ultimately, this analysis aims to inform development and security teams on how to strengthen the security posture of applications deployed on K3s.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack path leading to the compromise of an application running within a K3s cluster. The scope includes:

* **K3s Cluster Components:**  Analysis will consider vulnerabilities within the K3s control plane (API server, scheduler, controller manager, etcd), worker nodes (kubelet, container runtime), and networking components (CNI).
* **Application Deployment:**  We will consider vulnerabilities related to how the application is deployed, configured, and managed within the K3s environment (e.g., Pod specifications, Deployments, Services, Secrets, ConfigMaps).
* **Container Images:**  The security of the container images used by the application will be considered as a potential attack vector.
* **Network Security:**  Network policies, ingress controllers, and service meshes will be examined for potential weaknesses.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  The configuration and effectiveness of RBAC within the K3s cluster will be analyzed.

The scope explicitly excludes:

* **Physical Security:**  We will not consider physical access to the servers running the K3s cluster.
* **Supply Chain Attacks (beyond container images):**  While container image security is in scope, broader supply chain vulnerabilities related to the underlying operating system or hardware are excluded.
* **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:**  This analysis focuses on compromise, not service disruption.
* **Attacks originating outside the network where the K3s cluster resides (unless directly targeting exposed services).**

### 3. Methodology

This deep analysis will employ the following methodology:

* **Decomposition of the Attack Path:** The high-level objective "**Compromise Application Running on K3s**" will be broken down into a series of more granular sub-objectives and potential attack vectors.
* **Threat Modeling:** We will consider the perspective of a malicious actor with varying levels of skill and access.
