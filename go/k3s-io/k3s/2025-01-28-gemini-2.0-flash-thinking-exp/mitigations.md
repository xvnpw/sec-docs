# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for k3s-io/k3s

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Harden Default K3s Configurations](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_harden_default_k3s_configurations.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Review and Harden Default K3s Configurations
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access K3s Configuration Files/Flags:** Identify how K3s is configured (command-line flags during installation, configuration file if used).
    2.  **Analyze Default Settings:** Review default K3s settings, particularly those related to:
        *   **Networking:** Default network plugin (Flannel, Canal, etc.) and its configuration.
        *   **Authorization:** Default authorization mode (RBAC, ABAC).
        *   **API Server:**  TLS settings, audit logging defaults, enabled features.
    3.  **Disable Unnecessary K3s Features:** Disable K3s features not required for the application. Examples:
        *   Disable the default embedded etcd if using external datastore (for HA setups, though less relevant for basic K3s).
        *   Disable local storage provisioner if not needed.
        *   Disable default ingress controller if a custom one is deployed.
    4.  **Strengthen K3s Specific Parameters:** Modify K3s parameters to enhance security:
        *   Configure strong TLS cipher suites for the K3s API server using `--tls-cipher-suites`.
        *   Adjust API server audit log settings using `--audit-log-path`, `--audit-policy-file`, etc.
        *   If needed, configure specific authorization modes beyond default RBAC.
    5.  **Apply Configuration Changes:** Restart the K3s server and agents to apply changes. For flags, this might involve re-running the K3s installation command with updated flags.
    6.  **Document Hardened Configuration:** Document all configuration changes made from defaults for future reference and audits.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Default K3s Settings (High Severity):** Attackers may exploit known vulnerabilities or weaknesses in default configurations common across K3s deployments.
    *   **Unnecessary Attack Surface from Enabled K3s Features (Medium Severity):** Enabled but unused K3s features can introduce unnecessary attack vectors.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Verbose K3s Logging (Low to Medium Severity):** Default logging levels might expose more information than necessary, potentially including sensitive data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Default K3s Settings:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Unnecessary Attack Surface from Enabled K3s Features:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Information Disclosure via Verbose K3s Logging:** Low to Medium Risk Reduction

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization for K3s API Server](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strong_authentication_and_authorization_for_k3s_api_server.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization for K3s API Server
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify TLS for API Server:** Ensure K3s API server is running with TLS enabled (default in K3s, but confirm).
    2.  **Configure Authentication Methods for K3s API:** Choose and configure robust authentication methods supported by K3s:
        *   **Client Certificates:** Utilize client certificates for `kubectl` and service account authentication. K3s supports certificate-based authentication.
        *   **OIDC (OpenID Connect):** Integrate K3s with an OIDC provider using K3s flags like `--oidc-issuer-url`, `--oidc-client-id`, etc. for centralized user authentication.
        *   **Webhook Token Authentication:**  Configure a webhook using `--authentication-token-webhook-config-file` for external token validation.
    3.  **Implement Kubernetes RBAC:** Leverage Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) which is enabled by default in K3s.
        *   Define Roles and ClusterRoles to control access to K3s resources (pods, deployments, services, etc.).
        *   Create RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings to assign roles to users, groups, and service accounts interacting with the K3s API.
        *   Apply least privilege principle in RBAC policies.
    4.  **Disable Anonymous Authentication (If Possible):** If no anonymous access is needed, disable it using `--anonymous-auth=false` flag for the K3s API server.
    5.  **Regularly Audit RBAC Policies:** Periodically review and update RBAC policies to adapt to changing user roles and application needs within the K3s cluster.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to K3s API (High Severity):** Weak or missing authentication allows unauthorized users or processes to interact with the K3s API, potentially gaining control of the cluster.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via K3s API (High Severity):** Insufficient authorization can allow users or compromised service accounts to escalate privileges and perform actions beyond their intended scope within K3s.
    *   **Data Breaches via K3s API Access (High Severity):** Unauthorized API access can lead to data breaches by allowing attackers to access or manipulate sensitive data managed by K3s.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to K3s API:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Privilege Escalation via K3s API:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breaches via K3s API Access:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. TLS is likely enabled. Default RBAC is active, but likely not customized.
    *   **Where:** K3s API server configuration, Kubernetes RBAC system.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Integration with OIDC or Webhook authentication for centralized user management.
    *   Custom RBAC roles and bindings tailored to specific application and team needs within K3s.
    *   Automated RBAC policy management and audits.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure K3s Agent Nodes](./mitigation_strategies/secure_k3s_agent_nodes.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure K3s Agent Nodes
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Harden Agent Node OS:** Apply OS-level hardening to each K3s agent node:
        *   Regularly apply OS security patches and updates.
        *   Minimize installed software packages to reduce attack surface on the agent OS.
        *   Configure firewalls (e.g., `iptables`, `firewalld`) on agent nodes to restrict unnecessary network access.
        *   Harden SSH access: disable password authentication, use SSH keys, restrict SSH access to specific networks/users.
    2.  **Restrict Access to Agent Node Services:** Limit access to services running on the agent node itself (beyond containers managed by K3s).
        *   Disable or restrict access to kubelet port (default 10250) if direct kubelet access is not required and manage nodes solely through the K3s API.
        *   Secure or disable the K3s agent API (if exposed, though less common in typical K3s setups).
    3.  **Implement Host Intrusion Detection on Agents:** Deploy and configure a Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) on each agent node to monitor for suspicious activity at the host level.
    4.  **Regular Agent Node Security Audits:** Periodically audit the security configuration of agent nodes to ensure ongoing compliance and identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **K3s Agent Node Compromise (High Severity):** Compromised agent nodes can be used to attack the K3s cluster, hosted applications, or the underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Lateral Movement from Agent Node (Medium to High Severity):** Weakly secured agent nodes can become entry points for lateral movement within the network after initial compromise.
    *   **Data Exfiltration via Agent Node (Medium to High Severity):** Attackers can use compromised agent nodes to exfiltrate sensitive data from the node itself or from containers running on it.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **K3s Agent Node Compromise:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Lateral Movement from Agent Node:** Medium to High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Exfiltration via Agent Node:** Medium to High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Basic OS security measures are likely in place, but specific K3s agent hardening might be missing.
    *   **Where:** Agent node operating systems, K3s agent service configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalized OS hardening process specifically for K3s agent nodes.
    *   Detailed configuration and restriction of agent node services (kubelet, agent API).
    *   Deployment and configuration of HIDS on agent nodes.
    *   Regular security audits focused on K3s agent node security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Network Policies (K3s Network Plugin Context)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_network_policies__k3s_network_plugin_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Network Policies (K3s Network Plugin Context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify Network Policy Engine:** Ensure a Network Policy engine is enabled and functioning within the K3s cluster. K3s default Flannel backend *may not* support Network Policies without additional configuration or switching to a different CNI (like Calico or Cilium, which K3s supports).
    2.  **Choose Network Policy Provider (if needed):** If the default K3s network setup doesn't support Network Policies, choose and install a compatible CNI plugin like Calico or Cilium. K3s simplifies CNI plugin replacement.
    3.  **Define Network Policies:** Create Kubernetes NetworkPolicy resources to control network traffic *within the K3s cluster*:
        *   Isolate namespaces using Network Policies to prevent cross-namespace communication unless explicitly allowed.
        *   Control pod-to-pod communication within namespaces based on application needs.
        *   Define ingress and egress rules for pods to restrict network connections based on source/destination IPs, ports, and protocols.
    4.  **Test and Enforce Policies:** Thoroughly test Network Policies in a staging K3s environment before deploying to production to avoid disrupting application connectivity. Ensure policies are actively enforced by the chosen network plugin.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update Policies:** Periodically review and update Network Policies as application network requirements evolve and new services are deployed within the K3s cluster.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Lateral Movement within K3s Cluster (High Severity):** Without Network Policies, compromised pods can freely communicate with other pods in the K3s cluster, facilitating lateral movement.
    *   **Namespace Breaches within K3s (Medium to High Severity):** Lack of namespace isolation via Network Policies can allow attackers to move between namespaces after compromising a single pod in K3s.
    *   **Uncontrolled Network Egress from K3s Pods (Medium Severity):** Unrestricted egress traffic from pods can allow data exfiltration or communication with malicious external services.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Lateral Movement within K3s Cluster:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Namespace Breaches within K3s:** Medium to High Risk Reduction
    *   **Uncontrolled Network Egress from K3s Pods:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely Not Implemented or Partially Implemented. Default K3s Flannel setup might not have Network Policy enforcement enabled or configured.
    *   **Where:** K3s networking configuration, Kubernetes Network Policy system.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Verification of Network Policy engine status in the current K3s setup.
    *   If needed, selection and deployment of a Network Policy-capable CNI plugin for K3s.
    *   Definition and deployment of NetworkPolicy resources for namespaces and applications within K3s.
    *   Testing and active enforcement of Network Policies in the K3s environment.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Firewall on K3s Server Node:** Implement a firewall (e.g., `iptables`, cloud provider firewalls) directly on the K3s server node.
    2.  **Restrict Inbound Traffic to Server Node:**  Strictly limit inbound traffic to the K3s server node to only essential ports and sources:
        *   Allow inbound traffic from K3s agent nodes on necessary ports (default: TCP 6443 for API server, UDP 8472 and TCP 4789 for Flannel VXLAN if used, TCP 9345 for agent registration).
        *   Allow inbound SSH access only from authorized management IPs/networks.
        *   Block all other inbound traffic by default.
    3.  **Restrict Outbound Traffic from Server Node:** Limit outbound traffic from the K3s server node to only necessary destinations. In many cases, outbound traffic can be very restricted, primarily to agent nodes and potentially external services required for K3s operation (e.g., external database if used).
    4.  **Private Network for K3s Server-Agent Communication:** Deploy the K3s server and agent nodes within a private network (VPC, private subnet) to isolate K3s control plane communication from the public internet.
    5.  **Network Segmentation for K3s Control Plane:** Implement network segmentation to further isolate the K3s control plane network from other application or infrastructure networks.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **K3s Server Node Compromise (High Severity):** Direct, unrestricted access to the K3s server node significantly increases the risk of compromise, potentially leading to full cluster control for attackers.
    *   **Lateral Movement from K3s Server Node (Medium to High Severity):** A compromised K3s server node can be used as a pivot point for lateral movement to other networks if network controls are weak.
    *   **Data Exfiltration via K3s Server Node (Medium to High Severity):** Attackers can use a compromised server node to exfiltrate sensitive data from the server itself or potentially pivot to access data within the cluster.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **K3s Server Node Compromise:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Lateral Movement from K3s Server Node:** Medium to High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Exfiltration via K3s Server Node:** Medium to High Risk Reduction
