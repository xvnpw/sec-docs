# K3s Project Design Document for Threat Modeling - Improved Version

**Project:** K3s - Lightweight Kubernetes

**Version:** Based on K3s v1.27 (as of October 26, 2023, adjust as needed)

**Document Version:** 1.1

**Date:** October 27, 2023

**Author:** Gemini (AI Expert)

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a security-focused design overview of K3s, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution, specifically for threat modeling. It details the system architecture, key components, data flow, and critical security aspects to facilitate threat identification and mitigation in K3s deployments.

K3s is engineered for resource-constrained environments like edge computing and CI/CD, offering a production-ready, certified Kubernetes experience in a single binary with simplified operations and standard Kubernetes API compatibility.

This document targets security professionals, developers, and operators requiring a deep understanding of K3s architecture for security analysis and proactive threat management. It will serve as the foundation for identifying potential vulnerabilities and developing effective security strategies.

## 2. System Overview

K3s streamlines Kubernetes by consolidating components and using lightweight alternatives, while adhering to core Kubernetes principles.

The architecture comprises:

*   **Server Components (Control Plane):** Manage cluster state and operations.
*   **Agent Components (Worker Nodes):** Execute workloads under control plane direction.

## 3. Component Security Details & Threat Vectors

This section details each component with a focus on security implications and potential threat vectors.

### 3.1. API Server (`k3s server`)

*   **Functionality:** Kubernetes API endpoint, authentication, authorization, request validation, cluster interaction.
*   **Security Focus:** Central security enforcement point. Compromise impacts entire cluster.
*   **Security Mechanisms:**
    *   **Authentication:** X.509 certificates, bearer tokens, OIDC, Webhook. *Misconfiguration or weak credentials are major vulnerabilities.*

## 4. Deployment Model Security Implications

Deployment models significantly impact security:

*   **Single-Server:** *Highest Risk.* Single point of failure. Control plane and workloads on one node. Node compromise = cluster compromise. *Not for production.*
*   **Multi-Server (HA Control Plane):** *Recommended for Production.* Control plane redundancy. Agent nodes isolated. Control plane compromise harder, but agent node compromise still possible. *Requires secure server node communication.*
*   **Agent-Only Nodes:** *Scalable and More Secure than Single-Server.* Control plane isolated. Agent node compromise limited to worker node scope. *Secure agent-server communication is crucial.*

**Deployment Security Best Practices:**

*   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate control plane, agent nodes, and external networks. *Firewalls and Network Policies are essential.*
*   **Node Hardening:** Secure OS, minimize services, apply security benchmarks. *Reduces node attack surface.*
*   **Secure Boot:** Prevent unauthorized bootloaders. *Protects against boot-level attacks.*
*   **Regular Security Updates:** Patch OS, K3s, containerd, and all components. *Mitigates known vulnerabilities.*

## 5. External Interface Security Risks

K3s external interfaces are potential attack vectors:

*   **User (kubectl):** *Authentication and Authorization are Key.* Compromised user credentials or overly permissive RBAC = cluster compromise. *Enforce strong authentication, least privilege RBAC.*
*   **Container Registries:** *Supply Chain Risk.* Compromised registries or images = malware injection. *Use trusted registries, scan images, verify provenance.*
*   **External Services:** *Network Security and Authentication.* Unsecured external service communication = data breaches. *Enforce TLS, strong authentication for external service access.*
*   **External Load Balancers/DNS:** *External Attack Surface.* Misconfigured load balancers = service exposure, DoS. *Secure load balancer configuration, DDoS protection, TLS termination.*
*   **Monitoring/Logging Systems:** *Data Confidentiality and Integrity.* Unsecured monitoring/logging = data breaches, log tampering. *Secure transmission and storage of logs/metrics, access control.*

## 6. Data Flow Security Analysis

The data flow diagram (section 2) highlights sensitive data paths. Security concerns include:

*   **Credential Transmission:** User and service account credentials must be protected in transit (TLS).
*   **RBAC Policy Storage:** RBAC policies in etcd must be protected from unauthorized access and modification.
*   **Pod Specification Confidentiality:** Pod specs (secrets, env vars) in etcd and transit to Kubelet must be encrypted.
*   **Secret Management:** Kubernetes Secrets require encryption at rest and secure access control.
*   **Container Image Security:** Images pulled from registries must be scanned and verified to prevent malware.

## 7. Actionable Threat Modeling Guidance

To effectively threat model K3s, consider the following:

**By Component:**

*   **API Server:** Focus on authentication, authorization, API abuse, and data exfiltration threats.
*   **etcd:** Prioritize data confidentiality, integrity, and availability threats.
*   **Kubelet & Containerd:** Analyze container escape, node compromise, and image security threats.
*   **Network Components (Kube-proxy, LoadBalancer, Ingress):** Assess network policy bypass, service exposure, and web application attack threats.

**By Attack Surface:**

*   **External API Access (kubectl):** Threats related to user authentication and authorization.
*   **External Network Exposure (LoadBalancer, Ingress):** Threats from the internet, including web attacks and DoS.
*   **Node Level:** Threats targeting individual nodes, including container escapes and node compromise.
*   **Control Plane:** Threats targeting control plane components, leading to cluster-wide impact.
*   **Supply Chain (Container Images):** Threats from compromised container images and registries.

**Threat Modeling Activities:**

1.  **Identify Assets:**  Cluster data (secrets, configuration), workloads, control plane components, nodes.
2.  **Identify Threats:** Use STRIDE or similar frameworks, focusing on the threat vectors outlined in this document for each component and attack surface.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** Assess K3s configuration, component versions, and deployment model for known vulnerabilities.
4.  **Risk Assessment:** Prioritize threats based on likelihood and impact.
5.  **Mitigation Strategies:** Develop and implement security controls to mitigate identified risks (e.g., RBAC hardening, network policies, image scanning, encryption).

## 8. Conclusion

This improved design document provides a robust foundation for threat modeling K3s deployments. By understanding the architecture, component-specific security considerations, and actionable threat modeling guidance, security professionals can proactively identify and mitigate potential threats. This document should be used as a living document, updated as K3s evolves and new threats emerge. Continuous security assessment and adaptation are crucial for maintaining a secure K3s environment.
