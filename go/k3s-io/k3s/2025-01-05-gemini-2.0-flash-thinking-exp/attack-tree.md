## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit K3s Control Plane Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_k3s_control_plane_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

**Description:** This represents a broad category of attacks targeting the core components that manage and control the K3s cluster. Successful exploitation at this level grants the attacker significant control and access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to K3s API Server [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_k3s_api_server__critical_.md)

**Description:** The K3s API server is the central point of interaction for managing the cluster. Gaining unauthorized access allows an attacker to perform arbitrary actions, including deploying malicious workloads, modifying configurations, and accessing sensitive data. This is a critical node because it unlocks numerous subsequent attack possibilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known CVE in Kubernetes API Server (K3s Specific Patches Lagging)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_cve_in_kubernetes_api_server__k3s_specific_patches_lagging_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in the Kubernetes API server. The risk is heightened in K3s environments if there's a delay in backporting security patches compared to upstream Kubernetes.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete control over the K3s cluster, allowing the attacker to perform any action an authorized user can.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak or Default K3s API Server Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_or_default_k3s_api_server_authenticationauthorization.md)

**Attack Vector:** Leveraging weak or default credentials for API server access or exploiting misconfigurations in authentication and authorization mechanisms. This can occur if strong passwords are not enforced, default credentials are not changed, or if Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is not properly configured.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker unauthorized access to the API server, with the level of control depending on the compromised credentials or the extent of the authorization bypass.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise etcd (K3s Embedded Data Store) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_etcd__k3s_embedded_data_store___critical_.md)

**Description:** etcd is a distributed key-value store that serves as the primary backing store for all Kubernetes cluster data, including configuration, state, and secrets. Compromising etcd gives the attacker the ability to manipulate the entire cluster and access sensitive information. This is a critical node because it directly impacts the integrity and confidentiality of the entire K3s environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated etcd Access (Default K3s Setup)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unauthenticated_or_weakly_authenticated_etcd_access__default_k3s_setup_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting default configurations or the absence of strong authentication mechanisms for accessing the etcd database. In some default K3s setups, etcd might be accessible without proper authentication on certain network interfaces.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to directly read and modify the entire cluster state, including secrets, configurations, and deployment information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known CVE in etcd (K3s Bundled Version)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_cve_in_etcd__k3s_bundled_version_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in the specific version of etcd bundled with the K3s distribution.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the etcd database, allowing the attacker to manipulate cluster data, steal secrets, or even cause a denial of service.
