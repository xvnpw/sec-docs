# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for k3s-io/k3s

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to the K3s API Server](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to_the_k3s_api_server.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Authorized Networks:** Determine the specific IP address ranges or networks that require access to the K3s API server (e.g., internal network, specific developer IPs).
    2.  **Configure Host Firewall:** Utilize the host-based firewall (like `iptables` or `firewalld`) on the K3s server node to restrict access to the kube-apiserver port (default 6443). Allow inbound traffic *only* from the identified authorized networks. Block all other inbound traffic to this port.  This is crucial as K3s is often deployed on edge or resource-constrained environments where network segmentation might be less robust.
    3.  **K3s Server Configuration ( `--advertise-address`, `--bind-address`):** Review and configure the `--advertise-address` and `--bind-address` flags during K3s server startup.  `--bind-address` should be set to a non-public interface (e.g., internal network interface). `--advertise-address` should be set to an address reachable by other nodes and authorized clients, but not necessarily publicly accessible.
    4.  **Avoid Public Exposure:**  Do not expose the K3s API server directly to the public internet. For remote `kubectl` access, establish a secure tunnel (like SSH port forwarding or VPN) to the internal network where the K3s API server is accessible.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized API Access (High Severity): Attackers gaining access to the K3s API server from outside authorized networks.
    *   Control Plane Compromise (Critical Severity):  Compromising the API server, leading to full control over the K3s cluster due to external exposure.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized API Access: High Reduction
    *   Control Plane Compromise: High Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Host-based firewalls are configured on server nodes to restrict access to port 6443 from outside the internal network.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Further refinement of `--advertise-address` and `--bind-address` K3s server flags to ensure optimal network exposure control.
    *   Formal documentation for developers on secure remote `kubectl` access methods (VPN/SSH tunneling).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in K3s](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_enforce_role-based_access_control__rbac__in_k3s.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify RBAC is Enabled (Default in K3s):** K3s enables RBAC by default. Confirm during setup or by inspecting the kube-apiserver arguments that RBAC is active (`--authorization-mode=RBAC`).
    2.  **Define K3s Specific Roles:** Create Roles and ClusterRoles tailored to the specific needs of applications and users interacting with the K3s cluster. Consider roles for deploying applications, accessing logs, monitoring, etc., within the K3s environment.
    3.  **Utilize K3s Service Accounts with RBAC:** Ensure applications deployed in K3s utilize service accounts. Assign specific Roles to these service accounts using RoleBindings to limit application permissions to only what's necessary within the K3s cluster.
    4.  **Regularly Audit K3s RBAC:** Periodically review RBAC configurations in K3s to ensure they remain aligned with the principle of least privilege.  As applications evolve in K3s, RBAC policies might need adjustments.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Privilege Escalation within K3s (High Severity): Attackers or compromised applications gaining excessive permissions within the K3s cluster.
    *   Unauthorized Resource Modification in K3s (Medium Severity): Users or applications unintentionally or maliciously modifying K3s resources beyond their intended scope.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Privilege Escalation within K3s: High Reduction
    *   Unauthorized Resource Modification in K3s: High Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   RBAC is enabled by default in the K3s cluster.
    *   Basic roles exist for cluster administrators.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More granular, application-specific Roles and ClusterRoles tailored for the K3s environment are needed.
    *   Consistent use of service accounts with least privilege RBAC bindings for all applications deployed in K3s.
    *   Automated RBAC auditing process specific to the K3s cluster.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Network Policies for Pod Isolation in K3s (Requires CNI Plugin)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_network_policies_for_pod_isolation_in_k3s__requires_cni_plugin_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose and Enable a Network Policy CNI:** K3s itself does not include a default NetworkPolicy controller. Select and install a CNI plugin that supports Network Policies. Common choices compatible with K3s include Calico, Cilium, or Weave Net. Follow the CNI plugin's installation instructions for K3s.
    2.  **Define K3s Network Policies:** Create NetworkPolicy resources specifically designed for your application deployments within K3s. Focus on isolating namespaces and micro-segmenting applications running in K3s to limit lateral movement.
    3.  **Namespace Isolation in K3s:**  Utilize Network Policies to enforce namespace isolation within the K3s cluster. This is crucial for multi-tenancy or separating environments within a single K3s instance.
    4.  **Default Deny Policies in K3s Namespaces:** Consider implementing default deny Network Policies within K3s namespaces to enhance security posture. This approach requires explicitly allowing necessary traffic, improving control over network communication within the K3s environment.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Lateral Movement within K3s Cluster (High Severity): Attackers moving between pods within the K3s cluster after initial compromise.
    *   Network-based Data Breach in K3s (Medium Severity): Unauthorized network access to services and data within the K3s environment due to lack of network segmentation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Lateral Movement within K3s Cluster: High Reduction
    *   Network-based Data Breach in K3s: Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No NetworkPolicy controller is currently installed in the K3s cluster. Network Policies are not enforced.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Selection and installation of a NetworkPolicy CNI plugin compatible with K3s.
    *   Definition and implementation of Network Policies for namespace isolation and application micro-segmentation within the K3s cluster.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Kubernetes Secrets Management in K3s](./mitigation_strategies/secure_kubernetes_secrets_management_in_k3s.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Encryption at Rest for Secrets in K3s etcd:** Configure K3s to enable encryption at rest for Kubernetes Secrets stored in its embedded etcd database. This is typically done during K3s server setup using the `--secrets-encryption-providers` flag. This protects secrets if the etcd data is compromised.
    2.  **Consider External Secrets Management for K3s:** Evaluate integrating an external secrets management solution (like HashiCorp Vault) with K3s. While K3s has embedded etcd, for more robust secret management, external solutions offer features like centralized audit, rotation, and finer access control, which can be beneficial even in lightweight K3s deployments.
    3.  **RBAC for Secret Access in K3s:**  Strictly control access to Kubernetes Secrets within K3s using RBAC. Grant only necessary permissions to service accounts and users that require access to specific secrets within the K3s environment.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Breach due to Secret Exposure in K3s (Critical Severity): Compromise of sensitive credentials stored as Kubernetes Secrets within the K3s cluster.
    *   Privilege Escalation via Stolen Credentials from K3s (High Severity): Attackers using stolen secrets from K3s to escalate privileges within the cluster or in external systems.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Breach due to Secret Exposure in K3s: High Reduction (with encryption at rest and external solutions - Very High Reduction)
    *   Privilege Escalation via Stolen Credentials from K3s: High Reduction (with robust secret management practices)
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Kubernetes Secrets are used for managing application credentials in K3s.
    *   Secrets are *not* currently encrypted at rest in the K3s embedded etcd.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Enable encryption at rest for Kubernetes Secrets in the K3s embedded etcd using the `--secrets-encryption-providers` flag during K3s setup or configuration update.
    *   Evaluation and potential integration of an external secrets management solution with K3s for enhanced secret lifecycle management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Audit Logging in K3s](./mitigation_strategies/enable_audit_logging_in_k3s.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable K3s Audit Logging:** Configure K3s to enable audit logging. This is typically done by providing an audit policy file and enabling the audit log feature during K3s server startup using flags like `--audit-policy-file` and `--audit-log-path`.
    2.  **Define K3s Audit Policy:** Create a detailed audit policy file that specifies which API requests should be logged and at what level of detail. Focus on logging security-relevant events like authentication attempts, authorization failures, resource modifications, and secret access within the K3s environment.
    3.  **Secure K3s Audit Log Storage:** Ensure that K3s audit logs are stored securely and are protected from unauthorized access and tampering. Consider sending logs to a centralized logging system or SIEM for long-term storage and analysis outside of the K3s cluster itself.
    4.  **Regularly Review K3s Audit Logs:** Establish a process for regularly reviewing and analyzing K3s audit logs to detect suspicious activities, security incidents, and policy violations within the K3s cluster.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Security Incident Detection in K3s (Medium to High Severity): Improved ability to detect and respond to security incidents occurring within the K3s cluster.
    *   Compliance Violations (Varies):  Meeting compliance requirements that mandate audit logging of Kubernetes API activity.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Security Incident Detection in K3s: Medium to High Reduction (depending on log analysis and response processes)
    *   Compliance Violations: High Reduction (if compliance requires audit logging)
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Audit logging is *not* currently enabled in the K3s cluster.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Enable audit logging in K3s by configuring `--audit-policy-file` and `--audit-log-path` during K3s server setup.
    *   Creation of a comprehensive audit policy file tailored to the security needs of the K3s environment.
    *   Establishment of secure storage and a process for regular review and analysis of K3s audit logs.
