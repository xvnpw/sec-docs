# Attack Surface Analysis for photoprism/photoprism

## Attack Surface: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/image_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** PhotoPrism uses image processing libraries to handle uploaded media. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited by malicious image files.
*   **PhotoPrism Contribution:** PhotoPrism directly integrates and relies on image processing libraries, making it vulnerable to flaws in these libraries.
*   **Example:** A crafted JPEG file exploits a buffer overflow in `libjpeg` during PhotoPrism processing, leading to remote code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, Remote Code Execution, Information Disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep PhotoPrism and dependencies updated.
    *   Monitor security advisories for PhotoPrism and OS.
    *   Consider resource limits for PhotoPrism process.
    *   Explore sandboxing image processing (advanced).

## Attack Surface: [Database Injection](./attack_surfaces/database_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in database query construction can lead to SQL injection attacks.
*   **PhotoPrism Contribution:** PhotoPrism interacts with a database. Insufficient input sanitization or parameterized queries can lead to vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects SQL code via a crafted API request, bypassing authentication and reading sensitive database data.
*   **Impact:** Data Breach, Data Manipulation, Privilege Escalation, Potential Remote Code Execution (in specific database configurations).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure parameterized queries are used consistently.
    *   Implement server-side input sanitization.
    *   Apply principle of least privilege to database user accounts.
    *   Conduct regular security audits.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration and Secrets Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_and_secrets_management.md)

*   **Description:** Mismanagement of configuration files and secrets can expose sensitive information.
*   **PhotoPrism Contribution:** PhotoPrism uses configuration files and environment variables for sensitive data like database credentials.
*   **Example:** Database credentials are hardcoded in a configuration file exposed via a misconfigured web server, leading to database compromise.
*   **Impact:** Data Breach, Full System Compromise (if database access is compromised).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure configuration file storage outside web root.
    *   Use environment variables or secret management for sensitive data.
    *   Enforce strong passwords and key rotation.
    *   Apply principle of least privilege for access control to configurations.
    *   Regularly audit configuration security.

## Attack Surface: [Third-Party Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/third-party_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by PhotoPrism.
*   **PhotoPrism Contribution:** PhotoPrism relies on third-party Go packages and JavaScript libraries that may contain vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability in a Go library used by PhotoPrism is exploited to compromise PhotoPrism instances.
*   **Impact:** Varies; can include Denial of Service, Remote Code Execution, and Data Breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **Critical** (can be Critical depending on the dependency vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update PhotoPrism and dependencies.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools.
    *   Monitor vulnerability databases and advisories.
    *   Implement automated dependency updates.
