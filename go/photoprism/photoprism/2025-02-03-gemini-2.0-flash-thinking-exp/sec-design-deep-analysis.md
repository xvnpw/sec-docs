### 2. Security Implications of Key Components and Mitigation Strategies

#### 2.1 Web Server Container

**Description & Function:**  The Web Server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) acts as the entry point for user requests, serving static content and proxying dynamic requests to the Application Server. It handles HTTPS termination and provides basic web security features.

**Security Implications:**

*   **Exposure to the Internet:** Directly exposed to the internet, making it a primary target for attacks.
*   **Web Server Vulnerabilities:** Potential vulnerabilities in the web server software itself (e.g., Nginx, Apache vulnerabilities).
