# Threat Model Analysis for photoprism/photoprism

## Threat: [Malicious Media File Exploitation](./threats/malicious_media_file_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image or video file designed to exploit vulnerabilities in PhotoPrism's media processing libraries. This could involve overflowing buffers, triggering code execution, or causing denial of service when PhotoPrism attempts to process the file.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server. Denial of Service (DoS), making PhotoPrism unavailable. Data corruption if the exploit corrupts stored media or database. Information disclosure if the exploit allows access to sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Media Processing Module (image decoding libraries, ffmpeg, etc.)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep PhotoPrism and its dependencies updated.
        *   Implement sandboxing for media processing.
        *   Regularly scan uploaded media with anti-malware (though limited effectiveness against sophisticated exploits).
        *   Consider input validation and sanitization (complex for binary formats).

## Threat: [Exif/Metadata Exploitation](./threats/exifmetadata_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker embeds malicious code or crafted data within image metadata (Exif, IPTC, XMP). When PhotoPrism parses this metadata, it triggers a vulnerability in the metadata parsing library, leading to exploitation.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to Malicious Media File Exploitation: RCE, DoS, data corruption, information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Component:** Metadata Extraction Module (ExifTool or similar libraries)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep PhotoPrism and metadata parsing libraries updated.
        *   Sanitize or strip unnecessary metadata fields during processing.
        *   Implement sandboxing for metadata extraction.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass in PhotoPrism UI/API](./threats/authentication_bypass_in_photoprism_uiapi.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in PhotoPrism's authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to the web interface or API. This could involve exploiting weak password policies, session management flaws, or code vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to media files, modification or deletion of data, potential privilege escalation if admin accounts are compromised.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication Module, API, Web UI
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong and unique passwords.
        *   Regularly update PhotoPrism to patch authentication vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust API authentication (if API is exposed).
        *   Consider integrating with existing application authentication systems.
        *   Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) if available and applicable.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in PhotoPrism UI](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_photoprism_ui.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into PhotoPrism's web interface. This could be through user-supplied data displayed in the UI or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the UI code itself. When other users access the interface, the malicious script executes in their browsers.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account compromise, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the PhotoPrism interface, information theft from user browsers.
    *   **Affected Component:** Web UI
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep PhotoPrism updated to patch XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Ensure PhotoPrism implements proper output encoding and input sanitization in the UI.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Threat: [Database Injection](./threats/database_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in PhotoPrism's database queries to inject malicious SQL code. This could be through user input that is not properly sanitized before being used in database queries.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, data modification or deletion, potential for RCE in some database configurations (less likely with SQLite).
    *   **Affected Component:** Database Interaction Module, potentially API endpoints handling user input
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep PhotoPrism updated to patch database injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Ensure PhotoPrism uses parameterized queries or prepared statements.
        *   Regularly review code for potential injection points.

## Threat: [Data Breach of Stored Media and Metadata](./threats/data_breach_of_stored_media_and_metadata.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to PhotoPrism's data storage (database, media files) due to misconfigurations, weak access controls, or vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure *related to PhotoPrism's data management*.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach of user photos and videos, exposure of sensitive metadata (location data, personal information). Reputational damage and legal liabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Data Storage (Database, File System) as managed by PhotoPrism
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure database and file storage servers *used by PhotoPrism*.
        *   Implement strong access controls *specifically for PhotoPrism's data*.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest (database, disk encryption).
        *   Regularly back up data and store backups securely.
        *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in PhotoPrism Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_photoprism_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** PhotoPrism relies on numerous third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities discovered in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise PhotoPrism and the application using it.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the dependency vulnerability - RCE, DoS, information disclosure, etc.
    *   **Affected Component:** All PhotoPrism modules relying on vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update PhotoPrism and all its dependencies.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories for dependencies and apply patches promptly.
