## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Media Processing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_media_processing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Image Parsing Vulnerability (e.g., Buffer Overflow, Heap Overflow) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Attacker uploads a specially crafted image file (e.g., JPEG, PNG, GIF).
        *   Photoprism uses image processing libraries (like libjpeg, libpng) to parse the image.
        *   A vulnerability (buffer overflow, heap overflow, etc.) in these libraries is triggered during parsing due to the malicious image structure.
        *   This can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Video Processing Vulnerability (e.g., Codec Vulnerability) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Attacker uploads a malicious video file (e.g., MP4, MOV, AVI).
        *   Photoprism uses video processing libraries or codecs to handle the video.
        *   A vulnerability in a video codec or processing logic is exploited.
        *   Similar to image parsing, this can result in code execution.
    *   **Upload Extremely Large Media File:**
        *   Attacker uploads a file that is excessively large (e.g., gigabytes in size).
        *   Photoprism attempts to process this large file, consuming excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
        *   This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Code Execution: Full compromise of the server, attacker can gain complete control.
    *   Denial of Service: Application becomes unavailable, impacting users.
    *   Information Disclosure (less likely in direct media processing, but possible depending on vulnerability).

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Robust input validation and sanitization for media files.
    *   Regularly update image and video processing libraries and codecs.
    *   Implement sandboxing for media processing tasks to isolate potential exploits.
    *   Implement file size limits and resource quotas for uploads.
    *   Set timeouts and resource limits for media processing operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Web Interface Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_web_interface_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit API Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Attacker targets Photoprism's API endpoints.
        *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass in API [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Attacker attempts to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms in the API.
            *   This could involve exploiting flaws in session management, token handling, or access control logic.
            *   Successful bypass allows unauthorized access to API endpoints and functionalities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Data: Access to photos, metadata, user information, application settings.
    *   Data Manipulation: Modification or deletion of photos, metadata, user accounts, settings.
    *   Application Control: Ability to control Photoprism functionalities, potentially leading to further compromise.

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test API authentication and authorization logic.
    *   Implement robust access control mechanisms based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   Regularly audit API endpoints for vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement rate limiting and API monitoring to detect suspicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Vulnerable Third-Party Libraries [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Photoprism relies on numerous third-party libraries and dependencies.
        *   **Outdated Dependencies with Known Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Photoprism uses outdated versions of third-party libraries that contain publicly known security vulnerabilities.
            *   Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities using readily available exploit code or techniques.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Code Execution: Exploiting dependency vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   Data Breach: Vulnerabilities might allow access to sensitive data or enable data exfiltration.
    *   Denial of Service: Some dependency vulnerabilities can cause application crashes or DoS.

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Maintain a comprehensive inventory of all third-party dependencies.
    *   Regularly update all dependencies to their latest stable versions.
    *   Implement automated dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor security advisories for dependencies used by Photoprism.
    *   Have a plan for quickly patching or mitigating dependency vulnerabilities.
