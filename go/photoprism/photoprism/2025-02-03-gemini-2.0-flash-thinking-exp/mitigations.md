# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for photoprism/photoprism

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strict File Type Validation (Photoprism Context)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strict_file_type_validation__photoprism_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict File Type Validation (Photoprism Context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Photoprism's Supported Types:** Consult Photoprism's documentation to understand the media file types it supports for indexing and processing. Identify the default supported types and any configuration options to modify this list.
    2.  **Restrict Photoprism's Allowed Types (Configuration):** If Photoprism provides configuration options to limit the file types it processes (e.g., through configuration files or environment variables), utilize these to restrict processing to only the absolutely necessary and safest media types for your application's use case.  This minimizes the attack surface by reducing the number of file formats Photoprism needs to handle.
    3.  **Application-Level Pre-Validation (Reinforcement):** While Photoprism should handle files securely, implement file type validation *before* files are passed to Photoprism for indexing. This acts as a defense-in-depth measure. Use server-side validation (MIME type and extension checks as described previously) in your application to ensure only allowed files reach Photoprism.
    4.  **Monitor Photoprism Logs:** Regularly review Photoprism's logs for any errors or warnings related to file processing. This can help identify attempts to upload or process unexpected or potentially malicious file types that might have bypassed initial application-level validation.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious File Upload Exploitation via Photoprism (High Severity):** If Photoprism has vulnerabilities in its handling of certain media types, attackers could exploit these by uploading crafted files of those types. Restricting supported types reduces the potential attack surface within Photoprism's processing.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion via Complex File Types (Medium Severity):** Processing certain complex or less common media types might be more resource-intensive in Photoprism. Limiting supported types can help prevent resource exhaustion attacks targeting Photoprism's processing capabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious File Upload Exploitation via Photoprism:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the attack surface exposed to Photoprism's media processing engine.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion via Complex File Types:** Medium risk reduction. Helps control resource consumption by Photoprism.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Application-level extension validation exists before files are passed to Photoprism. Photoprism's internal configuration regarding allowed types is assumed default and not explicitly restricted.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Photoprism Configuration Review and Restriction:** Need to review Photoprism's configuration options to explicitly restrict the media types it processes to the minimum required.
    *   **Photoprism Log Monitoring for File Processing Errors:**  Need to implement monitoring of Photoprism's logs specifically for file processing related errors.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Filenames (Photoprism Context)](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_filenames__photoprism_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize Filenames (Photoprism Context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Sanitize Before Photoprism Indexing:** Ensure filenames are sanitized *before* they are passed to Photoprism for indexing. This should be done at the application level during file upload processing. Use a robust sanitization policy as described previously (allowlist of characters, length limits).
    2.  **Understand Photoprism's Filename Handling:** Research and understand how Photoprism handles filenames internally - during storage, database operations, and web interface display. Identify any potential areas where unsanitized filenames could cause issues within Photoprism's operations.
    3.  **Verify Sanitization Effectiveness for Photoprism:** After implementing filename sanitization in the application, test with various filenames containing special characters and path traversal sequences to ensure that Photoprism processes them safely and as expected, without errors or unexpected behavior.
    4.  **Review Photoprism's Configuration for Filename Handling:** Check if Photoprism has any configuration options related to filename handling or sanitization. If so, review and adjust these settings to reinforce secure filename processing.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal within Photoprism (Medium Severity):** If Photoprism itself has vulnerabilities in how it handles filenames during file system operations or internal path constructions, unsanitized filenames could potentially be exploited for path traversal within Photoprism's context.
    *   **Command Injection in Photoprism (Low to Medium Severity):** While less likely, if Photoprism uses filenames in system commands internally (e.g., for media processing tools), unsanitized filenames could theoretically be exploited for command injection within Photoprism's execution environment.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues within Photoprism (Low Severity):** Problematic filenames could potentially cause issues with Photoprism's database operations or file storage mechanisms, leading to data integrity problems within Photoprism's managed data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Path Traversal within Photoprism:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the risk of path traversal vulnerabilities within Photoprism itself.
    *   **Command Injection in Photoprism:** Low to Medium risk reduction. Reduces risk, although command injection via filenames in Photoprism is less probable.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues within Photoprism:** Low risk reduction. Helps prevent potential data integrity problems within Photoprism.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic sanitization is done at the application level before passing filenames to Photoprism. However, the effectiveness of this sanitization specifically for Photoprism's internal operations is not fully verified.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Photoprism Filename Handling Research:** Need to research and understand Photoprism's internal filename handling in detail.
    *   **Sanitization Effectiveness Testing with Photoprism:** Need to specifically test the implemented sanitization against Photoprism to ensure it is sufficient for Photoprism's secure operation.
    *   **Photoprism Configuration Review for Filename Handling:** Need to review Photoprism's configuration options related to filename handling.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit File Upload Size (Photoprism Context)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_file_upload_size__photoprism_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit File Upload Size (Photoprism Context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Photoprism's Upload Limits (If Available):** Investigate if Photoprism itself provides any configuration options to limit the size of files it accepts for indexing or processing. If such options exist (e.g., in configuration files or environment variables), configure them to set reasonable limits based on your infrastructure and application needs.
    2.  **Application-Level Pre-Limiting (Reinforcement):** Implement file size limits in your application *before* files are passed to Photoprism. This acts as the primary enforcement point and prevents excessively large files from even reaching Photoprism for processing.
    3.  **Resource Monitoring for Photoprism:** Monitor the resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk I/O) of the Photoprism process, especially during file indexing and processing. This helps identify if large files are causing resource strain on the Photoprism instance and inform adjustments to file size limits.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) targeting Photoprism (High Severity):** Attackers could attempt to overload the Photoprism instance by uploading extremely large media files, causing resource exhaustion and potentially crashing Photoprism or impacting its performance for legitimate users.
    *   **Storage Exhaustion via Photoprism (Medium Severity):** Uncontrolled uploads of large files processed by Photoprism can rapidly consume storage space allocated to Photoprism, leading to storage exhaustion and Photoprism malfunction.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) targeting Photoprism:** High risk reduction. Prevents DoS attacks specifically targeting Photoprism's resource limits.
    *   **Storage Exhaustion via Photoprism:** Medium risk reduction. Helps control storage usage by Photoprism.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Application-level size limits are in place, but primarily relying on web server limits. Photoprism's own configuration for upload limits is not investigated or configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Photoprism Configuration Review for Upload Limits:** Need to investigate and configure Photoprism's own file upload size limits if available.
    *   **Photoprism Resource Monitoring:** Need to implement monitoring of Photoprism's resource usage, especially during file processing, to inform appropriate size limits.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Photoprism and Dependencies Updated (Photoprism Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/keep_photoprism_and_dependencies_updated__photoprism_focus_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Photoprism Specific Update Monitoring:** Focus monitoring efforts on Photoprism's release notes, security advisories, and GitHub repository for security-related updates. Prioritize applying Photoprism updates that address security vulnerabilities.
    2.  **Photoprism Dependency Updates:** When updating Photoprism, also ensure its dependencies are updated. Photoprism's documentation or release notes should provide guidance on dependency updates. Use appropriate dependency management tools for Photoprism's stack (e.g., Go modules if Photoprism is built from source, or container image updates if using Docker).
    3.  **Test Photoprism Updates Thoroughly:**  After updating Photoprism, conduct thorough testing to ensure the update has not introduced regressions or broken functionality, especially features related to security and media processing. Pay attention to any changes in Photoprism's configuration or behavior after updates.
    4.  **Automate Photoprism Updates (If Feasible and Safe):** Explore options for automating Photoprism updates, especially for minor or patch releases, if your deployment environment allows for safe automation. However, always prioritize testing in a staging environment before applying automated updates to production.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Photoprism Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Directly addresses the risk of attackers exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in Photoprism itself.
    *   **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Photoprism's Dependencies (High Severity):** Mitigates risks arising from vulnerabilities in libraries and components used by Photoprism.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Photoprism Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction. Directly patches vulnerabilities in Photoprism.
    *   **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Photoprism's Dependencies:** High risk reduction. Addresses vulnerabilities in Photoprism's underlying components.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. General awareness of updates exists, but a Photoprism-specific focused update strategy is not formalized. Updates are applied occasionally but not always promptly or systematically.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Photoprism-Focused Update Monitoring:** Need to establish dedicated monitoring for Photoprism security updates and releases.
    *   **Formal Photoprism Update Process:** Need to define a clear process for testing and applying Photoprism updates, including dependency updates.
    *   **Automation Exploration for Photoprism Updates:** Need to explore safe automation options for Photoprism updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits for Photoprism Media Processing](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_for_photoprism_media_processing.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Resource Limits for Photoprism Media Processing
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Containerization and Resource Limits (Recommended):** If deploying Photoprism in a containerized environment (e.g., Docker), utilize container orchestration features (like Docker Compose or Kubernetes) to set resource limits for the Photoprism container. Limit CPU cores, memory usage, and potentially disk I/O to prevent Photoprism from consuming excessive server resources.
    2.  **Operating System Level Limits (If Applicable):** If not containerized, explore operating system-level resource control mechanisms (e.g., `ulimit` on Linux) to restrict the resources available to the Photoprism process.
    3.  **Photoprism Configuration for Resource Usage (If Available):** Check if Photoprism has any internal configuration options to control its resource usage, such as limiting concurrent processing threads, memory caches, or other resource-intensive operations. Configure these settings to optimize resource usage and prevent overload.
    4.  **Monitoring Photoprism Resource Consumption:** Implement monitoring of Photoprism's resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk I/O) in real-time. Set up alerts to trigger if Photoprism exceeds predefined resource thresholds, indicating potential resource exhaustion or DoS attempts.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion via Photoprism (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from causing DoS by triggering resource-intensive media processing in Photoprism that exhausts server resources, impacting availability for legitimate users and potentially other services.
    *   **"Noisy Neighbor" Issues (Medium Severity):** In shared hosting environments, resource limits prevent Photoprism from negatively impacting other applications or tenants on the same server due to excessive resource consumption.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion via Photoprism:** High risk reduction. Effectively limits the impact of resource exhaustion attacks targeting Photoprism.
    *   **"Noisy Neighbor" Issues:** Medium risk reduction. Improves stability and resource fairness in shared environments.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Photoprism is deployed in a containerized environment (Docker), but explicit resource limits are not yet configured for the Photoprism container. System-level monitoring is in place but not specifically focused on Photoprism's resource usage.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Container Resource Limits for Photoprism:** Need to configure CPU and memory limits for the Photoprism Docker container.
    *   **Photoprism Configuration Review for Resource Usage:** Need to review Photoprism's configuration options for controlling resource consumption.
    *   **Photoprism Specific Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Need to implement dedicated monitoring and alerting for Photoprism's resource usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Consider Using a Sandboxed Environment for Photoprism Media Processing](./mitigation_strategies/consider_using_a_sandboxed_environment_for_photoprism_media_processing.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sandboxed Environment for Photoprism Media Processing
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Containerization (Base Sandboxing):** Deploy Photoprism within a container (e.g., Docker). Containers provide a basic level of sandboxing by isolating Photoprism's process and file system from the host system. This is already partially implemented.
    2.  **Security-Focused Container Configuration:** Configure the Photoprism container with security best practices:
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Photoprism process within the container as a non-root user.
        *   **Capability Dropping:** Drop unnecessary Linux capabilities from the container to reduce its attack surface.
        *   **Seccomp Profiles:** Apply Seccomp profiles to restrict the system calls Photoprism can make from within the container.
        *   **AppArmor/SELinux:** Consider using AppArmor or SELinux profiles to further restrict the container's access to system resources and files.
    3.  **Dedicated Processing Container (Isolation):** For enhanced isolation, consider separating Photoprism's media processing tasks into a dedicated container that is separate from the main Photoprism web application container. This limits the potential impact if a vulnerability is exploited during media processing.
    4.  **Minimalist Base Image:** Use a minimalist container base image (e.g., Alpine Linux, distroless images) for the Photoprism container to reduce the number of packages and potential vulnerabilities within the container image itself.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) Exploitation Containment (High Severity):** If a vulnerability in Photoprism's media processing engine is exploited for RCE, a sandboxed environment limits the attacker's ability to compromise the host system or other parts of the application infrastructure. The impact of the RCE is contained within the sandbox.
    *   **Privilege Escalation Containment (High Severity):** Sandboxing helps prevent privilege escalation attempts from within the Photoprism process, limiting the damage an attacker can cause even if they gain initial code execution.
    *   **Lateral Movement Prevention (Medium Severity):** Sandboxing makes it more difficult for an attacker who compromises Photoprism to move laterally to other parts of the infrastructure or access sensitive data outside of the sandbox.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) Exploitation Containment:** High risk reduction. Significantly limits the impact of RCE vulnerabilities in Photoprism.
    *   **Privilege Escalation Containment:** High risk reduction. Prevents or hinders privilege escalation.
    *   **Lateral Movement Prevention:** Medium risk reduction. Makes lateral movement more challenging for attackers.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Photoprism is containerized (Docker), providing basic isolation. However, security-focused container configuration (non-root user, capability dropping, Seccomp/AppArmor/SELinux) is not fully implemented. Dedicated processing container is not implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Security-Focused Container Configuration:** Need to implement non-root user, capability dropping, and Seccomp/AppArmor/SELinux profiles for the Photoprism Docker container.
    *   **Dedicated Processing Container (Optional but Recommended):** Consider implementing a separate container specifically for media processing tasks for enhanced isolation.
    *   **Minimalist Base Image Evaluation:** Evaluate using a minimalist base image for the Photoprism container.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable or Carefully Configure Photoprism Features Involving External Services](./mitigation_strategies/disable_or_carefully_configure_photoprism_features_involving_external_services.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable/Configure External Service Features in Photoprism
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify External Service Features:** Review Photoprism's documentation and configuration options to identify features that involve communication with external services. This might include features like:
        *   Reverse geocoding services (for location metadata).
        *   Object recognition or image tagging services.
        *   Integration with cloud storage or backup services.
        *   Any features that make outbound network requests.
    2.  **Assess Necessity and Risk:** For each external service feature, assess whether it is essential for your application's functionality. Consider the security risks associated with relying on external services, including:
        *   Data privacy concerns (data sent to third-party services).
        *   Availability and reliability of external services.
        *   Potential for vulnerabilities in the integration with external services.
    3.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable any external service features that are not strictly required for your application's core functionality. This reduces the attack surface and minimizes reliance on potentially less secure or less reliable external components.
    4.  **Carefully Configure Necessary Features:** For external service features that are essential, configure them securely:
        *   **Use HTTPS:** Ensure all communication with external services is over HTTPS to protect data in transit.
        *   **Least Privilege Access:** If authentication is required for external services, use API keys or credentials with the least privileges necessary.
        *   **Rate Limiting and Error Handling:** Implement rate limiting and robust error handling for interactions with external services to prevent abuse and handle service outages gracefully.
    5.  **Monitor External Service Interactions:** Monitor Photoprism's logs for any errors or unexpected behavior related to external service interactions. This can help identify potential issues or security problems.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Leakage to External Services (Medium Severity):** Sensitive data (e.g., location information, image content) could be unintentionally leaked to third-party external services if features involving these services are not carefully configured or if those services are compromised.
    *   **Dependency on Untrusted External Services (Medium Severity):** Relying on external services introduces dependencies on potentially untrusted third-party infrastructure, which could be vulnerable or unreliable.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Medium Severity):** If communication with external services is not properly secured (e.g., not using HTTPS), it could be vulnerable to MitM attacks, potentially exposing data or allowing attackers to intercept or modify communications.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Leakage to External Services:** Medium risk reduction. Prevents unintentional data sharing with external parties.
    *   **Dependency on Untrusted External Services:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces reliance on potentially less secure external components.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Medium risk reduction. Protects communication with external services from eavesdropping and tampering.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. There is a general awareness of external service features, but a systematic review and configuration based on security risk is not fully implemented. Some features might be enabled with default configurations.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Photoprism Feature Review for External Service Usage:** Need to conduct a thorough review of Photoprism's features and identify all those that interact with external services.
    *   **Risk Assessment and Necessity Evaluation:** Need to assess the necessity and security risks of each external service feature for the application's use case.
    *   **Disablement/Secure Configuration of External Service Features:** Need to disable unnecessary features and securely configure essential ones (HTTPS, least privilege, rate limiting).
    *   **Monitoring of External Service Interactions:** Need to implement monitoring of Photoprism's logs for external service related events.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Harden Photoprism's Configuration Related to Image and Video Decoding](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_harden_photoprism's_configuration_related_to_image_and_video_decoding.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Harden Photoprism's Media Decoding Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Decoding Configuration Options:** Review Photoprism's configuration files and documentation to find settings related to image and video decoding libraries and codecs. This might involve settings for:
        *   Specific image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.).
        *   Specific video codecs (H.264, H.265, VP9, etc.).
        *   Libraries used for decoding (e.g., libjpeg, libpng, ffmpeg).
        *   Decoding performance settings.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Codec Support:** If Photoprism allows disabling support for specific image or video codecs, consider disabling support for codecs that are:
        *   Less commonly used in your application's expected media uploads.
        *   Known to have a history of security vulnerabilities.
        *   More complex and potentially more prone to vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Restrict Decoding Library Options (If Possible):** If Photoprism allows choosing between different decoding libraries or versions, select libraries that are known for their security and are actively maintained. Avoid using outdated or less secure libraries if alternatives are available.
    4.  **Optimize Decoding Performance Settings for Security:** Review performance-related decoding settings. Sometimes, optimizing for performance might come at the cost of security (e.g., disabling certain security checks for faster decoding). Prioritize security over extreme performance optimizations unless absolutely necessary.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update Decoding Libraries:** Ensure that the decoding libraries used by Photoprism (either bundled or system-level dependencies) are regularly updated to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. This ties back to the general "Keep Photoprism and Dependencies Updated" strategy.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Media Decoding Libraries (High Severity):** Media decoding libraries (like libjpeg, libpng, ffmpeg) are complex and have historically been targets for security vulnerabilities. Exploiting vulnerabilities in these libraries during media processing in Photoprism could lead to RCE or other security breaches.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Crafted Media Files (Medium Severity):** Attackers could craft media files designed to trigger vulnerabilities or resource exhaustion in decoding libraries, leading to DoS of the Photoprism instance.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Media Decoding Libraries:** Medium to High risk reduction. Reduces the attack surface by limiting codec support and ensuring libraries are updated.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Crafted Media Files:** Medium risk reduction. Makes it harder to trigger DoS through crafted media files by hardening decoding configurations.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Photoprism's default configuration for media decoding is assumed to be in place. No explicit review or hardening of decoding configurations has been performed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Photoprism Decoding Configuration Review:** Need to thoroughly review Photoprism's configuration options related to image and video decoding.
    *   **Codec Support Restriction (If Possible):** Need to evaluate the feasibility and benefits of disabling support for less common or potentially vulnerable codecs.
    *   **Decoding Library Review and Updates:** Need to ensure that decoding libraries used by Photoprism are up-to-date and potentially explore options for using more secure alternatives if available.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Strong and Unique Credentials for Photoprism Administrative Accounts (If Exposed)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_strong_and_unique_credentials_for_photoprism_administrative_accounts__if_exposed_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strong Credentials for Photoprism Admin Accounts
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Photoprism Admin Interface:** Determine if your deployment exposes Photoprism's administrative interface directly to users or administrators. If so, identify the login mechanism and user management system used by Photoprism.
    2.  **Enforce Strong Password Policy:** If Photoprism allows password-based authentication for administrative accounts, enforce a strong password policy:
        *   **Minimum Length:** Set a minimum password length (e.g., 12-16 characters or more).
        *   **Complexity Requirements:** Require a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
        *   **Password History:** Prevent password reuse by enforcing password history.
    3.  **Unique Passwords:** Ensure that administrative users are using unique passwords for Photoprism that are not reused across other accounts.
    4.  **Avoid Default Credentials:** Change any default administrative usernames and passwords provided by Photoprism immediately upon deployment.
    5.  **Regular Password Rotation (Recommended):** Encourage or enforce regular password rotation for administrative accounts.
    6.  **Consider Disabling Direct Admin Access (If Possible):** If direct access to Photoprism's admin interface is not strictly necessary, consider disabling or restricting access to it, managing Photoprism through other means (e.g., API, configuration files, command-line tools) if possible.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Photoprism Admin Interface (High Severity):** Weak or default credentials for administrative accounts are a primary target for attackers. Compromising admin accounts grants full control over Photoprism and potentially the media library and application integration.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Weak passwords are vulnerable to brute-force attacks, where attackers try to guess passwords through automated attempts.
    *   **Credential Stuffing Attacks (Medium Severity):** If users reuse passwords across multiple services, compromised credentials from other breaches could be used to gain access to Photoprism admin accounts.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Photoprism Admin Interface:** High risk reduction. Strong credentials are a fundamental defense against unauthorized access.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Medium risk reduction. Makes brute-force attacks significantly more difficult.
    *   **Credential Stuffing Attacks:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the risk of successful credential stuffing attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic password complexity is encouraged, but a strict password policy is not enforced within Photoprism itself (policy would need to be enforced at the application level if managing Photoprism users). Default credentials are assumed to be changed during initial setup.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Formal Strong Password Policy Enforcement:** Need to implement and enforce a strict password policy for Photoprism administrative accounts (if managed directly by Photoprism or through application integration).
    *   **Password Rotation Policy:** Need to establish and implement a password rotation policy for admin accounts.
    *   **Admin Access Review and Restriction:** Need to review the necessity of direct admin interface access and consider disabling or restricting it if possible.

        *   Applying configuration changes to Photoprism or infrastructure components.
        *   Developing and deploying application-level patches or workarounds if necessary.
    6.  **Re-scan After Remediation:** After implementing remediation measures, re-run vulnerability scans to verify that the vulnerabilities have been effectively addressed.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Proactively identifies known vulnerabilities in Photoprism and its deployment environment before attackers can exploit them.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerability Discovery (Medium Severity):** While not directly detecting zero-day vulnerabilities, regular scanning helps establish a baseline security posture and makes it easier to identify unusual activity or deviations that might indicate exploitation attempts.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation by proactively identifying and remediating vulnerabilities.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerability Discovery:** Medium risk reduction. Enhances overall security visibility and incident detection capabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Regular vulnerability scanning of the deployed Photoprism instance is not currently performed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Vulnerability Scanner Selection and Configuration:** Need to select and configure appropriate vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   **Scheduled Vulnerability Scans:** Need to establish a schedule for regular scans.
    *   **Scan Result Analysis and Remediation Process:** Need to define a process for analyzing scan results, prioritizing vulnerabilities, and implementing remediation measures.
    *   **Re-scanning Verification:** Need to incorporate re-scanning after remediation to verify effectiveness.
