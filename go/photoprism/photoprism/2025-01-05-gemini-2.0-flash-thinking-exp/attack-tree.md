## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Photoprism API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_photoprism_api_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Exploit Photoprism API Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Identify a vulnerable API endpoint:**
        * Analyzing Photoprism's API documentation for known vulnerabilities.
        * Fuzzing API endpoints with unexpected or malicious input to trigger errors or unexpected behavior.
    * **Inject malicious payloads:**
        * Sending crafted data through API requests that, when processed by Photoprism, leads to unintended actions such as code execution or data manipulation.
        * Injecting malicious data that is stored by Photoprism and later processed in a vulnerable manner (e.g., during metadata extraction or display).
    * **Gain unauthorized access to application data or functionality:**
        * Successfully bypassing authentication or authorization checks to access resources or perform actions that should be restricted.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Photoprism Image Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_photoprism_image_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Exploit Photoprism Image Processing Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Upload a maliciously crafted image:**
        * Creating image files that exploit known vulnerabilities in image parsing libraries (e.g., libjpeg, libpng) used by Photoprism. These vulnerabilities can be memory corruption issues, buffer overflows, or other flaws.
    * **Trigger Photoprism's processing of the malicious image:**
        * Relying on the application's functionality to upload images to Photoprism or Photoprism's automatic processing of newly added files.
    * **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server hosting Photoprism (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Successfully exploiting an image processing vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server running Photoprism. This grants the attacker full control over the server.
    * **Cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the Photoprism process (Potential Critical Node):**
        * Exploiting an image processing vulnerability to cause Photoprism to crash or become unresponsive, disrupting the application's functionality.
    * **Access sensitive information through RCE (CRITICAL NODE IMPACT):**
        * After gaining RCE, accessing sensitive data stored on the server, including user photos, metadata, application configurations, or other sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Photoprism's Authentication/Authorization Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_photoprism's_authenticationauthorization_flaws.md)

* **Exploit Photoprism's Authentication/Authorization Flaws:**
    * **Identify weaknesses in Photoprism's user authentication or authorization mechanisms:**
        * Analyzing Photoprism's code to find flaws in how user credentials are handled, session management, or role-based access control is implemented.
    * **Gain control over Photoprism and potentially impact the application:**
        * Successfully bypassing authentication to access Photoprism's administrative interface.
        * Elevating privileges to perform actions that should be restricted to administrators, potentially leading to data manipulation or service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies Vulnerabilities within Photoprism](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_vulnerabilities_within_photoprism.md)

* **Exploit Dependencies Vulnerabilities within Photoprism:**
    * **Identify outdated or vulnerable dependencies used by Photoprism:**
        * Examining Photoprism's dependency files (e.g., `go.mod`) to identify outdated libraries.
        * Using vulnerability scanning tools to find known vulnerabilities in the identified dependencies.
    * **Trigger a code path that utilizes the vulnerable dependency with malicious input (Potential Critical Node):**
        * Providing specific input that, when processed by the vulnerable dependency, triggers the vulnerability. This could lead to various outcomes, including RCE or DoS.
    * **Achieve Remote Code Execution through the vulnerable dependency (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Successfully exploiting a vulnerability in a dependency to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Cause a Denial of Service by exploiting a vulnerability in a critical dependency (Potential Critical Node):**
        * Exploiting a dependency vulnerability to crash Photoprism or consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.
