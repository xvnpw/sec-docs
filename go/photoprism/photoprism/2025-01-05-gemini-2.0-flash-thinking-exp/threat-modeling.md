# Threat Model Analysis for photoprism/photoprism

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Metadata](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_metadata.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in Photoprism's web interface or API (provided by Photoprism) to gain unauthorized access to the metadata stored for photos and videos by Photoprism. This could involve crafting malicious requests or exploiting authentication flaws *within Photoprism*. They could then exfiltrate this metadata.

**Impact:**  Loss of privacy for users as sensitive information like location data, timestamps, and camera details is exposed. This could lead to stalking, doxxing, or other forms of harm.

**Affected Component:** Database, Web Interface, API

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Ensure Photoprism is updated to the latest version with security patches.
- Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the Photoprism instance.
- Regularly review and restrict Photoprism's API access if exposed.
- Consider options within Photoprism's configuration to redact or limit the storage of highly sensitive metadata if not strictly necessary.

## Threat: [Unintended Data Sharing through Shared Albums](./threats/unintended_data_sharing_through_shared_albums.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit flaws in Photoprism's shared album functionality, such as predictable or brute-forceable share links *generated by Photoprism*, or vulnerabilities in permission management *within Photoprism*, to access albums they were not intended to see.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to private photos and videos, potentially leading to privacy breaches, embarrassment, or reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Sharing Module, Web Interface, Database

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Use strong, unpredictable share links (if configurable within Photoprism).
- Implement robust access control mechanisms for shared albums within Photoprism's settings.
- Regularly audit shared album permissions within Photoprism.
- Consider adding expiration dates or password protection to shared albums (if offered by Photoprism).

## Threat: [Data Breach via Photoprism's Database](./threats/data_breach_via_photoprism's_database.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in Photoprism's database interaction layer (code within Photoprism) or exploit known vulnerabilities in the database software *if Photoprism doesn't properly secure its database access*.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of user data, including metadata, user accounts, and potentially file paths managed by Photoprism. This could lead to significant data loss, identity theft, and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Database Interaction Layer, Database

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Ensure Photoprism is updated to the latest version with security patches that address database interaction vulnerabilities.
- Use strong, unique passwords for database accounts used by Photoprism.
- Restrict database access to only the Photoprism application.
- Regularly back up the database.

## Threat: [File System Access Vulnerabilities](./threats/file_system_access_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in Photoprism's file handling logic to gain unauthorized access to the underlying file system. This could involve path traversal vulnerabilities where manipulated file paths allow access outside of designated media directories *managed by Photoprism*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized reading, modification, or deletion of arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to data loss, system compromise, or privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** File Handling Module, Web Interface, API

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Ensure Photoprism is updated to the latest version with security patches addressing file handling vulnerabilities.
- Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all file paths within Photoprism's configuration and usage.
- Ensure Photoprism runs with the least necessary privileges.
- Employ operating system-level file permissions to restrict access to the media directories.

## Threat: [Malicious Media File Processing](./threats/malicious_media_file_processing.md)

**Description:** An attacker could upload specially crafted image or video files designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Photoprism's image processing libraries (used by Photoprism). This could lead to buffer overflows, remote code execution *within the Photoprism process*, or denial of service.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution allowing the attacker to potentially gain control of the server, or denial of service making the application unavailable.

**Affected Component:** Image Processing Libraries, Video Processing Libraries, Upload Handling Module

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Ensure Photoprism and its underlying image/video processing libraries are updated to the latest versions.
- Implement input validation and sanitization for uploaded media files handled by Photoprism, including format checks and size limits.
- Consider using sandboxing or containerization to isolate the media processing environment.

## Threat: [Command Injection via External Tools](./threats/command_injection_via_external_tools.md)

**Description:** If Photoprism uses external command-line tools for tasks like video transcoding, an attacker could exploit insufficient input sanitization *within Photoprism's code* to inject malicious commands that are executed on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server.

**Affected Component:** External Tool Integration Modules, Video Processing Modules

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Avoid using external tools if possible within Photoprism's development.
- Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any data passed to external commands by Photoprism.
- Use parameterized commands or libraries that prevent command injection within Photoprism's code.
- Run external tools with the least necessary privileges (if applicable to Photoprism's implementation).

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate file paths provided to Photoprism, either through the web interface or API, to access files outside of the intended media directories *managed by Photoprism*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.

**Affected Component:** File Handling Module, Web Interface, API

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Ensure Photoprism is updated to the latest version with security patches addressing path traversal vulnerabilities.
- Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all file paths handled by Photoprism.
- Use canonicalization techniques to resolve symbolic links and relative paths within Photoprism's file handling.
- Enforce strict access controls based on the principle of least privilege for Photoprism's file system operations.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration Options](./threats/insecure_configuration_options.md)

**Description:**  Leaving default credentials *for Photoprism itself*, enabling insecure protocols *within Photoprism's configuration*, or misconfiguring access controls *within Photoprism* could create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application, data breaches, or system compromise depending on the misconfiguration of Photoprism.

**Affected Component:** Configuration Management, Authentication Module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Change all default credentials for Photoprism immediately after installation.
