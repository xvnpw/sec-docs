# Attack Surface Analysis for photoprism/photoprism

## Attack Surface: [Malicious File Upload](./attack_surfaces/malicious_file_upload.md)

*   **Description:** The application accepts file uploads, and vulnerabilities in file processing can be exploited.
    *   **PhotoPrism Contribution:** PhotoPrism's core functionality revolves around ingesting and processing various image and video file formats. This inherently introduces a significant attack surface due to the complexity of file parsing and the potential for embedded malicious content.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted TIFF file with a directory traversal vulnerability. When PhotoPrism attempts to process this file, it writes data to an unintended location on the server's file system, potentially overwriting critical system files or sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, allowing the attacker to gain control of the system, access sensitive data, or disrupt services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) rather than just extensions. Utilize secure, well-maintained file processing libraries and keep them updated. Employ sandboxing or containerization for file processing tasks to limit the impact of potential exploits. Implement robust input sanitization to prevent path traversal or other injection attacks during file handling.
        *   **Users:** Ensure only trusted users have upload privileges. Regularly monitor server logs for unusual file upload activity or processing errors. Consider using a dedicated, isolated environment for running PhotoPrism.

## Attack Surface: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/image_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in image processing libraries used by the application.
    *   **PhotoPrism Contribution:** PhotoPrism relies heavily on image processing libraries (like ImageMagick or its forks) for core functionalities like thumbnail generation, format conversion, and metadata extraction. Exploitable vulnerabilities in these libraries directly impact PhotoPrism's security.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PNG image that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the image processing library used by PhotoPrism. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the PhotoPrism process.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Prioritize keeping all image processing libraries updated to the latest versions with security patches. Implement resource limits for image processing operations to prevent denial-of-service attacks. Consider using memory-safe alternatives to vulnerable libraries where feasible. Employ techniques like fuzzing to identify potential vulnerabilities in the image processing pipeline.
        *   **Users:**  Keep PhotoPrism updated to benefit from security updates to its dependencies. Monitor server resource usage for unusual spikes during image processing, which could indicate an attempted exploit.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (if direct queries are used)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__if_direct_queries_are_used_.md)

*   **Description:** Improperly sanitized user input is used in database queries.
    *   **PhotoPrism Contribution:** While PhotoPrism likely uses an ORM for most database interactions, there might be instances of direct SQL queries for specific, potentially complex, operations or custom features. If these queries aren't carefully constructed, they can be vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Example:** A custom search feature in PhotoPrism uses a direct SQL query that concatenates user-provided search terms without proper sanitization. An attacker crafts a malicious search term that injects SQL code, allowing them to bypass authentication and retrieve all user credentials from the database.
    *   **Impact:** Data Breach, Data Manipulation, potential for complete compromise of the application's data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Strictly avoid constructing SQL queries by concatenating user-supplied input. Always use parameterized queries or ORM features with proper escaping. Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data that might be used in database interactions. Regularly audit the codebase for instances of direct SQL queries.
        *   **Users:**  This is primarily a developer concern. Ensure PhotoPrism is regularly updated, as updates often include fixes for SQL injection vulnerabilities. Avoid using custom or unverified plugins or extensions that might introduce vulnerable SQL queries.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/insecure_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** API endpoints lack proper authentication, authorization, or input validation.
    *   **PhotoPrism Contribution:** PhotoPrism exposes an API to enable interaction with its features programmatically. Vulnerabilities in the security of these API endpoints can allow unauthorized access or manipulation of data.
    *   **Example:** An API endpoint for modifying album metadata lacks proper authorization checks. An attacker could potentially discover the API endpoint and, without proper authentication, modify the metadata of any album, including private ones.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, data deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints. Use established security protocols like OAuth 2.0 or API keys with proper validation and rotation. Validate all input received by API endpoints to prevent injection attacks. Implement rate limiting and request throttling to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about granting API access to third-party applications. Regularly review and revoke API keys or tokens that are no longer needed. Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.
