## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using Photoprism - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access and control over the application utilizing Photoprism, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further exploitation of the underlying system.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application Using Photoprism
    * Exploit Photoprism Image Processing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Upload Malicious Image File
            * Trigger Buffer Overflow in Image Decoder [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Specific Image Codecs (e.g., libjpeg, libpng) [CRITICAL NODE]
    * Exploit Photoprism Database Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]
        * SQL Injection through Metadata or Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Manipulate Search Queries with Malicious SQL
    * Exploit Photoprism's External Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Libraries (e.g., Go libraries) [CRITICAL NODE]

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Exploit Photoprism Image Processing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* This represents a high-risk entry point because successful exploitation of vulnerabilities within Photoprism's image processing capabilities can directly lead to severe consequences, most notably code execution on the server. Attackers target the way Photoprism handles and processes image files.

    * **Upload Malicious Image File:** This is the initial step in exploiting image processing vulnerabilities. Attackers craft or modify image files to contain malicious data or structures that trigger flaws in the processing logic.

        * **Trigger Buffer Overflow in Image Decoder [CRITICAL NODE]:**  When Photoprism attempts to decode a malicious image, a buffer overflow can occur. This happens when the image data exceeds the allocated buffer size, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions. Attackers can carefully craft the image to overwrite critical data or inject and execute malicious code.

        * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Specific Image Codecs (e.g., libjpeg, libpng) [CRITICAL NODE]:** Photoprism relies on external libraries like `libjpeg` and `libpng` to handle different image formats. These libraries themselves can have known vulnerabilities. Attackers can craft images that exploit these specific vulnerabilities within the codecs, potentially leading to code execution or other undesirable outcomes.

**2. Exploit Photoprism Database Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* This path is high-risk due to the potential for gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database or manipulating that data. If Photoprism interacts with a database without proper security measures, it becomes vulnerable to injection attacks.

    * **SQL Injection through Metadata or Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]:** This occurs when an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into database queries through user-supplied metadata associated with images or through configuration parameters that are not properly sanitized.

        * **Manipulate Search Queries with Malicious SQL:**  A common form of SQL injection where attackers craft malicious input that is used in search queries. By injecting SQL commands, they can bypass intended logic, retrieve unauthorized data, modify existing data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

**3. Exploit Photoprism's External Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* This represents a significant risk because Photoprism, like many applications, relies on external libraries and dependencies to provide various functionalities. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.

    * **Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Libraries (e.g., Go libraries) [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers often target known vulnerabilities (identified by CVEs - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in the libraries that Photoprism uses. If Photoprism uses an outdated or vulnerable version of a library, attackers can leverage publicly available exploits to compromise the application. This can lead to various outcomes, including code execution, data breaches, or denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability.
