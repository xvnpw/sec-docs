Here are the high and critical threats directly involving PhotoPrism:

*   **Threat:** Malicious File Upload Leading to Remote Code Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file (e.g., TIFF, JPEG) that exploits a vulnerability in one of PhotoPrism's underlying image processing libraries (like ImageMagick or ExifTool). Upon processing this file, the vulnerability is triggered, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting PhotoPrism.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server hosting PhotoPrism, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and further attacks on other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Image processing pipeline, specifically the libraries used for decoding and processing image files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update PhotoPrism and all its dependencies, including image processing libraries, to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Consider running PhotoPrism's image processing in a sandboxed environment with restricted permissions to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
        *   Implement file type validation and sanitization before passing files to PhotoPrism for processing.

*   **Threat:** Metadata Injection Leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads an image file with malicious JavaScript code embedded within its metadata (e.g., EXIF, IPTC, XMP). When PhotoPrism extracts and displays this metadata, the malicious script is executed in the context of a user's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of user accounts interacting with the application, potential data theft, and defacement of the application's user interface.
    *   **Affected Component:** Metadata extraction module and the component responsible for displaying metadata to users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and encode metadata extracted by PhotoPrism before displaying it to users.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
        *   Consider disabling the display of certain metadata fields that are more prone to injection attacks.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via Filename Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a file with a carefully crafted filename containing path traversal characters (e.g., `../../`). If PhotoPrism does not properly sanitize filenames during storage, the file could be saved outside of the intended storage directory, potentially overwriting system files or other sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, system instability, or potential privilege escalation if critical system files are overwritten.
    *   **Affected Component:** File upload and storage module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize uploaded filenames, removing or replacing any path traversal characters.
        *   Ensure that the application has appropriate permissions to write only to the designated storage directory.
        *   Implement checks to prevent writing files outside the intended directory structure.
