## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Exploit ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick Vulnerabilities (if used) [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_exploit_imagemagickgraphicsmagick_vulnerabilities__if_used___high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft malicious image files that exploit known vulnerabilities in ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick (if used by PhotoPrism for image processing). These vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to take control of the server.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Known vulnerabilities exist, but require specific configurations/inputs and PhotoPrism to use these libraries)
*   **Impact:** High (RCE, file disclosure, complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding a vulnerable configuration and crafting a malicious image, or using existing exploit code)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium-High (Exploit development or use of existing exploits)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (IDS might detect known exploits, but custom or zero-day exploits are harder to detect)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Exploit FFmpeg/libav Vulnerabilities (if used for video) [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_exploit_ffmpeglibav_vulnerabilities__if_used_for_video___high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to 1.1.1, but targets vulnerabilities in FFmpeg or libav (if used for video processing). Attackers craft malicious video files to trigger RCE or other exploits.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Known vulnerabilities exist, but require specific configurations/inputs and PhotoPrism to use these libraries)
*   **Impact:** High (RCE, file disclosure, complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding a vulnerable configuration and crafting a malicious video, or using existing exploit code)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium-High (Exploit development or use of existing exploits)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (IDS might detect known exploits, but custom or zero-day exploits are harder to detect)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3 Exploit PhotoPrism's Custom Image/Video Handling Logic [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_exploit_photoprism's_custom_imagevideo_handling_logic__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This targets vulnerabilities *within* PhotoPrism's own code that handles image and video processing, rather than relying on external libraries. This is more difficult for an attacker but potentially very impactful.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (Depends on the quality of PhotoPrism's code; less likely than exploiting well-known libraries, but still a possibility)
*   **Impact:** High (RCE, file disclosure, data corruption, complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** High (Requires code review, vulnerability discovery, and potentially exploit development)
*   **Skill Level:** High (Reverse engineering, vulnerability research, exploit development)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High (Custom code vulnerabilities are less likely to be detected by standard tools)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Exploit Weaknesses in PhotoPrism's Authentication Mechanism [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_exploit_weaknesses_in_photoprism's_authentication_mechanism__high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers find and exploit flaws in how PhotoPrism handles user authentication (login, session management, password reset, etc.). This could involve bypassing authentication entirely, hijacking user sessions, or gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Assuming standard security practices are followed, but custom implementations can be vulnerable)
*   **Impact:** High (Full account takeover, access to all user data)
*   **Effort:** Medium-High (Requires finding flaws in the authentication flow, potentially involving code review)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium-High (Web application security testing, understanding of authentication protocols)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Failed login attempts can be logged, but sophisticated attacks might bypass detection)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 Bypass Authorization Checks [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_bypass_authorization_checks__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers find ways to access resources (e.g., private albums, user data) that they should not have permission to access, even after successfully authenticating. This exploits flaws in PhotoPrism's authorization logic.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (Depends on the complexity of PhotoPrism's authorization logic and how well it's implemented)
*   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized access to private data, potential for privilege escalation)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding the authorization model and finding flaws, potentially involving code review)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium (Web application security testing, understanding of authorization models)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Access logs might reveal unauthorized access, but correlation with legitimate activity can be difficult)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.5.1 Exploit vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by PhotoPrism. [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_5_1_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries_used_by_photoprism___high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** PhotoPrism, like most software, relies on external libraries.  Attackers target known vulnerabilities in these libraries to gain control.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common attack vector; depends on the update frequency of dependencies and the presence of known vulnerabilities)
*   **Impact:** High (Varies depending on the vulnerable library; could lead to RCE, data breaches, complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium (Publicly known vulnerabilities are easy to exploit using existing tools; zero-days require more effort)
*   **Skill Level:** Low-High (Varies depending on the complexity of the exploit; using public exploits is low-skill, developing zero-days is high-skill)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Vulnerability scanners can detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Trick a user into sharing a private album or revealing their credentials. [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_trick_a_user_into_sharing_a_private_album_or_revealing_their_credentials___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers use social engineering techniques (phishing, pretexting, etc.) to manipulate PhotoPrism users into granting them access or revealing sensitive information.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Humans are often the weakest link in security)
*   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized access to private data, potential for account takeover)
*   **Effort:** Low (Social engineering can be simple and require minimal technical skill)
*   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium (Depends on the sophistication of the social engineering attack)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very High (Difficult to detect with technical measures; relies on user awareness and training)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1 Attempt to guess user passwords or use leaked credentials. [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1_attempt_to_guess_user_passwords_or_use_leaked_credentials___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers use automated tools to try many passwords (brute-force) or use credentials stolen from other breaches (credential stuffing) to gain access to PhotoPrism accounts.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on password strength, account lockout policies, and whether users reuse passwords)
*   **Impact:** High (Account takeover, access to all user data)
*   **Effort:** Low (Automated tools are readily available)
*   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic scripting and use of readily available tools)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Rate limiting and account lockout can mitigate this, but sophisticated attacks might bypass these measures)

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1 Use default admin credentials if not changed. [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_use_default_admin_credentials_if_not_changed___high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** If PhotoPrism has default administrator credentials, and the user fails to change them after installation, an attacker can easily gain full control.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (Depends on user awareness and whether the installation process enforces a password change)
*   **Impact:** High (Full administrative access, complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Very Low (Trivial; simply trying the default credentials)
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low (No skill required)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Login attempts with default credentials can be logged and easily identified)
