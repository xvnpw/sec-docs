# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for photoprism/photoprism

## Mitigation Strategy: [Harden Default Settings (PhotoPrism Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/harden_default_settings__photoprism_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Review and Secure PhotoPrism Configuration

**Description:**
1.  **Review All Settings:**  Carefully examine all PhotoPrism configuration options (in `docker-compose.yml`, environment variables, or the settings UI). This is a direct interaction with PhotoPrism's configuration mechanism.
2.  **Change Default Password:**  Immediately change the default `PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to a strong, unique password. This is a direct configuration change within PhotoPrism.
3.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:**  Disable features that are not needed, such as WebDAV (`PHOTOPRISM_DISABLE_WEBDAV`), the settings UI (`PHOTOPRISM_DISABLE_SETTINGS`), or experimental features. These are direct PhotoPrism configuration flags.
4.  **Enable Security Features:**  Enable security-relevant features provided by PhotoPrism, such as HTTP compression (`PHOTOPRISM_HTTP_COMPRESSION`).
5.  **Disable Debug Mode:**  Ensure `PHOTOPRISM_DEBUG` is set to `false` in production. This is a direct PhotoPrism setting.
6.  **Read-Only Mode (if applicable):**  If appropriate, run PhotoPrism in read-only mode (`PHOTOPRISM_READONLY`) to limit the impact of potential exploits. This is a core PhotoPrism operational mode.
7.  **Document Configuration:**  Keep a record of all configuration changes, ideally in a version-controlled file. This relates directly to managing PhotoPrism's configuration.
8. **Configure Indexing:** Use `PHOTOPRISM_INIT` and related settings to control how and when indexing occurs. This can help mitigate DoS attacks targeting the indexing process.
9. **Configure Face Recognition:** If using face recognition, carefully configure `PHOTOPRISM_FACES_DETECT` and related settings. Consider disabling it (`PHOTOPRISM_DISABLE_FACES`) if not strictly necessary.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):**  Changing the default password prevents attackers from easily gaining administrative access *to PhotoPrism*.
*   **Exploitation of Unnecessary Features (Severity: Medium/High):**  Disabling unused *PhotoPrism* features reduces the attack surface.
*   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium/Low):**  Disabling debug mode prevents sensitive information from being exposed *by PhotoPrism*.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Read-only mode limits the potential damage from a successful exploit *within PhotoPrism*.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Controlled indexing can mitigate DoS attacks.
*   **Privacy Violations (Severity: Medium/High):** Careful configuration of face recognition features mitigates privacy risks.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low/Negligible).
*   **Exploitation of Unnecessary Features:** Risk reduced (variable, depending on the feature).
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced (from Medium/Low to Low/Negligible).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced (from High to Medium/Low).
*   **DoS:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).
*   **Privacy Violations:** Risk reduced (variable, depending on configuration).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   The default admin password has been changed.
*   Debug mode is disabled.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   WebDAV is enabled, but not used.
*   The settings UI is accessible in production.
*   No comprehensive review of all configuration options has been documented.
*   Read-only mode is not used (and may not be appropriate for the use case).
*   Indexing and face recognition settings are at their defaults.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Database Configuration (Interacting with PhotoPrism's Database)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_database_configuration__interacting_with_photoprism's_database_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for Database Access (as configured for PhotoPrism)

**Description:**
1.  **Create Dedicated User (Through PhotoPrism Config):** When configuring PhotoPrism (e.g., in `docker-compose.yml`), specify the credentials for a dedicated database user.  PhotoPrism *uses* these credentials, so this is a direct interaction.
2.  **Grant Minimal Privileges (External, but for PhotoPrism):**  Although the *granting* of privileges happens in the database itself, it's done *specifically for the user that PhotoPrism will use*. This is directly related to PhotoPrism's operation.
3.  **Password Security (Through PhotoPrism Config):**  The database password is provided to PhotoPrism through its configuration.  Ensure this is a strong password and handled securely.
4.  **Connection Security (Through PhotoPrism Config):** PhotoPrism's configuration (e.g., `PHOTOPRISM_DATABASE_DSN`) determines how it connects to the database. Ensure this configuration specifies a secure connection (e.g., using TLS).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **SQL Injection (Severity: High):**  Limits the impact of a successful SQL injection attack *against PhotoPrism*.
*   **Data Breach (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized data access or modification if the database credentials *used by PhotoPrism* are compromised.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Prevents an attacker from gaining higher-level database privileges *through PhotoPrism*.

**Impact:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Medium/Low).
*   **Data Breach:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Medium/Low).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low/Negligible).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   A dedicated database user is specified in the PhotoPrism configuration.
*   The database connection string specifies TLS.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   The database user (as configured for PhotoPrism) has more privileges than strictly necessary.
*   The database password is not stored in a dedicated secrets management system (it's in the `docker-compose.yml` file).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Storage Configuration (As Configured for PhotoPrism)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_storage_configuration__as_configured_for_photoprism_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Originals Storage and Access Control (via PhotoPrism settings)

**Description:**
1. **Dedicated Storage (Configured in PhotoPrism):** PhotoPrism's configuration (e.g., `PHOTOPRISM_ORIGINALS_PATH`) specifies where original photos are stored. This is a *direct* PhotoPrism setting. Ensure this path is secure.
2. **Network Storage Security (Configured in PhotoPrism):** If using network storage, PhotoPrism's configuration (e.g., environment variables for S3, Backblaze B2) determines how it connects. Ensure these settings are secure (access keys, secret keys, etc.). This is a direct interaction with PhotoPrism's storage mechanism.

**Threats Mitigated:**
     * **Unauthorized Access to Originals (Severity: High):**  Proper configuration within PhotoPrism ensures that it accesses originals from a secure location.
     * **Data Tampering (Severity: High):** Limits the ability of attackers to modify originals *via PhotoPrism*.

**Impact:**
    * **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low/Negligible).
    * **Data Tampering:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low/Negligible).

**Currently Implemented:**
    * `PHOTOPRISM_ORIGINALS_PATH` is set to a dedicated directory.

**Missing Implementation:**
    * No specific configuration for network storage security (assuming local storage is used). The configuration could be more explicit about permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitoring and Logging (Using PhotoPrism's Logs)](./mitigation_strategies/monitoring_and_logging__using_photoprism's_logs_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize PhotoPrism's Logging

**Description:**
1.  **Enable Detailed Logging:** Configure PhotoPrism (via environment variables or `docker-compose.yml`) to produce detailed logs. This might involve setting the log level appropriately.
2.  **Monitor Logs:** Regularly review PhotoPrism's logs for suspicious activity, errors, or warnings. This is a direct interaction with PhotoPrism's output.
3. **Centralized Logging (Optional, but Recommended):** Integrate PhotoPrism's logs with a centralized logging system. This makes it easier to analyze logs and set up alerts.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Various (Severity: Variable):**  Logging helps detect and investigate security incidents, including unauthorized access attempts, errors that might indicate vulnerabilities, and other suspicious behavior.

**Impact:**
*   **Detection and Response:** Improves the ability to detect and respond to security incidents. Does not *prevent* incidents, but reduces their impact by enabling faster response.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   PhotoPrism's default logging is enabled.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Logs are not reviewed regularly.
*   No centralized logging system is in place.
*   The log level could be more verbose.
