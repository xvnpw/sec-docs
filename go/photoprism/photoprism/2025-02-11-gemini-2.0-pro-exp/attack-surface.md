# Attack Surface Analysis for photoprism/photoprism

## Attack Surface: [1. Image/Video Processing Exploits](./attack_surfaces/1__imagevideo_processing_exploits.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in image/video processing libraries used by PhotoPrism.
    *   **How PhotoPrism Contributes:** PhotoPrism relies heavily on external libraries (like `libvips`, `ffmpeg`) for image and video processing, making it directly susceptible to vulnerabilities in these libraries.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted JPEG file that exploits a known buffer overflow vulnerability in `libvips`, leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), potential information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Developers):** Regularly update all image/video processing libraries to the latest patched versions. Implement robust input validation and sanitization *before* passing data to these libraries. Consider using sandboxing or containerization to isolate the processing components. Use a dependency vulnerability scanner.

## Attack Surface: [2. Resource Exhaustion (Processing)](./attack_surfaces/2__resource_exhaustion__processing_.md)

**Description:** Attackers overwhelm PhotoPrism's processing capabilities, leading to denial of service.
    *   **How PhotoPrism Contributes:** PhotoPrism's core function is processing large numbers of images and videos, making it inherently vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads thousands of extremely high-resolution images or videos simultaneously, consuming all available CPU and memory, making PhotoPrism unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential increased infrastructure costs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Developers):** Implement rate limiting on uploads and processing. Set reasonable limits on file sizes and resolutions. Implement resource monitoring and alerting. Consider using a queue system to manage processing tasks.

## Attack Surface: [3. Metadata Extraction Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/3__metadata_extraction_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in libraries used for extracting metadata from images and videos.
    *   **How PhotoPrism Contributes:** PhotoPrism extracts and uses metadata extensively, making it a potential target for attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in metadata parsing.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads an image with maliciously crafted EXIF data that triggers a vulnerability in the metadata extraction library, leading to RCE or DoS.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Developers):** Similar to image processing, keep metadata extraction libraries updated. Implement robust input validation and sanitization before parsing metadata. Consider sandboxing the metadata extraction process.

## Attack Surface: [4. Authentication Bypass (Multi-User Mode)](./attack_surfaces/4__authentication_bypass__multi-user_mode_.md)

**Description:** Attackers bypass authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to photos or administrative functions.
    *   **How PhotoPrism Contributes:** If multi-user mode is enabled, PhotoPrism's authentication and authorization logic becomes a critical attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw in the session management logic to hijack another user's session and access their private photos.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, potential privilege escalation, account takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Developers):** Implement strong password policies (length, complexity, etc.). Use well-established and secure authentication libraries. Enforce proper session management (secure cookies, short session timeouts, etc.). Implement robust authorization checks to ensure users can only access resources they are permitted to. Regularly audit authentication and authorization code.

## Attack Surface: [5. WebDAV Exploits (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/5__webdav_exploits__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in PhotoPrism's WebDAV implementation.
    *   **How PhotoPrism Contributes:** If WebDAV is enabled, PhotoPrism exposes a WebDAV interface, which becomes part of the attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses a known WebDAV vulnerability to upload malicious files or gain unauthorized access to the file system.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized file access, file modification, potential RCE (depending on the specific WebDAV vulnerability).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Developers):** Keep the WebDAV implementation updated. Thoroughly test the WebDAV interface for vulnerabilities. Consider offering configuration options to restrict WebDAV access (e.g., read-only mode, IP whitelisting).
