Okay, let's create a design document for the PhotoPrism project, focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

PhotoPrism is an AI-Powered Photos App for the Decentralized Web.  It's designed to allow users to organize, browse, and share their photo collections.  Given its open-source nature and focus on self-hosting, the business posture can be characterized as follows:

Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a user-friendly, private, and secure alternative to commercial cloud-based photo management solutions.
*   Empower users to control their own data and maintain their privacy.
*   Offer a robust and extensible platform that can be adapted to various user needs and environments.
*   Foster a community-driven development model.
*   Ensure the long-term sustainability of the project.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data breaches leading to unauthorized access to users' private photos.
*   Data loss due to software bugs, hardware failures, or user error.
*   Reputational damage resulting from security vulnerabilities or privacy violations.
*   Inability to scale the platform to meet growing user demand.
*   Lack of adoption due to complexity or poor user experience.
*   Compromise of the build and distribution pipeline, leading to the distribution of malicious software.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Authentication: User authentication via username/password and optional multi-factor authentication (referenced in documentation and code).
*   security control: Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions (referenced in documentation).
*   security control: Input Validation: Validation of user inputs to prevent common web vulnerabilities (inferred from code and best practices, needs more specific documentation).
*   security control: HTTPS: Support for HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and server (documented).
*   security control: Docker: Containerization using Docker to isolate the application and its dependencies (Dockerfile).
*   security control: Go security features: Use of the Go programming language, which offers some built-in security features like memory safety (inherent to the language).
*   security control: Regular Updates: Frequent releases and updates to address bugs and security vulnerabilities (observed in the repository).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party libraries: The project depends on various third-party libraries, which may introduce vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Self-hosting complexity: Self-hosting requires technical expertise and introduces the risk of misconfiguration.
*   accepted risk: Limited resources for security audits: As an open-source project, resources for comprehensive security audits may be limited.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.
*   Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) to ensure that fetched resources haven't been tampered with.
*   Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS connections.
*   Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits.
*   Establish a vulnerability disclosure program.
*   Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.
*   Provide detailed security documentation and guidelines for users.
*   Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for better supply chain security.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Strong password policies (length, complexity).
    *   Secure storage of passwords (hashing and salting).
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks (account lockout).
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (TOTP).
*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control to photos and albums.
    *   Ability to share photos with specific users or groups.
    *   Administrative roles with elevated privileges.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Validation of all user inputs (filenames, metadata, search queries).
    *   Protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   Protection against SQL injection attacks.
    *   Protection against command injection attacks.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong encryption algorithms (AES, TLS).
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Protection of data at rest (optional, depending on user configuration).

## BUILD

The PhotoPrism build process leverages Go modules and Docker.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"]
    SourceCode["Source Code (GitHub)"]
    GoBuild["Go Build"]
    DockerBuild["Docker Build"]
    DockerImage["Docker Image (Docker Hub/GHCR)"]
    Tests["Tests (Unit, Integration)"]

    Developer -- Commits --> SourceCode
    SourceCode -- Fetched by --> GoBuild
    GoBuild -- Compiles --> Tests
    Tests -- Run --> GoBuild
    GoBuild -- Produces --> Binary["Binary"]
    Binary -- Included in --> DockerBuild
    DockerBuild -- Builds --> DockerImage
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers commit code to the GitHub repository.
2.  The `go build` command is used to compile the Go code, fetching dependencies using Go modules.
3.  Unit and integration tests are run as part of the build process.
4.  A Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image containing the compiled binary and other necessary files.
5.  The Docker image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry).

Security Controls:

*   security control: Go Modules: Use of Go modules for dependency management, including vulnerability scanning with tools like `govulncheck`.
*   security control: Automated Build: Use of a CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) to automate the build process.
*   security control: Testing: Automated unit and integration tests to identify bugs and vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Docker Best Practices: Use of Docker best practices (e.g., multi-stage builds, non-root user) to create secure Docker images.
*   security control: Image Scanning: Scanning of Docker images for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy or Clair.
*   security control: Signed Commits: Developers should sign their commits using GPG keys to ensure code integrity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   User authentication and authorization.
*   Photo storage and retrieval.
*   Image processing and analysis.
*   Data backup and recovery.

Data Sensitivity:

*   User credentials (passwords, API keys): Highly sensitive.
*   Photo files: Highly sensitive (personal and potentially private).
*   Photo metadata (location, date, time, faces): Sensitive.
*   User profile information: Sensitive.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What are the specific requirements for data retention and deletion?
*   Are there any compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)?
*   What are the expected user base and storage requirements?
*   What level of support is provided for external authentication providers?
*   What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by users or researchers?
*   Are there any plans to implement end-to-end encryption?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: Users are responsible for securing their own infrastructure when self-hosting.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The project follows secure coding practices, but a formal security audit has not been conducted.
*   DESIGN: The Docker Compose deployment model is the primary deployment method.
*   DESIGN: External storage is configured securely by the user.
*   DESIGN: Regular backups are performed by the user.
