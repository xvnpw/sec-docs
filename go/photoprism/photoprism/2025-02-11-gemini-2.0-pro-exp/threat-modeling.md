# Threat Model Analysis for photoprism/photoprism

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Private Content (Direct PhotoPrism Vulnerability)](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_private_content__direct_photoprism_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Private Content (Direct)
*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to photos/videos marked as private within PhotoPrism due to a *vulnerability within PhotoPrism's own access control logic*. This is *not* due to misconfiguration, but rather a flaw in the code that enforces permissions.  For example, a bug in the `internal/entity` or `internal/api` packages might allow an attacker to bypass checks for user roles or album ownership when requesting a file or thumbnail.  The attacker might exploit this directly through the PhotoPrism web interface or API.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive personal information.
    *   Reputational damage to the user and the PhotoPrism project.
    *   Legal and regulatory consequences (e.g., GDPR violations).
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   PhotoPrism's core access control logic (specifically within `internal/entity` and `internal/api` packages, functions related to user authentication, session validation, and authorization checks for accessing albums and media files).  This *excludes* configuration errors.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Rigorous code review and security audits of the access control implementation, focusing on potential bypass vulnerabilities.
        *   Extensive unit and integration testing of all access control functions, including edge cases and negative tests.
        *   Use of static analysis tools to identify potential security flaws in the access control logic.
        *   Fuzz testing of API endpoints related to accessing media files and albums.
        *   Implement a robust vulnerability disclosure program and respond promptly to security reports.

## Threat: [Sensitive Metadata Exposure (Bypass of PhotoPrism Controls)](./threats/sensitive_metadata_exposure__bypass_of_photoprism_controls_.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Metadata Exposure (Bypass)
*   **Description:** An attacker accesses sensitive metadata (EXIF, GPS, etc.) *despite PhotoPrism's configured privacy settings* due to a vulnerability in how PhotoPrism handles metadata access.  This is *not* about missing configuration, but a flaw in the code that should be enforcing restrictions. For example, a bug in the `internal/api` package might allow an attacker to retrieve metadata fields that should be hidden based on user roles or configuration.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Disclosure of private information (location, time, device details).
    *   Potential for tracking or profiling users.
    *   Increased risk of targeted attacks.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   PhotoPrism's metadata handling and API logic (specifically within `internal/photoprism`, `internal/entity`, and `internal/api` packages, functions related to metadata access control and API endpoints that expose metadata). This *excludes* cases where metadata stripping is not configured.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Thorough code review and security audits of the metadata handling logic, focusing on potential bypass vulnerabilities.
        *   Ensure that access control checks are consistently applied to all metadata fields, regardless of how they are accessed (e.g., through the API, web interface, or internal functions).
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks through malicious metadata.
        *   Fuzz testing of API endpoints that expose metadata.

## Threat: [API Abuse Leading to Data Leakage (PhotoPrism API Vulnerability)](./threats/api_abuse_leading_to_data_leakage__photoprism_api_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Threat:** API Abuse Leading to Data Leakage (Direct Vulnerability)
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a *vulnerability within PhotoPrism's API implementation* to gain unauthorized access to data. This is *not* about weak API keys or lack of rate limiting, but a flaw in the API code itself. For example, a vulnerability in the `internal/api` package might allow an attacker to bypass authentication or authorization checks, inject malicious input to manipulate queries, or access data they should not be able to see.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access to photos, videos, and metadata.
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   Potential for further attacks on the system.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   PhotoPrism's API endpoints (primarily within the `internal/api` package).
    *   API authentication and authorization logic *within PhotoPrism*.
    *   Input validation and sanitization logic *within the API handlers*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Rigorous code review and security audits of the API implementation, focusing on potential vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP API Security Top 10).
        *   Extensive unit and integration testing of all API endpoints, including edge cases and negative tests.
        *   Use of static analysis tools to identify potential security flaws in the API code.
        *   Fuzz testing of API endpoints.
        *   Implement robust error handling to prevent information leakage through error messages.

## Threat: [Indexing/Processing DoS (Exploitable PhotoPrism Code)](./threats/indexingprocessing_dos__exploitable_photoprism_code_.md)

*   **Threat:** Indexing/Processing Denial of Service (Code Vulnerability)
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a *vulnerability in PhotoPrism's indexing or processing code* to cause a denial of service. This is *not* simply about uploading many large files, but about crafting specific files that trigger bugs or inefficiencies within PhotoPrism's image/video handling. For example, a malformed image might cause an infinite loop or excessive memory allocation within the `internal/photoprism` package's image processing functions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   System instability or crashes.
    *   Increased resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   PhotoPrism's indexing and processing pipeline (primarily within the `internal/photoprism` package, specifically functions related to image and video processing, thumbnail generation, and transcoding). This focuses on *vulnerabilities within the code itself*, not just resource limits.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Thorough code review and security audits of the image and video processing logic, focusing on potential vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, integer overflows, out-of-bounds reads/writes).
        *   Extensive unit and integration testing of all processing functions, including edge cases and negative tests with malformed input.
        *   Use of static analysis tools to identify potential security flaws in the processing code.
        *   Fuzz testing of the image and video processing functions.
        *   Implement robust error handling and resource limits to prevent crashes or excessive resource consumption.

## Threat: [Exploitation of PhotoPrism Vulnerabilities (Direct Code Execution)](./threats/exploitation_of_photoprism_vulnerabilities__direct_code_execution_.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of PhotoPrism Vulnerabilities (Code Execution)
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a *previously unknown vulnerability in PhotoPrism's codebase* to achieve *arbitrary code execution* on the server running PhotoPrism. This is the most severe type of vulnerability, allowing the attacker to potentially take full control of the PhotoPrism instance. This could involve vulnerabilities in any part of PhotoPrism's code, including the web interface, API, or internal processing logic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete compromise of the PhotoPrism instance.
    *   Data breaches (all data accessible).
    *   Potential for further attacks on the system and network.
    *   Installation of malware or backdoors.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   Potentially any part of the PhotoPrism codebase.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

        *   Follow secure coding practices throughout the entire development lifecycle.
        *   Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing, specifically looking for code execution vulnerabilities.
        *   Use a combination of static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a robust vulnerability disclosure program and respond promptly to security reports.
        *   Keep all dependencies up-to-date and regularly scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Minimize the attack surface by disabling unnecessary features and components.

## Threat: [Insecure Communication (Within PhotoPrism or its Defaults)](./threats/insecure_communication__within_photoprism_or_its_defaults_.md)

* **Threat:** Insecure Communication (Internal or Default)
* **Description:** PhotoPrism itself, or its default configuration, uses insecure communication (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS) *internally* or for its default setup. This is *not* about the external application's connection to PhotoPrism, but about PhotoPrism's own internal communication or default settings. For example, if PhotoPrism's default configuration uses HTTP for communication between its internal components, or if it doesn't enforce HTTPS by default.
* **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive data (photos, videos, metadata, internal API calls) if an attacker gains access to the network.
    *   Man-in-the-middle attacks *within* the PhotoPrism deployment.
* **Affected Component:**
    *   PhotoPrism's internal communication channels.
    *   Default configuration files (`config/options.yml` and related).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS by default for all internal and external communication.
        *   Use secure protocols for communication between internal components (e.g., within a Docker network).
        *   Provide clear documentation on how to configure secure communication.
        *   Reject insecure connections by default.
        *   Use strong cryptographic ciphers and protocols.
