Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on password guessing and credential stuffing against PhotoPrism, presented in Markdown format:

# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Password Guessing and Credential Stuffing (2.3.1)

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack path "2.3.1 Attempt to guess user passwords or use leaked credentials" within the PhotoPrism application's attack tree.  This analysis aims to:

*   Identify specific vulnerabilities within PhotoPrism that could be exploited by this attack.
*   Assess the effectiveness of existing security controls.
*   Propose concrete, actionable recommendations to mitigate the risk.
*   Understand the attacker's perspective and potential attack vectors.
*   Quantify the residual risk after implementing mitigations.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following aspects of PhotoPrism:

*   **Authentication Mechanisms:**  The login process, password storage, session management, and any related APIs.
*   **Account Lockout Policies:**  The configuration and enforcement of account lockout after failed login attempts.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  The presence and effectiveness of rate limiting on login attempts.
*   **Password Reset Functionality:**  The security of the password reset process, as it can be a target for attackers.
*   **User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX):**  How the UI/UX might inadvertently encourage weak passwords or insecure practices.
*   **Dependencies:**  Any third-party libraries or services used for authentication that might introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** The extent to which login attempts (successful and failed) are logged and monitored.
*   **Configuration Options:** Default settings and available configuration options related to authentication security.

This analysis *excludes* broader attacks like phishing or social engineering that might lead to credential compromise *outside* of PhotoPrism itself.  It also excludes attacks targeting the underlying infrastructure (e.g., server compromise) unless directly related to the authentication process.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Examination of the PhotoPrism source code (available on GitHub) to identify potential vulnerabilities in the authentication logic.  This will involve searching for:
    *   Weak password hashing algorithms.
    *   Inadequate input validation.
    *   Lack of proper rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms.
    *   Vulnerabilities in session management.
    *   Hardcoded credentials or secrets.
    *   Use of vulnerable third-party libraries.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  Performing penetration testing against a locally deployed instance of PhotoPrism.  This will involve:
    *   Attempting brute-force attacks with common password lists.
    *   Testing credential stuffing attacks with known leaked credentials.
    *   Evaluating the effectiveness of account lockout and rate limiting.
    *   Attempting to bypass authentication mechanisms.
    *   Testing the password reset functionality for vulnerabilities.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Considering the attacker's perspective and identifying potential attack vectors and scenarios.
*   **Review of Documentation:**  Examining PhotoPrism's official documentation, including security recommendations and configuration guides.
*   **Vulnerability Database Search:**  Checking for known vulnerabilities in PhotoPrism or its dependencies in public vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD).
*   **Best Practices Review:**  Comparing PhotoPrism's security measures against industry best practices for authentication and password management (e.g., OWASP guidelines, NIST recommendations).

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 2.3.1

### 4.1. Attack Scenario Breakdown

An attacker targeting PhotoPrism via this attack path would likely follow these steps:

1.  **Target Acquisition:** Identify a PhotoPrism instance (e.g., through exposed web servers, search engines, or social media).
2.  **Credential Gathering (for credential stuffing):** Obtain lists of leaked usernames and passwords from data breaches (readily available on the dark web).
3.  **Tool Selection:** Choose an automated tool for brute-forcing or credential stuffing (e.g., Hydra, Burp Suite, custom scripts).
4.  **Attack Execution:**
    *   **Brute-Force:**  The tool systematically tries different password combinations for a known username.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:**  The tool attempts to log in using the leaked username/password pairs.
5.  **Exploitation:** If successful, the attacker gains unauthorized access to the PhotoPrism account and its associated data.

### 4.2. Vulnerability Analysis (Code Review & Dynamic Testing Findings)

This section will be populated with specific findings from the code review and dynamic testing.  For now, we'll outline potential vulnerabilities and how they relate to the attack path:

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Weak Password Hashing:**  If PhotoPrism uses an outdated or weak hashing algorithm (e.g., MD5, SHA1), it's easier for attackers to crack passwords even if they obtain a database dump.  Modern, adaptive hashing algorithms like Argon2, bcrypt, or scrypt are essential.
    *   **Code Review Focus:** Search for password hashing functions in the authentication code.  Identify the algorithm used and check for proper salt and iteration count configuration.
    *   **Dynamic Testing:**  Attempt to crack captured password hashes (if possible) using tools like John the Ripper or Hashcat.
*   **Insufficient Account Lockout:**  If PhotoPrism doesn't lock accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts, attackers can continue brute-forcing indefinitely.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine the authentication logic for account lockout mechanisms.  Check for configuration options related to lockout thresholds and durations.
    *   **Dynamic Testing:**  Repeatedly attempt to log in with incorrect credentials to test the lockout functionality.
*   **Lack of Rate Limiting:**  Without rate limiting, attackers can make a large number of login attempts in a short period, increasing the chances of success.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Look for code that limits the number of requests from a single IP address or user within a specific time frame.
    *   **Dynamic Testing:**  Use automated tools to send a high volume of login requests and observe if rate limiting is enforced.
*   **Predictable Password Reset Tokens:**  If the password reset tokens are predictable or easily guessable, attackers can hijack accounts by initiating a password reset and intercepting the token.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Analyze the code that generates password reset tokens.  Ensure they are cryptographically secure and have sufficient entropy.
    *   **Dynamic Testing:**  Attempt to guess or predict password reset tokens.
*   **Lack of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  The absence of 2FA makes it significantly easier for attackers to gain access, even with a compromised password.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Check for any implementation of 2FA (e.g., TOTP, SMS).
    *   **Dynamic Testing:**  N/A (if 2FA is not implemented).
*   **Vulnerable Dependencies:**  Third-party libraries used for authentication might have known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Identify all authentication-related dependencies and check their versions against vulnerability databases.
    *   **Dynamic Testing:**  May involve exploiting known vulnerabilities in the dependencies.
* **Session Fixation:** If session IDs are not properly handled, an attacker could potentially hijack a user's session.
    * **Code Review Focus:** Check how session IDs are generated, stored, and validated.
    * **Dynamic Testing:** Attempt to set a known session ID and see if it grants access.
* **Username Enumeration:** If the application reveals whether a username exists or not during login attempts, it can aid attackers in identifying valid usernames for brute-forcing or credential stuffing.
    * **Code Review Focus:** Analyze the error messages returned during login attempts.
    * **Dynamic Testing:** Attempt to log in with both valid and invalid usernames and observe the responses.

### 4.3. Existing Security Controls (and their effectiveness)

This section will be populated after the code review and dynamic testing.  Examples of potential existing controls and their effectiveness:

*   **Password Hashing:** (Effectiveness depends on the algorithm and configuration).
*   **Account Lockout:** (Effectiveness depends on the threshold and duration).
*   **Rate Limiting:** (Effectiveness depends on the implementation and configuration).
*   **CAPTCHA:** (Effectiveness depends on the type of CAPTCHA and the attacker's sophistication).
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** (Effectiveness depends on the level of detail and the monitoring practices).

### 4.4. Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following recommendations are made to mitigate the risk of password guessing and credential stuffing:

1.  **Strong Password Hashing:**
    *   **Implement Argon2id:** Use Argon2id with appropriate parameters (memory cost, time cost, parallelism) as the primary password hashing algorithm.  Ensure proper salting and a high iteration count.
    *   **Migrate Existing Passwords:**  Develop a plan to securely migrate existing passwords to Argon2id upon the next user login.

2.  **Robust Account Lockout:**
    *   **Implement Account Lockout:**  Lock accounts after a small number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts).
    *   **Configure Lockout Duration:**  Set a reasonable lockout duration (e.g., 30 minutes, increasing with subsequent failed attempts).
    *   **Consider IP-Based Lockout:**  Implement IP-based lockout in addition to account-based lockout to mitigate distributed attacks.

3.  **Effective Rate Limiting:**
    *   **Implement Rate Limiting:**  Limit the number of login attempts from a single IP address and/or user within a specific time window.
    *   **Use a Sliding Window:**  Employ a sliding window approach to prevent attackers from circumventing rate limits by waiting for the window to reset.
    *   **Monitor Rate Limiting Effectiveness:**  Regularly review logs to ensure rate limiting is working as expected and adjust parameters as needed.

4.  **Secure Password Reset:**
    *   **Use Cryptographically Secure Tokens:**  Generate password reset tokens using a cryptographically secure random number generator.
    *   **Set Token Expiration:**  Ensure password reset tokens expire after a short period (e.g., 1 hour).
    *   **Send Tokens via a Secure Channel:**  Send password reset tokens via email or SMS, ensuring the communication is encrypted.
    *   **Do not reveal if user exists:** Do not reveal if user exists during password reset process.

5.  **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
    *   **Implement 2FA:**  Strongly recommend implementing 2FA (e.g., TOTP, WebAuthn) to provide an additional layer of security.

6.  **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:**  Keep all third-party libraries up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Use a Dependency Checker:**  Employ a tool to automatically scan for vulnerable dependencies.

7.  **Logging and Monitoring:**
    *   **Log All Login Attempts:**  Log all login attempts (successful and failed), including timestamps, IP addresses, and usernames.
    *   **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:**  Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious login patterns (e.g., high number of failed attempts, logins from unusual locations).

8.  **User Education:**
    *   **Promote Strong Passwords:**  Educate users about the importance of strong, unique passwords.
    *   **Encourage 2FA Adoption:**  Encourage users to enable 2FA.
    *   **Warn Against Password Reuse:**  Advise users against reusing passwords across multiple websites.

9.  **Prevent Username Enumeration:**
    *   **Generic Error Messages:**  Return generic error messages for both invalid usernames and incorrect passwords (e.g., "Invalid username or password").

10. **Session Management:**
    *   **Use Secure Cookies:**  Use the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for session cookies.
    *   **Regenerate Session IDs:**  Regenerate session IDs after successful login.
    *   **Implement Session Timeout:**  Automatically log users out after a period of inactivity.

### 4.5. Residual Risk

After implementing the recommendations, the residual risk will be significantly reduced but not eliminated.  The remaining risk factors include:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  Undiscovered vulnerabilities in PhotoPrism or its dependencies could still be exploited.
*   **Sophisticated Attackers:**  Highly skilled attackers might be able to bypass some security controls.
*   **User Error:**  Users might still choose weak passwords or fall victim to phishing attacks.
*   **Compromised 2FA Devices:**  If a user's 2FA device is compromised, the attacker could gain access.

The residual risk should be regularly reassessed and addressed through ongoing security monitoring, vulnerability management, and user education.

### 4.6. Conclusion
This deep analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the attack path related to password guessing and credential stuffing against PhotoPrism. By implementing the recommendations, the development team can significantly enhance the application's security posture and protect user data from unauthorized access. Continuous monitoring, regular security assessments, and staying informed about emerging threats are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.
