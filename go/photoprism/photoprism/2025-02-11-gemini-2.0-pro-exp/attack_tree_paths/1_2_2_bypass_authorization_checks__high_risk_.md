Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the "Bypass Authorization Checks" attack tree path for PhotoPrism.

## Deep Analysis: PhotoPrism Authorization Bypass (Attack Tree Path 1.2.2)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for authorization bypass vulnerabilities within the PhotoPrism application (specifically focusing on attack tree path 1.2.2).  We aim to identify specific attack vectors, assess their feasibility, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to enhance the security posture of PhotoPrism by ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources and perform specific actions.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis will focus on the following areas within PhotoPrism:

*   **Resource Access Control:**  How PhotoPrism determines which users (or roles) can access specific photos, albums, metadata, and other resources.  This includes both the web UI and API endpoints.
*   **Session Management (Indirectly):** While authentication is handled separately, flaws in session management *after* authentication can lead to authorization bypasses.  We'll consider how session hijacking or manipulation could be used to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation:** If PhotoPrism uses RBAC, we'll examine how roles are defined, assigned, and enforced.  If a custom authorization model is used, we'll analyze its design and implementation.
*   **API Endpoints:**  API endpoints are often a prime target for authorization bypass attacks.  We'll pay close attention to how authorization is handled for each API call.
*   **Database Interactions:** How PhotoPrism queries the database to retrieve resources, and whether those queries properly incorporate authorization checks.
* **Third-party libraries:** How third-party libraries are used and if they introduce any authorization bypass vulnerabilities.

**Exclusions:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** This analysis assumes the attacker has already successfully authenticated (e.g., with stolen credentials or by exploiting a separate authentication vulnerability).  We are *not* focusing on bypassing the login process itself.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  While DoS attacks are important, they are outside the scope of this specific authorization bypass analysis.
*   **Physical Security:**  We are not considering physical access to servers or infrastructure.

**1.3 Methodology:**

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine the PhotoPrism source code (Go) to identify potential authorization flaws.  This will involve:
    *   Searching for keywords related to authorization (e.g., "permission," "role," "access," "check," "authorize," "policy").
    *   Tracing the flow of data from user input to resource access to ensure authorization checks are performed at each critical point.
    *   Analyzing the implementation of RBAC or any custom authorization logic.
    *   Identifying potential vulnerabilities like Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), broken access control logic, and improper use of authorization-related libraries.
    *   Analyzing database queries to ensure they include appropriate authorization checks.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Penetration Testing):**  We will perform manual penetration testing against a running instance of PhotoPrism.  This will involve:
    *   Creating multiple user accounts with different permission levels.
    *   Attempting to access resources that should be restricted to other users or roles.
    *   Manipulating request parameters (e.g., IDs, URLs) to try to bypass authorization checks (IDOR testing).
    *   Testing API endpoints with various payloads and headers to identify authorization vulnerabilities.
    *   Using browser developer tools to inspect network traffic and identify potential attack vectors.
    *   Using automated vulnerability scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to identify common web application vulnerabilities that could lead to authorization bypass.

3.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use threat modeling techniques to systematically identify potential attack scenarios and assess their likelihood and impact.

4.  **Documentation Review:**  We will review any available PhotoPrism documentation related to security, authorization, and access control.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.2.2 (Bypass Authorization Checks)

Based on the methodology, we'll break down the analysis into specific attack vectors and mitigation strategies:

**2.1 Attack Vectors:**

*   **2.1.1 Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**
    *   **Description:**  Attackers manipulate direct references to objects (e.g., photo IDs, album IDs, user IDs) in URLs or API requests to access resources they shouldn't have access to.  For example, changing `/photos/123` to `/photos/456` might grant access to a private photo if PhotoPrism doesn't properly check if the authenticated user has permission to view photo 456.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine how PhotoPrism handles object IDs.  Look for places where IDs are directly used in database queries or file system access without proper authorization checks.  Check how URLs are constructed and parsed.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Create multiple user accounts.  Try to access resources belonging to other users by modifying IDs in URLs and API requests.  Use tools like Burp Suite's Intruder to automate IDOR testing.
    *   **Example (Go):**
        ```go
        // Vulnerable Code (Illustrative)
        func GetPhoto(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            photoID := r.URL.Query().Get("id")
            photo, err := db.GetPhotoByID(photoID) // No authorization check!
            // ... serve the photo ...
        }

        // Mitigated Code (Illustrative)
        func GetPhoto(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            photoID := r.URL.Query().Get("id")
            userID := GetUserIDFromSession(r) // Get authenticated user ID
            photo, err := db.GetPhotoByIDAndUser(photoID, userID) // Check ownership/access
            // ... serve the photo if authorized ...
        }
        ```

*   **2.1.2 Broken Access Control Logic:**
    *   **Description:**  Flaws in the logic that determines whether a user has permission to perform an action or access a resource.  This could be due to incorrect role assignments, flawed conditional statements, or missing checks.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine the code that implements RBAC or any custom authorization logic.  Look for potential logic errors, edge cases, and missing checks.  Pay close attention to how roles and permissions are defined and enforced.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Create users with different roles.  Attempt to perform actions that should be restricted to specific roles.  Try to escalate privileges by exploiting flaws in the authorization logic.
    *   **Example (Go - Illustrative):**
        ```go
        // Vulnerable Code (Illustrative)
        func DeletePhoto(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            userRole := GetUserRoleFromSession(r)
            if userRole == "admin" || userRole == "editor" { // Flawed logic: editors shouldn't delete all photos
                photoID := r.URL.Query().Get("id")
                db.DeletePhoto(photoID)
            }
        }

        // Mitigated Code (Illustrative)
        func DeletePhoto(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            userID := GetUserIDFromSession(r)
            photoID := r.URL.Query().Get("id")
            if CanDeletePhoto(userID, photoID) { // Centralized authorization check
                db.DeletePhoto(photoID)
            }
        }

        func CanDeletePhoto(userID, photoID string) bool {
            // Check if user is admin OR owns the photo
            // ...
        }
        ```

*   **2.1.3 API Endpoint Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:**  API endpoints are often less protected than the web UI and can be vulnerable to authorization bypass attacks.  Attackers might send crafted API requests to access restricted data or perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine the code that handles API requests.  Ensure that each API endpoint performs proper authorization checks before processing the request.  Look for any undocumented or hidden API endpoints.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Use tools like Postman or curl to interact with PhotoPrism's API.  Try to access restricted API endpoints or perform unauthorized actions.  Fuzz API parameters to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker might try to access `/api/v1/users/all` (if it exists) without proper authorization, hoping to retrieve a list of all users and their details.

*   **2.1.4 Session Management Issues (Indirect):**
    *   **Description:**  While authentication is separate, if an attacker can hijack a valid session, they can inherit the permissions of that user.  This can lead to unauthorized access even if the authorization logic itself is sound.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine how sessions are created, managed, and terminated.  Look for vulnerabilities like predictable session IDs, session fixation, and insufficient session timeout.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Attempt to hijack sessions using techniques like cross-site scripting (XSS) or session prediction.  If successful, try to access resources using the hijacked session.

*   **2.1.5  Missing or Incorrect Database Query Authorization:**
    * **Description:** Even if the application code *intends* to check authorization, the actual database queries might not enforce these checks.  This can happen if the query logic doesn't include user IDs or role-based filters.
    * **Code Review Focus:**  Carefully examine *all* database queries that retrieve or modify data.  Ensure that each query includes appropriate `WHERE` clauses or other filtering mechanisms to limit results based on the authenticated user's permissions.
    * **Dynamic Analysis:**  Use database monitoring tools (if available) to observe the actual SQL queries being executed.  Verify that the queries are correctly filtering data based on authorization rules.
    * **Example (Go - Illustrative):**
        ```go
        // Vulnerable (Illustrative - using a hypothetical ORM)
        func GetPhotos(db *gorm.DB) ([]Photo, error) {
            var photos []Photo
            err := db.Find(&photos).Error // Retrieves ALL photos!
            return photos, err
        }

        // Mitigated (Illustrative)
        func GetPhotos(db *gorm.DB, userID string) ([]Photo, error) {
            var photos []Photo
            err := db.Where("user_id = ?", userID).Find(&photos).Error // Only retrieves photos for the user
            return photos, err
        }
        ```
*  **2.1.6 Third-party library vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:** PhotoPrism may use third-party libraries for authentication, authorization, or other functionalities. These libraries might have known or unknown vulnerabilities that could be exploited to bypass authorization checks.
    * **Code Review Focus:** Identify all third-party libraries used by PhotoPrism. Check their versions and search for known vulnerabilities in vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD). Analyze how these libraries are integrated and used within PhotoPrism's code.
    * **Dynamic Analysis:** If a vulnerable library is identified, try to exploit the vulnerability in the context of PhotoPrism. This might involve crafting specific inputs or requests that trigger the vulnerability.
    * **Mitigation:** Keep all third-party libraries up-to-date. Use a dependency management tool (e.g., `go mod`) to track and update dependencies. Consider using a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to automatically identify vulnerable libraries.

**2.2 Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **2.2.1 Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that users have only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.  Avoid granting overly broad permissions.

*   **2.2.2 Centralized Authorization Logic:**  Implement a centralized authorization mechanism that handles all access control decisions.  This makes it easier to manage and audit authorization rules.  Avoid scattering authorization checks throughout the codebase.

*   **2.2.3 Input Validation and Parameterization:**  Thoroughly validate all user input, especially object IDs and other parameters that are used to access resources.  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, which can be used to bypass authorization checks.

*   **2.2.4 Secure Session Management:**  Use strong session management techniques to prevent session hijacking.  This includes using HTTPS, generating strong session IDs, setting appropriate session timeouts, and implementing proper session termination.

*   **2.2.5 Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address authorization vulnerabilities.

*   **2.2.6  Use of established authorization libraries:** Consider using well-vetted authorization libraries (e.g., Casbin for Go) instead of building custom authorization logic from scratch.  This can reduce the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.

*   **2.2.7  Logging and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.  Log all authorization decisions, including successes and failures.

*   **2.2.8  Regular Updates:** Keep PhotoPrism and all its dependencies up-to-date to patch any known security vulnerabilities.

* **2.2.9 Indirect Object References:** Instead of using direct object references (like sequential IDs), consider using indirect object references. This could involve mapping user-accessible identifiers to internal IDs, making it harder for attackers to guess valid IDs.
