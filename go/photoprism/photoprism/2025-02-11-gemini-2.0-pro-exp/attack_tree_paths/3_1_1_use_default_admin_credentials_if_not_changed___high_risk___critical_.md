Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the PhotoPrism application.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Default Admin Credentials

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with the use of default administrator credentials in PhotoPrism, to identify potential mitigation strategies, and to provide actionable recommendations for developers and users to enhance the application's security posture.  We aim to go beyond the basic description and explore the practical implications, detection methods, and preventative measures in detail.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on attack tree path 3.1.1: "Use default admin credentials if not changed."  The scope includes:

*   **PhotoPrism's default credential handling:** How PhotoPrism handles default credentials during and after installation.  This includes examining the installation scripts, documentation, and any built-in mechanisms for credential management.
*   **Attack vectors:**  How an attacker might discover and exploit default credentials.  This includes both external (internet-facing) and internal (compromised network) scenarios.
*   **Impact analysis:**  A detailed breakdown of the specific capabilities an attacker gains with administrative access, including data exfiltration, modification, denial of service, and potential lateral movement within the network.
*   **Detection and prevention:**  Strategies for detecting attempts to use default credentials and, more importantly, preventing their successful exploitation.  This includes both technical controls and user education.
*   **Specific PhotoPrism versions:** While the analysis is general, we will consider if specific versions of PhotoPrism have known vulnerabilities or mitigations related to default credentials.
* **Related CVEs:** Check if there are any CVEs related to default credentials.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following methods:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine the publicly available PhotoPrism source code (from the provided GitHub repository) to understand how credentials are handled, stored, and validated.  We'll look for:
    *   Hardcoded credentials.
    *   Default credential settings in configuration files.
    *   Password change enforcement mechanisms (or lack thereof).
    *   Input validation related to password fields.
    *   Relevant API endpoints.

2.  **Documentation Review:**  We will thoroughly review PhotoPrism's official documentation, including installation guides, security recommendations, and FAQs, to identify any guidance or warnings related to default credentials.

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  We will set up a test instance of PhotoPrism (in a controlled environment) to:
    *   Verify the default credential behavior.
    *   Test the effectiveness of potential mitigation strategies.
    *   Simulate attack scenarios.
    *   Examine log files for evidence of login attempts.

4.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will search for known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs) and public exploits related to default credentials in PhotoPrism or similar applications.

5.  **Threat Modeling:** We will consider various attacker profiles and their motivations to understand the likelihood and potential impact of this attack vector.

6.  **Best Practice Comparison:** We will compare PhotoPrism's credential handling practices against industry best practices for secure authentication and authorization.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 3.1.1

**2.1.  Understanding PhotoPrism's Default Credential Handling**

*   **Installation Process:**  The PhotoPrism installation process (using Docker, manual setup, etc.) is crucial.  We need to determine:
    *   Does the installation script prompt for a new admin password?
    *   If not, is there a clear warning about the default credentials and the need to change them immediately?
    *   Is there a mechanism to *force* a password change on the first login?
    *   Are default credentials documented, and if so, how prominently?
    *   Is there a web UI or command-line tool for changing the password?

*   **Configuration Files:**  We'll examine configuration files (e.g., `docker-compose.yml`, `photoprism.yml`) for any default credential settings.  Even if the installation script prompts for a password, a hardcoded default in a configuration file could be a vulnerability if the user doesn't modify it.

*   **Codebase Search:**  We'll search the codebase for strings like "admin," "password," "default," "credentials," etc., to identify relevant code sections.  We'll pay close attention to:
    *   Authentication logic.
    *   User management functions.
    *   Database interactions related to user accounts.

**2.2. Attack Vectors**

*   **External Attack (Internet-Facing):**  If PhotoPrism is exposed to the internet without proper network security (e.g., a firewall, reverse proxy with authentication), an attacker can directly attempt to log in using default credentials.  This is the most common and dangerous scenario.
*   **Internal Attack (Compromised Network):**  If an attacker has already gained access to the internal network (e.g., through phishing, a compromised device), they can attempt to access PhotoPrism using default credentials, even if it's not directly exposed to the internet.
*   **Social Engineering:**  An attacker might try to trick a user into revealing the default credentials or resetting the password to a known value.
*   **Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing:** While not directly related to *default* credentials, if the default password is weak, it might be vulnerable to brute-force or credential stuffing attacks.  This highlights the importance of strong default passwords even if a change is enforced.

**2.3. Impact Analysis**

Gaining administrative access to PhotoPrism provides an attacker with extensive control:

*   **Data Exfiltration:**  The attacker can access and download all photos and videos stored in PhotoPrism.  This could include sensitive personal information, copyrighted material, or confidential business data.
*   **Data Modification:**  The attacker can delete, modify, or add photos and videos.  They could deface the application, plant malicious content, or alter metadata.
*   **Data Destruction:** The attacker can delete all photos and videos, causing significant data loss.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker can shut down the PhotoPrism service, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **System Compromise:**  Depending on the PhotoPrism configuration and the underlying operating system, the attacker might be able to gain access to the host system itself.  This could allow them to:
    *   Install malware.
    *   Steal other data.
    *   Use the system for further attacks (e.g., as part of a botnet).
*   **Lateral Movement:**  The attacker could use the compromised PhotoPrism instance as a stepping stone to attack other systems on the network.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack could damage the reputation of the organization or individual using PhotoPrism.

**2.4. Detection and Prevention**

**Detection:**

*   **Log Monitoring:**  PhotoPrism should log all login attempts, including successful and failed attempts.  Monitoring these logs for attempts to use default credentials (especially from unexpected IP addresses) is crucial.  Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems can automate this process.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  IDS/IPS can be configured to detect and block attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities, including default credential attacks.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Periodic security audits should include checks for default credentials and other security misconfigurations.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regular vulnerability scans can identify systems with default credentials or other known vulnerabilities.

**Prevention:**

*   **Mandatory Password Change on First Login:**  This is the most effective prevention method.  The application should *force* the user to change the default password upon the first successful login.  This should be implemented at the code level, not just as a recommendation in the documentation.
*   **Strong Default Password (if unavoidable):** If a mandatory password change is not feasible, the default password should be strong and randomly generated.  It should *not* be a common password like "admin" or "password."  A long, complex, and unique password makes brute-force attacks much more difficult.
*   **Account Lockout:**  Implement account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts.  This prevents brute-force attacks.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Enabling 2FA adds an extra layer of security, making it much harder for an attacker to gain access even if they know the password.
*   **Secure Configuration Defaults:**  Ensure that all default settings in PhotoPrism are secure.  This includes disabling unnecessary features and services.
*   **Regular Updates:**  Keep PhotoPrism and its dependencies up to date to patch any known vulnerabilities.
*   **User Education:**  Educate users about the importance of changing default credentials and using strong passwords.  This should be included in the installation documentation and any user training materials.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that PhotoPrism runs with the minimum necessary privileges.  It should not run as root or with unnecessary system permissions.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help protect against common web attacks, including attempts to exploit default credentials.

**2.5. Specific PhotoPrism Version Considerations & CVEs**

This section would be populated after researching specific PhotoPrism versions and searching for relevant CVEs.  For example:

*   **CVE-XXXX-YYYY:**  (Hypothetical)  "PhotoPrism version X.Y.Z is vulnerable to default credential exploitation due to a missing password change enforcement mechanism."
*   **PhotoPrism 2.0.0:**  (Hypothetical)  "Introduced mandatory password change on first login, mitigating the risk of default credential attacks."

(Note:  At the time of this analysis, I don't have access to real-time CVE databases.  A real-world analysis would involve searching databases like NIST NVD and MITRE CVE.)

**2.6. Best Practice Comparison**

PhotoPrism's credential handling should be compared against industry best practices, such as:

*   **OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet:**  Provides comprehensive guidance on secure authentication.
*   **NIST Special Publication 800-63B:**  Digital Identity Guidelines - Authentication and Lifecycle Management.
*   **CIS Benchmarks:**  Provide security configuration guidelines for various operating systems and applications.

### 3. Conclusion and Recommendations
