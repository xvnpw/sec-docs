## Attack Tree Path: [1. Malicious File Upload [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__malicious_file_upload__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   Attacker uploads a specially crafted image file to Photoprism.
*   This file is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in image processing libraries used by Photoprism (e.g., libvips, or libraries used by Go image processing packages).
*   When Photoprism processes the file (during upload, indexing, or thumbnail generation), the vulnerability is triggered.

**Potential Impact:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Photoprism, leading to full system compromise.
*   **System Compromise:**  Complete control over the server, allowing data theft, modification, or further attacks on the network.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Robust Input Validation:**  Strictly validate file types, sizes, and formats. Use allowlists for accepted file extensions.
*   **Image Metadata Sanitization:** Sanitize image metadata to remove or neutralize potentially malicious content.
*   **Secure Image Processing Libraries:**  Use updated and hardened image processing libraries. Regularly patch and update these libraries.
*   **Sandboxing Image Processing:** Consider sandboxing image processing operations to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Image Processing Library Exploits [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__image_processing_library_exploits__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   Attackers directly target known vulnerabilities in image processing libraries used by Photoprism.
*   This could involve exploiting buffer overflows, memory corruption issues, or other security flaws in libraries like libvips or its dependencies.
*   Exploitation might be triggered by specific image types, sizes, or processing operations.

**Potential Impact:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crash the application or consume excessive resources, making it unavailable.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Dependency Management:** Maintain a detailed inventory of all image processing libraries and their versions.
*   **Regular Updates:**  Implement a process for regularly updating image processing libraries and their dependencies to the latest secure versions.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   **Sandboxing:**  Isolate image processing operations in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Resource Exhaustion during Processing [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__resource_exhaustion_during_processing__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   Attacker uploads a large number of high-resolution images or videos.
*   Photoprism's automated processing (indexing, transcoding, analysis, thumbnail generation) consumes excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
*   This overload leads to resource exhaustion and application unavailability.

**Potential Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Application becomes slow, unresponsive, or completely unavailable to legitimate users.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits for processing tasks (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
*   **Queueing and Throttling:** Implement queueing mechanisms for processing tasks and throttle the rate of processing to prevent overload.
*   **Resource Monitoring:**  Continuously monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual spikes.
*   **Rate Limiting Uploads:** Implement rate limiting on file uploads to prevent rapid flooding of the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Default Credentials/Weak Passwords [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__default_credentialsweak_passwords__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   Photoprism or related services (database, admin panel) are deployed with default or easily guessable credentials (usernames and passwords).
*   Attackers attempt to access these services using default credentials or common password lists.
*   Successful login grants unauthorized access.

**Potential Impact:**
*   **Full Administrative Access:**  Attacker gains complete control over Photoprism application and potentially the underlying server, depending on the privileges of the compromised account.
*   **Data Breach:** Access to all photos, videos, and metadata managed by Photoprism.
*   **System Compromise:**  Ability to modify configurations, install malware, or pivot to other systems.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Enforce Strong Password Policies:**  Require strong, unique passwords for all accounts.
*   **Mandatory Password Change:** Force users to change default passwords immediately upon initial setup.
*   **Disable Default Accounts:** Disable or remove default accounts where possible.
*   **Account Lockout Policies:** Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force password attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Vulnerable Go Libraries [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__vulnerable_go_libraries__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   Photoprism relies on numerous Go libraries and dependencies.
*   Known vulnerabilities are discovered in these libraries over time.
*   If Photoprism uses a vulnerable version of a library and the vulnerability is exploitable in Photoprism's context, attackers can leverage it.

**Potential Impact:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crash the application.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Gain access to sensitive data.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Dependency Management:** Maintain a comprehensive list of all Go libraries and their versions used by Photoprism.
*   **Automated Dependency Scanning:**  Use dependency scanning tools to regularly check for known vulnerabilities in Go libraries.
*   **Regular Updates:**  Implement a process for promptly updating vulnerable Go libraries to patched versions.
*   **Dependency Pinning:** Consider dependency pinning to ensure consistent and controlled dependency versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Phishing Attack [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/6__phishing_attack__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   Attackers craft phishing emails, messages, or websites that convincingly impersonate Photoprism or related services.
*   These phishing attempts target Photoprism users or administrators, tricking them into revealing their login credentials (usernames and passwords).
*   Users might click on malicious links or enter credentials on fake login pages.

**Potential Impact:**
*   **Account Compromise:** Attacker gains access to the compromised user's Photoprism account.
*   **Data Breach:** Access to photos, videos, and metadata, depending on the compromised user's privileges.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If an administrator account is compromised, the attacker gains full control.

**Mitigation:**
*   **User Awareness Training:**  Conduct regular user awareness training on phishing attacks, social engineering tactics, and how to identify suspicious communications.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Enable MFA for all user accounts, especially administrator accounts, to add an extra layer of security beyond passwords.
*   **Email Security Measures:** Implement email security measures like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to reduce the effectiveness of email phishing.
*   **Security Banners/Warnings:** Display security banners or warnings to users when they are accessing external links or entering sensitive information.
