# Attack Surface Analysis for photoprism/photoprism

## Attack Surface: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code injected by an attacker is stored within PhotoPrism's data and executed in the browsers of other users when they interact with the affected content.
*   **PhotoPrism Contribution:** PhotoPrism allows user input in fields like photo descriptions, album names, tags, and comments. Insufficient sanitization of this input before storage and display directly contributes to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects a `<script>` tag into a photo description via the web interface or API. When another user views this photo through PhotoPrism, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or performing actions on their behalf.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, defacement of PhotoPrism interface, redirection to malicious websites, theft of sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement rigorous input sanitization and output encoding for all user-generated content displayed by PhotoPrism. Utilize security-focused templating engines that automatically escape output. Conduct regular code audits specifically targeting XSS vulnerabilities in user input handling.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Upload](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_upload.md)

*   **Description:** PhotoPrism permits users to upload files without adequate validation of file types. This can enable attackers to upload malicious files (e.g., executable scripts, malware) that could be executed or exploited on the server or client-side.
*   **PhotoPrism Contribution:** PhotoPrism's core function is photo management, inherently involving file uploads. Weak or insufficient file type validation within PhotoPrism's upload mechanisms directly creates this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as a JPEG image (e.g., `malicious.php.jpg`) through PhotoPrism's upload interface. If PhotoPrism or the underlying server is misconfigured or vulnerable, this script could be executed, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, full system compromise, malware distribution through PhotoPrism, data theft, unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) and not solely on file extensions. Configure PhotoPrism to store uploaded files outside the web server's document root. Ensure the web server is configured to prevent execution of scripts within the upload directory. Implement strict file size limits and quotas for uploads.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via File Upload](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_file_upload.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate filenames during the upload process to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\`). This can allow writing files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially overwriting critical system files or achieving code execution.
*   **PhotoPrism Contribution:** If PhotoPrism's file upload handling does not properly sanitize filenames, it becomes vulnerable to path traversal attacks during file uploads.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a filename like `../../../etc/cron.d/malicious_cron` and uploads it through PhotoPrism. If filename sanitization is lacking, PhotoPrism might attempt to save the file in the `/etc/cron.d/` directory, enabling the attacker to schedule malicious tasks on the server.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, arbitrary file write access, potential for remote code execution, privilege escalation on the server.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement thorough filename sanitization to remove or neutralize path traversal characters and sequences. Employ secure file path construction methods that prevent directory traversal vulnerabilities. Store uploaded files using unique, randomly generated filenames and manage file paths internally within PhotoPrism. Consider using chroot environments to restrict file system access for PhotoPrism processes.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configuration (Weak or Default Passwords)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configuration__weak_or_default_passwords_.md)

*   **Description:** PhotoPrism, or components it relies on, might be shipped with default or weak passwords for administrative accounts or services. If these defaults are not changed during deployment, attackers can easily gain unauthorized access.
*   **PhotoPrism Contribution:** If PhotoPrism itself has default administrative accounts or if underlying services (like a bundled database if applicable in certain deployment scenarios) use default credentials, it directly introduces a critical vulnerability.
*   **Example:** PhotoPrism might have a default administrator account with a common password like "admin" or "password". If the administrator fails to change this default password during initial setup, an attacker can easily log in and gain full administrative control over PhotoPrism.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, complete unauthorized access to all photos and data managed by PhotoPrism, control over PhotoPrism application and potentially the underlying server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Eliminate the use of default passwords in PhotoPrism. Force users to set strong, unique passwords during the initial setup process or account creation. Provide clear and prominent warnings about the critical importance of changing default credentials immediately.
    *   **Users:** **Immediately change all default passwords** upon installation and deployment of PhotoPrism. Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts associated with PhotoPrism. Regularly review and update passwords as a security best practice.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** PhotoPrism relies on numerous third-party libraries and dependencies. Known vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise PhotoPrism indirectly.
*   **PhotoPrism Contribution:** PhotoPrism's functionality is built upon various libraries for image processing, web framework features, database interactions, and other functionalities. Using vulnerable versions of these dependencies directly exposes PhotoPrism to the security flaws within those libraries.
*   **Example:** PhotoPrism uses an outdated version of an image processing library like `libvips` or `ImageMagick` that has a known remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a specially crafted image to PhotoPrism, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server running PhotoPrism.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency, but can range from remote code execution and full system compromise to denial of service or significant information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Maintain a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for all PhotoPrism dependencies. Implement a rigorous dependency update process to regularly update all dependencies to their latest versions, especially security patches. Utilize automated dependency scanning tools to proactively identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies. Establish a clear process for promptly addressing and patching reported vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **Users:** Keep PhotoPrism updated to the latest available version, as updates frequently include patches for vulnerable dependencies. Monitor security advisories related to PhotoPrism and its dependencies. Subscribe to security mailing lists or vulnerability databases relevant to PhotoPrism's technology stack.
