# Threat Model Analysis for photoprism/photoprism

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload - Code Execution](./threats/malicious_file_upload_-_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a crafted image file to PhotoPrism. This file exploits vulnerabilities within PhotoPrism's image processing components (libraries for decoding, thumbnailing, metadata extraction). Upon processing, the attacker gains arbitrary code execution on the server hosting PhotoPrism. This could be achieved through vulnerabilities in libraries like `libvips`, `ImageMagick`, or similar used by PhotoPrism.
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise, complete access to all photos and the PhotoPrism database, potential data breach, denial of service, and the possibility of lateral movement to other systems on the network.
*   **PhotoPrism Component Affected:** Image Processing Module (image decoding, thumbnailing, metadata extraction functions), File Upload Handler.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Prioritize regular updates of all image processing libraries to their latest secure versions.
        *   Implement rigorous input validation for all uploaded files, including strict file type and size checks, and consider file content analysis.
        *   Employ sandboxing or containerization for image processing tasks to isolate potential exploits and limit their impact.
        *   Conduct thorough static and dynamic code analysis specifically targeting image processing code paths.
    *   **User:**
        *   Ensure PhotoPrism is always updated to the latest available version.
        *   Monitor server resource utilization for unusual spikes that could indicate exploitation attempts related to image processing.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) - Photo Access](./threats/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__-_photo_access.md)

*   **Description:** PhotoPrism's API or web interface uses predictable identifiers (like sequential IDs) to access photos and albums. An attacker can manipulate these identifiers in API requests or web URLs to bypass authorization checks and access photos or albums belonging to other users or intended to be private. This is possible if PhotoPrism relies on predictable IDs without proper server-side authorization validation for resource access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to private photos and albums, significant privacy violations, potential data breach of sensitive or personal images.
*   **PhotoPrism Component Affected:** API endpoints for photo and album retrieval, Web Interface components displaying photos and albums, Authorization Module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Implement mandatory and robust server-side authorization checks for every access request to photos and albums, regardless of the identifier used.
        *   Replace predictable, sequential identifiers with non-guessable, unique identifiers (UUIDs) for photos and albums.
        *   Ensure authorization logic is consistently applied across all API endpoints and web interface components that handle photo and album access.
    *   **User:**
        *   Report any suspected unauthorized access or unexpected behavior related to photo or album access to the PhotoPrism administrator.
        *   Configure and review access control settings within PhotoPrism if available to ensure appropriate restrictions are in place.

## Threat: [Session Hijacking - Insecure Cookies](./threats/session_hijacking_-_insecure_cookies.md)

*   **Description:** PhotoPrism's session management relies on cookies. If these cookies are not securely configured by PhotoPrism (e.g., lacking `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite` attributes, or using weak session ID generation), an attacker can intercept or steal a legitimate user's session cookie. This could occur through network sniffing, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if other vulnerabilities exist, or malware. With a stolen session cookie, the attacker can fully impersonate the user without needing their credentials.
*   **Impact:** Complete unauthorized access to user accounts, enabling the attacker to view, modify, or delete photos, albums, and settings as if they were the legitimate user. This can lead to data breaches, privacy violations, and manipulation of the PhotoPrism instance.
*   **PhotoPrism Component Affected:** Authentication and Session Management Module, potentially Web Server configuration if PhotoPrism relies on it for cookie settings.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Ensure PhotoPrism and its deployment environment (web server) are configured to set `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` attributes for all session cookies.
        *   Utilize strong, cryptographically secure methods for generating session IDs to prevent predictability and guessing.
        *   Implement session timeout and inactivity timeout mechanisms to limit the lifespan of session cookies.
        *   Consider anti-CSRF tokens to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks that could facilitate cookie theft.
    *   **User:**
        *   Always access PhotoPrism over HTTPS to encrypt communication and protect cookies in transit.
        *   Avoid using PhotoPrism on untrusted networks (like public Wi-Fi) without using a VPN to secure network traffic.
        *   Log out of PhotoPrism sessions when finished, especially on shared or untrusted devices.

## Threat: [Default or Weak Credentials - Initial Setup](./threats/default_or_weak_credentials_-_initial_setup.md)

*   **Description:** During the initial setup of PhotoPrism, if default administrative credentials are used and not immediately changed, or if the system allows for the creation of easily guessable passwords for administrative accounts, attackers can exploit this. If the setup process or the PhotoPrism instance is accessible from the internet or a less trusted network, attackers can attempt to log in using these default or weak credentials to gain administrative access.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the PhotoPrism instance, complete administrative control over all photos, albums, users, and configuration. This can lead to a complete data breach, system takeover, and potential further exploitation of the underlying server or network.
*   **PhotoPrism Component Affected:** User Authentication Module, Initial Setup/Installation Process, Administrative Account Management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Eliminate the use of default credentials entirely. Enforce strong password policies during the initial setup and for all user account creation, particularly for administrative roles.
        *   Provide clear and prominent warnings and instructions to users about the critical importance of setting strong, unique passwords immediately upon installation.
        *   Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts to add an extra layer of security.
    *   **User:**
        *   Immediately change any default credentials provided during installation.
        *   Choose strong, unique passwords for all PhotoPrism accounts, especially for any administrative accounts.
        *   Ensure the PhotoPrism setup process is not exposed to the public internet or untrusted networks.

## Threat: [Configuration File Tampering - Sensitive Data Exposure](./threats/configuration_file_tampering_-_sensitive_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** PhotoPrism's configuration files (e.g., `.env` files or similar) may store sensitive information in plaintext or easily reversible formats. This can include database credentials, API keys for external services, or other secrets. If these configuration files are not adequately protected by file system permissions, or if vulnerabilities in PhotoPrism or the underlying system allow for unauthorized file writing, attackers could gain access to or modify these files.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials and secrets, leading to full compromise of the PhotoPrism instance and potentially connected systems or services. Attackers could gain unauthorized access to the database, external APIs, or modify PhotoPrism's behavior to facilitate further attacks or data exfiltration.
*   **PhotoPrism Component Affected:** Configuration Management, File System Access, potentially Secrets Management if implemented.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive configuration data in plaintext files whenever possible. Utilize environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions for sensitive information.
        *   Ensure that configuration files are stored outside of the web server's document root and are not directly accessible via web requests.
        *   Implement file integrity monitoring to detect any unauthorized modifications to configuration files.
    *   **User:**
        *   Restrict file system permissions on PhotoPrism configuration files to the minimum necessary access, typically read-only for the application user and read/write only for the administrator.
        *   Regularly review and verify file system permissions on configuration files.
        *   Consider using a dedicated secret management system to securely store and manage sensitive configuration data instead of relying on local files.
