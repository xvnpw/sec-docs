Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving GoFrame, with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Router Misconfiguration (Overly Permissive Wildcard Routes)
    *   **Description:**  Defining routes with overly broad wildcards (e.g., `/api/{...}`) can allow attackers to access unintended endpoints or resources that were not meant to be publicly accessible.
    *   **How GF Contributes:** GoFrame's flexible router allows for defining such wildcard routes easily. If developers are not careful, they might create overly permissive patterns.
    *   **Example:** A route defined as `/admin/{path}` could allow an attacker to access `/admin/config/database.json` if such a file exists and is served statically.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, administrative functionalities, or internal application logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define routes with specific and restrictive patterns.
        *   Avoid broad wildcards unless absolutely necessary and ensure proper authorization checks within the handler.
        *   Regularly review route definitions to identify and correct overly permissive patterns.
        *   Utilize GoFrame's route grouping and middleware to enforce authorization at different levels.

*   **Attack Surface:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
    *   **Description:** If user-controlled data is directly embedded into templates without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious template code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **How GF Contributes:** GoFrame's template engine, while generally safe, can be vulnerable if developers directly pass unsanitized user input into template rendering functions.
    *   **Example:**  A template rendering call like `c.View.DisplayContent(ctx, "{{ .UserInput }}", g.Map{"UserInput": c.Request.Get("name")})` where `name` is user-provided, could allow an attacker to inject template directives.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, server takeover, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never directly embed unsanitized user input into templates.**
        *   Utilize GoFrame's built-in template escaping mechanisms.
        *   Sanitize user input before passing it to the template engine.
        *   Consider using a template engine with strong security features and auto-escaping by default.

*   **Attack Surface:** SQL Injection (via Raw Queries or Insufficient ORM Sanitization)
    *   **Description:**  If the application uses raw SQL queries or doesn't properly sanitize input when using GoFrame's ORM, attackers can inject malicious SQL code to manipulate database queries.
    *   **How GF Contributes:** While GoFrame's ORM provides features to prevent SQL injection (e.g., parameterized queries), developers might still write raw SQL or misuse ORM methods.
    *   **Example:** Using `db.Raw(ctx, "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + c.Request.Get("username") + "'")` directly uses unsanitized input.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access, potential server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries or GoFrame's ORM features that automatically handle input sanitization.**
        *   Avoid constructing SQL queries by concatenating user input directly.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization on the application layer before interacting with the database.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege for database user accounts.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Session Handling (Weak Session IDs, Session Fixation)
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in session management can allow attackers to hijack user sessions, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **How GF Contributes:** GoFrame provides session management features. If not configured or used correctly, it can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:**  Using default session configurations without strong entropy for session ID generation or failing to regenerate session IDs after login can lead to session fixation attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionalities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure GoFrame's session middleware is configured to use strong, cryptographically secure random number generators for session IDs.
        *   Regenerate session IDs after successful user authentication to prevent session fixation.
        *   Set appropriate `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for session cookies.
        *   Implement session timeouts and consider using secure session storage mechanisms.

*   **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal (via User-Controlled File Paths)
    *   **Description:** If the application allows users to specify file paths (e.g., for uploads or downloads) without proper validation, attackers can access files outside of the intended directories.
    *   **How GF Contributes:** GoFrame's file handling functions can be vulnerable if developers directly use user-provided paths without sanitization.
    *   **Example:**  Code that uses `os.Open(c.Request.Get("filepath"))` where `filepath` is directly taken from user input could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the server using paths like `../../../../etc/passwd`.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files, potential for code execution if executable files are accessed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never directly use user-provided file paths without thorough validation and sanitization.**
        *   Use whitelisting of allowed file paths or directories.
        *   Utilize GoFrame's file system utilities in a secure manner, avoiding direct manipulation of paths.
        *   Store uploaded files in a dedicated, non-executable directory with restricted access.

*   **Attack Surface:** Command Injection (via CLI Features with Unsanitized Input)
    *   **Description:** If the application exposes CLI commands that take user input and execute system commands without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious commands.
    *   **How GF Contributes:** GoFrame's CLI features allow for defining and executing commands. If user input is incorporated into these commands without sanitization, it creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A CLI command defined as `gfcli build main.go -o output/` + c.Request.Get("output_name") where `output_name` is user-provided, could allow an attacker to inject commands like `; rm -rf /`.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid using user input directly in system commands.**
        *   If necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent command injection.
        *   Consider using safer alternatives to system calls if possible.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege for the user running the application.
