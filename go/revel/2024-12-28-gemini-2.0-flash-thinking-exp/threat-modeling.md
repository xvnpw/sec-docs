### High and Critical Revel-Specific Threats

Here's a list of high and critical severity threats that directly involve the Revel framework:

*   **Threat:** Session Fixation
    *   **Description:** An attacker might manipulate a user into using a pre-existing session ID, allowing the attacker to hijack the user's session after they log in. This is a risk due to Revel's default cookie-based session handling if not properly secured.
    *   **Impact:** Full account takeover, unauthorized access to user data, ability to perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Affected Revel Component:** Session Management (specifically the default cookie-based session handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regenerate the session ID upon successful login.
        *   Set secure session cookie attributes: `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` (preferably `Strict` or `Lax`).
        *   Consider using a more robust session store than the default in-memory store for production.

*   **Threat:** Mass Assignment via Parameter Binding
    *   **Description:** An attacker could send unexpected parameters in a request, and due to Revel's automatic parameter binding, these parameters might be inadvertently assigned to model fields, potentially modifying sensitive data or bypassing intended logic.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized modification of application state, potential privilege escalation if sensitive fields like `isAdmin` are affected.
    *   **Affected Revel Component:** Parameter Binding (within the controller layer).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) or specific form structs to explicitly define which parameters can be bound to models.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all bound parameters.
        *   Avoid directly binding request parameters to database entities without careful consideration and whitelisting.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
    *   **Description:** If user-controlled data is directly embedded into Revel templates without proper escaping, an attacker can inject malicious template code that executes on the server. This allows for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, remote code execution, data exfiltration, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Revel Component:** Template Engine (specifically the Go HTML/template library used by Revel).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always escape user-provided data when rendering it in templates using the appropriate escaping functions provided by the template engine.
        *   Avoid constructing template strings dynamically from user input.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful injections.
        *   Regularly review template code for potential injection points.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Handling of User Roles and Permissions
    *   **Description:** If the Revel application doesn't implement proper authorization checks, attackers might be able to access functionality or data they are not authorized to access by manipulating requests or exploiting flaws in the authorization logic, potentially leveraging Revel's routing and interceptor mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Revel Component:** Interceptors, Controller Logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a robust authorization system that checks user roles and permissions before granting access to sensitive resources or actions.
        *   Utilize Revel's interceptors to enforce authorization rules at the route level.
        *   Avoid relying solely on client-side checks for authorization.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles and permissions.
