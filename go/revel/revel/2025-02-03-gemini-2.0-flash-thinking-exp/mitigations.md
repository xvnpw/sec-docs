# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for revel/revel

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Sanitization of User Input in Templates (Revel Template Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_sanitization_of_user_input_in_templates__revel_template_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all locations in Revel templates (`.html` files) where user-provided data, passed from Revel controllers, is rendered.**
    2.  **Analyze the context of each user input rendering within the Revel template.** Determine if it's within HTML content, JavaScript code, URL attributes, etc., *within the template context*.
    3.  **Apply context-appropriate escaping functions provided by Go's `html/template` package, as used by Revel.**
        *   For HTML content within Revel templates: Use `{{.Variable | html}}` or similar functions like `HTMLEscapeString` within the template.
        *   For JavaScript contexts within Revel templates: Use `{{.Variable | js}}` or `JSEscapeString` within the template.
        *   For URL contexts within Revel templates: Use `{{.Variable | urlquery}}` or `QueryEscape` within the template.
    4.  **Avoid using `{{. | safehtml}}` or similar "unsafe" template actions in Revel templates unless absolutely necessary and after rigorous security review.** Prefer context-aware escaping.
    5.  **Regularly review Revel templates for new user input renderings and ensure proper sanitization using Revel/Go template functions is applied.**
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Revel Templates:** High Severity - Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server *via Revel's template engine*.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Revel Templates:** High Severity - Enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into the user's browser *due to improper handling in Revel templates*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **SSTI (Revel Templates):** High Impact - Effectively prevents SSTI vulnerabilities originating from Revel template usage.
    *   **XSS (Revel Templates):** High Impact - Significantly reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities arising from data rendering within Revel templates.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - Basic HTML escaping is used in some Revel templates, but JavaScript and URL context escaping is not consistently applied across all templates within the project. Found in: `app/views` directory, specifically in templates displaying user comments and profile information rendered by Revel.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in Revel templates that handle user-generated content within JavaScript blocks or URL parameters *rendered by Revel*. Needs review and implementation in all Revel templates handling dynamic data, especially those related to search functionality and user profile editing managed by Revel controllers and views.

## Mitigation Strategy: [CSRF Protection using Revel's Built-in Mechanism](./mitigation_strategies/csrf_protection_using_revel's_built-in_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable CSRF protection in Revel's `conf/app.conf` configuration file by setting `csrf.enabled = true`.**
    2.  **Verify that the `CSRF` filter is included in the filter chain defined in Revel's `conf/routes` file.** This is crucial for Revel to automatically apply CSRF protection.
    3.  **In HTML forms rendered by Revel templates, use the `{{.CSRFField}}` template function to automatically include the CSRF token as a hidden field.** This leverages Revel's built-in CSRF token generation and injection.
    4.  **For AJAX requests or non-form submissions interacting with Revel controllers, retrieve the CSRF token (using Revel's provided mechanisms, e.g., from meta tag or cookie) and include it in request headers (e.g., `X-CSRF-Token`).** Ensure consistency with Revel's CSRF token handling.
    5.  **Avoid bypassing Revel's automatic CSRF validation in custom controllers or actions unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.** Rely on Revel's built-in validation as much as possible.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in Revel Applications:** High Severity - Prevents attackers from performing unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users *within the Revel application*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSRF (Revel Applications):** High Impact - Effectively prevents CSRF attacks when leveraging Revel's built-in CSRF protection correctly.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented - `csrf.enabled = true` is set in `conf/app.conf` and `CSRF` filter is in `conf/routes`. `{{.CSRFField}}` is used in most forms rendered by Revel templates.
*   **Missing Implementation:** CSRF token handling for AJAX requests interacting with Revel controllers is not consistently implemented across all JavaScript functionalities. Needs review and implementation for all AJAX forms and API calls that modify data handled by Revel controllers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Session Management Security Configuration in Revel](./mitigation_strategies/session_management_security_configuration_in_revel.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure session cookies in Revel's `conf/app.conf` to use the `Secure` flag (`session.secure = true`).** This ensures session cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS, a Revel configuration setting.
    2.  **Configure session cookies in Revel's `conf/app.conf` to use the `HttpOnly` flag (`session.httpOnly = true`).** This prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing session cookies, a Revel configuration setting.
    3.  **Set appropriate session timeouts in Revel's `conf/app.conf` (`session.maxAge`).** Shorter timeouts reduce the window of opportunity for session hijacking in Revel applications.
    4.  **Consider configuring a secure session storage mechanism supported by Revel if default cookie-based storage is insufficient for security needs.** Explore server-side stores like Redis if handling sensitive session data within Revel.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) based Session Hijacking in Revel Applications:** High Severity - Prevents attackers from stealing session cookies using JavaScript if XSS is present *within the Revel application context*.
    *   **Session Hijacking through Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks against Revel Applications:** High Severity - Protects session cookies from being intercepted over insecure HTTP connections *when using a Revel application*.
    *   **Session Fixation attacks against Revel Applications:** Medium Severity - Session regeneration (ideally handled by Revel's authentication mechanisms) mitigates this.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS based Session Hijacking (Revel):** High Impact - Effectively prevents session cookie theft via JavaScript in Revel applications.
    *   **Session Hijacking (MitM) (Revel):** High Impact - Prevents session cookie theft over insecure connections when using Revel applications.
    *   **Session Fixation (Revel):** Medium Impact - Reduces the risk of session fixation attacks in Revel applications.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - `session.secure = true` is enabled in `conf/app.conf`, but `session.httpOnly = true` is missing in Revel's configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:** `session.httpOnly = true` needs to be added to Revel's `conf/app.conf`. Evaluate if the default cookie-based session storage is sufficient or if a more secure server-side store needs to be configured within Revel.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation using Revel's Validation Framework](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_using_revel's_validation_framework.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **For each controller action in Revel that accepts user input, define validation rules using Revel's `revel.Validation` framework.** This is the framework-provided mechanism for input validation.
    2.  **Use Revel's validation tags and functions to validate data type, format, length, allowed values, and any other relevant constraints *within the Revel controller logic*.**
    3.  **Perform validation *after* parameter binding in Revel controllers but *before* using the data in application logic or database queries *within the Revel application flow*.**
    4.  **Handle validation errors gracefully within Revel controllers, using `revel.Validation.HasErrors()` and `revel.Validation.Errors` to return informative error messages to the user via Revel's response mechanisms.**
    5.  **Regularly review and update validation rules defined in Revel controllers as application requirements change.**
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (SQL Injection, Command Injection, etc.) in Revel Applications:** Medium to High Severity - Reduces the risk by ensuring input processed by Revel controllers conforms to expected formats, preventing malicious input from being processed by the application logic.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Revel Applications:** Low Severity - While output encoding in Revel templates is the primary XSS defense, input validation in Revel controllers can prevent some forms of XSS by rejecting invalid input before it reaches templates.
    *   **Business Logic Errors in Revel Applications:** Medium Severity - Prevents errors and unexpected application behavior within the Revel application caused by invalid input data handled by Revel controllers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (Revel):** Medium Impact - Reduces the likelihood and impact of injection attacks within Revel applications.
    *   **XSS (Revel):** Low Impact - Provides a minor layer of defense against certain XSS vectors in Revel applications.
    *   **Business Logic Errors (Revel):** High Impact - Improves application stability and data integrity within Revel applications.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - Validation using Revel's framework is used in some controller actions, particularly for user registration and login forms within the Revel application. Validation rules are not comprehensive across all input fields and controller actions in Revel.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Needs to be implemented more comprehensively across all Revel controller actions that accept user input, including form submissions, API endpoints, and URL parameters handled by Revel. Focus on validating all critical input fields and edge cases within Revel controller logic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Debug Mode in Production (Revel Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_debug_mode_in_production__revel_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Ensure `mode = prod` is explicitly set in Revel's `conf/app.conf` configuration file for production deployments.** This is the primary way to disable debug mode in Revel.
    2.  **Verify that any other debug-related configurations in `conf/app.conf` (e.g., verbose logging, stack trace display) are also disabled or set to production-appropriate levels.**
    3.  **Regularly check the Revel application configuration (`conf/app.conf`) to ensure debug mode is not accidentally enabled in production environments.**
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure from Revel Applications:** Medium Severity - Prevents exposure of sensitive information like stack traces, internal paths, and Revel framework version details in error messages *generated by the Revel application in production*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Revel):** Medium Impact - Reduces the risk of information leakage from Revel applications that could aid attackers.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented - `mode = prod` is set in `conf/app.conf` for the production environment of the Revel application.
*   **Missing Implementation:** No missing implementation currently. Regularly verify this setting in `conf/app.conf` during deployments and configuration changes to ensure debug mode remains disabled in production Revel environments.
