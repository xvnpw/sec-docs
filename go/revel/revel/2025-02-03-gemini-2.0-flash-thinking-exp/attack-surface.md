# Attack Surface Analysis for revel/revel

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how applications handle parameters defined in Revel's routing configuration. Attackers manipulate these parameters to achieve unintended actions.
*   **Revel Contribution:** Revel's routing mechanism, defined in `conf/routes`, directly uses parameters passed to controller actions. Lack of sanitization in controller actions exposes this attack surface.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** A route like `/files/{filepath}` in `routes` file and corresponding controller action not validating `filepath` allows attackers to use `filepath=../../../../etc/passwd` to access sensitive files.
    *   **SSRF:** A route like `/proxy/{url}` and controller action using `url` parameter to make external requests without validation, allows attackers to use `url=http://internal.server/admin` to access internal resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized file access.
    *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
    *   Potential data breaches and internal network exploitation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation in Controllers:** Implement robust input validation within controller actions for all route parameters. Use whitelisting, regular expressions, and appropriate data type checks.
    *   **Sanitize/Escape Parameters:** Sanitize or escape route parameters before using them in file paths, URLs, system commands, or database queries.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit application's file system and network access to the minimum required.
    *   **URL Whitelisting (for SSRF):** For routes handling URLs, maintain a strict whitelist of allowed domains or protocols.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious code into Go templates used by Revel, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Revel Contribution:** Revel utilizes Go's `html/template` package for rendering views. If user input is directly embedded into templates without proper escaping, SSTI vulnerabilities can occur.
*   **Example:**
    *   Directly embedding user input in a template like `{{.UserInput}}` without escaping, allowing an attacker to inject Go template directives such as `{{ .Execute "os/exec" "Command" "whoami" }}` to execute system commands.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
    *   Full server compromise.
    *   Data breaches and system disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Context-Aware Escaping in Templates:** Always use Go's template engine's built-in escaping mechanisms (e.g., `{{.UserInput | html}}`, `{{.UserInput | js}}`) to ensure output is properly escaped for the intended context (HTML, JavaScript, etc.).
    *   **Avoid Direct User Input in Raw Templates:** Minimize or eliminate direct embedding of user-controlled input into templates. Process and sanitize data in controllers before passing it to templates.
    *   **Restrict Custom Template Functions:** Carefully review and secure any custom template functions. Avoid functions that provide access to sensitive operations or system commands.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to reduce the impact of XSS and SSTI by controlling resource loading sources.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting Revel's automatic form binding to modify unintended object properties, particularly database model fields, by submitting unexpected request parameters.
*   **Revel Contribution:** Revel's form binding feature automatically maps request parameters to controller action parameters and struct fields, including database models. This automatic binding, if not controlled, creates the mass assignment risk.
*   **Example:**
    *   A user profile update form binds to a `User` struct. An attacker submits extra parameters like `isAdmin=true` in the POST request, potentially setting the `isAdmin` field to true if the `User` struct and binding are not properly secured.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized data modification.
    *   Privilege escalation (e.g., granting admin privileges).
    *   Data integrity compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Whitelist Binding Fields:** Explicitly control which fields are allowed to be bound from request parameters. Implement mechanisms to restrict binding to only expected and safe fields.
    *   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Use DTOs to represent the expected request data. Bind request parameters to DTOs, validate them, and then map validated DTO data to domain models with controlled updates.
    *   **Authorization Checks Before Updates:** Always perform authorization checks in controller actions before updating any data based on user input. Verify user permissions to modify specific fields.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Session Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_session_management.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in Revel's session handling, storage, or transmission, allowing attackers to hijack or manipulate user sessions and gain unauthorized access.
*   **Revel Contribution:** Revel provides built-in session management. Default configurations or improper usage of session features can lead to vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker intercepts a user's session cookie and uses it to impersonate the user, gaining access to their account.
    *   **Session Fixation:** An attacker forces a user to use a known session ID, then authenticates with that ID, allowing the attacker to hijack the session after successful login.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Account takeover.
    *   Unauthorized access to user data and application functionality.
    *   Full user account compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Session Storage Configuration:** Configure Revel to use secure session storage mechanisms suitable for production, such as database-backed or distributed cache stores, instead of default file-based or in-memory storage.
    *   **Session ID Regeneration on Authentication:** Ensure session IDs are regenerated after successful user authentication to prevent session fixation attacks.
    *   **HttpOnly and Secure Cookies for Sessions:** Configure session cookies with `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags in Revel's configuration to prevent client-side script access and ensure transmission only over HTTPS.
    *   **Strong Session ID Generation:** Verify that Revel's session ID generation algorithm is cryptographically secure and unpredictable.
    *   **Session Timeout Implementation:** Implement appropriate session timeouts to limit the lifespan of sessions and reduce the window of opportunity for session hijacking.

## Attack Surface: [Development Mode Features Exposed in Production](./attack_surfaces/development_mode_features_exposed_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Accidentally deploying applications with Revel's development mode features enabled in production, exposing debug endpoints, less strict security defaults, and sensitive information.
*   **Revel Contribution:** Revel distinguishes between development and production modes. Misconfiguration or improper deployment practices can lead to development mode settings persisting in production.
*   **Example:**
    *   Debug routes or profiling endpoints intended for development are left accessible in production, allowing attackers to gain insights into application internals or performance characteristics.
    *   CSRF protection, which might be disabled or less strict in development, is not properly enabled or configured in production, leaving the application vulnerable.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure about application internals and configuration.
    *   Privileged access to debugging or administrative functionalities.
    *   Bypassing security controls like CSRF protection.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Environment-Specific Configuration:** Utilize environment variables or separate configuration files to manage settings for development, staging, and production environments distinctly.
    *   **Disable Debug Features in Production:** Explicitly disable all debug routes, profiling endpoints, and development-specific features in production configurations.
    *   **Enforce Strict Security Defaults in Production:** Ensure all security features (like CSRF protection, strict input validation, secure session settings) are enabled and properly configured for production deployments.
    *   **Automated Deployment Processes:** Implement automated deployment pipelines to enforce consistent configurations and prevent manual errors that could lead to development settings being deployed to production.

## Attack Surface: [Revel Framework Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/revel_framework_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities present within the Revel framework code itself, which could be exploited by attackers targeting applications built on Revel.
*   **Revel Contribution:** As with any software framework, Revel itself may contain security vulnerabilities in its code base.
*   **Example:**
    *   A vulnerability in Revel's routing logic could be discovered that allows bypassing authorization checks.
    *   A flaw in Revel's request handling could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, potentially including RCE, privilege escalation, DoS, or information disclosure.
    *   Can affect all applications built on the vulnerable Revel version.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Stay Updated with Revel Releases:** Regularly update Revel framework to the latest stable versions. Monitor Revel's release notes and security advisories for vulnerability patches.
    *   **Subscribe to Security Mailing Lists/Channels:** Subscribe to Revel's security mailing lists or community channels to receive timely notifications about security vulnerabilities and updates.
    *   **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of Revel applications to identify potential vulnerabilities, including those within the framework itself and application-specific flaws.
    *   **Follow Security Best Practices:** Adhere to general web application security best practices in addition to framework-specific mitigations to minimize the overall attack surface.
