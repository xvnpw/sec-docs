## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Revel Framework Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_revel_framework_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

* This is a broad category encompassing vulnerabilities inherent to the Revel framework itself. Successful exploitation can lead to significant compromise.

    * **1.1. Template Engine Injection [CRITICAL]**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting how Revel renders templates, specifically when user-controlled data is embedded without proper escaping.
        * **High-Risk Path:** [HR] Exploit Unsafe Template Rendering [CRITICAL]
            * **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code (e.g., JavaScript for XSS) into template variables that are not correctly sanitized before being rendered in the user's browser.
            * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, and malicious actions on behalf of the user. In severe misconfigurations, Server-Side Command Injection (though less likely with `html/template`).
            * **Mitigation:**  Strictly escape all user-controlled data rendered in templates using Revel's built-in template functions. Regularly review templates for potential injection points. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).

    * **1.2. Session Management Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]**
        * **Attack Vectors:** Weaknesses in how Revel handles user sessions, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts.
        * **High-Risk Paths:**
            * [HR] Session Hijacking [CRITICAL]
                * **Description:** Attackers obtain a valid session ID belonging to another user and use it to impersonate them. This can be achieved through various means like network sniffing, malware, or predicting session IDs if they are weakly generated.
                * **Impact:** Account takeover, full access to the victim's account and data.
                * **Mitigation:** Use strong, cryptographically secure random session ID generation. Implement secure session transport (HTTPS).
            * [HR] Session Fixation [CRITICAL]
                * **Description:** Attackers force a user to use a session ID that the attacker controls. After the user authenticates, the attacker can use the pre-set session ID to gain access to the user's authenticated session.
                * **Impact:** Account takeover, full access to the victim's account and data.
                * **Mitigation:** Regenerate session IDs upon successful login. Implement proper session fixation defenses within the application or framework level.
            * [HR] Insecure Session Storage (if misconfigured) [CRITICAL]
                * **Description:** Session data is stored in a way that is easily accessible to attackers. This could be plaintext cookies without `HttpOnly` or `Secure` flags, or insecure server-side storage.
                * **Impact:** Exposure of session data, potentially leading to session hijacking and account takeover.
                * **Mitigation:** Store session data securely, preferably server-side. If using cookies, ensure they are encrypted, use `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags, and are properly signed for integrity.

    * **1.3. Form Handling/Validation Bypass [CRITICAL]**
        * **Attack Vectors:** Circumventing or exploiting weaknesses in Revel's form handling and validation mechanisms to manipulate data or bypass security controls.
        * **High-Risk Paths:**
            * [HR] Bypass Server-Side Validation [CRITICAL]
                * **Description:** Attackers manipulate requests to bypass server-side validation logic implemented in Revel. This can be done by modifying request parameters, skipping validation steps, or exploiting flaws in the validation implementation.
                * **Impact:** Data integrity issues, security bypass, application errors, potential for further exploitation.
                * **Mitigation:** Implement robust server-side validation for all user inputs. Do not rely solely on client-side validation. Ensure validation logic is comprehensive and covers all critical input points.
            * [HR] Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities (if applicable and not mitigated) [CRITICAL]
                * **Description:** Attackers exploit Revel's data binding features to overwrite sensitive model attributes by including unexpected parameters in form submissions. If not properly mitigated, attackers can modify data they should not have access to.
                * **Impact:** Data manipulation, privilege escalation, account takeover, unauthorized modification of sensitive information.
                * **Mitigation:** Implement proper whitelisting of allowed fields for data binding. Avoid directly updating models from request data without careful control. Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) or similar patterns to manage data transfer between requests and models.

    * **1.4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities (Framework-Assisted) [CRITICAL]**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting framework-level output encoding issues to inject and execute malicious scripts in users' browsers.
        * **High-Risk Path:** [HR] Reflected XSS due to Framework Output Encoding Issues [CRITICAL]
            * **Description:** Attackers inject XSS payloads into requests that are reflected back in the response without sufficient output encoding by Revel. This occurs when the framework's default encoding is insufficient or developers make mistakes in template rendering.
            * **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, malicious actions on user behalf, defacement of the application.
            * **Mitigation:** Understand and correctly utilize Revel's built-in output encoding mechanisms. Always escape user input before rendering it in templates. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS risks.

    * **1.5. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerabilities (Framework-Level) [CRITICAL]**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the absence or weakness of framework-level CSRF protection to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.
        * **High-Risk Path:** [HR] Lack of Default CSRF Protection (if not enabled or misconfigured) [CRITICAL]
            * **Description:** If CSRF protection is not enabled by default in Revel or is misconfigured by developers, attackers can craft malicious web pages or links that, when visited by an authenticated user, trigger unintended actions on the Revel application (e.g., changing passwords, making purchases).
            * **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user, data manipulation, privilege escalation.
            * **Mitigation:** Ensure CSRF protection is enabled and correctly configured in Revel. Understand Revel's CSRF protection mechanisms and avoid disabling or weakening them.

    * **1.6. Development Mode Exposure in Production [CRITICAL]**
        * **Attack Vectors:** Leaving development-related features enabled in production environments, exposing sensitive information and functionalities.
        * **High-Risk Paths:**
            * [HR] Debug Mode Enabled in Production [CRITICAL]
                * **Description:** Leaving Revel's debug mode enabled in production exposes debug endpoints, potentially revealing sensitive application information, configuration details, and internal workings. It might also expose functionalities intended only for development.
                * **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential access to administrative functions, aids further attacks.
                * **Mitigation:** **Strictly disable debug mode in production deployments.** Ensure proper configuration for production environments.
            * [HR] Verbose Error Logging in Production [CRITICAL]
                * **Description:**  Overly verbose error logging in production environments can reveal sensitive information in error messages, such as file paths, configuration details, database connection strings, and internal application logic.
                * **Impact:** Information disclosure, aids further attacks, potential for data breaches if sensitive data is logged.
                * **Mitigation:** Configure error logging in production to be minimal and not reveal sensitive information. Log errors securely and monitor them for suspicious patterns. Use centralized logging and security monitoring tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Revel Features or Misconfigurations [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_revel_features_or_misconfigurations__critical_.md)

* This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the misuse or misconfiguration of Revel's features, rather than inherent framework flaws.

    * **2.1. Insecure Configuration [CRITICAL]**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weak or default configurations within Revel applications.
        * **High-Risk Path:** [HR] Default Secret Keys Used [CRITICAL]
            * **Description:** Using default secret keys provided by Revel or not changing the default keys during application setup. These keys are often used for cryptographic operations like signing cookies or generating tokens. If default keys are known or easily guessed, attackers can bypass security mechanisms.
            * **Impact:** **Critical Compromise.** Session hijacking, bypassing authentication, data manipulation, potentially full application takeover depending on how the secret keys are used.
            * **Mitigation:** **Immediately change all default secret keys to strong, randomly generated values during application setup.** Securely store and manage secret keys. Regularly rotate keys as a security best practice.
