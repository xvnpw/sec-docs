  - security control: Implement centralized logging and monitoring for security events and anomalies in deployed applications.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: The framework should provide mechanisms to implement secure user authentication.
    - Requirement: Support for various authentication methods (e.g., username/password, OAuth, API keys).
    - Requirement: Secure session management to protect user sessions from hijacking.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: The framework should enable fine-grained access control to resources and functionalities.
    - Requirement: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) should be implementable.
    - Requirement: Protection against unauthorized access to sensitive data and operations.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The framework should facilitate robust input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, XSS).
    - Requirement: Validation should be applied to all input sources (e.g., HTTP requests, API calls).
    - Requirement: Clear error handling for invalid input without revealing sensitive information.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: The framework should support secure cryptographic operations for data protection.
    - Requirement: Secure storage of sensitive data, including passwords and API keys (e.g., using hashing, encryption).
    - Requirement: Secure communication channels using HTTPS/TLS.
    - Requirement: Support for encryption of data at rest and in transit where necessary.
