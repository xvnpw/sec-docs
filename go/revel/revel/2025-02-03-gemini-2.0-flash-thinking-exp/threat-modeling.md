# Threat Model Analysis for revel/revel

## Threat: [Insecure Route Configuration](./threats/insecure_route_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker identifies misconfigured routes in `conf/routes` that expose sensitive functionalities (e.g., admin panels, internal APIs) without proper authentication. They can directly access these routes by crafting specific URLs, bypassing intended access controls.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to administrative functions, data breaches, application compromise, potential for further attacks.
*   **Revel Component Affected:** Routing (`conf/routes`, `controllers`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly review and audit `conf/routes` for proper access control and intended exposure.
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization checks in controllers for all routes, especially those handling sensitive operations.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining routes and access permissions.
    *   Use route groups and prefixes to organize routes and apply common security policies.

## Threat: [Parameter Tampering via Routing](./threats/parameter_tampering_via_routing.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker manipulates URL parameters in Revel routes to alter application behavior. They can modify parameters to bypass authorization checks, access different resources, or inject malicious data into the application's processing logic within Revel controllers.
*   **Impact:** Data manipulation, unauthorized access to resources, injection vulnerabilities (SQL injection, command injection if parameters are used unsafely), application logic bypass.
*   **Revel Component Affected:** Routing (`conf/routes`), Controllers (Action parameters)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all route parameters within controllers before using them in application logic.
    *   Use strong input validation libraries and techniques within Revel controllers.
    *   Avoid directly using route parameters in sensitive operations like database queries without proper sanitization and parameterization within Revel actions.
    *   Implement authorization checks based on user roles and permissions, not solely relying on parameter values in Revel routes.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker gains access to `conf/app.conf` or other Revel configuration files containing sensitive information (database credentials, API keys, secrets). This can happen through misconfigured web servers, insecure deployments specific to Revel applications, or version control exposure of Revel project files. They can then extract credentials and secrets to compromise the application and related systems.
*   **Impact:** Full application compromise, data breaches, unauthorized access to backend systems, potential financial loss, reputational damage.
*   **Revel Component Affected:** Configuration (`conf/app.conf`, `conf/`)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict access to Revel configuration files to only necessary personnel and processes.
    *   Store sensitive configuration data securely, consider using environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions instead of plain text files within Revel deployments.
    *   Ensure proper web server configuration to prevent direct access to Revel configuration files.
    *   Do not commit sensitive Revel configuration files to version control systems.
    *   Implement regular security audits of Revel deployment processes and configurations.

## Threat: [Weak Session Management Implementation](./threats/weak_session_management_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits weaknesses in Revel's session management or its configuration. This could involve predictable session IDs generated by Revel, insecure default session storage used by Revel, or lack of proper session invalidation within Revel applications. They can hijack user sessions to gain unauthorized access to accounts and functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, unauthorized access to user data and functionalities, impersonation of legitimate users, potential data breaches.
*   **Revel Component Affected:** Session Management (Sessions module, Cookies)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong and unpredictable session ID generation within Revel configurations.
    *   Configure secure session cookie attributes (HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite) in Revel applications.
    *   Implement proper session invalidation on logout and timeout within Revel controllers.
    *   Consider using secure session storage mechanisms supported by or integrated with Revel.
    *   Regularly review and test session management implementation in Revel applications.

## Threat: [Framework-Specific Validation Bypass](./threats/framework-specific_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker identifies and exploits nuances or edge cases in Revel's validation mechanisms to bypass intended validation rules. They craft malicious input that circumvents Revel's validation checks, allowing them to inject malicious data or trigger unintended application behavior within Revel applications.
*   **Impact:** Injection vulnerabilities (SQL injection, command injection, etc.), data integrity issues, application logic bypass, potential for further attacks.
*   **Revel Component Affected:** Validation (`revel.Validation`, `controllers`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly understand and correctly implement Revel's validation features.
    *   Test validation logic extensively with various input types, including boundary and edge cases, within Revel controllers.
    *   Use a combination of client-side and server-side validation in Revel applications.
    *   Employ input sanitization in addition to Revel validation to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Stay updated with Revel security advisories and best practices related to validation.

## Threat: [Misuse of Revel-Specific Features (Interceptors, Filters, Actions)](./threats/misuse_of_revel-specific_features__interceptors__filters__actions_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits vulnerabilities introduced by incorrect or insecure use of Revel's features like interceptors, filters, and actions. Misconfigured Revel interceptors might bypass security checks, or filters might introduce unintended security weaknesses in Revel applications.
*   **Impact:** Authorization bypass, unintended application behavior, security breaches, potential for further attacks.
*   **Revel Component Affected:** Interceptors, Filters, Actions (Controllers, `app/init.go`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly understand the functionality and security implications of Revel's interceptors, filters, and actions.
    *   Carefully design and implement interceptors and filters to ensure they enforce intended security policies correctly within Revel applications.
    *   Regularly review and audit the implementation of interceptors, filters, and actions for potential security flaws in Revel applications.
    *   Follow Revel best practices and security guidelines when using these features.
