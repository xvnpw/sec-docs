### 4. Deep Analysis of Server-Side Template Injection in Revel

#### 4.1 Understanding Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)

Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) is a vulnerability that arises when a web application embeds user-controllable data directly into server-side templates without proper sanitization or escaping. Template engines are designed to generate dynamic web pages by combining static templates with dynamic data.  However, if an attacker can control part of the template itself, they can inject malicious template directives or code that will be executed by the template engine on the server.

In the context of Revel, which uses Go's `html/template` package, SSTI occurs when user input is directly placed within a Go template and rendered without appropriate escaping. This allows an attacker to manipulate the template logic and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.

#### 4.2 Revel and Go Templates: The Vulnerable Interaction

Revel leverages Go's powerful `html/template` package for rendering views. This package provides a flexible and efficient way to generate HTML output. However, its power also presents a security risk if not used carefully.

**How Revel Uses Templates:**

* Revel applications typically define views as `.html` files located in the `app/views` directory.
* Controllers pass data to these views as context (often a `map[string]interface{}`).
* Templates use Go template syntax (directives enclosed in `{{` and `}}`) to access and display this data.

**The SSTI Vulnerability Point:**

The vulnerability arises when a Revel application directly incorporates user-provided input into a template *without proper escaping*.  If the template engine interprets this user input as template code rather than just plain text, SSTI becomes possible.

**Example Scenario (Vulnerable Code - Do NOT Implement):**

Let's imagine a simplified Revel controller and view:

**Controller (app/controllers/app.go):**

```go
package controllers

import "github.com/revel/revel"

type App struct {
	*revel.Controller
}

func (c App) Index(userInput string) revel.Result {
	return c.Render(revel.Map{"UserInput": userInput}) // Potentially vulnerable!
}
```

**View (app/views/App/Index.html):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Welcome</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>User Input: {{.UserInput}}</p>  <!-- Vulnerable line -->
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, if a user provides input like `{{ .Execute "os/exec" "Command" "whoami" }}` as the `userInput` query parameter, the Revel application, without proper escaping, will render the view and execute the injected Go template code. This would result in the `whoami` command being executed on the server.

#### 4.3 Exploitation Techniques in Go Templates within Revel

Attackers can leverage various Go template directives and functions to exploit SSTI vulnerabilities in Revel applications. Here are some potential techniques:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via `os/exec`:** As demonstrated in the example, the `{{ .Execute "os/exec" "Command" ... }}` directive can be used to execute arbitrary system commands.  Attackers can use this to gain complete control of the server.

* **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access server-side variables, environment variables, or even read files using Go template functions (if available or custom functions are poorly secured).  For example, if a custom template function exposed file system access, it could be exploited.

* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Maliciously crafted template payloads can be designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory) leading to a Denial of Service.  Complex template logic or recursive structures could be used for this purpose.

* **Data Exfiltration (Indirect):** While direct data exfiltration might be less common via SSTI itself, attackers could use RCE to exfiltrate data through other channels (e.g., uploading to an external server, sending data in DNS requests).

* **Privilege Escalation (Local):** If the Revel application runs with elevated privileges, successful SSTI exploitation can lead to privilege escalation on the server.

**Example Payloads:**

* **Basic RCE (Linux):** `{{ .Execute "os/exec" "Command" "id" }}`
* **Basic RCE (Windows):** `{{ .Execute "os/exec" "Command" "whoami" }}`
* **Attempt to read environment variable (might be restricted by default):** `{{ .Env.PATH }}` (Note: Direct access to `.Env` might be restricted in default Go templates, but custom functions could expose such access).

**Important Note:** The effectiveness of specific payloads may depend on the Go version, Revel configuration, and any custom template functions or security measures in place. However, the core principle of SSTI exploitation remains the same: injecting malicious template code to be executed by the server.

#### 4.4 Impact and Risk Severity

The impact of SSTI vulnerabilities in Revel applications is **Critical**. Successful exploitation can lead to:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the most severe consequence, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
* **Full Server Compromise:** RCE can lead to complete control over the server, including access to sensitive data, system configuration, and the ability to install malware or pivot to other systems.
* **Data Breaches:** Attackers can access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored on the server, including databases, configuration files, and user data.
* **System Disruption and Denial of Service:** Attackers can disrupt application functionality, cause downtime, or launch Denial of Service attacks.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful SSTI attack and subsequent data breach or system compromise can severely damage the reputation of the organization using the vulnerable application.

Given the potential for complete server compromise and severe business impact, SSTI vulnerabilities are considered **Critical** risk.

#### 4.5 Mitigation Strategies for SSTI in Revel Applications

To effectively mitigate SSTI vulnerabilities in Revel applications, development teams should implement the following strategies:

##### 4.5.1 Context-Aware Escaping in Templates

**Best Practice:**  **Always use Go's template engine's built-in escaping mechanisms** when displaying user-controlled data in templates.

Go's `html/template` package provides built-in escaping functions that should be used to ensure output is properly encoded for the intended context.

* **`{{.UserInput | html}}` (HTML Escaping):**  Use this for displaying user input within HTML content. It escapes characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, and `'` to their HTML entity equivalents, preventing HTML injection and XSS.  **This is the most common and crucial escaping function for general text content.**

* **`{{.UserInput | js}}` (JavaScript Escaping):** Use this when embedding user input within JavaScript code blocks or attributes. It escapes characters that have special meaning in JavaScript strings, preventing JavaScript injection.

* **`{{.UserInput | urlquery}}` (URL Query Escaping):** Use this when embedding user input into URL query parameters. It escapes characters that are not allowed in URLs.

* **`{{.UserInput | css}}` (CSS Escaping):** Use this when embedding user input within CSS styles. It escapes characters that have special meaning in CSS.

**Corrected Example (Mitigated View - Recommended):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Welcome</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>User Input: {{.UserInput | html}}</p>  <!-- HTML Escaping Applied -->
</body>
</html>
```

By using `{{.UserInput | html}}`, even if a user provides malicious template code as input, it will be treated as plain text and displayed as escaped HTML entities, preventing SSTI exploitation.

##### 4.5.2 Avoid Direct User Input in Raw Templates

**Best Practice:** **Minimize or eliminate direct embedding of user-controlled input into templates.**

Instead of directly passing user input to templates, **process and sanitize data in controllers** before passing it to the view. This approach reduces the risk of accidentally forgetting to escape input in templates.

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Receive User Input in Controller:**  Get user input from request parameters, forms, etc.
2. **Sanitize and Process in Controller:**  Perform necessary validation, sanitization, and processing of the user input *within the controller logic*.  This might involve:
    * **Whitelisting allowed characters or formats.**
    * **Using input validation libraries.**
    * **Encoding or transforming data as needed.**
3. **Pass Sanitized Data to Template:**  Only pass the *sanitized and processed* data to the template for rendering.

**Example (Improved Controller - Recommended):**

```go
package controllers

import (
	"html"
	"github.com/revel/revel"
)

type App struct {
	*revel.Controller
}

func (c App) Index(userInput string) revel.Result {
	sanitizedInput := html.EscapeString(userInput) // Sanitize in controller
	return c.Render(revel.Map{"UserInput": sanitizedInput}) // Pass sanitized data
}
```

**View (app/views/App/Index.html) - Remains the same (or can be simplified):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Welcome</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>User Input: {{.UserInput}}</p>  <!-- Now safe as input is already sanitized -->
</body>
</html>
```

In this improved example, the `html.EscapeString` function is used in the controller to sanitize the user input *before* it's passed to the template. This ensures that even if the template is rendered without explicit escaping, the data is already safe.

##### 4.5.3 Restrict Custom Template Functions

**Best Practice:** **Carefully review, secure, and minimize the use of custom template functions.**

Revel allows developers to register custom functions that can be used within templates.  If these custom functions are not carefully designed and secured, they can become a significant source of SSTI vulnerabilities.

**Risks of Custom Template Functions:**

* **Access to Sensitive Operations:** Custom functions might inadvertently provide access to sensitive operations like file system access, system commands, or database interactions.
* **Unintended Functionality:** Poorly written custom functions might introduce unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

**Mitigation for Custom Functions:**

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design custom functions with the principle of least privilege in mind.  Grant them only the necessary permissions and capabilities.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization within Functions:**  If custom functions handle user input, ensure they perform thorough input validation and sanitization *within the function itself*.
* **Code Review and Security Audits:**  Subject custom template functions to rigorous code review and security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Minimize Custom Functions:**  Whenever possible, avoid creating custom template functions that handle sensitive operations or user input.  Consider performing such logic in controllers instead.
* **Secure Function Implementations:** If custom functions are necessary, implement them securely, avoiding functions that provide direct access to `os/exec`, file system operations, or other potentially dangerous functionalities.

##### 4.5.4 Content Security Policy (CSP)

**Best Practice:** **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to reduce the impact of SSTI and XSS.**

While CSP is not a direct prevention for SSTI, it can significantly limit the damage an attacker can cause even if SSTI is successfully exploited. CSP allows you to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.).

**How CSP Helps with SSTI:**

* **Mitigating RCE Impact (Indirectly):** If an attacker achieves RCE via SSTI and injects malicious JavaScript, CSP can restrict the browser from executing inline scripts or loading scripts from untrusted origins. This can limit the attacker's ability to perform actions like data exfiltration or further compromise the user's browser.
* **Reducing XSS Risk:** CSP is primarily designed to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which are often related to template injection vulnerabilities. By enforcing strict CSP policies, you can make it harder for attackers to inject and execute malicious scripts even if they find a way to inject HTML or JavaScript through SSTI.

**Example CSP Header (Restrictive - Adjust as needed):**

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'none'; form-action 'self'; upgrade-insecure-requests; block-all-mixed-content;
```

**Key CSP Directives for SSTI Mitigation:**

* **`script-src 'self'`:**  Only allow scripts from the application's own origin. This prevents execution of externally hosted malicious scripts.
* **`object-src 'none'`:** Disable plugins like Flash, which can be exploited for XSS and other attacks.
* **`frame-ancestors 'none'`:** Prevent the application from being embedded in `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, or `<object>` elements on other domains, mitigating clickjacking and related attacks.
* **`base-uri 'none'`:** Restrict the base URL for relative URLs, preventing attackers from manipulating the base URL to load resources from malicious origins.
* **`form-action 'self'`:**  Restrict form submissions to the application's own origin.

**Implementation:** Revel allows setting custom headers, including CSP headers, in middleware or controller responses.

**Important:** CSP should be carefully configured and tested to ensure it doesn't break legitimate application functionality while effectively mitigating security risks.

#### 4.6 Testing and Detection of SSTI Vulnerabilities

* **Manual Code Review:** Carefully review all templates and controller code to identify potential injection points where user input is directly embedded in templates without proper escaping.
* **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools that can analyze Go code and identify potential SSTI vulnerabilities by detecting patterns of unescaped user input in template rendering.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools or manual penetration testing techniques to actively probe the application for SSTI vulnerabilities by injecting various payloads and observing the server's response.
* **Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing techniques to automatically generate a wide range of inputs and template payloads to test for unexpected behavior or errors that might indicate SSTI vulnerabilities.
* **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the application code and infrastructure to identify and remediate potential SSTI vulnerabilities and other security weaknesses.

#### 4.7 Recommendations for Development Team

Based on this deep analysis, the following recommendations are crucial for the development team to prevent and mitigate SSTI vulnerabilities in Revel applications:

1. **Prioritize Context-Aware Escaping:** Make context-aware escaping (using `| html`, `| js`, etc.) a **mandatory practice** for all user-controlled data displayed in templates. Implement code review processes to enforce this.
2. **Sanitize Input in Controllers:** Shift towards sanitizing and processing user input in controllers *before* passing it to templates. This provides an extra layer of defense.
3. **Strictly Control Custom Template Functions:**  Thoroughly review, secure, and minimize the use of custom template functions. Audit existing functions and restrict their capabilities.
4. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Deploy and maintain a strong CSP policy to limit the impact of potential SSTI or XSS vulnerabilities.
5. **Regular Security Testing:** Integrate security testing (SAST, DAST, manual penetration testing) into the development lifecycle to proactively identify and fix SSTI vulnerabilities.
6. **Developer Training:** Provide training to developers on SSTI vulnerabilities, secure template coding practices, and the importance of input sanitization and output escaping.
7. **Security Awareness:** Foster a security-conscious development culture where developers are aware of and actively address security risks like SSTI.

By implementing these mitigation strategies and recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of SSTI vulnerabilities in their Revel applications and build more secure and resilient systems.
