# Threat Model Analysis for revel/revel

## Threat: [Improper Route Handling and Ambiguity](./threats/improper_route_handling_and_ambiguity.md)

**Description:** An attacker might craft specific URLs that match multiple route definitions with varying access controls. This allows them to bypass intended authorization or access unintended functionalities. They exploit the order or ambiguity in route definitions to trigger the wrong handler, a behavior directly managed by Revel's routing mechanism.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to application features, potential data breaches, bypassing security controls.

**Affected Revel Component:** `revel.Router`, `revel.Controller` (through incorrect routing logic within Revel).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Define specific and non-overlapping route patterns.
*   Utilize Revel's route precedence rules explicitly.
*   Thoroughly test route configurations with various inputs.
*   Avoid overly broad or wildcard route definitions where possible.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Revel's Template Engine](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_revel's_template_engine.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into user-controlled data that is then directly rendered by Revel's template engine without proper sanitization. The vulnerability lies in how Revel integrates with the underlying template engine and handles data passed to it.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, access to sensitive data, denial of service.

**Affected Revel Component:** `revel.TemplateLoader`, the specific template engine used (e.g., `html/template`) as integrated by Revel.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always sanitize user input before embedding it in templates.
*   Utilize Revel's built-in template functions for escaping and sanitization (e.g., `{{. | html}}`).
*   Avoid constructing templates dynamically from user input.
*   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful injection.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker submits extra or unexpected fields in form data that get bound to model attributes due to Revel's data binding feature. This is a direct consequence of how Revel's `Bind` functionality operates.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized modification of application state, privilege escalation.

**Affected Revel Component:** `revel.Controller` (data binding mechanisms like `Bind`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Explicitly define allowed fields for data binding using whitelisting techniques (e.g., using specific struct tags or functions).
*   Avoid directly binding request data to database models without careful consideration.
*   Implement validation rules to ensure only expected data is accepted.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Session Configuration](./threats/insecure_default_session_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits insecure default session settings configured by Revel, such as weak session ID generation or missing security flags on cookies (HTTPOnly, Secure). This vulnerability stems from Revel's default session management setup.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts, potential data breaches.

**Affected Revel Component:** `revel.Session`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Review and configure session settings appropriately for production environments.
*   Ensure strong session ID generation.
*   Set the `HTTPOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies.
*   Consider using a secure session storage mechanism (e.g., database-backed sessions).

## Threat: [Session Fixation Vulnerabilities](./threats/session_fixation_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker can trick a user into using a pre-existing session ID controlled by the attacker. If Revel's session management doesn't enforce session ID regeneration after successful login, this vulnerability exists.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Affected Revel Component:** `revel.Session`, specifically how Revel handles session creation and regeneration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regenerate session IDs upon successful user authentication.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Development Mode](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_development_mode.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to a Revel application running in development mode. Revel's development mode inherently includes features that expose sensitive information.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, easier exploitation of other vulnerabilities, potential for direct access to development resources.

**Affected Revel Component:** `revel.DevMode`, `revel.ErrorHandler` (as configured in development mode).

**Risk Severity:** High (if development instance is publicly accessible).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure development mode is strictly limited to development environments and is not accessible publicly.
*   Implement network restrictions and authentication for development instances.
*   Disable or restrict access to development-specific features in non-development environments.
