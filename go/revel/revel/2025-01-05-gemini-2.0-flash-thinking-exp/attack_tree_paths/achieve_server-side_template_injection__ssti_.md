## Deep Analysis: Achieve Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in a Revel Application

As a cybersecurity expert working with your development team, let's dissect the "Achieve Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)" attack path within a Revel application. This analysis will delve into the specifics of how this vulnerability can manifest in a Revel context, the potential impact, and crucial mitigation strategies.

**Understanding Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**

SSTI occurs when an attacker can inject malicious code into template directives that are processed and executed on the server-side. Instead of simply displaying data, the template engine interprets the injected code, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This often leads to complete server compromise, including:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker can run any command they desire on the server.
* **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive data stored on the server.
* **Server Takeover:** Complete control over the application and potentially the underlying infrastructure.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashing the application or server.

**SSTI in the Context of Revel**

Revel, being a full-stack Go web framework, utilizes the standard Go `html/template` package for rendering views. While `html/template` offers some built-in protection against basic cross-site scripting (XSS) through auto-escaping, it's still susceptible to SSTI if user-controlled data is directly embedded within template directives without proper sanitization or contextual escaping.

**Attack Vectors in Revel Applications**

Here are potential entry points where an attacker could inject malicious code leading to SSTI in a Revel application:

1. **Direct Injection into Template Data:**
   * **User Input in Forms:** If user input from forms is directly passed to the template without proper sanitization, attackers can craft malicious payloads.
   * **URL Parameters:** Similar to forms, data passed through URL parameters can be vulnerable if used directly in templates.
   * **Database Content:** If data retrieved from the database, which might have been previously injected by an attacker, is used in templates without sanitization.
   * **External APIs:** Data fetched from external APIs, if not carefully validated, could contain malicious template directives.

2. **Indirect Injection through Template Functions:**
   * **Custom Template Functions:** If the application defines custom template functions that process user input and then return values used within the template, vulnerabilities in these functions can lead to SSTI.
   * **Abuse of Built-in Functions:** While less common with `html/template`, attackers might try to exploit the behavior of built-in functions if they can control their arguments.

**Exploitation Steps**

An attacker attempting to achieve SSTI in a Revel application would likely follow these steps:

1. **Identify Potential Injection Points:** They would analyze the application's code, particularly the controllers and templates, looking for places where user-controlled data is used within template directives.
2. **Craft Malicious Payloads:**  They would craft payloads that leverage the syntax of Go's `html/template` to execute arbitrary code. This often involves using functions or language constructs that allow interaction with the operating system.
3. **Inject the Payload:** They would inject the malicious payload through the identified entry points (e.g., form fields, URL parameters).
4. **Trigger Template Rendering:** They would trigger the server to render the template containing the injected payload.
5. **Code Execution:** The Revel server, upon rendering the template, would execute the malicious code injected by the attacker.

**Example (Conceptual - Be cautious when testing similar payloads):**

Let's imagine a vulnerable Revel controller action and template:

**Controller (hypothetical):**

```go
package controllers

import "github.com/revel/revel"

type App struct {
	*revel.Controller
}

func (c App) Hello(name string) revel.Result {
	return c.Render(name) // Vulnerable: Directly passing user input to the template
}
```

**Template (app/views/App/Hello.html):**

```html
<h1>Hello, {{.}}.</h1>
```

An attacker could send a request like: `/hello?name={{ .Getenv "HOSTNAME" }}`

In this simplified example, if the template engine directly evaluates `{{ .Getenv "HOSTNAME" }}`, it would execute the `Getenv` function and display the server's hostname. More dangerous payloads could involve executing shell commands.

**Impact and Consequences**

Successful SSTI in a Revel application can have severe consequences:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** As demonstrated in the example, attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to complete compromise.
* **Data Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive data stored on the server, including database credentials, user information, and application secrets.
* **Server Takeover:** With RCE, attackers can install backdoors, create new user accounts, and gain persistent access to the server.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can execute commands that consume server resources or crash the application.
* **Lateral Movement:** If the compromised server is part of a larger network, attackers might use it as a stepping stone to attack other systems.

**Mitigation Strategies for Revel Applications**

Preventing SSTI requires a multi-layered approach:

1. **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
   * **Validate all user input:**  Ensure that data received from users conforms to expected formats and lengths.
   * **Sanitize input before use:**  Remove or escape potentially dangerous characters. However, relying solely on sanitization for SSTI prevention is risky, as attackers can often find ways to bypass filters.

2. **Contextual Output Encoding (Escaping):**
   * **Leverage `html/template`'s Auto-Escaping:** Revel uses `html/template`, which provides automatic escaping for HTML contexts. This helps prevent basic XSS but doesn't fully protect against SSTI.
   * **Be Mindful of Non-HTML Contexts:** If you are generating output in other formats (e.g., JSON, XML) within your templates, ensure proper escaping for those contexts.

3. **Avoid Direct Embedding of User Input in Template Directives:**
   * **Pre-process data in controllers:**  Manipulate and prepare data in your controllers before passing it to the templates.
   * **Use safe template functions:**  Stick to standard template functions and avoid creating custom functions that directly process user input without careful security considerations.

4. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
   * **Run the application with minimal necessary privileges:** This limits the damage an attacker can cause even if they achieve RCE.

5. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
   * **Implement a strong CSP:**  While not a direct defense against SSTI, CSP can help mitigate the impact of successful attacks by restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources, reducing the effectiveness of some post-exploitation techniques.

6. **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
   * **Conduct thorough code reviews:**  Specifically look for instances where user input is being used within template directives.
   * **Perform penetration testing:**  Simulate real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities.

7. **Keep Framework and Dependencies Up-to-Date:**
   * **Regularly update Revel and its dependencies:**  Security vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched in framework updates.

8. **Consider Using a Sandboxed Template Engine (If Feasible):**
   * While Revel directly uses `html/template`, in scenarios where security is paramount and complex templating logic is required, consider alternative template engines with stronger sandboxing capabilities (though this might require significant changes to the application).

**Detection and Mitigation After an Attack**

If you suspect an SSTI attack:

* **Isolate the affected server:** Prevent further damage and lateral movement.
* **Analyze logs:** Look for suspicious activity, error messages related to template rendering, and unusual requests.
* **Identify the entry point:** Determine how the attacker injected the malicious payload.
* **Patch the vulnerability:** Implement the necessary mitigation strategies.
* **Restore from backups:** If necessary, restore the application and data from a clean backup.
* **Conduct a thorough security review:** Identify and address any other potential vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion**

Server-Side Template Injection is a critical vulnerability that can have devastating consequences for Revel applications. By understanding the potential attack vectors, implementing robust mitigation strategies, and conducting regular security assessments, you can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability being exploited.
