## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious code into user-controlled input rendered by templates](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_user-controlled_input_rendered_by_templates.md)

* Description: An attacker injects malicious code (e.g., JavaScript, server-side code snippets) into user-controlled input fields (forms, URL parameters) that are subsequently rendered by the template engine without proper sanitization or escaping.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Critical (Remote Code Execution)
    * Effort: Medium
    * Skill Level: Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Send requests with unexpected parameters to modify sensitive data](./attack_tree_paths/send_requests_with_unexpected_parameters_to_modify_sensitive_data.md)

* Description: An attacker crafts HTTP requests containing additional or unexpected parameters that are not intended to be modified by users. Due to insufficient input validation or lack of proper data binding controls, these parameters are successfully bound to internal application objects, leading to unauthorized modification of sensitive data.
    * Likelihood: High
    * Impact: High (Data Breach, Unauthorized Modification)
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain Sensitive Information via Error Messages](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_sensitive_information_via_error_messages.md)

* Description: The application, when encountering errors, displays detailed error messages to the user. These messages inadvertently reveal sensitive information such as stack traces, internal file paths, database connection strings, or other configuration details. This information can be leveraged by attackers to gain a deeper understanding of the application's architecture and potential vulnerabilities.
    * Likelihood: High
    * Impact: Medium (Information Disclosure)
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Utilize Debug Endpoints or Tools](./attack_tree_paths/utilize_debug_endpoints_or_tools.md)

* Description: Development or debugging endpoints, intended for internal use during the development phase, are mistakenly left enabled in the production environment. Attackers can access these endpoints to gain insights into the application's state, execute arbitrary code, or perform other administrative actions.
    * Likelihood: Low
    * Impact: High (Information Disclosure, Potential for Code Execution or System Manipulation)
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Dev Mode Specific Endpoints/Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/access_dev_mode_specific_endpointsfunctionality.md)

* Description: Features or endpoints specifically designed for development purposes (e.g., code reloading, debugging interfaces, test routes) are not properly disabled or secured in the production deployment. Attackers can exploit these features to bypass security controls, gain access to sensitive information, or manipulate the application's behavior.
    * Likelihood: Low
    * Impact: High (Information Disclosure, Potential for Code Execution or System Manipulation)
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Revel Application](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_revel_application.md)

* Description: The ultimate goal of the attacker, representing the successful breach of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Template Engine Vulnerabilities (Go Templates)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_template_engine_vulnerabilities__go_templates_.md)

* Description: This node represents the category of attacks targeting the template engine used by Revel. Successful exploitation can lead to Server-Side Template Injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

* Description: A vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious code into template directives, which is then executed by the server. This often leads to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parameter Binding Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parameter_binding_weaknesses.md)

* Description: This node represents the category of attacks that exploit how Revel binds request parameters to application data structures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

* Description: A specific type of parameter binding vulnerability where attackers can modify unintended data by including extra parameters in their requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Error Handling and Debugging Features (Left Enabled in Production)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_error_handling_and_debugging_features__left_enabled_in_production_.md)

* Description: This node represents the category of attacks that exploit improperly configured error handling or debugging features in a production environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Revel's Dev Mode Features in Production](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_revel's_dev_mode_features_in_production.md)

* Description: This node represents the category of attacks that target development-specific features or endpoints that are inadvertently exposed in a production environment.
