# Attack Surface Analysis for revel/revel

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate URL route parameters to inject malicious data or commands.
    *   **How Revel Contributes:** Revel's routing mechanism relies on defining routes with parameters that are then accessible within controller actions. If these parameters are not properly sanitized or validated, they become an injection point.
    *   **Example:** A route like `/users/{id}` could be accessed as `/users/../etc/passwd` to attempt path traversal if the `id` parameter is not validated.
    *   **Impact:** Path traversal, command injection (if parameters are used in system calls), or indirect SQL injection (if parameters are used in database queries without sanitization).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on all route parameters within controller actions.
        *   Use whitelisting to define allowed characters or patterns for route parameters.
        *   Avoid directly using route parameters in system commands or database queries without proper sanitization and parameterization.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when accessing files based on route parameters.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send unexpected or malicious request parameters that are automatically bound to model fields, potentially modifying sensitive data.
    *   **How Revel Contributes:** Revel's automatic parameter binding feature, especially when not using `FieldFilter` effectively, can lead to this vulnerability. If developers don't explicitly control which fields can be bound, attackers can inject data into unintended fields.
    *   **Example:**  A user registration form might have fields for `username` and `password`. An attacker could send an additional parameter like `isAdmin=true` which, if not filtered, could be bound to an `isAdmin` field in the user model, granting them administrative privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, privilege escalation, unauthorized modification of data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Revel's `FieldFilter` to explicitly define which request parameters can be bound to model fields.
        *   Avoid directly binding request parameters to sensitive model fields.
        *   Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or specific view models to handle incoming data and map only the necessary fields to domain models.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template expressions that are then executed on the server.
    *   **How Revel Contributes:** Revel uses the Go `html/template` package. While generally safer than some other template engines, improper use of template functions or allowing user-controlled data within template logic without proper escaping can lead to SSTI.
    *   **Example:**  A developer might use a template function that directly executes a string provided by user input. An attacker could inject template syntax to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user-controlled data directly within template expressions.
        *   Sanitize and escape user-provided data before rendering it in templates, ensuring context-appropriate escaping (HTML, JavaScript, etc.).
        *   Restrict the use of dynamic template functions and carefully review any custom template functions.
        *   Consider using a template engine with stronger security features or sandboxing if the application requires complex dynamic templating.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Session Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_session_management.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how user sessions are created, maintained, and invalidated.
    *   **How Revel Contributes:** Revel's built-in session management relies on cookies. If not configured securely, these cookies can be vulnerable.
    *   **Example:**  Session cookies lacking the `HttpOnly` flag can be accessed by client-side JavaScript, leading to session hijacking via XSS. Session IDs generated using weak algorithms can be predictable, allowing attackers to impersonate users.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure session cookies have the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags set in production environments.
        *   Use cryptographically secure random number generators for session ID generation.
        *   Implement session regeneration after successful login to prevent session fixation attacks.
        *   Set appropriate session timeouts and implement proper logout functionality.
        *   Consider using secure session storage mechanisms if default cookie-based storage is insufficient.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Debug Endpoints/Development Mode](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_debug_endpointsdevelopment_mode.md)

*   **Description:**  Development or debugging features are unintentionally left enabled in production environments.
    *   **How Revel Contributes:** Revel has a "dev mode" that provides helpful debugging tools and more verbose logging. If not properly disabled for production deployment, these features can become attack vectors.
    *   **Example:**  Debug routes might allow attackers to inspect application state, trigger specific code paths, or even execute arbitrary code. Verbose logging might expose sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:**  Information disclosure, remote code execution, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Revel is configured to run in production mode for live deployments.
        *   Disable or remove any development-specific routes, endpoints, or middleware before deploying to production.
        *   Regularly review the application configuration to ensure no debugging features are inadvertently enabled.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal in Static File Serving](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_in_static_file_serving.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate URLs to access files outside the intended static asset directory.
    *   **How Revel Contributes:** Revel provides a mechanism for serving static files. If not configured carefully, vulnerabilities can arise.
    *   **Example:** An attacker might request `/public/../../../../etc/passwd` to try and access the system's password file.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files, potential server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that the static file serving configuration is properly restricted to the intended directory.
        *   Avoid using user-provided input to construct paths for serving static files.
        *   Implement checks to prevent access to parent directories (e.g., blocking `..` sequences).
