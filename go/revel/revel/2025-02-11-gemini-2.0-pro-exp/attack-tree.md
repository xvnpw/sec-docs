## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Bypass Authorization Checks by Calling Internal-Only Methods (Controller Method Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__bypass_authorization_checks_by_calling_internal-only_methods__controller_method_injection_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker manipulates route parameters to directly call controller methods that should only be accessible to authorized users (e.g., administrative functions).  Revel's routing mechanism, if not carefully configured with strict validation, might allow this.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement strict, whitelist-based validation of all route parameters.
    *   Perform authorization checks *within* each controller method, *not* just at the route level.  Don't rely solely on Revel's routing to enforce authorization.
    *   Use explicit routing configurations instead of relying heavily on Revel's "magic" routing conventions.
    *   Regularly audit controller methods and their associated routes.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1.1. Execute Arbitrary Go Code on the Server (RCE via Template Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_1__execute_arbitrary_go_code_on_the_server__rce_via_template_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious Go template code into a template, which is then executed by the server. This gives the attacker full control over the server process. This occurs if user-supplied data is used to construct the template itself, rather than being passed as a safe parameter.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (due to Go's `html/template` auto-escaping, but higher if improperly used)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   *Never* construct templates directly from user input.  Always use template parameters.
    *   Ensure that `html/template`'s auto-escaping is enabled and correctly configured.
    *   Sanitize all user-supplied data passed to templates, even if you believe it's already escaped.
    *   Regularly review template code for potential injection points.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1.1. Hijack the Victim's Session After They Authenticate (Session Fixation)](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_1__hijack_the_victim's_session_after_they_authenticate__session_fixation_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sets a known session ID for a victim user (e.g., by manipulating a URL or cookie).  When the victim authenticates, the attacker can then use the known session ID to hijack their session.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Regenerate session IDs after successful authentication.
    *   Ensure session IDs are not exposed in URLs.
    *   Use the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for session cookies.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1.1. Impersonate the Victim User (Session Hijacking)](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1_1__impersonate_the_victim_user__session_hijacking_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker steals a victim's session cookie (e.g., through network sniffing if HTTPS is not used, or via a separate XSS vulnerability). The attacker can then use the stolen cookie to impersonate the victim.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (assuming HTTPS is used)
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
     *   Enforce HTTPS for all communication.
     *   Use the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for session cookies.
     *   Implement session timeouts.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3.1.1. Gain Access to Other Users' Sessions (Weak Session ID Generation)](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_1_1__gain_access_to_other_users'_sessions__weak_session_id_generation_.md)

*   **Description:** If Revel uses a predictable algorithm for generating session IDs, an attacker might be able to predict future session IDs and gain access to other users' sessions.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use a cryptographically secure random number generator for session IDs.
    *   Ensure sufficient entropy for session ID generation.

## Attack Tree Path: [6.2.1.1. Obtain database credentials, API keys, or other secrets (Configuration File Exposure)](./attack_tree_paths/6_2_1_1__obtain_database_credentials__api_keys__or_other_secrets__configuration_file_exposure_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains direct access to the `app.conf` file (e.g., due to a misconfigured web server or directory traversal vulnerability). This file might contain sensitive information like database credentials.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Protect the `app.conf` file from unauthorized access.  Ensure it's not web-accessible.
    *   *Never* store sensitive credentials directly in `app.conf`.
    *   Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to store secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [7.2.1.1 Expose user data, session tokens, or other confidential details (Sensitive Data Leakage in Logs).](./attack_tree_paths/7_2_1_1_expose_user_data__session_tokens__or_other_confidential_details__sensitive_data_leakage_in_l_a3438b73.md)

*   **Description:**  Revel (or custom application code) logs sensitive information, such as user data, session tokens, or internal application details.  An attacker who gains access to the logs can then use this information.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   *Never* log sensitive data.
    *   Implement strict logging policies and review them regularly.
    *   Sanitize user input before logging it.
    *   Protect log files from unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [8.1.1.1 Aid attackers in understanding the application's internals and finding vulnerabilities (Information Disclosure via Error Messages).](./attack_tree_paths/8_1_1_1_aid_attackers_in_understanding_the_application's_internals_and_finding_vulnerabilities__info_04c301e9.md)

*   **Description:** Revel reveals sensitive information in error messages displayed to users (e.g., stack traces, database queries, file paths). This information can help attackers understand the application's structure and identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Configure Revel to display generic error messages to users.
    *   Log detailed error information internally, but *never* expose it to users.
    *   Implement robust error handling to prevent unhandled exceptions from revealing sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [9.1.1.1 Exploit the module's vulnerability to compromise the application (Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Modules).](./attack_tree_paths/9_1_1_1_exploit_the_module's_vulnerability_to_compromise_the_application__vulnerabilities_in_third-p_620256ea.md)

*   **Description:** A third-party Revel module used by the application has a known vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to compromise the application.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (assuming modules are kept up-to-date)
*   **Impact:** High (depends on the module and the vulnerability)
*   **Effort:** Medium (depends on the vulnerability)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Carefully vet all third-party modules before using them.
    *   Keep modules up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Use a dependency management tool to track and manage module versions.
    *   Regularly scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
