# Deep Analysis: Parameter Injection in Revel Controller Actions

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Parameter Injection in Controller Actions" attack surface within a Revel web application.  We aim to:

*   Understand the specific mechanisms by which Revel's routing and parameter handling can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   Identify common attack vectors and scenarios related to parameter injection.
*   Provide concrete, actionable recommendations for developers to mitigate these risks effectively.
*   Establish a clear understanding of the residual risk after mitigation.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack surface arising from how Revel's routing mechanism delivers parameters to controller actions.  It encompasses:

*   **All controller actions** within the Revel application that receive parameters from routes.
*   **All types of parameters**, including URL parameters, query parameters, and form data.
*   **All potential injection vulnerabilities** that can arise from mishandling these parameters, including but not limited to:
    *   SQL Injection
    *   Command Injection
    *   Path Traversal
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - if parameters are reflected in the response without proper encoding.
    *   NoSQL Injection (if applicable)
    *   LDAP Injection (if applicable)

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities unrelated to Revel's routing and parameter handling (e.g., general XSS vulnerabilities in templates that don't involve routed parameters).
*   Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries, except where Revel's parameter handling directly exacerbates them.
*   Infrastructure-level security issues (e.g., web server misconfiguration).

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine Revel's source code (specifically the routing and controller components) to understand the exact mechanisms of parameter passing.
2.  **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools (if available and suitable for Go and Revel) to identify potential injection vulnerabilities in the application's codebase.  This will involve searching for patterns of unsafe parameter usage.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Penetration Testing):**  Simulate attacks by crafting malicious inputs and observing the application's behavior.  This will involve:
    *   Fuzzing controller actions with various types of injected payloads.
    *   Attempting common injection attacks (SQLi, command injection, etc.) based on the application's functionality.
    *   Using automated vulnerability scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to identify potential injection points.
4.  **Threat Modeling:**  Develop threat models to identify likely attack scenarios and assess the potential impact of successful exploits.
5.  **Documentation Review:** Review Revel's official documentation and community resources for best practices and known security considerations related to parameter handling.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 4.1. Revel's Routing and Parameter Passing

Revel's routing mechanism is a core component that maps incoming HTTP requests to specific controller actions.  A typical route definition in `conf/routes` might look like this:

```
GET     /users/{id}             UserController.Show
POST    /users/{id}/update      UserController.Update
```

In this example, `{id}` is a route parameter.  Revel extracts the value of `id` from the URL and makes it available to the `Show` and `Update` actions of the `UserController`.  This is typically done through function arguments:

```go
func (c UserController) Show(id int) revel.Result {
    // ... use id ...
    return c.Render()
}

func (c UserController) Update(id int, userParams map[string]string) revel.Result {
 // ... use id and userParams
 return c.Render()
}
```

The crucial point is that Revel *directly* passes the extracted parameter value to the controller action.  There is no inherent sanitization or validation performed by Revel itself *during this passing process*.  The responsibility for handling the parameter safely lies entirely with the developer within the controller action.

### 4.2. Attack Vectors and Scenarios

Several attack vectors can exploit this direct parameter passing:

*   **SQL Injection:** If `id` is used directly in a SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.

    ```go
    // VULNERABLE CODE
    func (c UserController) Show(id int) revel.Result {
        query := fmt.Sprintf("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %d", id)
        // ... execute query ...
        return c.Render()
    }
    ```

    An attacker could provide a URL like `/users/1; DROP TABLE users;--` to potentially delete the entire `users` table.

*   **Command Injection:** If a parameter is used to construct a shell command, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands.

    ```go
    // VULNERABLE CODE
    func (c UserController) DeleteFile(filename string) revel.Result {
        cmd := exec.Command("rm", filename)
        err := cmd.Run()
        // ...
        return c.Render()
    }
    ```
    If filename is taken from route, attacker can provide filename like `../../some_important_file`

*   **Path Traversal:** If a parameter is used to construct a file path, an attacker can traverse the directory structure to access unauthorized files.

    ```go
    // VULNERABLE CODE
    func (c UserController) ReadFile(filepath string) revel.Result {
        data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(filepath)
        // ...
        return c.RenderText(string(data))
    }
    ```

    An attacker could provide a URL like `/readfile?filepath=../../etc/passwd` to potentially read the system's password file.

* **NoSQL Injection**
    ```go
    // VULNERABLE CODE
    func (c UserController) FindUser(username string) revel.Result {
	    // Assuming a MongoDB connection and a "users" collection
	    query := bson.M{"username": username}
	    var user User
	    err := c.MongoSession.DB("mydb").C("users").Find(query).One(&user)
	    // ...
	    return c.RenderJSON(user)
    }
    ```
    Attacker can provide username like this: `{"$ne": null}`. This will change query and return all users.

*   **XSS (Reflected):** While not a direct injection into backend systems, if a parameter is reflected back in the HTML response without proper encoding, it can lead to XSS.

    ```go
    // VULNERABLE CODE
    func (c UserController) Search(query string) revel.Result {
        return c.Render(query) // Directly rendering the query string
    }
    ```

    An attacker could provide a URL like `/search?query=<script>alert('XSS')</script>` to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.

### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The following mitigation strategies are crucial for developers to implement:

1.  **Input Validation (Strict and Specific):**

    *   **Use Revel's Validation Framework:** Revel provides a built-in validation framework (`revel.Validation`).  Use it to define strict validation rules for *every* parameter received from the routing mechanism.
        ```go
        func (c UserController) Show(id int) revel.Result {
            c.Validation.Required(id)
            c.Validation.Min(id, 1) // Ensure id is a positive integer

            if c.Validation.HasErrors() {
                c.Validation.Keep()
                c.FlashParams()
                return c.Redirect(routes.UserController.Index()) // Or handle errors appropriately
            }
            // ... proceed with validated id ...
            return c.Render()
        }
        ```
    *   **Define Specific Data Types:**  Use the most specific data type possible for each parameter.  For example, if a parameter is expected to be an integer, use `int` instead of `string`.  This helps Revel's type conversion and provides a basic level of validation.
    *   **Regular Expressions:** For string parameters, use regular expressions to enforce specific formats and allowed characters.
        ```go
        c.Validation.Match(username, regexp.MustCompile(`^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$`)) // Allow only alphanumeric and underscore
        ```
    *   **Whitelisting:**  Whenever possible, use whitelisting instead of blacklisting.  Define a set of allowed values or patterns and reject anything that doesn't match.
    *   **Custom Validation:** For complex validation logic, write custom validation functions.

2.  **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**

    *   **Always Use Parameterized Queries:**  *Never* construct SQL queries by concatenating strings with user-provided parameters.  Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) provided by your database driver.
        ```go
        // SAFE CODE (using database/sql)
        rows, err := db.Query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", id)
        ```
        The `?` is a placeholder that will be replaced by the database driver with the properly escaped value of `id`.
    *   **ORM Usage:** If using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), ensure it uses parameterized queries by default.  Verify the generated SQL to confirm.

3.  **Safe Command Execution:**

    *   **Avoid Shell Commands if Possible:**  If possible, use Go's built-in libraries to perform the desired operations instead of relying on shell commands.
    *   **Use `exec.Command` with Separate Arguments:**  If you *must* use shell commands, use `exec.Command` and pass arguments as separate strings, *not* as a single concatenated string.
        ```go
        // SAFE CODE
        cmd := exec.Command("ls", "-l", filepath) // filepath is a separate argument
        ```
    *   **Sanitize Arguments:**  Even with `exec.Command`, sanitize any user-provided arguments to remove potentially dangerous characters or sequences.

4.  **Safe File System Operations:**

    *   **Avoid Direct User Input in File Paths:**  Never use user-provided parameters directly to construct file paths.
    *   **Use a Base Directory:**  Define a base directory for file operations and construct paths relative to that base directory.
    *   **Validate File Names:**  Validate file names to ensure they conform to expected patterns and don't contain path traversal characters (e.g., `..`, `/`).
    *   **Use `filepath.Join`:** Use Go's `filepath.Join` function to safely construct file paths.

5.  **Output Encoding (for XSS Prevention):**

    *   **Use Revel's Template Engine Safely:** Revel's template engine (by default) automatically escapes HTML output.  Ensure this feature is enabled.
    *   **Explicitly Encode Output:** If you're manually constructing HTML or other output formats, explicitly encode any user-provided data using appropriate functions (e.g., `html.EscapeString` in Go).

6. **NoSQL Injection Mitigations**
    * **Use a Safe Query Builder:** If your ORM/ODM provides a query builder, use it to construct queries programmatically rather than building raw query objects from user input.
    * **Validate and Sanitize:** Apply strict validation and sanitization to all user-provided data before using it in any part of a NoSQL query.
    * **Avoid Raw Queries:** Minimize the use of raw, string-based queries.

### 4.4. Residual Risk

Even with diligent implementation of the mitigation strategies, some residual risk may remain:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  New vulnerabilities in Revel, database drivers, or other dependencies could be discovered.
*   **Complex Logic Errors:**  Subtle errors in validation or sanitization logic could still allow malicious input to bypass defenses.
*   **Misconfiguration:**  Incorrect configuration of the application or its environment could introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **ORM/ODM bypass:** If using ORM/ODM, there is always a risk of bypass, if developer is using raw queries.

Regular security audits, penetration testing, and staying up-to-date with security patches are essential to minimize these residual risks.

## 5. Conclusion

Parameter injection in Revel controller actions is a significant attack surface due to the framework's direct parameter passing mechanism.  Developers *must* treat all routed parameters as untrusted and implement robust input validation, parameterized queries, safe command execution, and output encoding to mitigate the risk of injection attacks.  While these measures significantly reduce the attack surface, ongoing vigilance and security best practices are crucial to maintain a secure application.
