Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on RCE via Template Injection in a Revel application:

## Deep Analysis: RCE via Template Injection in Revel (Attack Tree Path 2.1.1.1)

### 1. Define Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanics, risks, mitigation strategies, and detection methods associated with Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities arising from template injection in web applications built using the Revel framework (https://github.com/revel/revel).  We aim to provide actionable guidance for developers to prevent and detect this specific vulnerability.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Vulnerability:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Template Injection.
*   **Framework:** Revel (Go web framework).
*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploitation of improperly handled user input within Go templates (`html/template` or `text/template`).
*   **Context:**  Server-side execution of malicious Go code.

We will *not* cover other types of RCE vulnerabilities, other injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection), or vulnerabilities specific to other web frameworks.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Explanation:**  Provide a detailed technical explanation of how template injection works in the context of Revel and Go's templating system.
2.  **Exploitation Scenario:**  Present a realistic, step-by-step scenario of how an attacker might exploit this vulnerability.
3.  **Code Examples:**  Show vulnerable and secure code snippets to illustrate the difference.
4.  **Mitigation Deep Dive:**  Expand on the provided mitigations, providing specific implementation details and best practices.
5.  **Detection Techniques:**  Describe methods for identifying this vulnerability through code review, static analysis, and dynamic testing.
6.  **Impact Assessment:**  Reiterate the potential consequences of a successful attack.
7.  **Revel-Specific Considerations:**  Highlight any aspects of Revel that might increase or decrease the risk or impact of this vulnerability.

### 4. Deep Analysis

#### 4.1 Vulnerability Explanation

Go's `html/template` and `text/template` packages are designed to prevent common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through automatic contextual escaping.  However, this protection is *not* effective against template injection.  The key difference is:

*   **XSS:**  Attacker injects malicious *content* (e.g., JavaScript) into a template's *data*.  Auto-escaping handles this by encoding special characters.
*   **Template Injection:** Attacker injects malicious *template directives* (e.g., Go code) into the *template structure itself*.  Auto-escaping does *not* prevent this, as it operates on the data, not the template definition.

The vulnerability arises when user-supplied data is used to *construct the template itself*, rather than being passed as a *parameter* to a pre-defined template.  For example:

```go
// VULNERABLE: Template string is built from user input
tmplStr := fmt.Sprintf("<h1>Hello, %s</h1>", userInput)
tmpl, err := template.New("hello").Parse(tmplStr)
// ...

// SAFE: User input is passed as a parameter
tmpl, err := template.New("hello").Parse("<h1>Hello, {{.}}</h1>")
err = tmpl.Execute(w, userInput)
// ...
```

In the vulnerable example, if `userInput` contains `{{.EvilFunc}}`, and `EvilFunc` is a function accessible within the template's context, the attacker can execute arbitrary Go code.

#### 4.2 Exploitation Scenario

1.  **Target Identification:** The attacker identifies a Revel application and probes for areas where user input might influence the rendered output.  This could be through forms, URL parameters, or even HTTP headers.

2.  **Injection Point Discovery:** The attacker experiments with different inputs, looking for signs that their input is being directly incorporated into the template structure.  Error messages or unexpected output can be indicators.

3.  **Payload Crafting:** The attacker crafts a malicious template payload.  A simple example might be: `{{.System "ls -l"}}`.  This attempts to execute the `ls -l` command on the server (assuming a `System` function is available in the template context).  More sophisticated payloads could download and execute arbitrary code.

4.  **Payload Delivery:** The attacker submits the crafted payload through the identified injection point.

5.  **Code Execution:** If the application is vulnerable, the server will parse the attacker-controlled template string, execute the injected Go code, and potentially return the output to the attacker.

6.  **Escalation:** The attacker can now use this initial foothold to further compromise the server, exfiltrate data, or pivot to other systems.

#### 4.3 Code Examples

**Vulnerable Code (Revel Controller):**

```go
package app

import (
	"fmt"
	"html/template"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/revel/revel"
)

type App struct {
	*revel.Controller
}

func (c App) Vulnerable(userInput string) revel.Result {
	// DANGER: Template string is built from user input!
	tmplStr := fmt.Sprintf("<h1>Hello, %s</h1>", userInput)
	tmpl, err := template.New("vulnerable").Parse(tmplStr)
	if err != nil {
		return c.RenderError(err)
	}

	return c.RenderTemplate("App/Vulnerable.html", map[string]interface{}{
		"tmpl": tmpl, // Passing the parsed template to another template
	})
}

// In App/Vulnerable.html:
// {{ template "vulnerable" .tmpl }}
```

**Secure Code (Revel Controller):**

```go
package app

import (
	"html/template"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/revel/revel"
)

type App struct {
	*revel.Controller
}

func (c App) Secure(userInput string) revel.Result {
	// SAFE: User input is passed as a parameter.
	return c.RenderTemplate("App/Secure.html", map[string]interface{}{
		"userInput": userInput,
	})
}

// In App/Secure.html:
// <h1>Hello, {{ .userInput }}</h1>
```

**Explanation of Differences:**

*   **Vulnerable:** The `Vulnerable` action directly incorporates `userInput` into the template string using `fmt.Sprintf`. This allows an attacker to inject template directives.  Even passing the parsed template to another template file doesn't solve the problem, as the injection has already occurred.
*   **Secure:** The `Secure` action passes `userInput` as a *data parameter* to the `RenderTemplate` function.  The template itself (`App/Secure.html`) is static and uses `{{ .userInput }}` to safely render the data.

#### 4.4 Mitigation Deep Dive

*   **Never Construct Templates from User Input:** This is the most crucial mitigation.  Always use pre-defined, static template files.  User data should *only* be passed as parameters.

*   **Ensure `html/template` Auto-Escaping is Enabled (and Understand its Limitations):**  While auto-escaping doesn't prevent template injection, it's still essential for preventing XSS.  Revel, by default, uses `html/template` for HTML output.  Make sure you haven't accidentally switched to `text/template` for HTML rendering.  Be aware of functions like `template.HTML`, `template.JS`, etc., which bypass escaping.  Use these *very* cautiously and only when absolutely necessary, after thorough sanitization.

*   **Sanitize User-Supplied Data (Defense in Depth):** Even though auto-escaping and parameterization are the primary defenses, sanitizing user input adds an extra layer of security.  This can involve:
    *   **Whitelisting:**  Allowing only specific characters or patterns.
    *   **Blacklisting:**  Rejecting known malicious characters or patterns (less reliable than whitelisting).
    *   **Encoding:**  Converting potentially dangerous characters into safe representations (e.g., HTML entities).

*   **Regular Code Reviews:**  Specifically look for any instances where user input is used to build template strings.  Train developers to recognize this pattern as a high-risk vulnerability.

*   **Use a Template Linter:**  Consider using a linter that can detect potential template injection vulnerabilities.  While there may not be a linter specifically designed for Revel and Go templates, general security linters might flag suspicious string concatenation involving user input.

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While CSP primarily mitigates XSS, it can also limit the impact of some template injection attacks by restricting the resources the attacker can load or execute.

#### 4.5 Detection Techniques

*   **Code Review:**  Manually inspect the codebase for any instances of `template.New(...).Parse(...)` where the template string is dynamically generated using user input.

*   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):**  Use SAST tools that can analyze Go code for potential security vulnerabilities.  Some tools may be able to detect patterns indicative of template injection, even if they don't have specific rules for it.  Look for tools that understand data flow and can track user input through the application.

*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Use DAST tools (web application scanners) to probe the application for template injection vulnerabilities.  These tools typically send specially crafted payloads to try to trigger unexpected behavior.

*   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Engage experienced security testers to manually attempt to exploit the application, looking for template injection vulnerabilities.

*   **Runtime Monitoring:**  Implement monitoring to detect unusual server activity, such as unexpected processes being spawned or network connections being established.  This can help detect successful exploitation.

#### 4.6 Impact Assessment

A successful template injection attack leading to RCE has a **very high impact**.  The attacker gains complete control over the server process, allowing them to:

*   **Steal Sensitive Data:**  Access databases, configuration files, and other sensitive information.
*   **Modify Application Logic:**  Change the behavior of the application, potentially defacing the website or inserting malicious code.
*   **Execute Arbitrary Code:**  Run any command on the server, potentially installing malware or using the server as a launchpad for attacks on other systems.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Crash the server or make the application unavailable.
*   **Pivot to Other Systems:**  Use the compromised server to access other systems on the network.

#### 4.7 Revel-Specific Considerations

*   **Revel's Template Engine:** Revel uses Go's standard `html/template` package by default.  This means that the standard security considerations for Go templates apply.

*   **Revel's Controller Structure:** Revel's controller structure encourages separating logic from presentation, which can help reduce the risk of template injection if followed correctly.  Ensure that controllers only pass data to templates, not template strings.

*   **Revel's Hot Reloading:** Revel's hot reloading feature, while convenient for development, could potentially introduce vulnerabilities if not carefully managed.  Ensure that template files are not being loaded from untrusted sources.

*   **Revel's Filters:** Revel's filter system could be used to implement additional security checks, such as sanitizing user input before it reaches the controller actions. However, filters should not be the *sole* defense; template parameterization is still essential.

### 5. Conclusion

Template injection leading to RCE is a critical vulnerability in Revel applications (and any web application using templates).  By understanding the mechanics of the attack, implementing robust mitigations (primarily avoiding dynamic template string construction), and employing various detection techniques, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability.  Continuous vigilance and security awareness are crucial for maintaining the security of Revel applications.
