# Deep Analysis of Session Fixation Attack on a Revel Application

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Hijack the Victim's Session After They Authenticate (Session Fixation)" attack path (3.1.1.1) within the context of a web application built using the Revel framework (https://github.com/revel/revel).  This analysis aims to:

*   Understand the specific mechanisms by which a session fixation attack could be executed against a Revel application.
*   Identify potential vulnerabilities in a typical Revel application configuration that could facilitate this attack.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations within the Revel framework.
*   Provide concrete recommendations for developers to secure their Revel applications against session fixation.
*   Determine any Revel-specific features or limitations that impact the attack or its mitigation.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the session fixation attack vector.  It assumes the attacker has *not* compromised the server directly (e.g., through code injection or server-side vulnerabilities).  The scope includes:

*   **Revel's Session Management:**  How Revel handles session creation, storage, and validation.  This includes examining the default session cookie settings and the `revel.Session` object.
*   **Client-Side Interactions:**  How an attacker might manipulate session IDs on the client-side (e.g., through URL parameters, cookie manipulation, or cross-site scripting).
*   **Authentication Flow:**  The sequence of events during user authentication and how this interacts with session management.
*   **Revel Configuration:**  Relevant settings in `app.conf` that affect session security.
*   **Common Revel Application Patterns:**  Typical ways developers use sessions in Revel applications and how these patterns might introduce vulnerabilities.

The scope *excludes* other session hijacking techniques like session sniffing or cross-site request forgery (CSRF), except where they directly relate to facilitating a session fixation attack.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the Revel framework's source code, particularly the `session.go` file and related components, to understand the underlying session management mechanisms.
2.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Review the default `app.conf` settings and identify any configurations that could weaken session security.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Search for known vulnerabilities or exploits related to session fixation in Revel or similar Go web frameworks.
4.  **Scenario Analysis:**  Develop concrete attack scenarios demonstrating how a session fixation attack could be carried out against a Revel application.
5.  **Mitigation Evaluation:**  Assess the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations (session ID regeneration, URL avoidance, `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags) within the Revel context.  This will involve testing and code analysis.
6.  **Best Practices Recommendation:**  Formulate specific, actionable recommendations for developers to secure their Revel applications against session fixation.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 3.1.1.1 (Session Fixation)

### 2.1. Attack Scenario

Let's consider a typical Revel application with a login form.  The attacker's goal is to hijack a legitimate user's session after they successfully log in.

**Steps:**

1.  **Attacker Sets Session ID:** The attacker visits the application and obtains a session ID (e.g., `SESSION_ID=attackers_id`).  This could be done by simply visiting the site if Revel automatically creates sessions for unauthenticated users (a common default).  The attacker then crafts a malicious URL: `https://example.com/?SESSION_ID=attackers_id`.  Alternatively, if the session ID is stored in a cookie, the attacker might use a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (outside the scope of this specific analysis, but a common enabler) to set the `SESSION_ID` cookie to `attackers_id` on the victim's browser.

2.  **Victim Clicks Malicious Link:** The attacker tricks the victim into clicking the malicious link (e.g., through phishing, social engineering, or a compromised website).  The victim's browser now has the `SESSION_ID` set to `attackers_id`.

3.  **Victim Authenticates:** The victim navigates to the login page (which might be part of the same request if the malicious link pointed directly to the login page) and enters their valid credentials.

4.  **Session Hijacked:**  If Revel *does not* regenerate the session ID upon successful authentication, the attacker can now use the `attackers_id` to access the application as the victim.  The attacker simply needs to set their own browser's `SESSION_ID` cookie to `attackers_id` (or use the same URL if the session ID is in the URL).

### 2.2. Revel-Specific Vulnerabilities and Considerations

*   **Default Session Behavior:**  A crucial factor is whether Revel, by default, creates a new session for every visitor *before* authentication.  If it does, this significantly increases the attack surface for session fixation.  We need to examine the `session.go` code and the default `app.conf` to determine this.  Specifically, look for lines related to `revel.Session` initialization and whether it happens automatically or only after explicit action.

*   **Session ID Regeneration:**  The core mitigation is to regenerate the session ID upon successful authentication.  We need to verify if Revel provides a built-in mechanism for this.  Ideally, there would be a function like `revel.Session.Regenerate()` or a similar method that developers can call within their authentication logic.  If not, developers would need to manually implement this, which is error-prone.

*   **`app.conf` Settings:**  The `app.conf` file likely contains settings related to session security.  We need to examine settings like:
    *   `session.cookie`:  The name of the session cookie.
    *   `session.httponly`:  Whether the `HttpOnly` flag is enabled by default.
    *   `session.secure`:  Whether the `Secure` flag is enabled by default.
    *   `session.maxage`:  The session timeout.
    *   `session.path`: The path for the cookie.
    *   `session.domain`: The domain for the cookie.

    If `session.httponly` and `session.secure` are not set to `true` by default, this represents a significant vulnerability.

*   **URL-Based Session IDs:**  Revel *should not* support passing session IDs in the URL by default.  If it does, this is a major security flaw.  We need to verify this through code review and testing.  Look for any code that parses session IDs from the URL query parameters.

*   **Session Storage:**  While not directly related to fixation, the session storage mechanism (e.g., cookie-based, server-side) can influence the attack.  Cookie-based sessions are more susceptible to client-side manipulation.

### 2.3. Mitigation Evaluation

*   **Regenerate Session IDs:** This is the *primary* defense.  We need to determine the best way to implement this in Revel:
    *   **Ideal:**  Revel provides a `revel.Session.Regenerate()` function (or similar) that developers *must* call after successful authentication.
    *   **Acceptable:**  Revel provides a way to manually create a new session and discard the old one.  This requires careful implementation by the developer.
    *   **Unacceptable:**  Revel provides no mechanism for session ID regeneration.  This would require significant custom code and is highly error-prone.

    The code within the authentication controller should look something like this (assuming a `Regenerate()` function exists):

    ```go
    func (c App) Login(username, password string) revel.Result {
        // ... (validate credentials) ...

        if userIsValid {
            c.Session.Regenerate() // Crucial step!
            c.Session["username"] = username
            return c.Redirect(App.Index)
        }

        // ... (handle invalid login) ...
    }
    ```

*   **Ensure Session IDs are Not Exposed in URLs:**  This is a fundamental security practice.  Revel should *never* accept session IDs from the URL.  This should be verified through code review and testing.

*   **`HttpOnly` and `Secure` Flags:**
    *   **`HttpOnly`:**  Prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the session cookie.  This mitigates XSS-based session fixation attacks.  Revel should set this flag by default (`session.httponly = true` in `app.conf`).
    *   **`Secure`:**  Ensures the session cookie is only transmitted over HTTPS.  This prevents eavesdropping on the session ID.  Revel should set this flag by default (`session.secure = true` in `app.conf`) when running in production.

### 2.4. Recommendations for Developers

1.  **Mandatory Session Regeneration:**  *Always* regenerate the session ID immediately after successful user authentication.  Use the Revel-provided mechanism if available; otherwise, implement it manually, ensuring the old session is completely invalidated.

2.  **Verify `app.conf` Settings:**  Ensure the following settings in `app.conf` are configured correctly:
    *   `session.httponly = true`
    *   `session.secure = true` (for production environments)

3.  **Avoid URL-Based Session IDs:**  Never pass session IDs in URLs.  Rely solely on cookies for session management.

4.  **Educate on Session Fixation:**  Ensure all developers on the team understand the risks of session fixation and the importance of the mitigations.

5.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including session fixation.

6.  **Consider Session Timeout:** Implement a reasonable session timeout (`session.maxage`) to limit the window of opportunity for attackers.

7. **Consider using a filter:** Revel has a filter system. It is possible to create a filter that will be executed before every request and regenerate session id if user is authenticated.

### 2.5. Revel-Specific Findings (Requires Code Review and Testing)

This section will be filled in after performing the code review and testing steps outlined in the methodology.  It will contain specific findings about Revel's default behavior, available functions, and configuration options related to session fixation.  Examples of what might be found here:

*   **Finding:**  Revel automatically creates a session for every visitor, even before authentication.
*   **Finding:**  Revel provides a `revel.Session.Renew()` function that regenerates the session ID.
*   **Finding:**  The default `app.conf` file does *not* enable `HttpOnly` or `Secure` flags.
*   **Finding:**  Revel does *not* support passing session IDs in the URL.
*   **Finding:** Revel has built-in filter that can be used for session regeneration.

This detailed analysis provides a framework for understanding and mitigating session fixation attacks in Revel applications. The "Revel-Specific Findings" section is crucial and requires hands-on investigation of the framework's code and configuration.
