Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the Template Injection threat for a Revel application.

## Deep Analysis: Template Injection in Revel Applications

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the Template Injection vulnerability within the context of a Revel application, identify specific attack vectors, assess the potential impact, and provide concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigation and prevention.  We aim to go beyond the general description and provide practical guidance for developers.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on Template Injection vulnerabilities arising from the use of Revel's templating engine (primarily Go's `html/template`, but considerations for other engines will be mentioned).  It covers:

*   Controller actions that handle user input and interact with templates.
*   The mechanisms by which user input can influence template rendering.
*   The capabilities of an attacker exploiting this vulnerability.
*   Specific Revel features and coding practices that increase or decrease risk.
*   Effective mitigation strategies tailored to Revel development.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General web application security vulnerabilities unrelated to template injection.
*   Vulnerabilities within third-party libraries *unless* they directly impact template rendering.
*   Operating system or infrastructure-level security.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  We start with the provided threat model entry as a foundation.
2.  **Code Analysis (Hypothetical and Example):** We will examine hypothetical Revel controller code and template snippets to illustrate vulnerable and secure patterns.  We'll also look for common patterns in real-world Revel applications (if available and publicly accessible).
3.  **Exploitation Scenario Development:** We will construct realistic attack scenarios to demonstrate the practical impact of the vulnerability.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:** We will evaluate the effectiveness and practicality of various mitigation strategies, considering Revel's specific features and constraints.
5.  **Best Practices Definition:** We will define clear, actionable best practices for developers to prevent template injection vulnerabilities.
6.  **Documentation and Reporting:**  The findings will be documented in a clear, concise, and actionable format (this markdown document).

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1. Understanding the Vulnerability**

Template injection occurs when an attacker can control *part or all* of a template that is rendered by the server.  This is distinct from Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), where an attacker injects code into the *output* of a template.  Template injection is far more severe because it allows code execution *on the server*, within the context of the templating engine.

Go's `html/template` package, used by default in Revel, provides automatic contextual escaping to mitigate XSS.  However, this *does not* protect against template injection.  If an attacker can control the template itself, they bypass the escaping mechanisms entirely.

**2.2. Attack Vectors in Revel**

Several scenarios in a Revel application can lead to template injection:

*   **Dynamic Template Selection Based on User Input:**  The most direct attack vector.  Consider this (vulnerable) example:

    ```go
    // Vulnerable Controller Action
    func (c AppController) ShowPage() revel.Result {
        pageName := c.Params.Get("page") // User-controlled input
        return c.RenderTemplate("pages/" + pageName + ".html")
    }
    ```

    An attacker could supply a `page` parameter like `../../../../tmp/evil`, causing the application to attempt to render `/tmp/evil.html`.  If the attacker has write access to `/tmp`, they can place a malicious template there.  Even worse, they could use template syntax like `{{.SomeData}}` to access data passed to the template, or even `{{template "another_template" .}}` to include other templates.

*   **User-Supplied Template Snippets:**  Allowing users to input even small parts of a template is extremely dangerous.  For example, a feature that lets users customize a small section of a page's layout:

    ```go
    // Vulnerable Controller Action
    func (c AppController) Customize() revel.Result {
        customSnippet := c.Params.Get("snippet") // User-controlled input
        return c.Render(customSnippet) // Directly rendering user input!
    }
    ```
    This is a direct path to RCE. The attacker can provide template code directly.

*   **Indirect Template Control via Data:** While less direct, if user-supplied data is used to *construct* template names or paths, even with some sanitization, it can still be vulnerable.  For example, if a filename is built using user input and then used as part of a template path, careful manipulation of that input might allow the attacker to escape the intended directory.

* **Using `RenderHtml` with user controlled input:**
    ```go
    func (c AppController) ShowPage() revel.Result {
        pageContent := c.Params.Get("content") // User-controlled input
        return c.RenderHtml(pageContent)
    }
    ```
    This is very dangerous, because `RenderHtml` bypasses the template engine.

**2.3. Exploitation Scenarios**

*   **Scenario 1: Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

    Using the first vulnerable example (dynamic template selection), an attacker might:

    1.  Identify the vulnerability by testing various inputs for the `page` parameter.
    2.  Discover a way to write a file to a location on the server (e.g., through a separate file upload vulnerability or misconfigured permissions).
    3.  Upload a malicious template file (e.g., `evil.html`) containing Go template code:

        ```html
        {{/* This is a comment in the template */}}
        {{exec "cat /etc/passwd"}}
        ```
    4.  Request the vulnerable endpoint with the crafted `page` parameter: `/app/ShowPage?page=../../../../path/to/evil`.
    5.  The server executes the `cat /etc/passwd` command and includes the output in the response.  The attacker now has access to sensitive system information.  They could easily modify the template to execute arbitrary commands.

*   **Scenario 2: Data Exfiltration**

    Even without full RCE, an attacker can use template injection to access data passed to the template context.  Suppose the template context includes a `User` object with a `PasswordHash` field.  The attacker could inject a template snippet like:

    ```html
    {{.User.PasswordHash}}
    ```

    This would expose the password hash to the attacker.

**2.4. Impact Analysis**

The impact of a successful template injection attack is extremely severe:

*   **Complete Server Compromise:**  RCE allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server process.  This can lead to complete control of the server.
*   **Data Breach:**  The attacker can access and exfiltrate any data accessible to the web application, including database contents, configuration files, and user data.
*   **Data Modification:**  The attacker can modify or delete data stored by the application.
*   **Denial of Service:**  The attacker can disrupt the application's functionality or crash the server.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization running the application.

**2.5. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)**

*   **1. Avoid Dynamic Template Selection (Preferred):**  The most secure approach is to avoid using user input to determine which template to render.  Instead, use a fixed set of templates and select them based on application logic, *not* user input.

    ```go
    // Secure Controller Action
    func (c AppController) ShowPage() revel.Result {
        page := c.Params.Get("page")
        switch page {
        case "about":
            return c.RenderTemplate("pages/about.html")
        case "contact":
            return c.RenderTemplate("pages/contact.html")
        default:
            return c.RenderTemplate("pages/home.html") // Or return an error
        }
    }
    ```

*   **2. Whitelist Template Names (If Necessary):**  If dynamic template selection is absolutely unavoidable, use a strict whitelist of allowed template names.  This prevents attackers from accessing arbitrary files.

    ```go
    // Safer (but still less preferred) Controller Action
    func (c AppController) ShowPage() revel.Result {
        pageName := c.Params.Get("page")
        allowedTemplates := map[string]bool{
            "home":    true,
            "about":   true,
            "contact": true,
        }
        if _, ok := allowedTemplates[pageName]; ok {
            return c.RenderTemplate("pages/" + pageName + ".html")
        }
        return c.NotFound("Page not found") // Or a custom error page
    }
    ```

*   **3. Never Allow User-Supplied Template Code:**  Do not allow users to directly input any part of a template.  This includes seemingly small snippets or customization options.  Use data binding and template logic instead.

*   **4. Sanitize Input (Defense in Depth):**  Even though `html/template` provides auto-escaping, it's still a good practice to sanitize any user input used within template logic.  This provides an extra layer of defense against potential bypasses or unexpected behavior.  Use appropriate sanitization functions based on the type of data (e.g., string sanitization, integer validation).  However, remember that sanitization *alone* is not sufficient to prevent template injection.

*   **5. Use `c.Render()` Carefully:**  The `c.Render()` function in Revel is generally safe for rendering data *within* a template.  However, ensure that the *template itself* is not determined by user input.

*   **6. Avoid `c.RenderHtml()` with User Input:**  The `c.RenderHtml()` function bypasses the templating engine and directly renders the provided string as HTML.  Never use this with user-controlled input, as it's highly vulnerable to XSS and potentially other injection attacks.

*   **7. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including template injection.

*   **8. Keep Revel and Dependencies Updated:**  Ensure that you are using the latest versions of Revel and its dependencies to benefit from security patches and improvements.

*   **9. Least Privilege Principle:** Run your Revel application with the least privileges necessary. This limits the damage an attacker can do if they achieve RCE.

### 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

Template injection is a critical vulnerability that can lead to complete server compromise.  In Revel applications, the primary risk comes from using user input to dynamically select templates or include template snippets.

**Key Recommendations:**

*   **Prioritize avoiding dynamic template selection based on user input.** This is the most effective mitigation.
*   **If dynamic selection is unavoidable, use a strict whitelist.**
*   **Never allow users to directly input template code.**
*   **Sanitize user input as a defense-in-depth measure.**
*   **Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.**
*   **Stay updated with the latest Revel and dependency versions.**
*   **Follow the principle of least privilege.**

By following these recommendations, developers can significantly reduce the risk of template injection vulnerabilities in their Revel applications and protect their systems and data from attack.
