# Threat Model Analysis for revel/revel

## Threat: [Exposure of Internal Handlers/Actions via Insecure Route Definitions](./threats/exposure_of_internal_handlersactions_via_insecure_route_definitions.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft specific URLs that, due to overly permissive or poorly defined routes in Revel's `routes` configuration file, directly access internal application logic, administrative functions, or debugging endpoints that were not intended for public access. This could involve manipulating URL patterns or exploiting wildcard routes.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities, potential data breaches, ability to manipulate application state, or gain insights into the application's internal workings, leading to further exploitation.

**Affected Component:** Revel's `github.com/revel/revel/router` package, specifically the route parsing and matching logic within the `routes` configuration file and the `http.Handle` function.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict and explicit route definitions in the `routes` file.
* Avoid using overly broad wildcard routes unless absolutely necessary and with careful consideration of security implications.
* Regularly review and audit the `routes` configuration to ensure no unintended endpoints are exposed.
* Utilize Revel's route constraints to restrict parameter types and values.
* Consider using a separate, more restrictive routing configuration for production environments.

## Threat: [Route Parameter Injection](./threats/route_parameter_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate route parameters in the URL to inject malicious code or unexpected values. If the application logic doesn't properly sanitize or validate these parameters before using them (e.g., in database queries or system commands), it could lead to vulnerabilities like SQL injection, command injection, or path traversal.

**Impact:**  Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, remote code execution on the server, or access to sensitive files.

**Affected Component:** Revel's `github.com/revel/revel/controller` package, specifically the parameter binding mechanisms and how controller actions access route parameters.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always validate and sanitize route parameters within controller actions before using them.
* Utilize Revel's built-in parameter validation features and define validation rules for expected data types and formats.
* Avoid directly embedding user-supplied route parameters in database queries or system commands without proper escaping or using parameterized queries.
* Implement input sanitization techniques to remove or neutralize potentially harmful characters.

## Threat: [Bypassing Interceptors/Filters due to Routing Issues](./threats/bypassing_interceptorsfilters_due_to_routing_issues.md)

**Description:** An attacker might be able to craft specific requests that, due to flaws in Revel's routing logic or the order of interceptor execution, bypass intended interceptors or filters. This could allow them to circumvent authentication, authorization checks, input validation, or other security measures.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, execution of actions without proper authorization, or exploitation of vulnerabilities due to bypassed input validation.

**Affected Component:** Revel's `github.com/revel/revel/interceptor` package and the routing mechanism that determines interceptor execution order.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that interceptors are correctly applied to all relevant routes and actions.
* Thoroughly test routing logic and interceptor execution order to prevent bypass scenarios.
* Leverage Revel's interceptor chaining and ordering features to enforce the desired execution flow.
* Avoid relying solely on interceptors for security; implement defense-in-depth strategies.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Description:** If user-controlled data is directly embedded into Revel templates without proper escaping, an attacker could inject malicious template code that executes on the server. This can lead to remote code execution or access to sensitive server-side information.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Revel's template rendering engine, likely using Go's `html/template` or `text/template` packages.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always escape user-provided data before rendering it in templates using Revel's built-in escaping mechanisms.
* Be extremely cautious when using template features that allow for dynamic code execution or inclusion of external templates based on user input.
* Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS or SSTI vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Session Handling due to Default Configurations](./threats/insecure_session_handling_due_to_default_configurations.md)

**Description:** Default session management settings in Revel might not be optimal for security. This could include using insecure session storage mechanisms (e.g., in-memory in development), weak session ID generation, or lack of proper session timeouts.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, where an attacker gains unauthorized access to a user's session, potentially leading to account takeover and data breaches.

**Affected Component:** Revel's session management module, likely involving cookies and server-side storage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Review and configure session management settings according to security best practices.
* Use secure session storage mechanisms (e.g., Redis, database) instead of default in-memory storage, especially in production.
* Ensure strong and unpredictable session ID generation.
* Implement appropriate session timeouts and consider implementing idle timeouts.
* Use the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags for session cookies.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information or Functionality in Development Mode](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_or_functionality_in_development_mode.md)

**Description:** Features enabled in Revel's development mode, such as detailed error pages, code reloading, or access to debugging endpoints, could expose sensitive information or provide attack vectors if accidentally left enabled in production environments.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for remote code execution or other attacks if debugging endpoints are accessible.

**Affected Component:** Revel's application lifecycle management and environment configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High (if left enabled in production)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that development mode is strictly disabled in production environments.
* Implement checks to prevent development-specific routes or functionalities from being accessible in production.
* Use environment variables or configuration files to manage environment-specific settings.
