# Attack Surface Analysis for revel/revel

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template expressions, which is then executed on the server when the template is rendered.
    *   **How Revel Contributes:** Revel uses the Go `html/template` package. If developers directly embed user-provided data into template actions or use unsafe template functions without proper sanitization, it creates an opportunity for SSTI.
    *   **Example:** A comment form allows users to enter their name. The template displays `Hello {{.Comment.Author}}`. If an attacker enters `{{exec "rm -rf /"}}` as their name, and the template doesn't escape this, the server might attempt to execute this command.
    *   **Impact:**  Full server compromise, arbitrary code execution, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always escape user-provided data within templates using `{{. | html}}` or similar escaping functions.
        *   Avoid using `raw` or `unescaped` template functions with user input.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict resource loading.
        *   Regularly audit templates for potential injection points.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Session Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_session_management.md)

*   **Description:** Revel's default session management might use insecure settings or storage mechanisms, making sessions vulnerable to hijacking or manipulation.
    *   **How Revel Contributes:** Revel provides built-in session management. If developers rely on default configurations without understanding their security implications, it can lead to vulnerabilities. This includes weak session keys, insecure cookie attributes, or default storage (e.g., in-memory in development).
    *   **Example:**  A Revel application uses the default session key. An attacker might be able to guess or obtain this key and forge valid session cookies to impersonate users. Cookies might lack the `HttpOnly` flag, making them accessible to client-side scripts.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive data, session hijacking.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Generate strong, unique session keys; do not rely on defaults.
        *   Configure secure cookie attributes: set `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.
        *   Consider using a secure session store like Redis or a database instead of default in-memory storage (especially in production).
        *   Implement session regeneration after successful login.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Route Parameters](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_route_parameters.md)

*   **Description:**  Revel's routing mechanism uses parameters. If these parameters are not properly validated and sanitized before being used in sensitive operations, it can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Revel Contributes:** Revel automatically binds route parameters to controller action arguments. If developers directly use these parameters without validation, they are vulnerable to injection attacks.
    *   **Example:** A route is defined as `/file/:filename`. The controller uses the `filename` parameter to read a file. An attacker could provide a malicious filename like `../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to access sensitive files.
    *   **Impact:** File access vulnerabilities, local file inclusion, potential command execution if parameters are used in system calls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate and sanitize all route parameters to ensure they conform to expected formats.
        *   Use whitelisting for allowed parameter values.
        *   Avoid directly using route parameters in file system operations or system calls without thorough validation.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Interceptors](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_interceptors.md)

*   **Description:** Revel's interceptors allow pre-processing of requests. If interceptors are not implemented securely or if their logic is flawed, attackers might find ways to bypass security checks.
    *   **How Revel Contributes:** Revel's interceptor mechanism provides a powerful way to modify request flow. Incorrectly implemented interceptors can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An authentication interceptor checks for a valid session. If the interceptor has a flaw that allows bypassing the check under certain conditions (e.g., specific header values), an attacker could gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization bypass, access control vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test all interceptor logic to ensure correct enforcement of security policies.
        *   Avoid complex logic within interceptors.
        *   Ensure interceptors are applied consistently and cannot be bypassed.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining interceptor scope.
