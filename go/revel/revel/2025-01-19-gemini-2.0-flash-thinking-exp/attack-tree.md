## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application using Revel Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Parameter Binding Flaws -> Gain Unauthorized Access/Execute Code](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_revel_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_parameter_binding_flaws_-_gain_unauthor_4e78de01.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers can manipulate request parameters (e.g., in URLs or form data) to exploit vulnerabilities in how Revel binds these parameters to controller arguments.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Significant
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate
* **Outcome:** By providing unexpected or malicious input, attackers can bypass authentication or authorization checks, or even inject code that gets executed by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application using Revel Vulnerabilities -> Abuse Insecure Configuration -> Expose Sensitive Information / Gain Unauthorized Access](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_revel_vulnerabilities_-_abuse_insecure_configuration_-_expose_sensitive_3b40284b.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Revel's configuration files (e.g., `app.conf`) might contain sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or secret keys. Insecure defaults or improper configuration management can expose these.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Critical
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Novice
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Difficult
* **Outcome:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data leading to further compromise, or directly gain unauthorized access to the application or backend systems using exposed credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application using Revel Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Template Engine Vulnerabilities -> Achieve Remote Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_revel_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_template_engine_vulnerabilities_-_achie_03eb5db6.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Revel uses a template engine (typically Go's `html/template`). If developers use template directives improperly or if the template engine itself has vulnerabilities, attackers can inject malicious code into templates.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    * **Impact:** Critical
    * **Effort:** Moderate to High
    * **Skill Level:** Advanced
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult
* **Outcome:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application, leading to complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application using Revel Vulnerabilities -> Abuse Session Management Weaknesses -> Gain Unauthorized Access via Session Hijacking](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_revel_vulnerabilities_-_abuse_session_management_weaknesses_-_gain_unau_ec5a85b4.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Revel's session management might have weaknesses, such as predictable session IDs, insecure storage of session data, or lack of proper session invalidation.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Critical
    * **Effort:** Low to Moderate
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate
* **Outcome:** Attackers can steal or hijack legitimate user sessions, allowing them to impersonate users and perform actions on their behalf, potentially gaining administrative privileges or accessing sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application using Revel Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies -> Achieve Remote Code Execution / Other Impacts](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_revel_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies_-_achie_ec80c46a.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Revel relies on various third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited through the Revel application.
    * **Likelihood:** Varies depending on the dependency
    * **Impact:** Can be Critical (RCE) or Significant (Data Breach)
    * **Effort:** Low to Moderate (if exploits are available)
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Difficult
* **Outcome:** Exploiting dependency vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, or other impacts depending on the specific vulnerability.
