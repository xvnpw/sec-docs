# Threat Model Analysis for v2ray/v2ray-core

## Threat: [Configuration File Modification Leading to Compromise](./threats/configuration_file_modification_leading_to_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the v2ray-core configuration file (typically `config.json`) and modifies it to redirect traffic, disable security features, or inject malicious configurations. This directly exploits the way v2ray-core loads and uses its configuration.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the v2ray-core instance, allowing the attacker to intercept traffic, redirect it to malicious destinations, bypass authentication, or even cause a denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Configuration loading and parsing module within v2ray-core.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure the configuration file has restrictive file permissions, limiting access to only the necessary user accounts.
* Consider encrypting the configuration file at rest.
* Implement integrity checks to detect unauthorized modifications to the configuration file.
* Run v2ray-core under a least-privilege user account.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in VMess Protocol](./threats/exploitation_of_known_vulnerabilities_in_vmess_protocol.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits publicly known vulnerabilities in the VMess protocol implementation *within v2ray-core*. This involves crafting specific malicious packets that target flaws in v2ray-core's VMess handling.

**Impact:** Potential for remote code execution on the server running v2ray-core, denial of service, or bypassing authentication mechanisms.

**Affected Component:** VMess protocol handler within the inbound and outbound modules of v2ray-core.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep v2ray-core updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Monitor security advisories related to v2ray-core and the VMess protocol.
* Consider using alternative protocols if VMess is deemed too risky for the specific use case.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Transport Layer Exploits](./threats/denial_of_service_via_transport_layer_exploits.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the v2ray-core instance with a large number of connection requests or malformed packets targeting specific transport protocols like TCP or mKCP. This could exploit vulnerabilities *in v2ray-core's implementation* of these transport protocols or overwhelm its resources.

**Impact:**  The v2ray-core instance becomes unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from accessing the proxy service. This can disrupt applications relying on the proxy.

**Affected Component:** Transport layer implementations (e.g., TCP listener, mKCP handler) within v2ray-core.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting and connection limits in the v2ray-core configuration.
* Use robust transport protocols and configurations that are resistant to DoS attacks.
* Deploy v2ray-core behind a firewall or load balancer that can mitigate some types of DoS attacks.
* Monitor resource usage and network traffic for suspicious patterns.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Outbound Connections due to Insecure Configuration](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_outbound_connections_due_to_insecure_configuration.md)

**Description:** If the outbound configuration *within v2ray-core* does not enforce proper certificate validation or uses insecure protocols, an attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to intercept or modify traffic between the v2ray-core instance and the destination server. This is a direct consequence of how v2ray-core handles outbound connections.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data being transmitted, modification of data in transit, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Affected Component:** Outbound connection handling, specifically TLS/SSL implementation and certificate verification within v2ray-core.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always enable and enforce TLS encryption for outbound connections within v2ray-core's configuration.
* Ensure that certificate verification is enabled and configured correctly to prevent accepting invalid or self-signed certificates.
* Prefer secure protocols like HTTPS for outbound traffic.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Supported Protocols (e.g., Shadowsocks)](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_supported_protocols__e_g___shadowsocks_.md)

**Description:** Similar to VMess, other protocols supported by v2ray-core, such as Shadowsocks, might have known vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit *within v2ray-core's implementation*.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to authentication bypass, traffic interception, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** The specific protocol handler (e.g., Shadowsocks protocol handler) within the inbound and outbound modules of v2ray-core.

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep v2ray-core updated to patch known vulnerabilities in supported protocols.
* Stay informed about security advisories for the specific protocols being used.
* Consider the security implications of each protocol when choosing which to enable.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation due to Improper Process Management](./threats/privilege_escalation_due_to_improper_process_management.md)

**Description:** If v2ray-core is run with elevated privileges and there's a vulnerability *within v2ray-core* allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code, they could potentially escalate their privileges on the system. This is a direct consequence of a flaw in v2ray-core combined with how it's run.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the system hosting v2ray-core, allowing the attacker to perform any action with the privileges of the v2ray-core process.

**Affected Component:** Process management and any code execution vulnerabilities within v2ray-core.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Run v2ray-core with the minimum necessary privileges (least privilege principle).
* Implement robust security measures to prevent code execution vulnerabilities (primarily through keeping v2ray-core updated).
* Use process isolation techniques if available.
