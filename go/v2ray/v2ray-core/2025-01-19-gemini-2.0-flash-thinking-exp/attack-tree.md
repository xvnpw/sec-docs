## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit V2Ray-core Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_v2ray-core_vulnerabilities.md)

**1. Critical Node & High-Risk Path: Exploit V2Ray-core Vulnerabilities**

*   **Attack Vector: Authentication Bypass**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit flaws in V2Ray-core's authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access without providing valid credentials.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   Exploiting flaws in authentication protocols (e.g., VMess, VLess): This involves crafting malformed authentication requests that bypass the protocol's security checks. This could be due to implementation errors or logical flaws in the protocol design.
        *   Exploiting weaknesses in credential handling: This targets vulnerabilities in how V2Ray-core stores, retrieves, or verifies credentials. This could involve exploiting insecure storage mechanisms, timing attacks, or other weaknesses that allow attackers to bypass or circumvent credential checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate V2Ray Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_v2ray_configuration.md)

**2. Critical Node & High-Risk Path: Manipulate V2Ray Configuration**

*   **Attack Vector: Gain Unauthorized Access to Configuration Files**
    *   **Description:** Attackers aim to gain access to V2Ray-core's configuration files, which contain sensitive information and control the application's behavior.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   Exploiting OS vulnerabilities to access the server: This involves leveraging known vulnerabilities in the operating system where V2Ray-core is running to gain unauthorized access to the file system and configuration files.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application managing V2Ray configuration: If a separate application or interface is used to manage V2Ray-core's configuration, attackers may target vulnerabilities in this application to gain access to the configuration. This could involve web application vulnerabilities, API flaws, or other security weaknesses.
        *   Leveraging default or weak credentials for configuration management interfaces: If V2Ray-core or a related management interface uses default or easily guessable credentials, attackers can use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the configuration.

*   **Attack Vector: Modify Configuration to Introduce Backdoors**
    *   **Description:** Once attackers gain access to the configuration, they can modify it to introduce backdoors, allowing them persistent and unauthorized access or control.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   Adding malicious routing rules: Attackers can add routing rules that redirect traffic intended for the application or other destinations to attacker-controlled servers, allowing them to intercept or manipulate data.
        *   Enabling insecure features or protocols: V2Ray-core may have features or support protocols that are known to be insecure. Attackers can enable these features to create vulnerabilities that they can later exploit.
        *   Disabling security features: Attackers can disable critical security features within V2Ray-core, such as authentication or encryption, making the application more vulnerable to other attacks.
