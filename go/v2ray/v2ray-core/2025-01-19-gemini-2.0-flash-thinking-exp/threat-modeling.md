# Threat Model Analysis for v2ray/v2ray-core

## Threat: [VMess Authentication Bypass](./threats/vmess_authentication_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a flaw in the VMess authentication process within v2ray-core to connect to the V2Ray server without valid credentials. This could involve manipulating handshake packets or exploiting cryptographic weaknesses in the VMess implementation.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the V2Ray server, potentially allowing the attacker to route traffic through it, intercept communications, or launch further attacks.

**Affected Component:** VMess protocol handler (inbound/outbound) within v2ray-core.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Keep V2Ray-core updated to the latest stable version, use strong and unique `alterId` values, ensure proper time synchronization between client and server.

## Threat: [Shadowsocks Protocol Vulnerabilities](./threats/shadowsocks_protocol_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in the Shadowsocks protocol implementation within v2ray-core, such as replay attacks or weaknesses in the encryption or authentication mechanisms implemented by v2ray-core.

**Impact:**  Decryption of traffic handled by v2ray-core, interception of communications, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks, or unauthorized access if authentication is compromised.

**Affected Component:** Shadowsocks protocol handler (inbound/outbound) within v2ray-core.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Prefer more modern and secure protocols if possible, keep V2Ray-core updated, use strong and complex passwords for Shadowsocks, consider using AEAD ciphers supported by v2ray-core.

## Threat: [Trojan Protocol Vulnerabilities](./threats/trojan_protocol_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Trojan protocol implementation within v2ray-core, potentially bypassing authentication or exploiting weaknesses in its design as implemented in v2ray-core.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the V2Ray server, allowing the attacker to use it as a proxy, potentially leading to further malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** Trojan protocol handler (inbound/outbound) within v2ray-core.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Keep V2Ray-core updated, use strong and unique passwords for Trojan, ensure the TLS certificate used by Trojan is valid and properly configured within v2ray-core.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Protocol Exploits](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_protocol_exploits.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted packets targeting specific protocol handlers (e.g., VMess, Shadowsocks) within v2ray-core to cause excessive resource consumption or crashes within the v2ray-core process.

**Impact:**  Unavailability of the V2Ray service, disrupting the application's functionality that relies on it.

**Affected Component:** Various protocol handlers (inbound) within v2ray-core.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement rate limiting on inbound connections handled by v2ray-core, configure appropriate resource limits for the v2ray-core process, keep V2Ray-core updated to patch known DoS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Configuration File Vulnerabilities](./threats/configuration_file_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  If the V2Ray configuration file (`config.json`) is not properly secured, an attacker gaining access to the file can modify settings within v2ray-core to compromise the service, such as changing routing rules, disabling security features, or exposing control interfaces.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the V2Ray instance, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Configuration loading and parsing module within v2ray-core.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Secure the configuration file with appropriate file system permissions, avoid storing sensitive information directly in the configuration file if possible (use environment variables or secure secrets management), regularly review and audit the configuration.

## Threat: [Insecure Control Plane Exposure](./threats/insecure_control_plane_exposure.md)

**Description:** If the V2Ray control plane (API or other management interfaces provided by v2ray-core) is exposed without proper authentication or authorization, an attacker can gain control over the V2Ray instance.

**Impact:**  Complete control over the V2Ray instance, allowing the attacker to modify settings, monitor traffic, or shut down the service.

**Affected Component:** Control plane API, gRPC service within v2ray-core.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**  Disable the control plane if not needed, implement strong authentication and authorization for control plane access (e.g., using TLS client certificates), restrict access to the control plane to trusted networks or hosts.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Traffic Amplification](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_traffic_amplification.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within v2ray-core to amplify network traffic, potentially overwhelming the server or other network infrastructure.

**Impact:**  Denial of service for the V2Ray server and potentially other services on the network.

**Affected Component:** Outbound handlers, routing module within v2ray-core.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement rate limiting on outbound traffic handled by v2ray-core, configure appropriate resource limits, monitor network traffic for anomalies.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on V2Ray Binaries](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_v2ray_binaries.md)

**Description:**  Malicious actors could compromise the build or distribution process of V2Ray-core, injecting malware or vulnerabilities into the official binaries.

**Impact:**  Widespread compromise of systems using the affected V2Ray version, potentially leading to data breaches, remote control, or other malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** Entire V2Ray-core codebase and build process.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Download V2Ray-core from official and trusted sources, verify the integrity of downloaded binaries using checksums or signatures, monitor for any unusual behavior after updating V2Ray-core.
