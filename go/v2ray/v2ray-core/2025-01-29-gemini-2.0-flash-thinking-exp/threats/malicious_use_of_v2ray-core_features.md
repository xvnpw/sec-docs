### 4. Deep Analysis of Threats

#### 4.1 Threat: Tunneling and Bypassing Security Controls

*   **Detailed Threat Description:** Attackers leverage `v2ray-core`'s robust tunneling capabilities to establish encrypted connections that bypass traditional network security controls. By configuring `v2ray-core` to use protocols and ports commonly associated with legitimate traffic (e.g., HTTPS on port 443), attackers can effectively mask their malicious activities. This allows them to circumvent firewalls that rely on port and protocol filtering, and potentially evade Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) that are not configured to deeply inspect encrypted traffic or are overwhelmed by the volume of encrypted connections. The tunnel can be used to access internal resources from outside the network, or to establish a covert channel for data exfiltration or command and control.

*   **Attack Vectors and Techniques:**
    *   **Compromised Endpoint:** An attacker compromises an internal system and installs `v2ray-core`. This compromised system then acts as a tunnel endpoint, allowing the attacker to bypass perimeter security.
    *   **Malicious Insider:** A malicious insider with access to configure systems can intentionally set up `v2ray-core` to create tunnels for unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
    *   **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:** While `v2ray-core` itself is actively maintained, vulnerabilities in the application using it or in the underlying operating system could be exploited to install and configure `v2ray-core` for malicious tunneling.
    *   **Social Engineering:** Attackers could trick users into installing and running a pre-configured `v2ray-core` client that establishes a tunnel back to attacker-controlled infrastructure.
    *   **Protocol Obfuscation:** `v2ray-core` supports various transport protocols and obfuscation techniques (e.g., mKCP, WebSocket, HTTP/2, TLS). Attackers can utilize these features to further disguise their traffic and make detection more challenging.
