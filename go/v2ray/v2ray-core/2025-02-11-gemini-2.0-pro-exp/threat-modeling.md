# Threat Model Analysis for v2ray/v2ray-core

## Threat: [Traffic Fingerprinting and Identification](./threats/traffic_fingerprinting_and_identification.md)

*   **Description:** A passive network adversary analyzes traffic patterns (packet sizes, timing, frequency, etc.) even when encrypted, to identify that `v2ray-core` is being used. They might use machine learning or other statistical techniques to distinguish `v2ray-core` traffic from other encrypted traffic. The adversary may not be able to decrypt the content, but they can identify the *use* of `v2ray-core`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Loss of anonymity: Users can be identified as using a circumvention tool.
        *   Service blocking: The adversary can selectively block or throttle connections.
        *   Metadata collection: The adversary can gather information about user activity.
    *   **Affected v2ray-core Component:**
        *   All transport protocols (VMess, VLESS, Shadowsocks, Trojan, etc.).
        *   The `transport` layer and its configuration (`streamSettings`).
        *   Obfuscation mechanisms (TLS, WebSocket) within the `transport` layer.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use protocols designed for strong obfuscation (VLESS + XTLS, Trojan).
        *   Configure TLS with realistic certificates and ciphers.
        *   Use WebSocket transport with appropriate path and host settings.
        *   Avoid default ports or easily guessable configurations.
        *   Regularly update `v2ray-core`.
        *   Consider traffic padding (if supported).
        *   Use bridges or relays.

## Threat: [Active Probing and Blocking](./threats/active_probing_and_blocking.md)

*   **Description:** An active network adversary sends probe packets to the suspected `v2ray-core` server or client to elicit responses that reveal the presence of `v2ray-core` or specific protocols. Based on the responses, the adversary can block the connection.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of service: Users are unable to connect.
        *   Circumvention failure.
    *   **Affected v2ray-core Component:**
        *   All inbound and outbound connection handlers.
        *   The specific protocol implementation (VMess, VLESS, Shadowsocks, etc.).
        *   The `transport` layer and its configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use protocols and configurations resistant to known probing techniques (VLESS + XTLS, Trojan).
        *   Configure `streamSettings` to use TLS with strong ciphers and certificate verification.
        *   Implement fallback mechanisms (switch protocols/servers).
        *   Use domain fronting (with caution).
        *   Regularly update `v2ray-core`.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack.md)

*   **Description:** An adversary intercepts the connection between the client and server, presenting a fake certificate, decrypting traffic, potentially modifying it, and re-encrypting it.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete loss of confidentiality.
        *   Data modification.
        *   Loss of integrity.
        *   Potential for further attacks.
    *   **Affected v2ray-core Component:**
        *   TLS implementation within the `transport` layer (`streamSettings`).
        *   Certificate verification logic.
        *   Protocols that rely on TLS for security.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use TLS with strong ciphers and certificate verification.
        *   Ensure the client verifies the server's certificate against a trusted CA. *Do not* disable certificate verification.
        *   Use protocols with strong authentication (VLESS + XTLS, Trojan).
        *   Consider mutual TLS (mTLS).
        *   Regularly update `v2ray-core`.
        *   Use a secure channel to initially exchange configuration information.

## Threat: [Configuration Error Leading to Leakage](./threats/configuration_error_leading_to_leakage.md)

*   **Description:** A misconfigured `v2ray-core` instance allows traffic to bypass the tunnel or leak identifying information due to incorrect routing rules, DNS settings, or security parameters.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Loss of anonymity: User's real IP address or DNS requests may be exposed.
        *   Circumvention failure.
        *   Potential for data leakage.
    *   **Affected v2ray-core Component:**
        *   `routing` configuration.
        *   `inbounds` and `outbounds` configurations.
        *   DNS settings within `v2ray-core` or the OS.
        *   `policy` configuration (if used).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test the configuration.
        *   Use a configuration validation tool (if available).
        *   Provide clear and secure configuration instructions.
        *   Use a secure method for distributing configurations.
        *   Configure DNS to use a trusted resolver over TLS/HTTPS *through* the tunnel.
        *   Use "full tunnel" configurations.
        *   Regularly audit the configuration.

## Threat: [Exploitation of v2ray-core Vulnerability](./threats/exploitation_of_v2ray-core_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** A security vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, RCE) is discovered in the `v2ray-core` code. An attacker crafts a malicious payload to exploit it, gaining control of the process or system.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete system compromise.
        *   Data theft.
        *   Denial of service.
        *   Use as a botnet.
    *   **Affected v2ray-core Component:**
        *   Potentially any part of the `v2ray-core` codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `v2ray-core` updated to the latest stable version. *This is crucial.*
        *   Monitor security advisories.
        *   Temporarily disable `v2ray-core` or use an alternative if a patch isn't available.
        *   Run `v2ray-core` with least privileges.
        *   Consider sandboxing.

## Threat: [Upstream Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/upstream_dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability is discovered in a library that `v2ray-core` depends on. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to compromise `v2ray-core`.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to a direct `v2ray-core` vulnerability, this could lead to system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected v2ray-core Component:** The component that uses the vulnerable dependency. This is difficult to predict without knowing the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability in the dependency)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `v2ray-core` updated.  `v2ray-core` updates often include updates to its dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for `v2ray-core` *and* its major dependencies.
        *   Consider using a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to identify and track vulnerabilities in dependencies.
