# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for v2ray/v2ray-core

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Configuration Validation (v2ray-core specific aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_configuration_validation__v2ray-core_specific_aspects_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Configuration Validation (v2ray-core specific)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schema Definition (v2ray-core):**  Utilize v2ray-core's own schema definitions (if available, or create a custom one based on the documented configuration structure) to validate the structure and data types of the configuration *before* passing it to v2ray-core.
    2.  **Semantic Validation (v2ray-core):** Implement checks specific to v2ray-core's configuration options:
        *   **Inbound/Outbound Handler Compatibility:** Verify that the chosen inbound and outbound handlers are compatible with each other.
        *   **`streamSettings` Validation:**  Validate the parameters within `streamSettings` (e.g., `network`, `security`, `tcpSettings`, `kcpSettings`, `wsSettings`, `httpSettings`, `quicSettings`, `grpcSettings`) according to v2ray-core's documentation. Check for valid values and combinations.
        *   **Routing Rule Validation (v2ray-core):** Validate the syntax and semantics of v2ray-core's routing rules (`routing.rules`). Ensure that `domain`, `ip`, `port`, `network`, `source`, `user`, `inboundTag`, and `protocol` fields are used correctly.
        *   **DNS Configuration Validation (v2ray-core):** Validate the `dns` section of the configuration, ensuring that `servers` are valid DNS server addresses (or hostnames if using DoH/DoT) and that `hosts` entries are correctly formatted.
        *   **`policy` Validation:** If using v2ray-core's `policy` feature, validate the configuration of connection timeouts, buffer sizes, and other policy settings.
    3.  **Error Handling (v2ray-core):**  Capture and handle any errors returned by v2ray-core during configuration loading. Provide informative error messages to the user/administrator, referencing the specific v2ray-core configuration parameter that caused the error.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Internal Services (Severity: High):**  Directly prevents misconfigurations within v2ray-core that could expose internal services.
    *   **Traffic Leaks (Severity: High):** Ensures correct routing within v2ray-core, preventing leaks.
    *   **Use of Weak Protocols/Ciphers (Severity: High):** Enforces the use of strong settings within v2ray-core.
    *   **DNS Leaks (Severity: High):** Validates v2ray-core's DNS settings.
    *   **Unintentional Open Relays (Severity: High):** Prevents misconfigured inbound handlers within v2ray-core.
    *   **v2ray-core Specific Configuration Errors (Severity: Medium):** Reduces errors specific to v2ray-core's configuration format.

*   **Impact:**
    *   All listed threats: Risk reduced significantly (effectiveness depends on the comprehensiveness of the validation).

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: Basic schema validation using a custom schema.  Limited semantic validation of `streamSettings`.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example: Comprehensive semantic validation of routing rules, DNS configuration, and `policy` settings.  Robust error handling for v2ray-core specific errors.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Protocol Hardening (v2ray-core configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/protocol_hardening__v2ray-core_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Protocol Hardening (v2ray-core configuration)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **`streamSettings` Configuration:**  Within the `streamSettings` of each inbound and outbound handler, explicitly configure:
        *   **`network`:** Choose a secure network type (e.g., `tcp`, `kcp`, `ws`, `http`, `quic`, `grpc`). Avoid `tcp` without TLS.
        *   **`security`:**  Set to `tls` for all connections where possible.
        *   **TLS Settings:**  Within the `tlsSettings` (if `security` is set to `tls`):
            *   **`allowInsecure`:**  Set to `false` to prevent connections to servers with invalid certificates.
            *   **`serverName`:**  Set to the correct server hostname to prevent MITM attacks.
            *   **`certificates`:**  Configure server and/or client certificates as needed for authentication.
            *   **`minVersion` and `maxVersion`**: Enforce TLS 1.3 by setting both to "1.3".
            *   **`cipherSuites`:**  Specify a list of allowed cipher suites, prioritizing strong, modern ciphers (e.g., those recommended by TLS 1.3).
        *   **Protocol-Specific Settings:**  Configure the settings for the chosen network type (e.g., `tcpSettings`, `kcpSettings`, etc.) according to security best practices.
    2.  **VMess Configuration (If Used):**
        *   **`alterId`:** Set to a high value (e.g., 64 or higher).  Strongly consider migrating to VLESS or Trojan.
        *   **`security`:** Use "aes-128-gcm" or "chacha20-poly1305" (AEAD ciphers).
    3. **VLESS/Trojan Configuration (Recommended):** Prefer using VLESS or Trojan over VMess for improved security and performance. Configure them with TLS and strong ciphers.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Use of Weak Protocols/Ciphers (Severity: High):** Directly controls the protocols and ciphers used by v2ray-core.
    *   **Replay Attacks (Severity: Medium):** Mitigates replay attacks against VMess (if used).
    *   **Downgrade Attacks (Severity: High):** Prevents TLS downgrade attacks.
    *   **MITM Attacks (Severity: High):**  `serverName` and certificate validation prevent MITM attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   All listed threats: Risk reduced significantly (effectiveness depends on the specific settings used).

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: `security` is set to `tls` for all connections. `allowInsecure` is `false`.  Basic TLS settings are configured.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example: `cipherSuites` is not explicitly configured.  VMess is still used in some configurations (no `alterId` enforcement).  No migration plan to VLESS/Trojan.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [DNS Security (v2ray-core configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/dns_security__v2ray-core_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** DNS Security (v2ray-core configuration)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **`dns` Configuration:**  Within the `dns` section of the v2ray-core configuration:
        *   **`servers`:**  Specify a list of trusted DNS server addresses using DoH or DoT URLs (e.g., `"https://1.1.1.1/dns-query"`, `"tls://8.8.8.8:853"`).
        *   **`hosts`:**  Use the `hosts` section to define static mappings for specific domains if needed (e.g., for local development or to override DNS resolution for certain domains).  Ensure these mappings are correct and up-to-date.
        *   **`clientIp`**: If your application is aware of client IP, use it to improve DNS query.
    2. **Disable System DNS:** Ensure that v2ray-core is *not* configured to use the system's default DNS resolver. This is usually the default, but it's important to verify.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **DNS Leaks (Severity: High):**  Forces DNS queries through secure channels within v2ray-core.
    *   **DNS Hijacking/Poisoning (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk by using trusted DoH/DoT servers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DNS Leaks:** Risk reduced significantly (near elimination if configured correctly).
    *   **DNS Hijacking/Poisoning:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: `servers` is set to a single DoH server.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example: No fallback DNS servers.  `hosts` is not used. System DNS usage not explicitly checked.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Obfuscation Techniques (v2ray-core configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/obfuscation_techniques__v2ray-core_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Obfuscation Techniques (v2ray-core configuration)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **`streamSettings` Configuration:**  Within the `streamSettings` of each inbound and outbound handler, configure obfuscation options based on the chosen network type:
        *   **`tcpSettings`:** Use `header` to configure HTTP obfuscation.
        *   **`kcpSettings`:** Use `headerType` to configure obfuscation (e.g., `srtp`, `utp`, `wechat-video`, `dtls`, `wireguard`).
        *   **`wsSettings`:** Use `path` and `headers` to configure WebSocket obfuscation.
        *   **`httpSettings`:** Use `host` and `path` to configure HTTP/2 obfuscation.
        *   **`quicSettings`:** Use `security` and `key` to configure QUIC obfuscation.
        *   **`grpcSettings`:** Use `serviceName` to configure gRPC obfuscation.
    2.  **Experimentation:** Experiment with different obfuscation settings to find the most effective configuration for your specific network environment.
    3.  **Regular Review:**  Periodically review and adjust obfuscation settings as network conditions and censorship techniques evolve.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Traffic Analysis and Fingerprinting (Severity: Medium):** Makes it more difficult for censors to identify and block v2ray traffic based on patterns.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Traffic Analysis and Fingerprinting:** Risk reduced (effectiveness varies depending on the obfuscation method and the sophistication of the censor).

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: WebSocket obfuscation is used with a custom `path`.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example: No systematic experimentation with different obfuscation methods.  No regular review of obfuscation effectiveness.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Stay Updated (v2ray-core itself)](./mitigation_strategies/stay_updated__v2ray-core_itself_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Stay Updated (v2ray-core itself)
*   **Description:**
    1. **Direct Update of v2ray-core:** This involves directly updating the v2ray-core binary or library files that your application uses. The specific steps depend on how v2ray-core is integrated:
        * **Binary Distribution:** If you're using a pre-compiled binary, replace the old binary with the new one.
        * **Go Module:** If you're using v2ray-core as a Go module, use `go get -u github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core@latest` (or a specific version) to update the module, then rebuild your application.
        * **Other Integration Methods:** Follow the appropriate update procedure for your specific integration method.
    2. **Restart:** After updating v2ray-core, restart your application to ensure that the new version is loaded.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
     *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (Severity: High to Critical):** Directly addresses vulnerabilities within the v2ray-core code itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced significantly (the faster updates are applied, the lower the risk).

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: Manual replacement of the v2ray-core binary when updates are announced.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example: No automated update mechanism for the v2ray-core binary. No version pinning.]
