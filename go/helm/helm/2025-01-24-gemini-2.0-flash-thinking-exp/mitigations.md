# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for helm/helm

## Mitigation Strategy: [Chart Provenance Verification](./mitigation_strategies/chart_provenance_verification.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a signing tool:** Select a tool like `cosign` or `helm-sigstore-plugin` to sign and verify Helm charts.
    2.  **Generate Key Pair:** Create a private key for signing charts and a corresponding public key for verification. Securely store the private key.
    3.  **Sign Charts in CI/CD Pipeline:** Integrate chart signing into the CI/CD pipeline. After building a chart, use the private key and the chosen signing tool to generate a signature for the chart.
    4.  **Publish Signed Charts:** Publish both the Helm chart and its signature to a chart repository.
    5.  **Implement Verification in Deployment Pipeline:** Modify the deployment pipeline to include a verification step before installing or upgrading a chart using `helm install --verify` or similar commands with the chosen tool. Use the public key to verify the signature. Fail deployment if verification fails.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Malicious Chart Injection (High Severity) - Attackers injecting malicious code into charts hosted in compromised or untrusted repositories.
    *   **Threat:** Chart Tampering (Medium Severity) - Unauthorized modification of charts during transit or storage.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Chart Injection:** High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring only charts signed by a trusted entity are deployed.
    *   **Chart Tampering:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk by detecting unauthorized modifications.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Chart signing using `cosign` is integrated into the CI pipeline for staging environment charts.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Chart verification is not yet enforced in the production deployment pipeline. Key management for signing keys needs improvement.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Trusted Chart Repositories](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_trusted_chart_repositories.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify and Vet Repositories:**  Establish a list of approved and trusted Helm chart repositories. This could be internal repositories or well-known and vetted public repositories.
    2.  **Prioritize Internal Repository:**  Set up and maintain an internal Helm chart repository. Encourage teams to publish and consume charts from this internal repository using `helm push` and `helm install`.
    3.  **Repository Scanning:** Implement vulnerability scanning for charts stored in both internal and external repositories. Use tools that can analyze chart contents for known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations before using `helm install`.
    4.  **Document Approved Repositories:**  Clearly document the list of approved repositories and communicate this list to development teams for use with `helm repo add`.
    5.  **Restrict Repository Access (Optional):** For sensitive environments, consider restricting Helm client access to only the approved repositories, preventing accidental or intentional use of untrusted sources in `helm repo add`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks via Charts (High Severity) - Using charts from untrusted sources that may contain vulnerabilities or malicious code.
    *   **Threat:** Accidental Deployment of Vulnerable Charts (Medium Severity) - Developers unknowingly using charts from repositories that are not regularly scanned or maintained.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Charts:** High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk by limiting chart sources to vetted and controlled repositories.
    *   **Accidental Deployment of Vulnerable Charts:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk by promoting the use of scanned and potentially more secure repositories.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. An internal chart repository is set up, but its adoption is not fully enforced. Some teams still use public repositories directly with `helm repo add`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Enforce the use of the internal repository as the primary source for charts. Implement automated vulnerability scanning for the internal repository. Formalize the process for vetting and approving external repositories for `helm repo add`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Perform Chart Audits and Security Reviews](./mitigation_strategies/perform_chart_audits_and_security_reviews.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Audit Process:** Define a process for regular security audits and reviews of Helm charts, especially before deploying to production or when introducing new charts from external sources using `helm install`.
    2.  **Manual Code Review:** Conduct manual code reviews of chart templates, values files, and hooks. Look for potential security vulnerabilities like command injection, template injection, insecure defaults, or exposed secrets within Helm chart files.
    3.  **Static Analysis Tools:** Integrate static analysis tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan charts for security best practices and potential issues before `helm install`. Tools like `kubeval`, `helm lint`, or custom scripts can be used.
    4.  **Security Checklist:** Create a security checklist for chart reviews, covering aspects relevant to Helm charts like secrets management within charts, privilege levels requested by charts, input validation in templates, and resource limits defined in charts.
    5.  **Document Audit Findings:** Document the findings of each chart audit and track remediation efforts for issues found in Helm charts.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Misconfigurations in Charts (Medium Severity) - Charts containing insecure default configurations or allowing for insecure configurations through values used with `helm install --set`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formalize the chart audit process and make it mandatory for all charts before `helm install`. Integrate static analysis tools into the CI/CD pipeline. Develop a comprehensive security checklist for Helm chart reviews.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Secure Default Configurations in Charts](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_secure_default_configurations_in_charts.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Default Values:**  Carefully review the default values defined in `values.yaml` and `templates` for all charts. Ensure that defaults are secure and follow security best practices for Helm deployments.
    2.  **Minimize Overrides:** Design charts to minimize the need for users to override default security settings using `helm install --set`. If overrides are necessary, provide clear guidance and documentation on secure configuration options.
    3.  **Principle of Least Privilege by Default:**  Ensure that default configurations adhere to the principle of least privilege in the context of Kubernetes resources created by Helm charts. For example, default service accounts should have minimal permissions, and containers should run as non-root users by default in chart templates.
    4.  **Security Hardening Defaults:**  Incorporate security hardening best practices into default configurations within Helm charts, such as setting resource limits in templates, disabling unnecessary features exposed by charts, and enabling security-related features by default in `values.yaml`.
    5.  **Document Secure Defaults:** Clearly document the secure default configurations in chart documentation and explain the security rationale behind them for users deploying with `helm install`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Insecure Default Configurations (Medium Severity) - Deploying applications with insecure default settings due to chart configurations when using `helm install`.
    *   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity) - Charts requesting or allowing for excessive privileges by default in Kubernetes resources they create.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Insecure Default Configurations:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk by ensuring applications are deployed with secure configurations out-of-the-box when using default `helm install`.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk by limiting default privileges and encouraging least privilege configurations in Helm charts.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some charts have been reviewed for secure defaults, but it's not a systematic approach across all charts.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Conduct a comprehensive review of default configurations for all existing charts. Establish guidelines and best practices for secure default configurations for new Helm chart development.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Input Validation and Sanitization in Chart Templates](./mitigation_strategies/implement_input_validation_and_sanitization_in_chart_templates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User Inputs:**  Identify all places in chart templates where user-provided values from `values.yaml` or `helm install --set` are used (e.g., using `.Values`).
    2.  **Validate Input Types and Formats:**  Use Helm's built-in functions and Sprig library functions within chart templates to validate the type and format of user inputs. For example, check if a value is an integer, string, or matches a specific regex pattern before using it in templates.
    3.  **Sanitize Inputs:** Sanitize user inputs within chart templates to prevent injection attacks. For example, use functions to escape special characters or limit input length before using them in commands or configurations generated by templates.
    4.  **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for invalid inputs within chart templates. Use `fail` function or conditional logic to prevent chart rendering or deployment if validation fails, providing informative error messages to users during `helm install`.
    5.  **Template Functions for Security:** Utilize template functions that help prevent vulnerabilities, such as functions for URL encoding, HTML escaping, or string manipulation within chart templates to ensure secure output.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Template Injection Attacks (High Severity) - Exploiting vulnerabilities in chart templates due to unsanitized user inputs from `values.yaml` or `helm install --set`, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code within the template rendering engine during `helm install`.
    *   **Threat:** Command Injection Attacks (High Severity) -  Exploiting vulnerabilities where user inputs are used to construct shell commands within chart templates or hooks without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the container or node during deployment via `helm install`.
    *   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Applications (Medium Severity) - If chart templates generate web application configurations, unsanitized inputs could lead to XSS vulnerabilities in the deployed application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Template Injection Attacks:** High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk by preventing malicious code injection through template vulnerabilities in Helm charts.
    *   **Command Injection Attacks:** High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk by preventing execution of arbitrary commands through input sanitization in Helm charts.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Applications:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities if chart templates are involved in generating web application configurations.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic input validation is used in some charts, but it's not consistently applied across all charts. Sanitization is less frequently used in Helm templates.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization across all chart templates. Develop guidelines and code examples for developers on how to properly validate and sanitize inputs in Helm charts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Apply Security Policies for Chart Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/apply_security_policies_for_chart_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Security Policies:** Define security policies that specify acceptable and unacceptable chart configurations. These policies can cover aspects like resource limits, security contexts, network policies (defined in charts), and allowed capabilities requested by charts.
    2.  **Choose Policy Enforcement Tool:** Select a policy enforcement tool like Open Policy Agent (OPA) or Kyverno that can be integrated with Kubernetes and Helm to validate chart configurations before `helm install`.
    3.  **Implement Policies as Code:**  Implement the defined security policies as code using the chosen policy enforcement tool's language (e.g., Rego for OPA, YAML for Kyverno). Policies should focus on validating Helm chart manifests and configurations.
    4.  **Integrate Policy Enforcement in CI/CD:** Integrate policy enforcement into the CI/CD pipeline. Before deploying a chart using `helm install`, use the policy enforcement tool to validate the chart's configuration against the defined policies. Fail the deployment if policies are violated.
    5.  **Continuous Policy Monitoring (Optional):**  Consider implementing continuous policy monitoring in the Kubernetes cluster to detect and potentially remediate configuration drifts or violations after deployment, although this is less directly Helm-related. Focus on pre-deployment checks.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Configuration Drift from Security Baselines (Medium Severity) - Charts being deployed with configurations that deviate from established security baselines over time when using `helm install`.
    *   **Threat:** Non-Compliance with Security Policies (Medium Severity) - Developers deploying charts that violate organizational security policies due to lack of enforcement during `helm install`.
