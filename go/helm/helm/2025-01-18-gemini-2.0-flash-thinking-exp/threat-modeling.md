# Threat Model Analysis for helm/helm

## Threat: [Installation of Malicious Charts](./threats/installation_of_malicious_charts.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could convince a user to install a Helm chart from an untrusted source. The Helm client would then fetch and process this chart, potentially executing malicious code within the Kubernetes cluster upon deployment. The attacker might distribute this chart through a compromised repository or social engineering, leveraging the Helm client's functionality to install it.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the deployed application and potentially the underlying Kubernetes cluster. This could lead to data breaches, service disruption, and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** Helm Client CLI, Chart Installation process
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only use trusted and verified chart repositories.
        *   Implement chart signing and verification mechanisms within the Helm workflow.
        *   Scan charts for known vulnerabilities before installation, potentially integrating with Helm tooling.
        *   Educate users about the risks of installing charts from unknown sources and the role of the Helm client in this process.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Insecure Chart Templates](./threats/exploitation_of_insecure_chart_templates.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in chart templates that are processed by the Helm templating engine. This might involve injecting malicious code through template functions or leveraging insecure default configurations defined in the templates. The Helm templating engine's logic is directly involved in rendering these templates into Kubernetes manifests.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive information, privilege escalation within the cluster, or the ability to execute arbitrary code within the deployed application's containers, all stemming from flaws in how Helm processes templates.
    *   **Affected Component:** Chart Templates (within the Chart), Helm Templating Engine
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and audit chart templates for security vulnerabilities, focusing on how Helm functions are used.
        *   Enforce secure coding practices in chart templates, considering the specific capabilities of the Helm templating language.
        *   Utilize Helm's built-in functions for secure value handling to prevent injection vulnerabilities during the templating process.
        *   Avoid using user-supplied input directly in template logic without proper sanitization within the Helm template context.

## Threat: [Exposure of Secrets in Charts](./threats/exposure_of_secrets_in_charts.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might unintentionally include sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or certificates directly within chart files (e.g., `values.yaml` or templates) that are part of the Helm chart structure. The Helm packaging process would then include these secrets.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to other systems or data protected by the exposed secrets, directly resulting from the insecure inclusion of secrets within Helm charts.
    *   **Affected Component:** Chart Files (`values.yaml`, templates), Chart Packaging
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never hardcode secrets in chart files that are managed by Helm.
        *   Utilize Kubernetes Secrets for managing sensitive information, ensuring Helm is configured to deploy these secrets securely.
        *   Consider using external secret management solutions integrated with Kubernetes and Helm for secure secret injection.
        *   Implement processes to prevent accidental inclusion of secrets in version control for Helm chart repositories.

## Threat: [Compromised Chart Repository](./threats/compromised_chart_repository.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could compromise a chart repository, either by gaining unauthorized access or exploiting vulnerabilities in the repository software. They could then inject malicious charts or modify existing ones that are served through the repository index, which is used by the Helm client to discover charts.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread deployment of compromised applications across multiple environments, potentially leading to significant data breaches and service disruptions, as users rely on Helm to fetch charts from this compromised source.
    *   **Affected Component:** Chart Repository (Index, Storage) - while not strictly *in* the Helm codebase, it's a critical part of the Helm ecosystem.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use trusted and reputable chart repositories.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the chart repository.
        *   Utilize chart signing and verification mechanisms within the Helm workflow to ensure chart integrity.
        *   Regularly audit the security of the chart repository infrastructure.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Chart Download](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_chart_download.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker positioned between the Helm client and the chart repository could intercept the chart download process initiated by the Helm client and replace the legitimate chart with a malicious one. This is more likely if the connection to the repository is not secured (e.g., using HTTP instead of HTTPS), allowing manipulation of the data transferred by the Helm client.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of a malicious chart, leading to the same consequences as installing a malicious chart directly, facilitated by the compromised download process of the Helm client.
    *   **Affected Component:** Helm Client CLI, Chart Download process
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use HTTPS for accessing chart repositories, ensuring secure communication for the Helm client.
        *   Utilize chart checksum verification within the Helm client to ensure the integrity of downloaded charts.
        *   Employ secure network configurations to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks affecting Helm client operations.

## Threat: [Insufficient Access Control for Helm Operations (Especially relevant for Helm v2 with Tiller)](./threats/insufficient_access_control_for_helm_operations__especially_relevant_for_helm_v2_with_tiller_.md)

*   **Description:** In Helm v2, if Tiller has overly permissive access to the Kubernetes API, an attacker gaining access to Tiller could perform unauthorized actions across the entire cluster via Helm's deployment mechanisms. In Helm v3+, insufficient RBAC permissions for the service accounts used by Helm could grant excessive privileges if misconfigured, allowing unauthorized manipulation of cluster resources through Helm.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized deployment, modification, or deletion of applications and resources within the Kubernetes cluster, potentially leading to cluster-wide compromise (especially with Tiller in v2), all facilitated by the access controls governing Helm's actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Tiller (Helm v2), Kubernetes API (Helm v3+), RBAC configurations related to Helm
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Migrate to Helm v3 or later to eliminate Tiller and its broad permissions.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege when configuring RBAC roles for Helm and related service accounts that interact with the Kubernetes API.
        *   Regularly review and audit RBAC configurations specifically for Helm's permissions.
        *   Restrict access to the Kubernetes API based on the necessary Helm operations.
