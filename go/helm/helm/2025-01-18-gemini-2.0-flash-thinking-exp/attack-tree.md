## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Chart](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_chart.md)

*   This path focuses on attackers inserting malicious code directly into Helm charts.
    *   It branches into two main ways to achieve this:
        *   **Compromise Chart Source:**
            *   **Compromise Chart Repository:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the chart repository and modify existing charts or upload malicious ones. This requires compromising repository credentials or exploiting repository vulnerabilities.
            *   **Compromise Developer Machine:** Attackers compromise a developer's machine with access to the chart repository and modify charts locally before pushing them.
        *   **Leverage Templating Engine Vulnerabilities:**
            *   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** Attackers inject malicious code into chart values that are then rendered by the Go templating engine, leading to arbitrary code execution on the Kubernetes cluster.
            *   **Insecure Use of Sprig Functions:** Helm uses Sprig template functions. Insecure usage of these functions (e.g., `exec`, `readFile` with unsanitized input) can allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the cluster.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfiguration in Chart](./attack_tree_paths/misconfiguration_in_chart.md)

*   This path highlights the risks associated with insecure configurations within Helm charts.
    *   It includes:
        *   **Expose Sensitive Information in Templates:**
            *   **Hardcoded Secrets, API Keys, Passwords:** Developers accidentally or intentionally hardcode sensitive information directly into chart templates or `values.yaml` files.
        *   **Insecure Default Values:**
            *   **Weak Passwords, Open Ports:** Default values in `values.yaml` might contain weak passwords for databases or other services, or expose unnecessary ports.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Helm Client Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_helm_client_configuration.md)

*   This path focuses on attacks targeting the Helm client's configuration.
    *   **Steal kubeconfig Credentials:** The Helm client relies on `kubeconfig` files to authenticate with Kubernetes clusters. If an attacker gains access to these files, they can control the clusters managed by that configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Helm Hooks](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_helm_hooks.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting Helm's lifecycle hooks.
    *   **Inject Malicious Code via Hooks:**
        *   **Leverage Post-Install, Post-Upgrade Hooks:** Attackers can inject malicious code into these hooks (e.g., scripts that run after installation or upgrade) to gain initial access or perform post-exploitation activities.
