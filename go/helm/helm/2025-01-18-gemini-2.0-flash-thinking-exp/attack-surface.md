# Attack Surface Analysis for helm/helm

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted or Malicious Helm Chart Repositories](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_or_malicious_helm_chart_repositories.md)

**Description:** Using Helm chart repositories that host malicious or vulnerable charts.

**How Helm Contributes:** Helm relies on repositories to discover and download charts. If these repositories are compromised or untrusted, users can unknowingly deploy malicious applications.

**Example:** A developer adds a public, unverified Helm repository to their configuration. This repository contains a chart with a known vulnerability or a backdoor. When the developer deploys this chart, the vulnerable application is deployed to the Kubernetes cluster.

**Impact:** Deployment of vulnerable applications, introduction of backdoors, data breaches, compromise of the Kubernetes cluster.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only use trusted and verified Helm chart repositories.
*   Implement chart signing and verification mechanisms to ensure chart integrity.
*   Regularly scan deployed charts for known vulnerabilities using security tools.
*   Maintain an inventory of approved chart repositories.
*   Consider hosting an internal, curated Helm chart repository.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Helm Charts](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_helm_charts.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Go templating engine used by Helm to inject malicious code through chart values.

**How Helm Contributes:** Helm uses Go templates to dynamically generate Kubernetes manifests based on provided values. Improperly sanitized or validated values can be used to inject malicious template code.

**Example:** A chart template uses a user-provided value directly in a command execution context without proper escaping. An attacker provides a malicious value that, when rendered by the template engine, executes arbitrary commands within the Kubernetes cluster.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the Kubernetes cluster, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided values used within chart templates.
*   Avoid using complex or dynamic logic within templates where possible.
*   Utilize Helm's built-in functions for escaping and quoting values.
*   Implement static analysis tools to scan chart templates for potential SSTI vulnerabilities.
*   Follow secure templating best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Chart Manifests Requesting Excessive Permissions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_chart_manifests_requesting_excessive_permissions.md)

**Description:** Helm charts containing Kubernetes manifests that request overly permissive roles, role bindings, or cluster roles.

**How Helm Contributes:** Helm deploys the Kubernetes resources defined in the chart manifests. If these manifests request excessive permissions, the deployed application or associated service accounts could gain unnecessary privileges.

**Example:** A chart for a simple web application requests `cluster-admin` privileges. If deployed, this application's service account would have full control over the Kubernetes cluster.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation within the Kubernetes cluster, potential for lateral movement and further compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when defining roles and permissions in chart manifests.
*   Thoroughly review chart manifests before deployment, paying close attention to RBAC configurations.
*   Use tools to analyze chart manifests for excessive permissions.
*   Implement admission controllers to enforce security policies and restrict the creation of overly permissive resources.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Helm Hooks](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_helm_hooks.md)

**Description:** Maliciously crafted Helm hooks (pre-install, post-upgrade, etc.) are used to execute arbitrary commands within the Kubernetes cluster during the deployment lifecycle.

**How Helm Contributes:** Helm allows defining hooks that execute scripts or commands at specific points in the release lifecycle. If these hooks are not carefully designed and secured, they can be exploited.

**Example:** A malicious chart includes a post-install hook that downloads and executes a script from an external, compromised server, leading to malware installation on the Kubernetes nodes.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on Kubernetes nodes, data breaches, compromise of the Kubernetes cluster.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review and understand the purpose of all Helm hooks in a chart.
*   Avoid executing external scripts or commands within hooks if possible.
*   If external scripts are necessary, ensure they are downloaded over secure channels and their integrity is verified.
*   Limit the permissions of the service account used by Helm during hook execution.
*   Implement monitoring and alerting for unexpected activity during hook execution.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Chart Content](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_chart_content.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information (secrets, API keys, internal configurations) is inadvertently included within Helm chart templates or `values.yaml` files.

**How Helm Contributes:** Helm packages all chart files together. If sensitive data is directly included, it can be easily accessed by anyone with access to the chart.

**Example:** A developer hardcodes a database password in a `values.yaml` file. This password is then stored in the Helm release history and potentially in version control, making it accessible to unauthorized individuals.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to internal systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never hardcode sensitive information directly in chart files.
*   Utilize Kubernetes Secrets to manage sensitive data.
*   Use external secret management solutions and integrate them with Helm.
*   Implement Git pre-commit hooks to prevent committing sensitive data.
*   Regularly scan chart repositories and release history for exposed secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Excessive Permissions Granted to the Helm Client/Service Account](./attack_surfaces/excessive_permissions_granted_to_the_helm_clientservice_account.md)

**Description:** The user or service account used by the `helm` client has overly broad permissions within the Kubernetes cluster.

**How Helm Contributes:** Helm requires permissions to manage Kubernetes resources. If these permissions are excessive, a compromised client or account can cause significant damage.

**Example:** The service account used by the CI/CD pipeline to deploy Helm charts has `cluster-admin` privileges. If this pipeline is compromised, the attacker gains full control over the cluster.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Kubernetes cluster, unauthorized modification or deletion of resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to Helm clients and service accounts.
*   Use role-based access control (RBAC) to define granular permissions.
*   Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to Helm-related accounts.
*   Consider using namespace-scoped permissions where appropriate.
