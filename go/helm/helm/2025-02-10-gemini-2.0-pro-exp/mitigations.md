# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for helm/helm

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Verified Chart Repositories](./mitigation_strategies/use_verified_chart_repositories.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Use Verified Chart Repositories**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Trusted Sources:** Create a list of approved chart repositories.  This should include official sources (like Artifact Hub's verified publishers) and repositories from trusted vendors. Consider creating an internal repository for vetted, internally-developed charts.
    2.  **Configure `repositories.yaml`:** Modify the Helm `repositories.yaml` file (usually located at `~/.config/helm/repositories.yaml` or a similar path) to *only* include the approved repositories.  Remove any default or untrusted entries.  This is a direct interaction with Helm's configuration.
    3.  **Regular Review:** Establish a schedule (e.g., monthly, quarterly) to review and update the list of trusted repositories. Remove any repositories that are no longer maintained or have become untrustworthy.
    4.  **Internal Repository (Optional):** If using an internal repository (ChartMuseum, Harbor, etc.), establish a process for vetting and uploading charts to this repository using `helm push`. This process should include security scanning and signature verification.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Charts (High Severity):** Prevents installation (`helm install`) of charts containing malicious code or backdoors.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of a compromised repository injecting malicious code.
    *   **Outdated/Vulnerable Charts (Medium Severity):** Reduces likelihood of using charts from unmaintained sources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Charts:** Significantly reduces risk (High Impact).
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Significantly reduces risk (High Impact).
    *   **Outdated/Vulnerable Charts:** Moderately reduces risk (Medium Impact).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. We use Artifact Hub, but also have less-known repositories in `dev-repos`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal, documented list of approved repositories.
    *   `repositories.yaml` contains untrusted entries (`dev-repos`).
    *   Regular review process is not established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify Chart Signatures (Provenance)](./mitigation_strategies/verify_chart_signatures__provenance_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Verify Chart Signatures (Provenance)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate Key Pair (Chart Authors):** Chart authors generate a PGP key pair.
    2.  **Sign Charts:** Use `helm package --sign --keyring <path_to_keyring> --key <key_name>` to sign the chart. This is a direct Helm CLI command.  This creates a `.prov` file.
    3.  **Distribute Public Key:** Make the public key available.
    4.  **Import Public Key (Users):** Users import the key into their GPG keyring.
    5.  **Verify on Install/Upgrade:** Use the `--verify` flag with `helm install` or `helm upgrade`: `helm install --verify <chart_name>`. This is a *critical* direct Helm CLI interaction for security.
    6.  **CI/CD Integration:** Incorporate signature verification into the CI/CD pipeline, using `helm install --verify` or `helm pull --verify` in scripts.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Chart Tampering (High Severity):** Prevents installation of modified charts.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (High Severity):** Attackers cannot silently replace a signed chart.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Chart Tampering:** Eliminates risk if implemented correctly (High Impact).
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Significantly reduces risk (High Impact).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No chart signing process.
    *   No public keys distributed.
    *   `--verify` flag not used.
    *   No CI/CD integration for verification.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Value Handling](./mitigation_strategies/secure_value_handling.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Value Handling**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Kubernetes Secrets:** Store sensitive data in Kubernetes Secrets.
    2.  **Secret References:** Reference Secrets in chart templates (e.g., `{{ .Values.secretName }}`).
    3.  **Secrets Management Solution (Optional):** Integrate a secrets solution (Vault, etc.).
    4.  **Avoid `--set` for Secrets:** *Never* use the `helm install --set` or `helm upgrade --set` flags to pass sensitive values on the command line. This is a crucial Helm usage best practice.
    5.  **Secure `values.yaml`:** Store `values.yaml` securely (e.g., private Git repo). Do *not* include sensitive data directly in `values.yaml`.
    6.  **Environment Variables (Caution):** Use environment variables for non-sensitive configuration. For sensitive values, prefer Secrets.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Exposure (High Severity):** Prevents sensitive data exposure in plain text.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Reduces risk of data compromise.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Exposure:** Significantly reduces risk (High Impact).
    *   **Data Breach:** Significantly reduces risk (High Impact).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. Kubernetes Secrets used inconsistently. Some sensitive values are passed via environment variables or `values.yaml`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent use of Kubernetes Secrets.
    *   Removal of sensitive data from `values.yaml` and environment variables.
    *   Consideration of a secrets management solution.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Immutable Chart Releases](./mitigation_strategies/immutable_chart_releases.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Immutable Chart Releases**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Versioning:** Use a consistent versioning scheme (e.g., SemVer) with `version` field in `Chart.yaml`.
    2.  **New Releases for Changes:** Create a *new* release with an incremented version number for any chart changes.  This directly impacts how `helm package` is used.
    3.  **No Modification of Existing Releases:** Do *not* modify existing releases in the chart repository.  This is a key principle for using `helm push` correctly.
    4.  **Rollback:** Use `helm rollback` to revert to a previous release. This is a direct Helm command for managing releases.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintentional Changes (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental modifications.
    *   **Tampering (Medium Severity):** Makes it harder to silently modify a deployed chart.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintentional Changes:** Significantly reduces risk (Medium Impact).
    *   **Tampering:** Moderately reduces risk (Medium Impact).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. SemVer is used, but existing releases have been modified.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Strict adherence to immutability.
    *   Clear policy for updates and rollbacks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Helm Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_helm_updated.md)

**5. Mitigation Strategy: Keep Helm Updated**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regular Updates:** Regularly update the `helm` client and plugins.
    2.  **Package Manager/Official Instructions:** Use a package manager or official instructions.
    3.  **Security Announcements:** Subscribe to Helm's security announcements.
    4.  **Testing:** Test deployment workflows after updating Helm.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Helm Client Vulnerabilities (High/Medium Severity):** Protects against vulnerabilities in the Helm client.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Helm Client Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces risk (High/Medium Impact).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. Developers update their clients, but no central tracking.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Centralized process/policy for Helm updates.
    *   Automated checks for updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Audit Helm History](./mitigation_strategies/audit_helm_history.md)

**6. Mitigation Strategy: Audit Helm History**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regular Review:** Regularly review Helm release history: `helm history <release_name>`. This is a direct Helm command for auditing.
    2.  **Automated Checks (Optional):** Consider automated checks for unexpected changes.
    3.  **Integration with Audits:** Incorporate history review into security audits.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Deployments (Medium Severity):** Detects unauthorized deployments.
    *   **Unintentional Changes (Medium Severity):** Identifies unintentional changes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Deployments:** Moderately reduces risk (Medium Impact).
    *   **Unintentional Changes:** Moderately reduces risk (Medium Impact).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No regular review of `helm history`.
    *   No automated checks.
