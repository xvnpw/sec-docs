## Attack Tree Path: [Deploying Malicious Charts from Untrusted Repositories](./attack_tree_paths/deploying_malicious_charts_from_untrusted_repositories.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker convinces a user or automated system to download a Helm chart from a repository that is not trusted or verified. This repository could be under the attacker's control or a legitimate repository that has been compromised.

**Steps:**
*   The attacker hosts a malicious Helm chart in an accessible repository.
*   A user or automated process configures Helm to access this untrusted repository.
*   The `helm install` or `helm upgrade` command is used to deploy the malicious chart.

**Potential Impact:** The malicious chart can contain Kubernetes resource definitions that deploy backdoors, steal secrets, modify application code, or perform other harmful actions within the cluster.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Insecure Default Secrets](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_insecure_default_secrets.md)

**Attack Vector:** Helm charts are created with default secret values embedded directly within the chart's templates or values files. These default secrets are often weak or easily guessable and are included in the chart package.

**Steps:**
*   Developers inadvertently include hardcoded or weak default secrets in their Helm charts.
*   Attackers gain access to the chart package (e.g., through a public repository or by intercepting deployment processes).
*   Attackers extract the default secrets from the chart.
*   Attackers use these secrets to gain unauthorized access to the application or its associated resources.

**Potential Impact:**  Compromise of application credentials, access to sensitive data, and potential for lateral movement within the infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposing Sensitive Information in ConfigMaps/Secrets](./attack_tree_paths/exposing_sensitive_information_in_configmapssecrets.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers store sensitive information, such as API keys, database passwords, or other credentials, in ConfigMaps or Secrets without proper encryption or security considerations. These resources are then deployed within the Kubernetes cluster.

**Steps:**
*   Developers store sensitive data in plain text within ConfigMaps or Secrets definitions in the Helm chart.
*   The chart is deployed to the Kubernetes cluster.
*   Attackers gain access to the Kubernetes cluster (e.g., through compromised credentials or a vulnerability).
*   Attackers retrieve the sensitive information from the exposed ConfigMaps or Secrets.

**Potential Impact:** Leakage of sensitive data, compromise of external services, and potential for further attacks using the exposed credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Chart Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_chart_vulnerabilities.md)

This represents the broad category of attacks that leverage weaknesses within the Helm charts themselves. This includes malicious content, template vulnerabilities, and insecure configurations. Addressing this node requires a multi-faceted approach to chart security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deploy Malicious Chart](./attack_tree_paths/deploy_malicious_chart.md)

This node highlights the critical point where a malicious chart is introduced into the Kubernetes cluster. Preventing the deployment of untrusted or malicious charts is a key security control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain Malicious Chart](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_malicious_chart.md)

This node emphasizes the importance of controlling the sources from which Helm charts are obtained. If attackers can inject malicious charts into the supply chain, the risk of compromise is significantly increased.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Chart Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_chart_configurations.md)

This node focuses on the risks associated with insecure configurations within Helm charts, particularly the handling of secrets and sensitive data. It underscores the need for secure defaults and best practices in chart development.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Default Secrets](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_default_secrets.md)

As a specific instance of insecure configurations, this node is critical due to the high likelihood and significant impact of this vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Sensitive Information in ConfigMaps/Secrets](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_sensitive_information_in_configmapssecrets.md)

Similar to insecure default secrets, this node highlights a common and easily exploitable vulnerability with significant consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Helm Configuration and Management](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_helm_configuration_and_management.md)

This node encompasses threats related to the security of the Helm client itself and how it is configured and managed. Compromising the Helm client can provide attackers with significant control over application deployments.
