# Attack Surface Analysis for helm/helm

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Chart Content](./attack_surfaces/malicious_chart_content.md)

*   **Description:** Helm charts, being essentially packaged Kubernetes manifests and templates, can contain malicious code or configurations that can compromise the cluster or deployed applications.
    *   **How Helm Contributes:** Helm is the tool that deploys these charts directly into the Kubernetes cluster, executing the defined resources and potentially any embedded scripts or configurations.
    *   **Example:** A chart contains a deployment that pulls a container image with known vulnerabilities or includes an init container that executes a reverse shell upon deployment.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the deployed application, potential cluster-wide compromise depending on the permissions of the deployed resources. Data breaches, denial of service, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review chart content before deployment, especially from untrusted sources.
        *   Implement code review processes for custom-developed charts.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools to scan chart templates and manifests for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Employ container image scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in images referenced by the chart.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege when defining resource requirements within the chart.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Chart Repositories](./attack_surfaces/compromised_chart_repositories.md)

*   **Description:** Chart repositories, where Helm charts are stored and distributed, can be compromised, leading to the distribution of malicious or tampered charts.
    *   **How Helm Contributes:** Helm relies on these repositories to fetch and install charts. If a repository is compromised, Helm will unknowingly install the malicious content.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a chart repository and replaces a legitimate chart with a backdoored version. Users installing this chart through Helm will unknowingly deploy the compromised application.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of malicious applications, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or other security incidents. Widespread impact if the compromised repository is widely used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only use trusted and reputable chart repositories.
        *   Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of charts, such as using signed charts and verifying signatures.
        *   Regularly audit the list of configured chart repositories.
        *   Consider hosting internal, curated chart repositories for better control.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Compromise Leading to Malicious Chart Deployment](./attack_surfaces/client-side_compromise_leading_to_malicious_chart_deployment.md)

*   **Description:** If the machine where the Helm client is running is compromised, an attacker can use the client to deploy malicious charts to the connected Kubernetes cluster.
    *   **How Helm Contributes:** Helm commands are executed from the client machine, and with sufficient credentials, can deploy any chart to the targeted cluster.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a developer's laptop and uses their configured Helm client and kubeconfig to deploy a chart that creates a privileged container and grants them access to the cluster nodes.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Kubernetes cluster, as the attacker can leverage the compromised client's credentials to deploy arbitrary resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure developer workstations and infrastructure with strong authentication and authorization controls.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive systems and Kubernetes clusters.
        *   Regularly patch and update the operating system and software on client machines.
        *   Restrict access to kubeconfig files and other sensitive credentials.
        *   Consider using ephemeral or isolated environments for interacting with production clusters.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Secrets within Chart Templates](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_secrets_within_chart_templates.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or other secrets directly within Helm chart templates, even if base64 encoded.
    *   **How Helm Contributes:** Helm renders these templates and deploys the resulting resources, including any exposed secrets.
    *   **Example:** A chart template includes a database password directly in a ConfigMap definition. Anyone with read access to the ConfigMap in the deployed namespace can retrieve this password.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to other systems or data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid embedding secrets directly in chart templates.
        *   Utilize Kubernetes Secrets to manage sensitive information securely.
        *   Consider using external secret management solutions and integrate them with Helm.
        *   Implement static analysis tools to scan chart templates for potential secret leaks.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Helm Hooks](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_helm_hooks.md)

*   **Description:** Helm Hooks allow the execution of scripts or jobs at specific points in the chart lifecycle (e.g., pre-install, post-upgrade). Malicious charts could leverage these hooks to execute arbitrary code within the cluster.
    *   **How Helm Contributes:** Helm executes the commands defined in the hook definitions during the chart deployment or upgrade process.
    *   **Example:** A malicious chart includes a post-install hook that downloads and executes a script from an external, attacker-controlled server, allowing for arbitrary code execution within the cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the Kubernetes cluster, potentially leading to full cluster compromise or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review the code and purpose of any Helm Hooks included in charts, especially from untrusted sources.
        *   Limit the permissions of the service accounts used by hook jobs.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for unexpected activity during hook execution.
        *   Consider disabling or restricting the use of hooks from untrusted sources.
