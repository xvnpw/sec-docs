# Threat Model Analysis for helm/helm

## Threat: [Malicious Chart Injection](./threats/malicious_chart_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads or introduces a crafted Helm chart into a repository (public or private) that contains malicious code or configurations. When a user deploys this chart using the Helm client, the malicious code is executed within the Kubernetes cluster, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial of service. The attacker might leverage post-install hooks, templates that execute commands, or embedded malicious container images.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Kubernetes cluster or specific namespaces, data exfiltration, service disruption, resource hijacking for cryptomining or other malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** Helm Client CLI, Templating Engine.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use trusted and reputable chart repositories.
*   Implement a rigorous chart review process before adding charts to internal repositories.
*   Utilize chart scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities and malicious code.
*   Employ checksums or digital signatures to verify chart integrity using Helm's features if available, or external tools.
*   Restrict access to chart repositories.

## Threat: [Chart Tampering in Transit](./threats/chart_tampering_in_transit.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the download of a Helm chart from a repository and modifies its contents before it reaches the user's machine via the Helm client. This could involve injecting malicious code or altering configurations. This is more likely if the connection to the chart repository is not secured (e.g., using HTTPS).

**Impact:** Deployment of compromised applications, leading to the same impacts as malicious chart injection (data breaches, unauthorized access, DoS).

**Affected Component:** Helm Client CLI, Network communication initiated by the Helm Client.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use HTTPS for accessing chart repositories.
*   Verify chart integrity using checksums or signatures after downloading with the Helm client or external tools.
*   Utilize secure and trusted network connections.

## Threat: [Template Injection Leading to Code Execution](./threats/template_injection_leading_to_code_execution.md)

**Description:** If user-provided values or external data are not properly sanitized before being used within Helm templates, an attacker can craft malicious input that, when rendered by the Helm templating engine, results in the execution of arbitrary code within the Kubernetes cluster. This could involve manipulating functions or leveraging access to environment variables or mounted volumes during the template rendering process initiated by the Helm client.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within containers or on nodes, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Templating Engine (within the Helm Client).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided values and external data used in templates.
*   Avoid using potentially dangerous template functions or limit their scope.
*   Implement strict input validation and escaping mechanisms.
*   Regularly audit Helm templates for potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Templates](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_templates.md)

**Description:** Developers accidentally or intentionally include sensitive information (API keys, passwords, secrets) directly within Helm templates or default values. If these templates are processed by the Helm client and the rendered manifests are not properly secured or are exposed, this sensitive data can be compromised.

**Impact:** Exposure of credentials and other sensitive information, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to other systems or resources.

**Affected Component:** Templating Engine (within the Helm Client), Chart Files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never embed sensitive information directly in Helm templates.
*   Utilize Kubernetes Secrets to manage sensitive data.
*   Employ secret management tools or operators to inject secrets securely.
*   Implement strict access controls on chart repositories and deployment pipelines.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive RBAC for Helm Operations](./threats/overly_permissive_rbac_for_helm_operations.md)

**Description:** The service account or user whose credentials are used by the Helm client has excessive permissions within the Kubernetes cluster. If these credentials are compromised, an attacker could leverage these broad permissions to perform actions beyond the intended scope via the Helm client, potentially compromising the entire cluster.

**Impact:** Cluster-wide compromise, ability to create, modify, or delete any resource within the cluster, potential for privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** Helm Client CLI, Kubernetes API interaction initiated by the Helm client.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Adhere strictly to the principle of least privilege when granting RBAC roles to the identities used by the Helm client.
*   Limit the scope of these permissions to the specific namespaces and resources Helm needs to manage.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing Kubernetes.
*   Regularly review and audit RBAC configurations.

## Threat: [Compromised Helm Client Machine](./threats/compromised_helm_client_machine.md)

**Description:** The machine where the Helm client is running is compromised by an attacker. This allows the attacker to potentially access Kubernetes credentials configured for Helm, modify local chart files before deployment using the Helm client, or directly execute malicious Helm commands.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Kubernetes cluster, deployment of malicious charts, modification of application configurations, exposure of sensitive information.

**Affected Component:** Helm Client CLI, Local file system where charts and configurations are stored.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the machines used for running the Helm client with strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and up-to-date security patches.
*   Restrict access to these machines.
*   Avoid storing sensitive Kubernetes credentials directly on the client machine; use secure credential management practices.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known Helm Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_known_helm_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Older versions of the `helm/helm` client might contain known security vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit if the Helm installation is not kept up-to-date.

**Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability, but could range from denial of service to remote code execution within the context of the Helm client or potentially the Kubernetes cluster.

**Affected Component:** Helm Client CLI.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Helm updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
*   Regularly review security advisories for Helm.
