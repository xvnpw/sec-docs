# Threat Model Analysis for helm/helm

## Threat: [Chart Tampering](./threats/chart_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker modifies a Helm chart after it's created but before deployment. This could happen during transit, storage, or within a compromised repository. They might inject malicious code, manipulate configurations, or cause denial of service by altering chart content.
**Impact:** Malicious code execution within Kubernetes cluster, application compromise, data breaches, denial of service, security misconfigurations.
**Helm Component Affected:** Chart Package, Chart Download Process
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use HTTPS for chart downloads.
* Implement chart signing and verification.
* Secure chart storage locations and control access.
* Perform security scanning of charts before deployment (static analysis, image vulnerability scanning).

## Threat: [Kubernetes API Server Interaction Abuse](./threats/kubernetes_api_server_interaction_abuse.md)

**Description:** Helm interacts with the Kubernetes API server. If Helm's permissions are excessive or misconfigured, a compromised chart or client could be used to perform unauthorized actions on the Kubernetes cluster. An attacker could create, modify, or delete resources beyond the intended scope.
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to Kubernetes resources, privilege escalation within Kubernetes, information disclosure, cluster instability.
**Helm Component Affected:** Helm Release Management, Kubernetes API Client
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Apply the principle of least privilege to Helm's service account/kubeconfig.
* Regularly review and audit Helm's Kubernetes permissions.
* Use Kubernetes Network Policies to restrict network access.
* Monitor Kubernetes API server logs for suspicious Helm activity.

## Threat: [Secrets Management in Charts (Improper Handling)](./threats/secrets_management_in_charts__improper_handling_.md)

**Description:** Improper handling of secrets within Helm charts can lead to exposure. Storing secrets in plaintext in charts, values, or logs is a major risk. Insecure Kubernetes Secrets usage can also lead to unauthorized access.
**Impact:** Sensitive information exposure (credentials, API keys, etc.), data breaches, unauthorized access to systems and applications.
**Helm Component Affected:** Chart Packaging, Values Files, Templating (when misused for secrets)
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Never store secrets directly in Helm charts or values files.**
* Use Kubernetes Secrets objects.
* Utilize external secret management solutions (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.).
* Employ tools like `helm secrets` or similar for encryption during development/storage.
* Regularly audit charts and configurations for secret exposure.
