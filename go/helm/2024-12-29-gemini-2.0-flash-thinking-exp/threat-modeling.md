Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving the `helm/helm` project:

* **Threat:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input within Helm chart values that, when processed by Helm's Go templating engine, allows for the execution of arbitrary code on the system running the Helm client. This occurs during the `helm template` or `helm install/upgrade` operations where user-provided values are interpolated into chart templates.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution on the developer's machine or the system running the Helm client, potentially leading to data exfiltration, privilege escalation on that system, or further attacks against the Kubernetes cluster.
    * **Affected Component:** Helm Charts (Templates), Helm Client (Templating Engine - specifically the Go template processing within the `pkg/chartutil` and related packages).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize and validate user-provided values rigorously before using them in Helm chart templates.
        * Avoid using complex or dynamic logic within templates where possible, limiting the scope for injection.
        * Implement security reviews of Helm chart templates to identify potential injection points.
        * Run Helm operations in isolated environments with limited privileges to reduce the impact of potential exploitation.
        * Keep the Helm client updated to the latest version, as security patches for template rendering vulnerabilities may be released.

* **Threat:** Malicious Chart Rendering Exploiting Helm Client Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** A specially crafted Helm chart exploits a vulnerability within the Helm client's chart rendering logic. This could involve vulnerabilities in how Helm parses chart files (e.g., `Chart.yaml`, values files) or handles specific template functions, leading to unexpected behavior or code execution during the rendering process.
    * **Impact:**  Remote code execution on the developer's machine or the system running the Helm client, potentially leading to data exfiltration, privilege escalation on that system, or further attacks against the Kubernetes cluster.
    * **Affected Component:** Helm Client (Chart Parsing and Rendering logic, potentially within `pkg/chartutil`, `pkg/chart`, and related packages).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Only use charts from trusted and verified sources.
        * Implement a chart review process before deploying new or updated charts, focusing on unusual or suspicious template constructs.
        * Keep the Helm client updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches addressing parsing and rendering vulnerabilities.
        * Run Helm operations in isolated environments with limited privileges.
        * Consider using static analysis tools specifically designed to identify potential vulnerabilities in Helm charts and their interaction with the Helm client.
