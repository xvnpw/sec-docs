# Attack Surface Analysis for alistgo/alist

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access to Files (if configured)](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access_to_files__if_configured_.md)

*   **Description:**  `alist` can be configured to allow public access to certain files or directories without requiring authentication.
    *   **How alist Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `alist`'s core functionality is to serve files. The configuration options within `alist` directly control whether authentication is required for access.
    *   **Example:**  An administrator unintentionally configures a sensitive directory containing internal documents as publicly accessible through `alist`'s settings.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential data breaches, exposure of confidential information managed by `alist`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Default to Restricted Access within alist:** Ensure the default configuration of `alist` requires authentication for all file access.
        *   **Regularly Review alist Access Permissions:** Periodically audit the access permissions configured directly within `alist` to ensure they align with security policies.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege in alist:** Grant only the necessary access permissions to users and groups within `alist`. Avoid overly permissive configurations in `alist`.

## Attack Surface: [Brute-Force Attacks on Authentication](./attack_surfaces/brute-force_attacks_on_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess user credentials by repeatedly trying different combinations of usernames and passwords against `alist`'s login.
    *   **How alist Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `alist` provides its own login interface for user authentication. The security of this interface directly impacts the susceptibility to brute-force attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses automated tools to try common username and password combinations against the `alist` login page.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise within `alist`, leading to unauthorized access to files and potentially administrative functions within `alist`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Rate Limiting in alist:** Configure `alist`'s built-in rate limiting features (if available) or use a reverse proxy to limit login attempts.
        *   **Enforce Strong Password Policies within alist:** Encourage or enforce the use of strong, unique passwords for all `alist` accounts.
        *   **Account Lockout Policies in alist:** Implement `alist`'s account lockout mechanisms that temporarily disable accounts after failed login attempts.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for alist:** Enable MFA for `alist` accounts for an added layer of security.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate file paths provided to `alist` to access files or directories outside of the intended storage scope managed by `alist`.
    *   **How alist Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `alist` processes user-provided file paths for download and potentially upload operations. If `alist`'s path validation is insufficient, specially crafted paths can bypass intended restrictions.
    *   **Example:** A user crafts a download link like `/d/../../../../etc/passwd` within `alist`'s interface to attempt to access the server's password file.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files accessible by the `alist` process, potential for configuration file disclosure, or even remote code execution in some scenarios if `alist` interacts with the file system in a privileged manner.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation within alist:** Implement robust server-side validation within `alist` of all user-provided file paths, rejecting any containing path traversal sequences like `../` or absolute paths.
        *   **Canonicalization within alist:** Convert file paths to their canonical form within `alist` before processing to eliminate variations that could bypass validation.
        *   **Restricted Access for alist Process:** Run the `alist` process with the minimum necessary privileges and within a restricted file system environment if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages served by `alist` and viewed by other users.
    *   **How alist Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If `alist` doesn't properly sanitize user-provided input (e.g., file names, descriptions, custom headers configured within `alist`) before displaying it in its web interface, it can become vulnerable to XSS.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a file with a malicious JavaScript payload in its name through `alist`. When another user views the file listing in `alist`, the script executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking of `alist` users, cookie theft related to the `alist` domain, redirection to malicious websites from the context of `alist`, defacement of the `alist` interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization/Output Encoding within alist:** Implement proper input sanitization and output encoding techniques within `alist`'s codebase to neutralize potentially malicious scripts before they are displayed.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) for alist:** Configure a strong CSP header within `alist`'s web server configuration to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
        *   **Regular Security Audits of alist:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting `alist` to identify and address potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in `alist` Configuration](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in__alist__configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information required by `alist`, such as storage backend credentials or API keys, might be stored in `alist`'s configuration files.
    *   **How alist Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `alist` requires configuration to connect to storage backends and potentially other services. This configuration, managed by `alist`, often involves storing sensitive credentials.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `alist` configuration file and retrieves storage backend credentials used by `alist`.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of storage backends connected to `alist` or other integrated services configured within `alist`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure `alist` Configuration File Permissions:** Ensure that the `alist` configuration file has restrictive permissions, limiting access to only the necessary user accounts running `alist`.
        *   **Environment Variables or Secrets Management for `alist`:** Prefer storing sensitive configuration data used by `alist` using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management solution instead of directly in the `alist` configuration file.
        *   **Regularly Review `alist` Configuration:** Periodically review the `alist` configuration to ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently exposed.
