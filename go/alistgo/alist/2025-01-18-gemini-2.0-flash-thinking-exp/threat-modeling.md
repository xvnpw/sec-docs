# Threat Model Analysis for alistgo/alist

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Storage Backend Credentials](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_storage_backend_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to `alist`'s configuration files or memory where storage backend credentials (e.g., API keys, access tokens, passwords) are stored. This could be achieved through exploiting a local file inclusion vulnerability *in alist*, gaining unauthorized access to the server *hosting alist*, or exploiting a memory disclosure bug *in alist*. The attacker can then use these credentials to directly access, modify, or delete data on the storage backend, bypassing `alist` entirely.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the data stored in the affected backend. Data loss, data corruption, unauthorized data access, and potential financial impact due to storage costs or data breaches.

**Affected Component:** Configuration Loading Module, potentially the Storage Backend Connection Management.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement secure storage for sensitive configuration data, such as using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions. Avoid storing credentials directly in configuration files. Ensure proper memory management to prevent memory leaks. Implement strict file system permissions on configuration files *within the alist codebase*.
*   **Users:**  Ensure the `alist` server and its configuration files are protected with strong access controls. Regularly review and rotate storage backend credentials.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via Storage Backend Abuse](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_storage_backend_abuse.md)

**Description:** An attacker, having gained unauthorized access to `alist` (or exploiting a vulnerability allowing arbitrary file uploads *within alist* if enabled), uses `alist`'s configured storage backend connections to upload malicious content or exfiltrate sensitive data to storage locations they control. This could involve uploading large amounts of data to incur costs or using the storage as a staging ground for further attacks.

**Impact:** Data breach, potential financial costs associated with storage usage, reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Storage Backend Interaction Module, potentially the Upload Functionality (if enabled).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement robust authorization checks *within alist* to control who can upload and download data. Implement rate limiting on upload and download operations *within alist*. Log all storage backend interactions *initiated by alist*.
*   **Users:** Carefully configure `alist`'s permissions and access controls. Monitor storage backend activity for unusual patterns. If uploads are not required, disable the upload functionality *within alist's configuration*.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass due to Vulnerabilities in alist's Authentication Mechanism](./threats/authentication_bypass_due_to_vulnerabilities_in_alist's_authentication_mechanism.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits flaws in `alist`'s authentication logic (e.g., flaws in session management, cookie handling, JWT verification, or password reset mechanisms) to gain access to the application without providing valid credentials. This could involve manipulating cookies *related to alist*, exploiting timing vulnerabilities *in alist's authentication code*, or bypassing authentication checks *within alist*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to files and directories managed by `alist`. Potential for data exfiltration, modification, or deletion depending on the attacker's privileges after bypass.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Middleware, Session Management Module, User Authentication Functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement robust and industry-standard authentication mechanisms. Regularly review and audit the authentication code for vulnerabilities. Use strong session management techniques and secure cookie handling (e.g., HttpOnly, Secure flags). Enforce strong password policies.
*   **Users:** Use strong and unique passwords for `alist` accounts. Keep `alist` updated to benefit from security patches.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass Leading to Unauthorized File Access](./threats/authorization_bypass_leading_to_unauthorized_file_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker, even with valid authentication *to alist*, exploits vulnerabilities in `alist`'s authorization logic to access files or directories they are not intended to access based on the configured permissions *within alist*. This could involve manipulating request parameters *sent to alist*, exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities within the authorization checks *performed by alist*, or bypassing access control lists *managed by alist*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories. Potential data breaches and information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** Authorization Middleware, Access Control Logic, Path Handling Functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement a robust and well-tested authorization model. Enforce the principle of least privilege. Carefully validate and sanitize all user inputs related to file paths and access requests. Regularly review and audit authorization rules.
*   **Users:** Carefully configure `alist`'s permissions and access controls. Regularly review the configured permissions to ensure they are appropriate.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within alist](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_alist.md)

**Description:** An attacker with limited privileges within `alist` exploits vulnerabilities *in alist's code* to gain higher-level privileges, potentially reaching administrative access *within alist*. This could involve exploiting flaws in role-based access control, manipulating user roles *within alist's user management*, or exploiting vulnerabilities in administrative functions *provided by alist*.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the `alist` application and potentially the underlying server. Ability to access all data, modify configurations, and potentially execute arbitrary code.

**Affected Component:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation, User Management Functions, Administrative Interface.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement a secure and well-defined RBAC system. Carefully validate user roles and permissions. Minimize the attack surface of administrative functions. Implement strong authentication and authorization for administrative actions.
*   **Users:** Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning user roles *within alist*. Regularly review user roles and permissions.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerability Leading to Access of Arbitrary Files](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerability_leading_to_access_of_arbitrary_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits flaws in how `alist` handles file paths, allowing them to construct requests *to alist* that access files outside of the intended directories on the storage backends or even on the server's local file system. This could be achieved by manipulating file path parameters with sequences like `../` *in requests to alist*.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files and directories, potentially including configuration files, system files, or other user data not intended to be served through `alist`.

**Affected Component:** Path Handling Functions, File Serving Logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all file path inputs. Use secure path manipulation techniques that prevent traversal (e.g., using canonical paths). Avoid directly using user-provided input in file system operations.
*   **Users:** Ensure `alist` is updated to the latest version with security patches.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Information](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_information.md)

**Description:** `alist`'s configuration files, containing sensitive information like storage backend credentials, API keys, and internal settings, are not properly protected and can be accessed by unauthorized individuals. This could be due to insecure file permissions *on the server hosting alist*, misconfigured web server settings *for serving alist*, or vulnerabilities *within alist* allowing local file inclusion.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of `alist` and potentially the connected storage backends.

**Affected Component:** Configuration Loading Module, File System Access.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files. Use environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
