### High and Critical Alist Specific Threats

This list contains high and critical severity threats that directly involve the Alist application.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Storage Provider Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the credentials (API keys, tokens, OAuth tokens) used by Alist to connect to configured storage providers. This could happen through various means like exploiting vulnerabilities in Alist's configuration storage or through social engineering targeting users who manage Alist. The attacker can then use these credentials to directly access, modify, or delete data within the connected storage, bypassing Alist entirely.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (exposure of sensitive files), data manipulation (unauthorized modification of files), data deletion (loss of important data), potential for further attacks if the storage provider is used for other purposes.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration module (where storage provider credentials are stored), potentially the storage provider integration modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Securely store Alist configuration files with appropriate permissions.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Utilize environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions for storing sensitive credentials instead of directly embedding them in configuration files.
        *   **Users:** Regularly review and rotate storage provider credentials if possible.
        *   **Users:** Enable multi-factor authentication on the storage provider accounts.

*   **Threat:** Unpatched Alist Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits known security vulnerabilities in the Alist application itself. This could involve sending specially crafted requests to trigger bugs leading to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service. The attacker might scan publicly accessible Alist instances for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server hosting Alist, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server. Data breach by accessing files managed by Alist. Denial of service, making Alist unavailable.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core application logic, specific modules (e.g., file handling, authentication, API endpoints).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update Alist to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Developers:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Alist.
        *   **Developers:** Implement a process for quickly deploying security updates.
        *   **Users:** Monitor Alist's release notes and update promptly.

*   **Threat:** Default Credentials or Weak Default Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker attempts to log in to the Alist administrative interface using default credentials (if they exist and haven't been changed) or exploits insecure default configurations that expose sensitive information or functionalities. This is often a first step in automated attacks targeting newly deployed instances.
    *   **Impact:** Full administrative access to the Alist instance, allowing the attacker to configure storage providers, manage users, and potentially access all files.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication module, configuration module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Ensure Alist does not ship with default, easily guessable credentials.
        *   **Developers:** Implement a mandatory password change upon initial setup.
        *   **Users:** Immediately change any default administrative credentials upon installation.
        *   **Users:** Review and harden default configurations, disabling unnecessary features or endpoints.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in File Handling
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious requests to access files outside of the intended directories managed by Alist. This could involve manipulating file paths in URLs or API calls. The attacker could potentially access sensitive system files or files belonging to other users if permissions are not properly enforced within Alist.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (access to unauthorized files), potential for remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities (e.g., writing to configuration files).
    *   **Affected Component:** File serving module, API endpoints related to file access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for file paths within Alist's codebase.
        *   **Developers:** Use secure file access methods within Alist that prevent traversal outside of allowed directories.
        *   **Developers:** Regularly audit the codebase for potential path traversal vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Insecure File Upload Handling
    *   **Description:** If Alist allows file uploads (depending on configuration and storage provider capabilities), an attacker could upload malicious files, such as web shells or executable code. If these files are not properly handled or scanned by Alist, they could be executed on the server, leading to system compromise.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, potential for further attacks on the underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Component:** File upload module, storage provider integration for uploads within Alist.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation and restrictions on uploads within Alist.
        *   **Developers:** Integrate with antivirus or malware scanning solutions to scan uploaded files within Alist.
        *   **Developers:** Store uploaded files in a secure location with restricted execution permissions.
        *   **Users:** If possible, disable file upload functionality if it's not required.
