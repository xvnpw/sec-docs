## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerability.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default/Weak Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_defaultweak_credentials.md)

**Description:** Attackers attempt to log in to the AList administrative panel using default credentials (e.g., admin/password) or easily guessable passwords.
**Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration).
**Impact:** High (Full control of AList).
**Effort:** Low (Requires knowing or guessing default credentials).
**Skill Level:** Low (Novice).
**Detection Difficulty:** Low (Login attempts from unusual IPs, failed login attempts).
**Mitigation:**
* Immediately change default administrative credentials upon deployment.
* Enforce strong password policies for all AList users.
* Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.
* Monitor login attempts for suspicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigured Storage Provider Access](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigured_storage_provider_access.md)

**Access Storage Provider with Leaked Credentials:**
    **Description:** Attackers obtain the credentials used by AList to access the underlying storage provider (e.g., AWS S3 keys, Google Cloud Storage credentials). This could be achieved by:
    * Exploiting information disclosure vulnerabilities in AList to access configuration files or environment variables.
    * Gaining access to the AList server and retrieving credentials from configuration files or memory.
    **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on how securely credentials are managed).
    **Impact:** High (Direct access to backend storage, potential for data breach or manipulation).
    **Effort:** Medium (Requires access to the AList server or exploiting information disclosure vulnerabilities).
    **Skill Level:** Medium (System administrator/Developer).
    **Detection Difficulty:** High (Hard to distinguish from legitimate AList access to storage).
    **Mitigation:**
    * Securely store storage provider credentials using secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
    * Avoid storing credentials directly in configuration files or environment variables.
    * Implement strong access controls on the AList server to prevent unauthorized access to configuration files.
    * Regularly rotate storage provider credentials.
    * Monitor storage provider access logs for unusual activity, although this can be challenging.
**Exploit Insufficient Permissions on Storage Provider:**
    **Description:** The storage provider account used by AList has overly permissive access rights. Attackers, even without stealing credentials, can leverage AList to perform actions on the storage provider that should not be allowed (e.g., deleting files, modifying permissions).
    **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration).
    **Impact:** Medium to High (Data breach or manipulation on the storage level).
    **Effort:** Low to Medium (Requires understanding of storage provider permissions and potentially using AList as a proxy).
    **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (Basic understanding of cloud storage).
    **Detection Difficulty:** High (Hard to distinguish from legitimate AList operations).
    **Mitigation:**
    * Implement the principle of least privilege for the storage provider account used by AList. Grant only the necessary permissions for AList to function correctly.
    * Regularly review and audit storage provider permissions.
    * Consider using more granular access control mechanisms provided by the storage provider (e.g., IAM roles, bucket policies).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit AList Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_alist_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** This encompasses exploiting any coding flaws or security weaknesses directly within the AList application.
**Mitigation:**
* Keep AList updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Subscribe to security advisories for AList.
* Follow secure coding practices if contributing to or modifying AList.
* Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_bypass.md)

**Description:**  Circumventing AList's authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.
**Mitigation:**
* Implement strong and secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
* Follow secure coding practices to prevent authentication bypass vulnerabilities.
* Regularly review and test authentication and authorization logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access AList admin panel with default credentials (if not changed)](./attack_tree_paths/access_alist_admin_panel_with_default_credentials__if_not_changed_.md)

(Covered in High-Risk Path 1)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerability.md)

**Description:** Exploiting a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting AList. This is a critical vulnerability with severe consequences.
**Mitigation:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent command injection and other RCE vectors.
* Keep AList and its dependencies updated to patch known RCE vulnerabilities.
* Run AList with the least privileges necessary.
* Implement security measures like ASLR and DEP on the hosting server.
* Conduct thorough code reviews and penetration testing to identify potential RCE vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse AList Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_alist_functionality.md)

**Description:**  Using the intended features of AList in unintended or malicious ways due to insecure implementation or configuration.
**Mitigation:**
* Carefully review the security implications of all AList features.
* Implement appropriate access controls and rate limiting for API endpoints.
* Validate user inputs and file uploads thoroughly.
* Provide clear documentation and guidance to users on secure usage of AList features.
