# Threat Model Analysis for alistgo/alist

## Threat: [Alist Admin Panel Credential Compromise](./threats/alist_admin_panel_credential_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the alist admin panel credentials (e.g., through brute-force, default credentials, or phishing). They can then log in and manipulate alist's settings.

**Impact:** Full control over alist, potentially leading to unauthorized access to stored data, modification of files, addition of malicious storage providers, or disruption of service.

**Affected Component:** Admin Panel (authentication module).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Enforce strong and unique passwords for the alist admin panel.
- Regularly change the admin panel password.
- Consider using multi-factor authentication if supported by alist or through reverse proxy setup.
- Restrict network access to the alist admin panel to authorized IP addresses.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Storage Provider Credentials](./threats/insecure_storage_of_storage_provider_credentials.md)

**Description:** Alist stores credentials for accessing storage providers (e.g., API keys, access tokens) in a way that is not sufficiently secure (e.g., plaintext in configuration files). An attacker gaining access to the server or alist's configuration can retrieve these credentials.

**Impact:** Direct access to the underlying storage providers, bypassing alist's access controls. This allows the attacker to read, modify, or delete any data in the connected storage.

**Affected Component:** Configuration Management (handling of storage provider credentials).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Ensure alist utilizes secure methods for storing storage provider credentials (e.g., encryption).
- If possible, leverage environment variables or secrets management systems to manage storage provider credentials instead of directly embedding them in alist's configuration.
- Regularly review and rotate storage provider credentials.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Storage Provider Configuration](./threats/unauthorized_storage_provider_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker with access to the alist admin panel or configuration files adds a malicious storage provider. Users interacting with this provider might unknowingly upload sensitive data to an attacker-controlled location or download malicious files.

**Impact:** Data exfiltration, introduction of malware, or compromise of user devices.

**Affected Component:** Admin Panel (storage provider management), Configuration Management.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Regularly audit the configured storage providers in alist.
- Implement strict access controls for the alist admin panel.
- Monitor alist's configuration for unauthorized changes.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerability in File Handling](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerability_in_file_handling.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability in alist's file handling logic allows an attacker to manipulate file paths to access files outside of the intended storage locations. This could potentially expose system files or files belonging to other users.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server hosting alist.

**Affected Component:** File Handling Module (within storage provider interactions).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Ensure alist is updated to the latest version with all security patches.
- Carefully review alist's release notes for any reported path traversal vulnerabilities.
- If contributing to alist's development or using custom storage drivers, implement robust input validation and sanitization for file paths.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Alist Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_alist_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Alist relies on various third-party libraries and components. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise alist or the underlying server.

**Impact:**  Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, from information disclosure to remote code execution.

**Affected Component:** Dependency Management, potentially various modules depending on the vulnerable dependency.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Regularly update alist to benefit from dependency updates and security patches.
- Implement a process for monitoring known vulnerabilities in alist's dependencies.
- Consider using tools like dependency scanners to identify potential issues.
