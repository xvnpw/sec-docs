    subgraph "User"
        U["User Browser"]
    end
    subgraph "AList Frontend"
        FE["Frontend Application"]
    end
    subgraph "AList Backend"
        BE["Backend API"]
    end
    subgraph "AList Database"
        DB["Database"]
    end
    subgraph "Storage Provider"
        SP["Storage Provider API"]
    end

    BE -- "3. Backend receives request, initiates authentication" --> BE
    BE -- "4. Backend queries database for user session" --> DB
    DB -- "5. Database returns session information" --> BE
    BE -- "6. Backend verifies user authentication and authorization" --> BE
    BE -- "7. Backend retrieves storage provider configuration from database" --> DB
    DB -- "8. Database provides storage provider details" --> BE
    BE -- "9. Backend constructs API request for storage provider" --> BE
    BE -- "10. Backend sends request to Storage Provider API (list files)" --> SP
    SP -- "11. Storage Provider authenticates request" --> SP
    SP -- "12. Storage Provider retrieves file listing" --> SP
    SP -- "13. Storage Provider returns file listing data" --> BE

    BE -- "15. Backend sends HTTP response (JSON file list)" --> FE
    FE -- "16. Frontend receives data and renders file list" --> U
```

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **User Initiates Browse:** The user interacts with the frontend, for example, by clicking on a folder within the file listing.
2. **Frontend Sends API Request:** The frontend application sends an asynchronous API request to the backend, typically to a specific endpoint like `/api/list`, indicating the desired path or directory.
3. **Backend Receives Request, Initiates Authentication:** The backend API receives the request and begins the process of authenticating the user.
4. **Backend Queries Database for User Session:** The backend queries the database to retrieve the current user's session information, typically using a session identifier (e.g., a cookie).
5. **Database Returns Session Information:** The database responds with the relevant session data, if a valid session exists.
6. **Backend Verifies User Authentication and Authorization:** The backend verifies the user's authentication status based on the retrieved session information and checks if the user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource.
7. **Backend Retrieves Storage Provider Configuration from Database:** If the user is authorized, the backend retrieves the configuration details for the relevant storage provider associated with the requested path from the database.
8. **Database Provides Storage Provider Details:** The database returns the necessary connection details, such as API keys, access tokens, or other authentication credentials.
9. **Backend Constructs API Request for Storage Provider:** The backend constructs a request to the specific storage provider's API, using the retrieved configuration details and the requested path.
10. **Backend Sends Request to Storage Provider API:** The backend sends the API request to the appropriate storage provider to retrieve the list of files and folders.
11. **Storage Provider Authenticates Request:** The storage provider authenticates the incoming request using the provided credentials.
12. **Storage Provider Retrieves File Listing:** Upon successful authentication, the storage provider retrieves the requested file listing from its storage infrastructure.
13. **Storage Provider Returns File Listing Data:** The storage provider sends the file listing data back to the AList backend.
14. **Backend Processes and Formats File Listing Data:** The backend receives the raw file listing data from the storage provider and processes it, potentially applying transformations, filtering, or sorting.
15. **Backend Sends HTTP Response:** The backend sends an HTTP response back to the frontend, typically containing the formatted file listing data in JSON format.
16. **Frontend Receives Data and Renders File List:** The frontend application receives the JSON data and dynamically updates the user interface to display the file listing in the user's browser.
