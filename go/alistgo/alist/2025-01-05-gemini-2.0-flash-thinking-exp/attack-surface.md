# Attack Surface Analysis for alistgo/alist

## Attack Surface: [Weak Default Administrator Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_default_administrator_credentials.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Weak Default Administrator Credentials**
    *   **Description:** The application uses Alist's default administrator credentials, which are publicly known or easily guessable.
    *   **How Alist Contributes:** Alist requires setting an initial administrator password. If this step is skipped or a weak default is used and not changed, it becomes a major vulnerability inherent to Alist's setup.
    *   **Example:** An attacker attempts to log in to the Alist admin panel using common default credentials like "admin/admin" or "admin/password".
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Alist instance, allowing attackers to manage storage providers, user accounts, and access all files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Force a strong password change during the initial setup of Alist.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Clearly document the importance of changing the default administrator password.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Implement password complexity requirements if Alist's configuration allows.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Storage Provider Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_storage_provider_credentials.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Storage of Storage Provider Credentials**
    *   **Description:** Alist stores credentials for connecting to various storage providers insecurely (e.g., in plain text in configuration files).
    *   **How Alist Contributes:** Alist's design necessitates storing authentication information for integrated storage providers. The security of *this specific storage within Alist* is the core issue.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the `config.json` file (due to misconfigured file permissions) and finds API keys or access tokens for connected cloud storage services managed by Alist.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the connected storage providers, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or resource hijacking on those platforms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Ensure the `config.json` file has restricted file system permissions (e.g., 600 or 400) *for the Alist instance*.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Explore if Alist supports more secure credential storage mechanisms (e.g., using environment variables with restricted access or a secrets management system) *within its own configuration*.
        *   **Developers:** If extending Alist, avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files *managed by Alist*.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Storage Provider Configuration](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_storage_provider_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Storage Provider Configuration**
    *   **Description:** Alist allows users to configure storage providers with arbitrary URLs or endpoints, which can be exploited to make the Alist server send requests to internal or external resources.
    *   **How Alist Contributes:** Alist's functionality to integrate with diverse storage solutions inherently involves accepting and using user-provided URLs for these services. The *lack of proper validation within Alist* is the key factor.
    *   **Example:** An attacker configures a storage provider *within Alist's settings* with a URL pointing to an internal service (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`) and triggers Alist to make a request, potentially revealing internal information or interacting with internal services.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal services, port scanning of internal networks, potential for further exploitation of vulnerable internal systems *via the Alist server*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of URLs provided for storage provider configurations *within Alist's codebase*.
        *   **Developers:** Consider using a whitelist of allowed protocols and domains for storage provider endpoints *enforced by Alist*.
        *   **Developers:** Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of potential SSRF vulnerabilities *originating from the Alist server*.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious when configuring storage providers *within Alist* and only use trusted and necessary endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in File Serving](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities_in_file_serving.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in File Serving**
    *   **Description:**  Alist fails to properly sanitize or validate file paths when serving files, allowing attackers to access files outside of the intended directories.
    *   **How Alist Contributes:** Alist's core function is serving files. The logic *within Alist* for resolving file paths from user requests is the source of this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a URL like `https://your-alist-instance/d/../../../../etc/passwd` attempting to access the server's password file *through Alist*.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files on the server's file system *via Alist*, potentially leading to information disclosure or system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Ensure robust input validation and sanitization of file paths in the file serving logic *within Alist*.
        *   **Developers:** Use secure file path manipulation techniques provided by the programming language or framework *within Alist's development*.
        *   **Developers:** Implement proper access controls and permissions on the server's file system *as a general security measure complementing Alist's security*.
