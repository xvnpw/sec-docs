# Threat Model Analysis for alistgo/alist

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Storage Provider Credentials](./threats/misconfiguration_of_storage_provider_credentials.md)

Description: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the backend storage service if storage provider credentials (API keys, access tokens) are:
        *   Stored insecurely in Alist's configuration files (e.g., plain text).
        *   Exposed due to misconfigured file permissions or server vulnerabilities.
        *   Hardcoded or easily guessable default credentials are used (less likely but possible in initial setup).
        An attacker could then read, modify, or delete data in the storage provider, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruption.
    Impact: Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service of the storage service, financial costs due to unauthorized usage of storage resources.
    Affected Alist Component: Configuration Management, Storage Provider Adapters
    Risk Severity: High
    Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Secure Credential Storage: Use environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) to store storage provider credentials instead of plain text configuration files.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: Grant Alist only the necessary permissions to access the storage provider. Avoid using root or admin-level credentials.
        *   Regularly Rotate Credentials: Implement a process to regularly rotate storage provider credentials to limit the window of opportunity if credentials are compromised.
        *   Secure File Permissions: Ensure Alist's configuration files are only readable by the Alist process user and administrators.
        *   Configuration Validation: Implement checks during Alist setup to validate the format and security of provided credentials.
