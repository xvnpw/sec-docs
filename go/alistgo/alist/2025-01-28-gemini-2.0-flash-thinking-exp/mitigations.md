# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for alistgo/alist

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Password Policies within alist](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_password_policies_within_alist.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access alist's Admin Settings:** Log in to alist as an administrator and navigate to the user management or settings section.
    2.  **Configure Password Policy Settings (if available):** Check if alist's admin panel or configuration files (like `conf.ini`) offer settings to control password policies. Look for options to set:
        *   Minimum password length.
        *   Password complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
    3.  **Manually Implement Policy (if settings limited):** If alist's built-in settings are limited, establish a *manual* strong password policy and communicate it to all users. This involves:
        *   Documenting the required password complexity and length.
        *   Educating users on creating strong passwords during account creation or password resets.
        *   Potentially using external password strength checking tools during user onboarding (though not directly integrated with alist).
    4.  **Regularly Remind Users:** Periodically remind users about the importance of strong passwords and the enforced policy.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-force attacks (High Severity):** Weak passwords make alist vulnerable to brute-force attacks, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Credential stuffing (High Severity):** Reused or weak passwords increase the risk of credential stuffing attacks if user credentials are compromised elsewhere.
    *   **Dictionary attacks (Medium Severity):** Simple passwords are susceptible to dictionary attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-force attacks:** Significantly reduces the risk if strong policies are effectively enforced and followed by users.
    *   **Credential stuffing:** Moderately reduces the risk, dependent on user password habits outside of alist.
    *   **Dictionary attacks:** Significantly reduces the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Potentially basic password length enforcement might be default. Complexity enforcement is likely *not* actively implemented by default within alist itself and requires manual configuration or external policy enforcement.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Robust, configurable password policy settings (complexity, reuse prevention) are likely missing *within alist's core features*. Implementation relies on administrator configuration if settings exist, or manual policy enforcement and user education if settings are limited.

    2.  **Establish Rotation Schedule:** Define a regular schedule (e.g., monthly, quarterly) for reviewing and rotating API keys used *by alist*.
    3.  **Manual Key Rotation Process:**
        *   **Generate New Keys (Storage Provider):**  Generate new API keys within the respective storage provider's admin console for the service account used by alist.
        *   **Update alist Configuration:**  Manually update alist's configuration (likely through the admin panel or configuration files) to replace the *old* API keys with the *newly generated* keys.
        *   **Revoke Old Keys (Storage Provider):**  Immediately revoke or delete the *old* API keys within the storage provider's admin console *after* verifying alist is functioning correctly with the new keys.
    4.  **Document Rotation:** Document the manual API key rotation process for consistent execution.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised API keys (High Severity):** If API keys used *by alist* are compromised, attackers can gain unauthorized access to connected storage providers and data.
    *   **Insider threats (Medium Severity):** Regular rotation limits the window of opportunity for malicious insiders who might gain access to API keys *configured in alist*.
    *   **Stale Keys (Low Severity):** Reduces risks associated with long-lived, potentially less managed API keys *used by alist*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised API keys:** Significantly reduces impact by limiting the lifespan of a compromised key *used by alist*.
    *   **Insider threats:** Moderately reduces risk by limiting the window of opportunity.
    *   **Stale Keys:** Reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented automatically. API key management and rotation for alist is a *manual administrative task*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated API key rotation is missing *within alist itself*. Rotation relies on manual processes and external storage provider key management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access Based on alist User Roles and Permissions](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_based_on_alist_user_roles_and_permissions.md)
