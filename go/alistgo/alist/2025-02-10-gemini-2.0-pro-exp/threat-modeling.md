# Threat Model Analysis for alistgo/alist

## Threat: [Malicious Storage Provider Configuration Injection](./threats/malicious_storage_provider_configuration_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Storage Provider Configuration Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the `alist` configuration file (e.g., `data/config.json`) and injects a malicious storage provider.  The attacker could achieve this through server compromise, exploiting a separate vulnerability, or social engineering. The malicious provider could then steal data, modify files, or act as a launching point for further attacks.  This directly involves `alist` because the configuration file and the loading of storage providers are core `alist` functions.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data loss, data corruption, potential compromise of other systems connected to the malicious storage provider.
    *   **Affected Component:** `alist` configuration file (`data/config.json` or similar), storage provider loading mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict File Permissions:** Ensure the configuration file has the most restrictive permissions possible (e.g., read/write only by the `alist` user, no access for others).
        *   **Configuration Management:** Use a configuration management tool (Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to manage the configuration file and enforce a known-good state.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Implement FIM to detect any unauthorized modifications to the configuration file.
        *   **Regular Backups:** Maintain regular, secure backups of the configuration file.
        *   **Input Validation (Feature Request):** `alist` could implement input validation to check the validity of storage provider configurations before loading them.

## Threat: [Credential Exposure via Configuration File](./threats/credential_exposure_via_configuration_file.md)

*   **Threat:** Credential Exposure via Configuration File

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the `alist` configuration file, which contains credentials (API keys, passwords, tokens) for backend storage providers.  The attacker might achieve this through server compromise, accidental exposure (e.g., committing the file to a public repository), or a separate vulnerability. This is a direct threat to `alist` because it's how `alist` stores and manages these credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to all connected storage providers, data breach, data loss, data corruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** `alist` configuration file (`data/config.json` or similar).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict File Permissions:** As above, ensure restrictive file permissions.
        *   **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive credentials in environment variables instead of directly in the configuration file.
        *   **Secrets Management:** Use a dedicated secrets management solution (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.). `alist` would need to be configured to retrieve credentials from the secrets manager.
        *   **Never Commit Credentials:** Avoid committing the configuration file (or any file containing credentials) to version control.

## Threat: [Storage Provider Credential Spoofing](./threats/storage_provider_credential_spoofing.md)

*   **Threat:** Storage Provider Credential Spoofing

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between `alist` and a legitimate storage provider and injects their own credentials. This could involve a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This is a direct threat if `alist` does not properly validate TLS certificates, making it vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the user's data, data breach, data modification.
    *   **Affected Component:** Network communication between `alist` and storage providers, authentication modules for specific storage providers *within alist*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **TLS Certificate Validation:** Ensure `alist` *rigorously* validates TLS certificates for *all* storage provider connections. Reject connections with invalid or self-signed certificates (unless explicitly and securely configured).
        *   **HTTPS Enforcement:** Enforce the use of HTTPS for all storage provider connections. `alist` should refuse to connect over plain HTTP.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests to `alist`, consuming server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and making it unresponsive. This directly targets the `alist` web server and its request handling capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** `alist` service becomes unavailable.
    *   **Affected Component:** `alist` web server, potentially all `alist` modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting within `alist` (feature request) or using a reverse proxy (Nginx, HAProxy).
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server resources.
        *   **Load Balancing:** Use a load balancer for multiple `alist` instances.

## Threat: [`alist` Binary/Dependency Tampering](./threats/_alist__binarydependency_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:**  `alist` Binary/Dependency Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker replaces the `alist` executable or one of its dependencies with a malicious version. This directly targets the integrity of the `alist` application itself.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the `alist` instance, potential server compromise, data breach.
    *   **Affected Component:** `alist` executable, `alist` dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Official Sources:** Download `alist` only from official sources.
        *   **Checksum Verification:** Verify binary integrity using checksums.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `alist` and dependencies up-to-date.
        *   **Containerization:** Use Docker to isolate `alist`.
        *   **System-Level Security:** Implement SELinux, AppArmor.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via `alist` Vulnerability](./threats/privilege_escalation_via__alist__vulnerability.md)

* **Threat:** Privilege Escalation via `alist` Vulnerability

    * **Description:** A vulnerability in `alist` (e.g., a buffer overflow, code injection) is exploited by an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the server. This is a direct threat to the security of the `alist` application and the system it runs on.
    * **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breach, data loss, data corruption.
    * **Affected Component:** Potentially any part of the `alist` codebase.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run `alist` as an unprivileged user.
        * **Containerization:** Use Docker to isolate `alist`.
        * **Regular Updates:** Keep `alist` up-to-date.
        * **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the `alist` codebase.
        * **System Hardening:** Implement system-level security measures (SELinux, AppArmor).
