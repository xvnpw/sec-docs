# Attack Surface Analysis for alistgo/alist

## Attack Surface: [Credential Compromise (via `alist` Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/credential_compromise__via__alist__vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to credentials stored by `alist` due to vulnerabilities *within `alist` itself*, such as insecure storage or information leakage.
*   **How `alist` Contributes:** `alist` stores and manages these credentials, making its internal security paramount.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in `alist`'s configuration file parsing logic to read the encrypted credential store, then uses a separate vulnerability to obtain the decryption key.
*   **Impact:** Complete access to all data within the compromised storage providers connected to `alist`. Data breaches, data loss, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strong Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt all stored credentials using strong, industry-standard encryption (e.g., AES-256) with a robust, *separate* key management system.  The decryption key *must not* be stored alongside the encrypted data.
        *   **Secure Configuration Storage:**  Protect configuration files and databases with strict file system permissions and access controls.  Consider using a dedicated secrets management solution (external to `alist`'s codebase) to further isolate secrets.
        *   **Prevent Information Leakage:**  Rigorously audit `alist`'s code to ensure that credentials (or any part of them, including encryption keys) are *never* logged, displayed in error messages, or exposed through the UI or API in any way.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input, especially anything related to credential management, to prevent injection attacks that might expose or manipulate credentials.
        *   **Audit Logging:** Log all credential-related actions (creation, modification, access, *attempted* access) with sufficient detail for forensic analysis, but *without* logging the credentials themselves.
        *   **Code Review and Static Analysis:**  Perform regular code reviews and static analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities related to credential handling.

## Attack Surface: [Storage Provider API Exploitation (via `alist`'s Intermediary Role)](./attack_surfaces/storage_provider_api_exploitation__via__alist_'s_intermediary_role_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how `alist` constructs and sends API requests to connected storage providers, allowing attackers to bypass intended security controls. This focuses on vulnerabilities *within `alist`'s code*, not the storage providers themselves.
*   **How `alist` Contributes:** `alist` acts as a proxy, and flaws in its request handling can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious file path that, due to improper sanitization *within `alist`*, is passed to the storage provider's API, triggering a path traversal vulnerability on the *provider* side, but initiated through `alist`.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification, denial of service, and potential compromise of connected storage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation (Whitelist Approach):**  Implement extremely strict input validation for *all* user-supplied data used in constructing API calls.  Use a whitelist approach, allowing only known-good characters and patterns, rather than trying to blacklist bad ones.
        *   **Parameterized API Calls:**  Use parameterized API calls or libraries that inherently prevent injection vulnerabilities whenever possible.  Avoid string concatenation for building API requests.
        *   **SSRF Prevention:**  Implement robust Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) prevention.  Validate all URLs and hostnames, and use a whitelist of allowed destinations if feasible.  `alist` should *never* allow arbitrary requests to be made through it.
        *   **Error Handling (No Leakage):**  Ensure that error messages returned from storage provider APIs are handled gracefully *within `alist`* and do *not* leak sensitive information to the user.  Log errors securely for internal debugging.
        *   **Code Review and Dynamic Analysis:** Conduct regular code reviews and dynamic analysis (e.g., fuzzing) specifically targeting `alist`'s API interaction logic.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass (within `alist`'s Logic)](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass__within__alist_'s_logic_.md)

*   **Description:** Users circumventing `alist`'s internal authorization checks to access files or folders they shouldn't have permission to, due to flaws *within `alist`'s code*.
*   **How `alist` Contributes:** `alist` implements its own authorization layer on top of the storage providers' permissions.  This layer must be robust.
*   **Example:** A user discovers a bug in `alist`'s URL handling that allows them to bypass permission checks and directly access a file URL, even though `alist`'s UI would normally prevent this.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially violating privacy and confidentiality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Server-Side Authorization Checks:**  Implement *all* authorization checks on the server-side, within `alist`'s core logic.  *Never* rely on client-side checks, as these can be easily bypassed.
        *   **Least Privilege Enforcement:**  Ensure that `alist`'s internal authorization system adheres strictly to the principle of least privilege.
        *   **Comprehensive Testing:**  Thoroughly test all authorization logic, including edge cases and boundary conditions, to ensure that there are no bypass vulnerabilities.  Include negative test cases (attempts to access unauthorized resources).
        *   **Code Review (Authorization Focus):**  Conduct code reviews with a specific focus on the authorization logic, looking for potential bypasses or flaws.

## Attack Surface: [Management Interface Compromise (Direct `alist` Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/management_interface_compromise__direct__alist__vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:**  Unauthorized access to the `alist` management interface due to vulnerabilities *within the interface itself*, such as weak authentication or injection flaws.
*   **How `alist` Contributes:** The management interface is a core part of `alist` and a high-value target.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `alist` management interface to steal an administrator's session cookie and gain full control.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over `alist`, including the ability to modify configurations, access credentials, and potentially compromise connected storage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strong Authentication and MFA:** Enforce strong password policies and *strongly recommend* (or require) multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the management interface.
        *   **Secure Session Management:** Implement secure session management practices, including using strong session IDs, setting appropriate session timeouts, and protecting against session fixation and hijacking.
        *   **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**  Rigorously validate *all* input to the management interface and properly encode output to prevent injection attacks (XSS, etc.).
        *   **Rate Limiting (Brute-Force Protection):** Implement rate limiting on login attempts to mitigate brute-force attacks against the management interface.
        *   **Code Review and Security Testing:** Conduct regular code reviews and security testing (including penetration testing) specifically targeting the management interface.
