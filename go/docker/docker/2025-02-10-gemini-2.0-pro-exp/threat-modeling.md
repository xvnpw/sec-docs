# Threat Model Analysis for docker/docker

## Threat: [Container Breakout (Escape to Host)](./threats/container_breakout__escape_to_host_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Docker Engine, the container runtime (containerd, runc), or the Linux kernel to escape the container's isolation and gain access to the host operating system.  This could involve exploiting a bug in the containerization mechanisms (e.g., cgroups, namespaces) or a kernel vulnerability. The attacker gains root or equivalent privileges on the host.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the host system.  The attacker gains full control of the host, including all other containers running on it, and potentially the ability to access the underlying infrastructure.  This is a catastrophic security failure.
*   **Affected Component:**  Docker Engine (daemon), container runtime (containerd, runc), Linux kernel.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the Docker Engine, container runtime, and host OS kernel up-to-date with the latest security patches. This is the *most crucial* mitigation.
    *   Run containers with the least necessary privileges (avoid running as root inside the container).
    *   Use AppArmor or SELinux to enforce mandatory access control.
    *   Use seccomp profiles to restrict the system calls a container can make.
    *   Avoid mounting sensitive host directories into containers.
    *   Consider using user namespaces.
    *   Explore virtualization-based container runtimes (Kata Containers, gVisor) for stronger isolation (but be aware of the performance overhead).

## Threat: [Docker Socket Exposure and Abuse](./threats/docker_socket_exposure_and_abuse.md)

*   **Description:**  The Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) is mounted inside a container.  An attacker within the container uses this access to the Docker API to create new containers, start/stop existing containers, or even gain root access to the host (if the Docker daemon is running as root). The attacker essentially gains control of the Docker daemon.
*   **Impact:**  Complete control over the Docker environment.  The attacker can launch malicious containers, disrupt existing services, and potentially escalate privileges to the host, effectively bypassing container isolation.
*   **Affected Component:**  Docker Engine (daemon), specifically the API exposed via the Docker socket.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid mounting the Docker socket inside containers.** This is the most important and effective mitigation.
    *   If absolutely necessary (and you fully understand the risks), use a carefully configured proxy or API gateway to mediate access to the Docker API, enforcing strict authorization and limiting the actions the container can perform.  This proxy must be highly secure.
    *   Consider using rootless Docker, which runs the Docker daemon without root privileges, significantly reducing the impact of a compromised socket.

## Threat: [Insecure Docker Daemon Configuration](./threats/insecure_docker_daemon_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** The Docker daemon is configured insecurely, for example, exposing its API without authentication or TLS encryption, or allowing unrestricted access from any network. An attacker can connect to the exposed API and control the Docker environment remotely.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over the Docker environment, similar to Docker socket exposure. The attacker can manage containers, images, and potentially gain access to the host, all remotely.
*   **Affected Component:** Docker Engine (daemon), specifically its configuration file (usually `/etc/docker/daemon.json`) and command-line options.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the Docker daemon API with TLS encryption and authentication.  Follow Docker's official documentation for configuring TLS. This is mandatory for any production environment.
    *   Restrict access to the Docker daemon to authorized users and hosts (e.g., using firewall rules, network ACLs).  Never expose the Docker API to the public internet without strong authentication and authorization.
    *   Regularly review and audit the Docker daemon configuration.
    *   Use a configuration management tool (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to ensure consistent and secure configurations across all Docker hosts.

## Threat: [Malicious Image Pulled from Untrusted Registry (with Docker Content Trust disabled)](./threats/malicious_image_pulled_from_untrusted_registry__with_docker_content_trust_disabled_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious image to a public registry, masquerading as a legitimate image. A developer, without Docker Content Trust enabled, unknowingly pulls and runs this image. The malicious image could contain malware, backdoors, or perform other harmful actions, potentially compromising the host.
* **Impact:** Compromise of the container and potentially the host, depending on the malicious image's capabilities and the privileges of the container. Data theft, system disruption, or use of the compromised system for further attacks.
* **Affected Component:** Docker Engine (image pulling mechanism), the compromised container, and potentially the host.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Enable Docker Content Trust (Notary).** This is the primary mitigation. It ensures that only signed images from trusted publishers can be pulled.
    * Use a private registry to control image sources and vet images before making them available.
    * Implement strict policies on which registries are allowed, even with Content Trust.
    * Scan images for vulnerabilities *before* running them, even if they are signed (defense in depth).

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation (within the image) - *Marginally Included*](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation__within_the_image__-_marginally_included.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies a vulnerability in a library or package installed *within* the Docker image. The attacker exploits this to gain control of the application *inside* the container. While this is *primarily* an application-level vulnerability, the Docker image is the delivery mechanism, and Docker's build process is relevant.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the containerized application. The attacker gains control *within* the container. The severity is high because it can lead to further attacks, including attempts to escape the container.
*   **Affected Component:** The application's dependencies within the Docker image. Docker's build process is indirectly involved.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools.
    *   Regularly update dependencies.
    *   Implement a secure build process.
    *   Scan the *final* built image for vulnerabilities.
