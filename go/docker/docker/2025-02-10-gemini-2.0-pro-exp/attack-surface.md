# Attack Surface Analysis for docker/docker

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Docker Socket (Docker Daemon API)](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_docker_socket__docker_daemon_api_.md)

*   **Description:** The Docker daemon's control interface (`/var/run/docker.sock`), which is *essential* for Docker's operation, is exposed without authentication or authorization. This is a direct consequence of how Docker is designed and often misconfigured.
*   **How Docker Contributes:** Docker's core functionality relies on this socket.  The default configuration (accessible by the `docker` group) is inherently risky if not carefully managed.  Docker *provides* the mechanism for this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker with access to a compromised container that has the Docker socket mounted (a common misconfiguration) can run `docker` commands to control the entire host.
*   **Impact:** Complete host compromise. The attacker gains root-level access to the host system *through* the Docker daemon.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never expose the Docker socket to untrusted networks or containers.** This is the paramount mitigation.
    *   If remote access is *absolutely* required, use TLS encryption and authentication (client and server certificates) – features *provided by Docker*. Configure Docker to use these certificates.
    *   Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) with strong authentication and authorization in front of the Docker API *only if* it must be exposed. Limit access to specific API endpoints. This acts as a gatekeeper to the Docker daemon.
    *   Regularly audit socket permissions and access using host-level security tools. This helps detect unauthorized access to the Docker socket.
    *   Consider using Docker contexts (a Docker feature) to manage connections to different Docker daemons securely.

## Attack Surface: [Privileged Containers (`--privileged`)](./attack_surfaces/privileged_containers___--privileged__.md)

*   **Description:** Containers are run with the `--privileged` flag, a *Docker-specific* option that grants them near-host-level capabilities, bypassing many of Docker's security mechanisms.
*   **How Docker Contributes:** Docker *provides* the `--privileged` flag, which intentionally disables many of its security features. This is a direct Docker feature that creates the risk.
*   **Example:** A container running with `--privileged` can load kernel modules, access all host devices, and potentially escape the container isolation – all *because* of this Docker flag.
*   **Impact:** High potential for host compromise. A compromised privileged container can easily escalate to full host control *due to the capabilities granted by Docker*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid using `--privileged` unless absolutely necessary and you fully understand the risks.** This is the primary mitigation. The best defense is to not use this Docker feature.
    *   If specific capabilities are needed, use `--cap-add` and `--cap-drop` (Docker-provided flags) to grant *only* the required capabilities. Start with `--cap-drop=ALL` and add back capabilities one by one, documenting the reason for each. This uses Docker's own capability system to limit the risk.
    *   Use AppArmor or SELinux profiles to further restrict the container's capabilities, even if it's running with elevated privileges. This adds a layer of security *on top of* Docker's configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Base Images](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_base_images.md)

*   **Description:**  Container images, a core concept in Docker, are built upon base images that may contain known vulnerabilities. The choice of base image is a direct factor in Docker security.
*   **How Docker Contributes:** Docker's image layering system, a fundamental part of its design, relies on base images.  The security of the base image directly impacts the security of the final image. Docker's ecosystem and image distribution mechanisms contribute to this risk.
*   **Example:** Using an outdated `ubuntu:16.04` base image (a choice made within the Docker build process) that has unpatched vulnerabilities allows an attacker to exploit those vulnerabilities within the container.
*   **Impact:** Container compromise, potentially leading to further attacks. The severity depends on the vulnerability and the container's configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use official, actively maintained base images from trusted sources (e.g., Docker Hub Official Images, which are part of the Docker ecosystem).
    *   Regularly update base images to the latest versions (e.g., `docker pull ubuntu:latest`), a Docker-specific action. Automate this process.
    *   Use minimal base images (e.g., Alpine Linux, distroless images) to reduce the attack surface. This minimizes the software included in the Docker image.
    *   Scan images for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy, Clair, or Snyk *before* deploying them, and integrate this into your Docker-based CI/CD pipeline. This proactively identifies vulnerabilities within the Docker image.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Registry Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_registry_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Docker is configured to interact with insecure (HTTP) container registries or registries without proper authentication, directly impacting how Docker pulls and pushes images.
*   **How Docker Contributes:** Docker relies on registries (a core part of the Docker ecosystem) to distribute images.  The `docker pull` and `docker push` commands are fundamental to Docker, and their security depends on the registry configuration.
*   **Example:** Pulling an image from an insecure registry (configured in Docker) allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to inject malicious code into the image *during the Docker pull operation*.
*   **Impact:** Container compromise by running malicious code obtained *via Docker*. Potential leakage of registry credentials.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use HTTPS for communication with container registries.** This secures the connection used by `docker pull` and `docker push`.
    *   Configure authentication for *all* registries used within Docker. Use strong passwords or tokens.
    *   Use a private registry with strong access controls if you are building and distributing sensitive images, managing access to the images used by Docker.
    *   Verify image signatures using Docker Content Trust or Notary (Docker-integrated features) to ensure image integrity during the `docker pull` process.

## Attack Surface: [Hardcoded Secrets in Images](./attack_surfaces/hardcoded_secrets_in_images.md)

* **Description:** Sensitive data is directly embedded within the Dockerfile or application code inside the image, making it part of the Docker image itself.
* **How Docker Contributes:** Dockerfiles are the primary way to build Docker images, and developers might mistakenly include secrets directly in these files or the application code that gets copied into the image during the `docker build` process.
* **Example:** A Dockerfile contains `ENV API_KEY=mysecretkey`, making the key accessible to anyone who can obtain the image (e.g., via `docker pull`).
* **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potentially leading to unauthorized access. The secrets are baked into the Docker image.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never hardcode secrets in Dockerfiles or application code within the image.**
    *   Use Docker Secrets (for Docker Swarm) or environment variables to inject secrets at *runtime*, not build time. These are Docker-provided mechanisms.
    *   Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and retrieve secrets, integrating this with your Docker deployment process.
    *   Use build-time secrets (e.g., `docker build --secret`) *carefully* and ensure they are *not* included in the final image layers. This is a Docker build feature that must be used correctly.
