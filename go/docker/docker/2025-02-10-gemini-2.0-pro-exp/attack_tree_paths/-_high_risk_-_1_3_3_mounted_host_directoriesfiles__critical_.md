Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on mounted host directories/files within a Docker environment.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.3.3 Mounted Host Directories/Files

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the risks associated with mounting sensitive host directories and files into Docker containers.
*   Identify specific attack vectors that exploit this vulnerability.
*   Provide concrete, actionable recommendations for developers to mitigate these risks effectively.
*   Explain the underlying mechanisms that make this vulnerability exploitable.
*   Provide examples of real-world scenarios and potential consequences.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack tree path "1.3.3 Mounted Host Directories/Files [CRITICAL]" within the context of applications using the Docker engine (https://github.com/docker/docker).  It covers:

*   **Target System:**  Applications deployed using Docker containers.  We assume a standard Docker installation on a Linux host (the most common scenario).  While some principles apply to Docker on Windows or macOS, the specific paths and attack vectors may differ.
*   **Attacker Profile:**  We consider attackers with varying levels of access:
    *   **Initial Foothold:** An attacker who has already gained *some* level of access to the container (e.g., through a separate vulnerability in the application running inside the container).  This is the most relevant scenario, as mounting sensitive directories is unlikely to be the *initial* entry point.
    *   **Privileged User (Less Likely):**  A malicious or compromised user with the ability to *create* and configure containers.  This is less likely in a well-managed environment, but still worth considering.
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis does *not* cover:
    *   Vulnerabilities in the Docker engine itself (e.g., container escape vulnerabilities that don't rely on mounted directories).
    *   Attacks that don't involve mounting host directories/files.
    *   Other containerization technologies (e.g., Podman, LXC) unless explicitly mentioned for comparison.

**1.3 Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Explanation:**  Provide a detailed explanation of *why* mounting sensitive host directories is dangerous.  This includes explaining the purpose of the targeted directories/files and how they can be abused.
2.  **Attack Vector Analysis:**  Describe specific attack scenarios, step-by-step, demonstrating how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability.  This will include code examples (e.g., Docker commands, shell scripts) where appropriate.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Clearly articulate the potential consequences of a successful attack, including the level of access gained, data compromised, and potential for further exploitation.
4.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Provide detailed, practical recommendations for preventing or mitigating the vulnerability.  This will include both general best practices and specific Docker configuration options.
5.  **Detection Methods:**  Describe how to detect if this vulnerability exists in a running system or during development.
6.  **Real-World Examples (if available):**  Reference any known real-world exploits or incidents related to this vulnerability.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

**2.1 Vulnerability Explanation:**

Mounting host directories or files into a container creates a direct link between the container's filesystem and the host's filesystem.  This bypasses the isolation that containers are designed to provide.  If a sensitive directory or file is mounted, an attacker who compromises the container can potentially:

*   **Gain Host Control:**  The most critical risk.  Mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` (the Docker daemon socket) allows the container to issue commands to the Docker daemon, effectively giving the attacker control over the entire host system.  They can create new containers, stop existing ones, access images, and potentially escape the container entirely.
*   **Modify Kernel Parameters:**  Mounting `/proc` or `/sys` allows the container to read and, crucially, *write* to kernel parameters.  This can be used to disable security features, manipulate network settings, or even crash the host system.
*   **Access Sensitive Data:**  Mounting directories like `/etc` (containing configuration files, including potentially sensitive ones like `/etc/shadow`), `/root` (the root user's home directory), or custom directories containing application data can expose sensitive information to the attacker.
*   **Device Manipulation:**  Mounting `/dev` allows the container to interact directly with host devices.  This could be used to access storage devices, network interfaces, or other hardware, potentially leading to data exfiltration or system disruption.

**Why is this dangerous?**

Containers are designed to be isolated environments.  The principle of least privilege dictates that a container should only have access to the resources it absolutely needs.  Mounting sensitive host paths violates this principle, creating a large attack surface.  Even if the application running inside the container is well-secured, a single vulnerability in that application, combined with a carelessly mounted directory, can lead to a complete host compromise.

**2.2 Attack Vector Analysis:**

Let's examine several specific attack vectors:

**2.2.1  `/var/run/docker.sock` (Docker Daemon Socket):**

*   **Scenario:** A web application running in a container is vulnerable to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.  The container was started with `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    1.  **Exploit RCE:** The attacker exploits the RCE vulnerability in the web application to gain a shell inside the container.
    2.  **Install Docker Client:**  The attacker installs the Docker client inside the compromised container (if it's not already present).  This can often be done with a simple `apt-get install docker.io` (or equivalent) if the container has network access.
    3.  **Issue Docker Commands:** The attacker uses the Docker client to interact with the Docker daemon on the host, via the mounted socket.  Examples:
        *   `docker ps`: List all running containers on the host.
        *   `docker run -it --privileged --pid=host debian nsenter -t 1 -m -u -n -i sh`:  This command creates a new, highly privileged container that shares the host's PID namespace, effectively giving the attacker a shell *on the host* with root privileges.
        *   `docker exec -it <other_container_id> sh`:  Gain a shell in *another* container running on the host.
        *   `docker pull malicious_image`: Download a malicious image from a remote repository.
        *   `docker run -d malicious_image`: Run the malicious image as a new container.
*   **Impact:** Complete host compromise.  The attacker has root access to the host system and can do anything they want.

**2.2.2  `/proc` (Process Information):**

*   **Scenario:** A container is started with `-v /proc:/hostproc:ro`.  While read-only, this still exposes sensitive information.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    1.  **Gain Container Access:** The attacker gains access to the container through some other vulnerability.
    2.  **Read Process Information:** The attacker can browse the `/hostproc` directory inside the container.  This gives them access to:
        *   `/hostproc/<pid>/cmdline`:  The command line arguments used to start *any* process on the host, potentially revealing sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or database connection strings.
        *   `/hostproc/<pid>/environ`:  The environment variables of *any* process on the host, which can also contain sensitive data.
        *   `/hostproc/<pid>/maps`:  Memory mappings of processes, which could be analyzed to potentially extract sensitive data.
        *   `/hostproc/<pid>/fd`: File descriptors of processes, which could reveal open files and network connections.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure.  The attacker can gather sensitive information about running processes on the host, which could be used for further attacks.  Even a read-only mount of `/proc` is dangerous.

**2.2.3  `/sys` (Kernel Parameters):**

*   **Scenario:** A container is started with `-v /sys:/hostsys`.  This is extremely dangerous.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    1.  **Gain Container Access:** The attacker gains access to the container.
    2.  **Modify Kernel Parameters:** The attacker can write to files within `/hostsys` to modify kernel parameters.  Examples:
        *   Disable security modules (e.g., AppArmor, SELinux) by modifying files in `/sys/kernel/security`.
        *   Change network settings by modifying files in `/sys/class/net`.
        *   Cause a denial-of-service by writing to files that control resource limits.
*   **Impact:**  System instability, security bypass, and potential for complete host compromise.  Modifying kernel parameters can have devastating consequences.

**2.2.4 `/dev` (Devices):**
* **Scenario:** A container is started with `-v /dev:/hostdev`.
* **Attack Steps:**
    1. **Gain Container Access:** The attacker gains access to the container.
    2. **Access Host Devices:** The attacker can interact with devices within `/hostdev`.
        *   Access raw disk partitions (e.g., `/hostdev/sda1`) to read or write data directly, bypassing filesystem permissions.
        *   Interact with network interfaces to sniff traffic or inject packets.
* **Impact:** Data breach, network compromise, system instability.

**2.3 Impact Assessment:**

The impact of exploiting mounted sensitive directories ranges from information disclosure to complete host compromise.  The specific impact depends on which directory is mounted and the level of access granted (read-only vs. read-write).

*   **Confidentiality:** Sensitive data can be exposed, including configuration files, credentials, application data, and kernel information.
*   **Integrity:**  The attacker can modify system files, kernel parameters, and even the contents of storage devices.
*   **Availability:**  The attacker can cause denial-of-service by crashing the host, disrupting network connectivity, or manipulating resource limits.
*   **Complete Host Compromise:**  Mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` almost always leads to complete host compromise.

**2.4 Mitigation Strategies:**

The most important mitigation is to **avoid mounting sensitive host directories whenever possible.**  If you *must* mount a host directory, follow these guidelines:

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Only mount the *specific* files or directories that the container absolutely needs.  Never mount entire directories like `/proc`, `/sys`, or `/dev` unless you have a very good reason and understand the risks.
*   **Read-Only Mounts:**  Use the `:ro` flag to make the mount read-only whenever possible.  This significantly reduces the attack surface.  Example: `-v /path/to/host/data:/container/path:ro`
*   **User Namespaces:**  Use Docker user namespaces (`--userns-remap`) to map the container's root user to a non-root user on the host.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they gain root privileges *inside* the container.
*   **AppArmor/SELinux:**  Use AppArmor or SELinux to further restrict the container's access to host resources, even if they are mounted.  These Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems can prevent the container from accessing files or performing actions that are not explicitly allowed.
*   **Seccomp Profiles:**  Use seccomp profiles to restrict the system calls that the container can make.  This can prevent the container from interacting with sensitive parts of the kernel, even if `/proc` or `/sys` are mounted.
*   **Avoid `--privileged`:**  Never use the `--privileged` flag unless absolutely necessary.  This flag disables many of Docker's security features and gives the container almost unrestricted access to the host.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Regularly review your Docker configurations and container images to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Minimal Base Images:** Use minimal base images (e.g., Alpine Linux) to reduce the attack surface.  Smaller images have fewer utilities and libraries that an attacker could potentially exploit.
* **Bind Mount Specific Files:** Instead of mounting entire directories, consider bind-mounting only the specific *files* the container needs. This is much more granular and secure.

**2.5 Detection Methods:**

*   **`docker inspect`:**  Use `docker inspect <container_id>` to examine the container's configuration, including the `Mounts` section.  Look for any mounts that point to sensitive host directories.
*   **Runtime Monitoring:**  Use container security monitoring tools (e.g., Sysdig Falco, Aqua Security, Prisma Cloud) to detect suspicious activity within containers, such as attempts to access or modify sensitive files or make unusual system calls.
*   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to scan Dockerfiles and container images for potential vulnerabilities, including insecure mount configurations.
*   **Security Benchmarks:**  Use Docker Bench for Security (https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security) to automatically check your Docker environment against security best practices.

**2.6 Real-World Examples:**

While specific, publicly disclosed examples of exploits *solely* based on mounted directories are less common (because this is often a *secondary* vulnerability used after an initial compromise), the general principle is well-known and exploited in various ways. The concept of "Docker escape" often relies on leveraging misconfigured mounts. The widespread use of Docker makes this a significant concern.

### 3. Conclusion

Mounting sensitive host directories or files into Docker containers is a critical security risk that can lead to complete host compromise. Developers must understand the dangers and follow best practices to minimize the attack surface. By applying the principle of least privilege, using read-only mounts, leveraging user namespaces, and employing security tools, the risks associated with this vulnerability can be significantly reduced. Continuous monitoring and regular security audits are essential to maintain a secure Docker environment.
