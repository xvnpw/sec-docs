Okay, let's create a design document for the Docker project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Docker has become a foundational technology for modern software development and deployment.  It's used by individual developers, small startups, and large enterprises.  Given its widespread adoption and critical role in many organizations' infrastructure, the business posture emphasizes stability, security, and broad compatibility.

Priorities and Goals:

*   Enable efficient and consistent application packaging and deployment.
*   Provide a platform-agnostic way to run applications.
*   Facilitate microservices architectures.
*   Reduce the "it works on my machine" problem.
*   Maintain backward compatibility where possible, while still innovating.
*   Foster a large and active community and ecosystem.
*   Provide enterprise-grade solutions with support and enhanced security features.

Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in Docker itself could lead to widespread exploits, impacting a vast number of deployments. This is the most critical risk.
*   Incompatibility with specific operating systems or kernel versions could limit adoption or break existing workflows.
*   Performance overhead could make Docker unsuitable for certain performance-sensitive applications.
*   Complexity of managing large-scale Docker deployments (especially with orchestration tools like Kubernetes) could hinder adoption or lead to operational issues.
*   Competition from alternative containerization technologies could erode Docker's market share.
*   Reputational damage from security incidents or poor community management.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Docker, being a core infrastructure component, has a significant security surface.  The project has evolved its security posture over time, incorporating various controls and addressing vulnerabilities.

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: User Namespaces: Isolates containers from the host system by mapping container user IDs to different host user IDs. Implemented in the Docker Engine.
*   security control: Control Groups (cgroups): Limits the resources (CPU, memory, network, I/O) that a container can consume. Implemented in the Docker Engine and Linux kernel.
*   security control: Capabilities: Provides fine-grained control over the privileges of processes within a container, limiting the potential impact of a compromised container. Implemented in the Docker Engine and Linux kernel.
*   security control: Seccomp Profiles: Restricts the system calls that a container can make, reducing the attack surface. Implemented in the Docker Engine and Linux kernel.
*   security control: AppArmor/SELinux: Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems that provide an additional layer of security by enforcing policies on container behavior. Can be configured and used with Docker.
*   security control: Docker Content Trust: Uses digital signatures to verify the integrity and publisher of Docker images. Implemented in Docker CLI and Docker Hub/Registry.
*   security control: Image Scanning: Tools (both integrated and third-party) are available to scan Docker images for known vulnerabilities. Implemented in Docker Hub, third-party tools, and CI/CD pipelines.
*   security control: Regular Security Audits: Docker Inc. and the community conduct security audits and penetration testing. Described in security documentation and reports.
*   security control: Security Advisories and CVE Handling: Docker Inc. publishes security advisories and addresses Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) promptly. Described in security documentation.
*   security control: Hardened Base Images: Official images are regularly updated and maintained to minimize vulnerabilities. Described in Docker Hub documentation.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Root Access within Containers: By default, processes within a container run as root (though with limited capabilities). This is a known risk, mitigated by other controls like user namespaces and capabilities.
*   accepted risk: Shared Kernel: Containers share the host operating system's kernel. A kernel vulnerability could potentially affect all containers on the host. This is inherent to containerization.
*   accepted risk: Complexity of Configuration: Securely configuring Docker and related tools (e.g., networking, storage) requires expertise. Misconfiguration is a potential risk.
*   accepted risk: Third-Party Image Risks: Users can pull and run images from any registry, including untrusted sources. This is mitigated by Docker Content Trust and image scanning, but the risk remains.
*   accepted risk: Supply Chain Attacks: Compromise of build systems or dependencies used to create Docker images could lead to malicious images.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation and verification for all official images.
*   Enhance integration with Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) and AppArmor, providing default profiles for common use cases.
*   Provide more granular control over network access within and between containers.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Docker CLI should authenticate with registries (e.g., Docker Hub) securely, using API keys or other strong authentication mechanisms.
    *   Private registries should support robust authentication and access control.
*   Authorization:
    *   Access to Docker Engine should be restricted to authorized users and groups.
    *   Fine-grained authorization should be available for managing containers, images, networks, and volumes.
    *   Integration with existing identity providers (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory) should be supported.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Dockerfiles should be validated to prevent injection of malicious commands.
    *   Image names and tags should be sanitized to prevent attacks.
    *   API inputs should be validated to prevent vulnerabilities like command injection.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Docker Content Trust should use strong cryptographic algorithms and key management practices.
    *   Communication between Docker components (e.g., CLI and daemon) should be encrypted using TLS.
    *   Secrets management should be integrated to securely store and distribute sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) to containers.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- commits code --> SourceCodeRepo["Source Code Repository (Git)"]
    SourceCodeRepo -- triggers --> CI_CD["CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)"]
    CI_CD -- builds --> DockerBuild["Docker Build (docker build)"]
    DockerBuild -- uses --> Dockerfile["Dockerfile"]
    DockerBuild -- pulls base image from --> BaseImage["Base Image (from Registry)"]
    DockerBuild -- produces --> DockerImage["Docker Image"]
    DockerImage -- pushed to --> ImageRegistry["Image Registry (Docker Hub, Private Registry)"]
    CI_CD -- runs --> SecurityScanners["Security Scanners (SAST, SCA, Image Scanning)"]
    SecurityScanners -- analyzes --> DockerImage
    SecurityScanners -- analyzes --> SourceCodeRepo

```

    *   Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Identifying and analyzing open-source dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Image Scanning: Scanning the built Docker image for vulnerabilities.
    *   Linting: Enforcing coding standards and best practices in the Dockerfile.
    *   Build provenance: Signing build artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity.
*   Dockerfile:
    *   Using minimal base images.
    *   Avoiding hardcoding secrets.
    *   Using multi-stage builds to reduce image size.
    *   Running security checks within the Dockerfile (e.g., using `RUN` commands to install security tools and scan the image).
*   Image Registry:
    *   Authentication and authorization for pushing and pulling images.
    *   Image scanning (if provided by the registry).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Application Deployment: Docker is critical for deploying applications consistently and reliably across different environments.
*   Software Development Lifecycle: Docker is used throughout the SDLC, from development to testing to production.

Data to Protect:

*   Application Code (Source Code and Binaries): Sensitivity varies depending on the application.
*   Configuration Data: May contain sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, etc. (High sensitivity)
*   Customer Data: Stored within applications running in containers. (High sensitivity, subject to regulations like GDPR, CCPA)
*   Docker Images: May contain proprietary code or sensitive configuration. (Sensitivity varies)
*   Docker Registry Credentials: Used to access private registries. (High sensitivity)
*   Docker Engine API Credentials: Used to access the Docker Engine. (High sensitivity)
