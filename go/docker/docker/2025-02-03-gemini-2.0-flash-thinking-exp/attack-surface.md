# Attack Surface Analysis for docker/docker

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Docker Daemon Socket](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_docker_daemon_socket.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of the Docker daemon socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) without proper access controls. This grants unrestricted access to the Docker daemon's powerful API.
*   **Docker Contribution:** Docker daemon, by default, listens on this Unix socket. Docker's design allows for local management via this socket, but insecure exposure creates a critical vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A container orchestration platform misconfigures its agent, exposing the host's Docker socket to containers or external networks without authentication. An attacker compromising a container can then use this socket to gain full control of the Docker host.
*   **Impact:** Full host compromise, arbitrary code execution on the host, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict access to the Docker socket using file system permissions.** Ensure only authorized users and processes can access it.
    *   **Avoid mounting the Docker socket into containers in production environments.** Re-architect applications to use Docker API over network with authentication if container management is needed.
    *   **If socket mounting is absolutely necessary, use minimal and isolated containers** and implement strict security policies around those containers.
    *   **Consider using alternative, less privileged methods for container management** if possible, such as dedicated container orchestration APIs or client libraries.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Docker Daemon API](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_docker_daemon_api.md)

*   **Description:** Exposing the Docker Daemon API over a network (HTTP or HTTPS) without proper authentication and authorization. This allows anyone with network access to control the Docker daemon.
*   **Docker Contribution:** Docker daemon provides a REST API for remote management. Docker's API design, while powerful, requires careful security considerations when exposed over a network.
*   **Example:** A Docker daemon API is exposed on a public cloud instance without TLS or authentication for ease of access during development and this configuration is mistakenly carried over to production. Attackers can discover this open API and remotely manage the Docker host.
*   **Impact:** Full host compromise, arbitrary code execution on the host, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never expose the Docker Daemon API directly to the public internet.**
    *   **Enable TLS for Docker API communication (HTTPS) to encrypt traffic.**
    *   **Implement strong authentication and authorization for the Docker API.** Use client certificates, mutual TLS, or authentication proxies to verify API clients.
    *   **Restrict network access to the Docker API using firewalls and network segmentation.** Only allow authorized networks or IP addresses to connect.
    *   **Regularly audit and monitor API access logs for suspicious activity.**

## Attack Surface: [Privileged Containers](./attack_surfaces/privileged_containers.md)

*   **Description:** Running Docker containers in privileged mode, which disables most container isolation features and grants the container near-host-level capabilities.
*   **Docker Contribution:** Docker provides the `--privileged` flag, a powerful but dangerous option that directly weakens container security by bypassing isolation.
*   **Example:** A development team uses privileged containers for tasks requiring direct hardware access or kernel module loading. This privileged mode is inadvertently left enabled in production. If this container is compromised, the attacker gains near-root access to the host system due to the Docker-granted privileges.
*   **Impact:** Full host compromise, arbitrary code execution on the host.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid using privileged containers in production environments under almost all circumstances.**  Thoroughly justify and document any exception.
    *   **If privileged mode is absolutely necessary, minimize the container's exposure and complexity.**  Isolate privileged containers as much as possible.
    *   **Explore alternative solutions that do not require privileged mode.** Investigate using specific Linux capabilities instead of full privilege to grant only necessary permissions.
    *   **Implement strict monitoring and auditing for any privileged containers** that are unavoidable.

## Attack Surface: [Container Escape Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/container_escape_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Docker runtime (like `runc`, `containerd`) or the underlying kernel that allow attackers to break out of the container's isolation and access the host system.
*   **Docker Contribution:** Docker relies on container runtimes and the Linux kernel for isolation. Vulnerabilities in these *Docker-ecosystem* components directly undermine Docker's security model.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability exists in the `runc` runtime used by Docker. An attacker exploits this vulnerability from within a container to escape the container boundary and execute code directly on the host operating system.
*   **Impact:** Full host compromise, arbitrary code execution on the host.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep the Docker engine, container runtime, and host kernel updated to the latest versions.** Apply security patches promptly to address known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Implement security profiles (AppArmor, SELinux) for containers.** These can provide an additional layer of defense and limit the impact even if a container escape occurs.
    *   **Use container-optimized operating systems** that are hardened and regularly updated, reducing the likelihood of kernel vulnerabilities.
    *   **Employ runtime security monitoring tools to detect and respond to suspicious container behavior** that might indicate a container escape attempt.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Docker Image Practices (Leading to Vulnerable Images)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_docker_image_practices__leading_to_vulnerable_images_.md)

*   **Description:**  Developing and using Docker images that contain known vulnerabilities or insecure configurations due to poor image building practices. This includes using vulnerable base images and introducing vulnerabilities during the image build process.
*   **Docker Contribution:** Docker's layered image system and Dockerfile build process, while powerful, can easily lead to insecure images if best practices are not followed. Docker facilitates the *creation* of these vulnerable images if users are not careful.
*   **Example (Base Image):** A team uses an outdated and unsupported base image for their application, inheriting numerous known vulnerabilities from the base OS packages.
*   **Example (Build Process):** A Dockerfile installs vulnerable packages or copies sensitive secrets into the image, creating vulnerabilities during the image creation process itself.
*   **Impact:** Container compromise, potential lateral movement, data breaches, supply chain compromise if vulnerable images are distributed.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Choose minimal and regularly updated base images from trusted sources.**
    *   **Implement automated image scanning for vulnerabilities during the build process and in registries.** Use tools to identify vulnerabilities in base images and installed packages.
    *   **Regularly rebuild images to incorporate security updates** from base images and dependencies. Automate image rebuilding pipelines.
    *   **Follow Dockerfile best practices:** Use multi-stage builds, avoid installing unnecessary packages, and never embed secrets directly in images.
    *   **Implement image signing and verification** to ensure image integrity and prevent supply chain attacks. Use private registries with access control to manage image distribution.
