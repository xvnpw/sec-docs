# Threat Model Analysis for docker/docker

## Threat: [Container Escape via Kernel Exploit](./threats/container_escape_via_kernel_exploit.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the host kernel from within a container. Successful exploitation allows them to break out of the container's isolation and gain root access on the host system.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of the host system, including data breach, service disruption, and unauthorized access to other containers.
*   **Docker Component Affected:** Host Kernel (shared by Docker containers)
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the host kernel updated with the latest security patches.
    *   Implement security profiles like AppArmor or SELinux to restrict container capabilities and system calls.
    *   Use container-optimized operating systems with hardened kernels.
    *   Regularly scan host systems for kernel vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Container Escape via Docker Daemon Exploit](./threats/container_escape_via_docker_daemon_exploit.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Docker daemon itself to escape containerization and gain control of the host.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of the host system, similar to kernel escape, leading to data breach, service disruption, and unauthorized access.
*   **Docker Component Affected:** Docker Daemon (dockerd)
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the Docker daemon updated to the latest version with security patches.
    *   Restrict access to the Docker daemon API using strong authentication (TLS) and authorization.
    *   Consider running the Docker daemon in rootless mode.
    *   Regularly scan the Docker daemon for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Container Escape via Capability Abuse](./threats/container_escape_via_capability_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages excessive Linux capabilities granted to a container to perform actions that lead to container escape.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Increased risk of container escape and potential host compromise, elevating attacker privileges within the container.
*   **Docker Component Affected:** Container Runtime (capabilities management)
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege and drop unnecessary capabilities from containers.
    *   Carefully review and minimize the capabilities granted to containers.
    *   Use security profiles (AppArmor, SELinux) to further restrict container capabilities.
    *   Implement user namespace remapping.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Base Image Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_base_image_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker targets known vulnerabilities present in the base image used to build a container, exploiting them from within the container or through exposed application services.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Compromise of the application container, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and unauthorized access to application resources.
*   **Docker Component Affected:** Docker Image (base image content)
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly scan base images for vulnerabilities using image scanning tools.
    *   Choose minimal and hardened base images from trusted sources.
    *   Keep base images updated by rebuilding images regularly.
    *   Implement a process for patching vulnerabilities in base images.

## Threat: [Malicious Image Injection](./threats/malicious_image_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects a malicious Docker image into the image registry or replaces a legitimate image, leading to deployment of compromised containers when users pull and run these images.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Deployment of compromised containers across the environment, potentially leading to widespread malware infection, data theft, and supply chain attacks.
*   **Docker Component Affected:** Docker Registry (image storage and distribution)
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only pull images from trusted registries.
    *   Implement image signing and verification using Docker Content Trust.
    *   Scan images for malware and vulnerabilities before pushing and deployment.
    *   Use private registries with robust access control and vulnerability scanning.

## Threat: [Secrets Exposure in Docker Image](./threats/secrets_exposure_in_docker_image.md)

*   **Description:** Developers hardcode sensitive information directly into Docker images, making these secrets accessible to anyone who can access the image.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to external systems, data breaches, and account compromise.
*   **Docker Component Affected:** Docker Image (image layers containing secrets)
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** hardcode secrets in Docker images.
    *   Use Docker secrets management or external secret management solutions to inject secrets at runtime.
    *   Employ multi-stage builds to minimize secret exposure.
    *   Use `.dockerignore` to prevent sensitive files from being included in the image.

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Docker API Access](./threats/unauthenticated_docker_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** The Docker daemon API is exposed without proper authentication or authorization, allowing attackers to control the Docker daemon and potentially compromise the host.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of the host system due to complete control over the Docker daemon.
*   **Docker Component Affected:** Docker Daemon API (remote API endpoint)
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** expose the Docker daemon API directly to the public internet.
    *   Use TLS authentication and authorization to secure Docker daemon API access.
    *   Restrict network access to the Docker daemon API.
    *   Consider using SSH tunnels or VPNs for remote API access.

## Threat: [Privileged Container Abuse](./threats/privileged_container_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** Running containers with the `--privileged` flag grants extensive host capabilities, significantly increasing the risk of container escape and host compromise if the container is compromised.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. High risk of container escape and host compromise due to bypassed security boundaries.
*   **Docker Component Affected:** Container Runtime (privileged mode)
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid using privileged containers** unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
    *   Thoroughly document and justify the use of privileged containers and implement strong compensating controls.
    *   Regularly audit the use of privileged containers.
    *   Explore alternative solutions to privileged mode, such as specific capabilities or volume mounts.

## Threat: [Insecure Network Exposure](./threats/insecure_network_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Containers expose unnecessary ports to public networks or use insecure network modes, directly exposing application services to network-based attacks.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Unauthorized access to application services, data breaches, and potential compromise of containers and the host system through exposed services.
*   **Docker Component Affected:** Docker Networking (port mapping, network modes)
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege for network exposure, only exposing necessary ports.
    *   Use Docker network features to isolate containers and control network traffic.
    *   Implement network segmentation and firewalls to restrict network access to containers.
    *   Avoid using the `host` network mode unless absolutely necessary.
