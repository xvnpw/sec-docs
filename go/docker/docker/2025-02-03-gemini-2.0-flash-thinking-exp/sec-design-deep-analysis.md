### 2. Security Implications Breakdown by Key Component

**2.1 Docker Engine:**

* **Security Implications:**
    * **Container Escape:** Vulnerabilities in the Docker Engine could allow a malicious container to escape its isolation and gain access to the host OS or other containers. This is a critical threat as it breaks the fundamental security promise of containerization.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Exploits within the Docker Engine could allow attackers to escalate privileges within a container or on the host system.
    * **API Security:** Unsecured or poorly secured Docker Engine API can be exploited for unauthorized container management, image manipulation, and system compromise.
    * **Resource Exhaustion:**  If resource limits (cgroups) are not properly configured or bypassed, a container could consume excessive resources, leading to denial of service for other containers or the host.
    * **Kernel Vulnerabilities:** As containers share the host kernel, kernel vulnerabilities can be exploited from within a container to affect the host and other containers.

* **Existing Security Controls:**
    * Namespace Isolation
    * Control Groups (cgroups)
    * Seccomp
    * AppArmor/SELinux
    * User Namespaces
