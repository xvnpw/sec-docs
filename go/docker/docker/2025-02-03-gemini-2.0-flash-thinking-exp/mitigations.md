## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Scan Docker Images for Vulnerabilities](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_scan_docker_images_for_vulnerabilities.md)

### 1. Regularly Scan Docker Images for Vulnerabilities

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Scan Docker Images for Vulnerabilities

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Choose a Docker Image Scanning Tool:** Select a tool specifically designed for Docker image scanning (e.g., Trivy, Clair, Anchore). These tools analyze image layers and identify vulnerabilities in OS packages and application dependencies within the container image.
    *   **Step 2: Integrate into Docker Build Process:** Integrate the scanner into your Docker image build process, ideally within your CI/CD pipeline.  This ensures every newly built image is automatically scanned.
    *   **Step 3: Define Docker Scan Policies:** Configure the scanner to enforce policies based on vulnerability severity. For example, fail a Docker build if critical or high severity vulnerabilities are found.
    *   **Step 4: Automate Docker Image Scanning:** Schedule automated scans of your Docker image registry to detect vulnerabilities in existing images, not just during builds.
    *   **Step 5: Review Docker Scan Reports:** Regularly review the reports generated by the Docker image scanner to understand identified vulnerabilities and prioritize remediation efforts within your Docker images.
    *   **Step 6: Remediate Docker Image Vulnerabilities:**  Address vulnerabilities by updating base images in Dockerfiles, patching packages during the Docker build process, or rebuilding images with updated components.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Docker Base Images:** Severity: High - Docker images inherit vulnerabilities from base images. Exploiting these can lead to container compromise and potentially host access.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Docker Image Layers:** Severity: Medium - Vulnerabilities introduced through packages installed or files added during the Docker image build process.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Vulnerable Docker Components:** Severity: Medium - Unknowingly including vulnerable components within Docker images can introduce security risks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Known Vulnerabilities in Docker Base Images: High Impact - Significantly reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities originating from base images used in Docker.
    *   Known Vulnerabilities in Docker Image Layers: Medium Impact - Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities introduced during the Docker image creation process.
    *   Supply Chain Attacks via Vulnerable Docker Components: Medium Impact - Helps identify and mitigate risks from vulnerable components embedded in Docker images.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Trivy scanner is integrated into GitLab CI/CD pipeline for backend Docker image builds.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Frontend Docker images in a separate repository are not yet scanned. Automated registry scanning for existing Docker images is not fully implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Choose Minimal and Hardened Base Images](./mitigation_strategies/choose_minimal_and_hardened_base_images.md)

### 2. Choose Minimal and Hardened Base Images

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Choose Minimal and Hardened Base Images

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Evaluate Docker Image Base Needs:** Analyze the application's runtime requirements within Docker containers. Identify the absolute minimum OS packages and libraries needed for the application to function inside a Docker container.
    *   **Step 2: Select Minimal Docker Base Images:** Choose Docker base images that are designed to be minimal, such as `alpine`, `distroless`, or slim variants of standard distributions available on Docker Hub or trusted registries.
    *   **Step 3: Consider Hardened Docker Base Images:** Explore Docker base images specifically hardened for security. Some organizations and cloud providers offer hardened versions of common base images on Docker Hub or their private registries.
    *   **Step 4: Test Docker Base Image Compatibility:** Thoroughly test the chosen minimal or hardened Docker base image to ensure full compatibility with the application and its dependencies within the Docker container environment.
    *   **Step 5: Document Docker Base Image Choice:** Document the selection process and the specific Docker base image chosen in the project's documentation, emphasizing security considerations.
    *   **Step 6: Regularly Review Docker Base Image Selection:** Periodically review the chosen Docker base image to ensure it remains the most secure and appropriate option as application needs and Docker best practices evolve.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Increased Docker Attack Surface:** Severity: Medium - Larger Docker base images contain more packages, increasing the potential attack surface within the container environment.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Unnecessary Docker Packages:** Severity: Medium - Unnecessary packages in Docker base images may contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited, even if not directly used by the application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Increased Docker Attack Surface: Medium Impact - Reduces the attack surface of Docker containers by minimizing the number of packages present in the base image.
    *   Vulnerabilities in Unnecessary Docker Packages: Medium Impact - Lowers the risk of vulnerabilities in unused packages within Docker images being exploited.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Backend services primarily use `alpine` based Docker images.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Frontend services still use larger `node` Docker base images. Consider migrating to slim or distroless Node.js Docker base images for frontend applications.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement a Process for Patching and Rebuilding Docker Images](./mitigation_strategies/implement_a_process_for_patching_and_rebuilding_docker_images.md)

### 3. Implement a Process for Patching and Rebuilding Docker Images

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement a Process for Patching and Rebuilding Docker Images

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Monitor Docker Image Vulnerability Reports:** Continuously monitor vulnerability scan reports generated for Docker images in your registry and CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Step 2: Track Docker Base Image Updates:** Subscribe to security advisories and update notifications specifically for the Docker base images used in your project (e.g., from base image providers or Docker Hub).
    *   **Step 3: Automate Docker Image Rebuild Triggers:** Configure automated triggers within your CI/CD system to rebuild Docker images when new vulnerabilities are detected in scans or when updates to base Docker images are released.
    *   **Step 4: Establish a Docker Image Patching Schedule:** Define a regular schedule for patching application dependencies *within* Dockerfiles and rebuilding Docker images, even if no immediate vulnerabilities are reported.
    *   **Step 5: Test Rebuilt Docker Images:** Thoroughly test rebuilt Docker images in a staging environment before deploying to production to ensure patching or base image updates haven't introduced regressions in the Dockerized application.
    *   **Step 6: Automate Docker Container Redeployment:** Automate the process of redeploying Docker containers with the newly patched and rebuilt Docker images to production environments to ensure timely vulnerability remediation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unpatched Docker Image Vulnerabilities:** Severity: High - Without a patching process, vulnerabilities in Docker images accumulate, increasing the risk of exploitation in running containers.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits in Docker Components:** Severity: High - While patching can't prevent zero-day exploits, a rapid Docker image patching process minimizes the window of vulnerability after disclosure.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unpatched Docker Image Vulnerabilities: High Impact - Significantly reduces the risk of long-term unpatched vulnerabilities within Docker containers.
    *   Zero-Day Exploits in Docker Components: Medium Impact - Reduces the exposure window to newly disclosed exploits affecting components within Docker images.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Automated Docker image rebuilds are triggered by base image updates for some backend services, but not fully integrated with vulnerability scan results.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to fully automate Docker image rebuilds based on vulnerability scan results. Implement a more robust patching schedule for Docker images and extend automation to all services (frontend and backend Docker images).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Docker Content Trust (Image Signing and Verification)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_docker_content_trust__image_signing_and_verification_.md)

### 4. Utilize Docker Content Trust (Image Signing and Verification)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Docker Content Trust (Image Signing and Verification)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Enable Docker Content Trust (DCT):** Enable DCT on your private Docker registry and on Docker clients used for pulling images in your environments. This requires setting up a trust infrastructure, often involving a Notary server.
    *   **Step 2: Configure Docker Signing Keys:** Generate and securely manage signing keys for authorized Docker image publishers within your organization.
    *   **Step 3: Integrate Docker Image Signing into CI/CD:** Integrate Docker image signing as a step in your CI/CD pipeline, immediately after successful Docker image builds and before pushing to the registry.
    *   **Step 4: Enforce Docker Signature Verification:** Configure Docker clients in all environments (development, staging, production) to *enforce* signature verification when pulling Docker images from the registry. This ensures only signed Docker images from trusted publishers are used.
    *   **Step 5: Regularly Rotate Docker Signing Keys:** Implement a process for regularly rotating Docker image signing keys to minimize the impact if a key is compromised.
    *   **Step 6: Monitor Docker Signing and Verification:** Monitor the Docker image signing and verification processes to detect any failures, anomalies, or attempts to bypass signature verification.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Malicious Docker Images:** Severity: High - Prevents the use of tampered or malicious Docker images injected into your supply chain by ensuring image authenticity and integrity.
    *   **Unauthorized Docker Image Modifications:** Severity: High - Ensures the integrity of Docker images in your registry by preventing unauthorized modifications after they are signed by trusted publishers.
    *   **Accidental Deployment of Untrusted Docker Images:** Severity: Medium - Reduces the risk of accidentally deploying Docker images from untrusted or unknown sources by enforcing verification.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Supply Chain Attacks via Malicious Docker Images: High Impact - Significantly reduces the risk of supply chain attacks targeting your Docker image pipeline.
    *   Unauthorized Docker Image Modifications: High Impact - Ensures the integrity and provenance of Docker images, preventing tampering.
    *   Accidental Deployment of Untrusted Docker Images: Medium Impact - Minimizes the risk of deploying unintended or compromised Docker images.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Docker Content Trust for image signing and verification is not currently implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to implement Docker Content Trust for our private Docker registry, integrate signing into the CI/CD pipeline for Docker images, and configure Docker clients to enforce signature verification across all environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Apply Resource Limits to Docker Containers](./mitigation_strategies/apply_resource_limits_to_docker_containers.md)

### 5. Apply Resource Limits to Docker Containers

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Apply Resource Limits to Docker Containers

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Analyze Docker Container Resource Needs:** Analyze the typical resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk I/O) of each Docker containerized application under normal and peak load conditions.
    *   **Step 2: Define Docker Resource Limits:** Set appropriate resource limits for Docker containers using Docker's built-in resource constraints (`--cpu`, `--memory`, `--memory-swap`, `--blkio-weight`) when running containers (e.g., in `docker run` commands or `docker-compose.yml` files).
    *   **Step 3: Monitor Docker Container Resource Usage:** Implement monitoring of Docker container resource usage in production environments to ensure defined limits are effective and not causing performance bottlenecks or application instability.
    *   **Step 4: Adjust Docker Resource Limits:** Based on monitoring data and application performance requirements, adjust Docker container resource limits as needed to optimize resource allocation and prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   **Step 5: Implement Docker Resource Quotas (Optional):** In multi-tenant Docker environments or when using orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, consider implementing resource quotas at the Docker host or namespace level to limit overall resource consumption by groups of Docker containers.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Docker Container Denial of Service (DoS):** Severity: High - A compromised or misbehaving Docker container can consume excessive resources, leading to DoS for other containers running on the same Docker host or even the host itself.
    *   **Docker Container Resource Starvation:** Severity: Medium - One Docker container consuming excessive resources can starve other containers of resources, degrading their performance and availability within the Docker environment.
    *   **Indirect Docker Container Escape (Resource Exhaustion):** Severity: Low - In extreme scenarios, resource exhaustion within a Docker container could potentially contribute to conditions that might be exploited for container escape vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Docker Container Denial of Service (DoS): High Impact - Significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks originating from within Docker containers due to uncontrolled resource consumption.
    *   Docker Container Resource Starvation: Medium Impact - Prevents resource starvation among Docker containers, ensuring fairer resource allocation and more stable performance.
    *   Indirect Docker Container Escape (Resource Exhaustion): Low Impact - Minimally reduces the indirect risk of Docker container escape related to resource exhaustion scenarios.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Resource limits are defined in `docker-compose.yml` files for most services, primarily memory and CPU.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Resource limits are not consistently applied to all Docker containers. Need to review and enforce resource limits for all containers, including background tasks and utility containers. Consider implementing Docker resource quotas at the host level for better overall resource management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Run Docker Containers with a Non-Root User](./mitigation_strategies/run_docker_containers_with_a_non-root_user.md)

### 6. Run Docker Containers with a Non-Root User

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Run Docker Containers with a Non-Root User

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Create a Non-Root User in Dockerfile:** Modify Dockerfiles to include instructions for creating a dedicated non-root user and group within the Docker image (e.g., using `RUN adduser -D myuser` in the Dockerfile).
    *   **Step 2: Set Docker File Ownership:** Ensure that application files and directories within the Docker image are owned by the newly created non-root user and group. Use `RUN chown -R myuser:mygroup /app` in the Dockerfile to set correct ownership.
    *   **Step 3: Use Docker `USER` Instruction:** Add the `USER myuser` instruction in the Dockerfile to switch the user context for all subsequent commands and the container's entrypoint to the non-root user.
    *   **Step 4: Verify Docker Non-Root Execution:** After building the Docker image and running a container, verify that the container processes are indeed running as the non-root user. Use `docker exec -it <container_id> whoami` to check the current user inside the running Docker container.
    *   **Step 5: Address Docker Permission Issues:**  Resolve any permission issues that arise from running as a non-root user within Docker containers. This might involve adjusting file permissions, volume mounts, or network port binding configurations to accommodate non-root execution.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Docker Container Escape to Host Root Access:** Severity: High - Running Docker containers as root significantly increases the severity of container escape vulnerabilities, potentially leading to full root access on the underlying Docker host system if an escape occurs.
    *   **Docker Privilege Escalation within Container:** Severity: Medium - If a process within a root-running Docker container is compromised, attackers inherently have root privileges *inside* the container, making privilege escalation and further malicious actions easier within the Docker environment.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Docker Container Escape to Host Root Access: High Impact - Dramatically reduces the potential impact of Docker container escape vulnerabilities by limiting the privileges an attacker gains on the host system after a successful escape.
    *   Docker Privilege Escalation within Container: Medium Impact - Makes privilege escalation within a compromised Docker container significantly more difficult, limiting the attacker's capabilities inside the container.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Most backend services are configured to run as non-root users within Docker containers.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Some older services and utility Docker containers might still be running as root. Need to audit all Dockerfiles and ensure all containers are configured to run as non-root users. Frontend Docker containers also need to be reviewed and transitioned to non-root execution.
