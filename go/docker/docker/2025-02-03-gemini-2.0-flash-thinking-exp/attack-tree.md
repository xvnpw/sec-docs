## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Docker Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_via_docker_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the root goal of the attacker. Success means compromising the application and potentially the underlying infrastructure by exploiting Docker-related weaknesses.
*   **Attack Vectors (Summarized from Sub-Tree):**
    *   Compromising the Docker Daemon.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in container base images.
    *   Exploiting Docker Socket Mounting misconfigurations.
    *   Exploiting insufficient resource limits.
    *   Exploiting weak network isolation (exposed ports).
    *   Exploiting volume and bind mount vulnerabilities.
    *   Exploiting privileged containers.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Docker Daemon [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path___critical_node__compromise_docker_daemon__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining control of the Docker daemon is a critical escalation point. It allows the attacker to control all containers and potentially the host system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Docker Daemon API Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Unauthenticated API Access -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Expose Docker API without Authentication**
            *   **Attack:** Exposing the Docker API (e.g., port 2375) without authentication.
            *   **Likelihood:** High
            *   **Impact:** Critical
            *   **Actionable Insight:** Never expose the Docker API without strong authentication (TLS and client certificates).
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Docker Daemon Software Vulnerabilities -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Known CVEs in Docker Engine (daemon process)**
        *   **Attack:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in outdated Docker Engine versions.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Critical
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Keep Docker Engine updated to the latest stable version and apply security patches regularly.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Vulnerable Base Images [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path___critical_node__vulnerable_base_images__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Using base images with vulnerabilities introduces weaknesses from the very foundation of the container.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Outdated Software in Base Image -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Use Base Images with Known Vulnerabilities (OS packages, libraries)**
        *   **Attack:** Base images containing outdated OS packages and libraries with known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Medium-High
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Regularly update base images, use minimal images, and perform vulnerability scanning on base images.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Docker Socket Mounting Vulnerabilities -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Mount Docker Socket Inside Container and Abuse Privileges**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__docker_socket_mounting_vulnerabilities_-__high-risk_path__mount_docker_socket_insid_dc6794df.md)

*   **Attack:** Mounting the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) inside a container.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Actionable Insight:** Avoid mounting the Docker socket inside containers unless absolutely necessary. If required, implement strict access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insufficient Resource Limits -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Container Resource Exhaustion leading to DoS (Denial of Service)**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__insufficient_resource_limits_-__high-risk_path__container_resource_exhaustion_leadi_03f21b96.md)

*   **Attack:** Lack of resource limits allowing a container to consume excessive resources.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Actionable Insight:** Define resource limits (CPU, memory) for containers to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Weak Network Isolation [CRITICAL NODE] -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exposed Container Ports -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Unnecessarily Expose Container Ports to Host or External Networks**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path___critical_node__weak_network_isolation__critical_node__-__high-risk_path__exposed_c_2ba56ae0.md)

*   **Attack:** Unnecessarily exposing container ports to the host or external networks.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Actionable Insight:** Only expose necessary ports. Use Docker's port mapping carefully and minimize external exposure.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Volume and Bind Mount Vulnerabilities**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__volume_and_bind_mount_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Host File System Access via Bind Mounts -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Gain Unauthorized Access to Host Files via Misconfigured Bind Mounts**
        *   **Attack:** Misconfigured bind mounts granting excessive host file system access.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium-High
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Minimize bind mount usage, restrict mounted directories, and use read-only mounts where possible.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Volume Data Leakage -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Sensitive Data Persisted in Docker Volumes without Proper Security**
        *   **Attack:** Sensitive data in Docker volumes without proper security.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium-High
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Secure Docker volumes, implement access controls, and consider volume encryption for sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Privileged Containers -> [HIGH-RISK PATH] Run Containers in Privileged Mode, Bypassing Isolation and Security Features**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__privileged_containers_-__high-risk_path__run_containers_in_privileged_mode__bypassi_a61de2d8.md)

*   **Attack:** Running containers in privileged mode.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Actionable Insight:** Avoid running privileged containers in production. Use less privileged alternatives whenever possible.
