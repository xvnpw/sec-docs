# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for docker/docker

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Scan Docker Images for Vulnerabilities using Docker Scan](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_scan_docker_images_for_vulnerabilities_using_docker_scan.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize `docker scan` command** (available with Docker Desktop and Docker Hub integration) in your CI/CD pipeline. This command leverages vulnerability databases to analyze Docker images for known vulnerabilities.
    2.  **Configure scan severity thresholds.**  Set thresholds (e.g., fail on "critical" or "high" vulnerabilities) to automatically fail builds or trigger alerts based on scan results.
    3.  **Review `docker scan` output.** Developers should examine the scan results, understand identified vulnerabilities, and prioritize remediation.
    4.  **Remediate vulnerabilities** by:
        *   Updating base images to patched versions.
        *   Updating vulnerable packages within the image.
        *   Applying necessary patches or workarounds.
    5.  **Rebuild and rescan images** after remediation using `docker scan` to verify vulnerability resolution.
    6.  **Schedule regular scans** of images in your Docker registry using `docker scan` or integrated registry scanning features to detect newly disclosed vulnerabilities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable Base Images:** Severity: High - Using outdated or vulnerable base images can introduce known security flaws into your containers.
    *   **Vulnerable Application Dependencies:** Severity: High - Vulnerabilities in libraries and packages included in your application image can be exploited.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Known Vulnerabilities):** Severity: Medium - Helps detect known vulnerabilities introduced through compromised upstream components.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerable Base Images:** High Risk Reduction - Proactively identifies and allows patching of base image vulnerabilities before deployment using Docker's built-in scanning capabilities.
    *   **Vulnerable Application Dependencies:** High Risk Reduction - Identifies and allows patching of application dependency vulnerabilities before deployment using Docker's scanning tools.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Known Vulnerabilities):** Medium Risk Reduction -  Docker Scan helps detect *known* vulnerabilities from supply chain issues, improving awareness and response.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Basic image building in CI, but `docker scan` is not integrated into the pipeline.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Integrate `docker scan` command into the CI/CD pipeline for automated vulnerability scanning of Docker images.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Resource Limits for Containers using Docker Runtime Flags](./mitigation_strategies/implement_resource_limits_for_containers_using_docker_runtime_flags.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define resource requirements** (CPU, memory, PIDs) for each containerized application based on application needs and expected load.
    2.  **Utilize Docker runtime flags** when running containers (e.g., `docker run --cpu-shares`, `docker run --memory`, `docker run --pids-limit`).
    3.  **Set appropriate limits** using these flags based on defined resource requirements. Start with conservative limits and adjust based on monitoring and performance testing.
    4.  **Monitor container resource usage** using Docker commands (`docker stats`) or monitoring tools to ensure limits are effective and not causing performance issues. Adjust limits as needed.
    5.  **Document resource limits** for each containerized application for maintainability and future adjustments.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Severity: High - A compromised or misbehaving container can consume excessive resources, leading to DoS for other containers or the host system.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Severity: Medium - Uncontrolled resource consumption by one container can starve other containers of resources, impacting application performance and stability.
    *   **"Noisy Neighbor" Problem:** Severity: Medium - One container's excessive resource usage can negatively impact the performance of other containers sharing the same host.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** High Risk Reduction - Docker resource limits prevent a single container from monopolizing resources and causing a DoS.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** High Risk Reduction - Docker limits ensure fair resource allocation and prevent resource starvation for other containers.
    *   **"Noisy Neighbor" Problem:** Medium Risk Reduction - Docker limits mitigate the "noisy neighbor" effect by controlling resource impact of individual containers.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Resource limits are sometimes set manually for specific containers, but not consistently or automatically.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Standardize the use of Docker runtime flags for resource limits across all container deployments, ideally managed through infrastructure-as-code or container orchestration configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Docker Daemon Socket Access and Use Docker API over TLS](./mitigation_strategies/secure_docker_daemon_socket_access_and_use_docker_api_over_tls.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict access to the Docker daemon socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`).** Avoid mounting it directly into containers unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
    2.  **Configure Docker daemon to listen on a TCP port with TLS enabled.** Modify Docker daemon configuration (`daemon.json`) to enable TLS and specify certificates for secure communication.
    3.  **Use the Docker API over TLS** for container management from remote clients or within containers when needed. Use `docker --tlsverify --tlscacert=ca.pem --tlscert=cert.pem --tlskey=key.pem -H tcp://<host>:<port> <command>` to connect securely.
    4.  **Implement client certificate authentication** for Docker API access. Generate and distribute client certificates to authorized users or systems.
    5.  **Restrict network access to the Docker API port** using firewall rules. Only allow authorized networks or IP addresses to connect to the Docker API port.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Host System Compromise via Docker Socket:** Severity: Critical - Direct access to the Docker socket from a container allows for trivial container escape and full control over the host system.
    *   **Unauthorized Container Management:** Severity: High - Unsecured Docker API access allows unauthorized users or services to manage containers, potentially leading to malicious actions.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Docker API):** Severity: Medium - Unencrypted Docker API communication is vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Host System Compromise via Docker Socket:** High Risk Reduction - Eliminates the most direct path to host compromise by restricting socket access and promoting secure API usage.
    *   **Unauthorized Container Management:** High Risk Reduction - Prevents unauthorized manipulation of containers by securing Docker API access with TLS and authentication.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Docker API):** Medium Risk Reduction - TLS encryption protects Docker API communication from eavesdropping and tampering.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Direct socket mounting is generally avoided, but Docker API is not consistently secured with TLS and client certificates.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Enforce strict prohibition of direct Docker socket mounting. Implement Docker daemon TLS authentication and client certificate-based access control for all Docker API interactions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Docker Content Trust (Image Signing)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_docker_content_trust__image_signing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Docker Content Trust.** Set the `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` environment variable on Docker clients and configure Docker Hub or a private registry to enforce content trust.
    2.  **Sign Docker images** during the image build and push process using Docker Content Trust signing keys. Use `docker trust sign <image_name>` after pushing an image.
    3.  **Verify image signatures** during image pull operations. Docker will automatically verify signatures if Content Trust is enabled and reject images without valid signatures.
    4.  **Manage signing keys securely.** Protect private signing keys and control access to them to prevent unauthorized image signing.
    5.  **Establish a process for key rotation and revocation** in case of key compromise.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Image Tampering:** Severity: High - Malicious actors could tamper with Docker images in transit or in registries, injecting malware or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Image Provenance Issues:** Severity: Medium - Difficulty in verifying the origin and integrity of Docker images without content trust.
    *   **"Pulling from Unknown Sources":** Severity: Medium - Risk of pulling and deploying compromised images from untrusted or compromised registries.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Image Tampering:** High Risk Reduction - Docker Content Trust ensures image integrity by verifying signatures, preventing deployment of tampered images.
    *   **Image Provenance Issues:** Medium Risk Reduction - Provides a mechanism to verify the publisher and integrity of Docker images, improving trust and accountability.
    *   **"Pulling from Unknown Sources":** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of deploying compromised images by enforcing signature verification and allowing trust in signed images only.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Docker Content Trust is not currently enabled or used in the project.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Enable Docker Content Trust across all Docker environments (clients and registries). Implement image signing in the CI/CD pipeline and enforce signature verification during image pulls.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Isolate Container Networks using Docker Networking Features](./mitigation_strategies/isolate_container_networks_using_docker_networking_features.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Docker networks** to isolate containers from each other and from the host network. Create custom Docker networks using `docker network create` for different application components or environments.
    2.  **Avoid using the default `bridge` network** for production environments. Custom networks offer better isolation and control.
    3.  **Connect containers to specific networks** using the `--network` flag in `docker run` or in Docker Compose files.
    4.  **Use network types appropriate for isolation needs.** Consider `bridge` networks for isolated groups of containers, `overlay` networks for multi-host environments, or `macvlan` networks for direct host network access when needed.
    5.  **Implement network segmentation** by placing different application tiers or environments on separate Docker networks.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Severity: High - In a flat network, a compromised container can easily communicate with and potentially compromise other containers on the same network.
    *   **Unnecessary Network Exposure:** Severity: Medium - Containers on the default bridge network might be unnecessarily exposed to each other and the host network, increasing the attack surface.
    *   **Network Broadcast/Multicast Issues:** Severity: Low - Default bridge networks can sometimes have broadcast/multicast traffic issues that custom networks can mitigate.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Lateral Movement:** High Risk Reduction - Docker networks limit lateral movement by isolating containers and restricting network communication paths.
    *   **Unnecessary Network Exposure:** Medium Risk Reduction - Custom Docker networks reduce unnecessary network exposure by providing more controlled network environments.
    *   **Network Broadcast/Multicast Issues:** Low Risk Reduction - Custom networks can improve network stability and reduce potential broadcast/multicast related issues.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Custom Docker networks are used in some deployments, but not consistently across all applications. Default bridge network is still used in some cases.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Standardize the use of custom Docker networks for all deployments. Review existing deployments and migrate applications from the default bridge network to appropriate custom networks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Docker Secrets for Secret Management](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_docker_secrets_for_secret_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `docker secret create` command** to create Docker secrets from files or standard input. Store sensitive data (passwords, API keys, certificates) as Docker secrets.
    2.  **Grant container access to secrets** using the `--secret` flag in `docker run` or in Docker Compose files.
    3.  **Access secrets within containers** as files mounted in `/run/secrets/`. Applications should read secrets from these files instead of environment variables or hardcoding.
    4.  **Manage secret lifecycle using Docker secret commands** (`docker secret inspect`, `docker secret rm`).
    5.  **Consider using Docker Swarm mode** for enhanced secret management features like secret rotation and access control (if applicable to your infrastructure).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Secrets Exposure in Images:** Severity: High - Embedding secrets in Docker images or environment variables makes them easily accessible if the image is compromised or inadvertently exposed.
    *   **Secrets in Logs/History:** Severity: Medium - Secrets in environment variables can be logged or stored in command history, increasing the risk of exposure.
    *   **Difficult Secret Rotation:** Severity: Medium - Managing and rotating secrets embedded in images or environment variables is complex and error-prone.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Secrets Exposure in Images:** High Risk Reduction - Docker Secrets prevent secrets from being embedded in images, significantly reducing exposure risk.
    *   **Secrets in Logs/History:** Medium Risk Reduction - Docker Secrets avoid using environment variables, reducing the risk of secrets appearing in logs or command history.
    *   **Difficult Secret Rotation:** Medium Risk Reduction - Docker Secrets provide a mechanism for managing and potentially rotating secrets more effectively (especially with Swarm mode).

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Secrets are currently managed through environment variables or configuration files within images. Docker Secrets are not used.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement Docker Secrets for managing sensitive data across all containerized applications. Migrate existing applications to use Docker Secrets instead of environment variables or embedded secrets.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Docker Daemon TLS Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/enable_docker_daemon_tls_authentication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate TLS certificates and keys** for the Docker daemon and clients. Use a certificate authority (CA) or self-signed certificates.
    2.  **Configure Docker daemon for TLS authentication.** Modify Docker daemon configuration (`daemon.json`) to enable TLS verification, specify CA certificate, server certificate, and server key.
    3.  **Configure Docker clients for TLS authentication.** Use `--tlsverify`, `--tlscacert`, `--tlscert`, and `--tlskey` flags with Docker client commands or set environment variables (`DOCKER_TLSVERIFY`, `DOCKER_TLSCA`, `DOCKER_CERT_PATH`).
    4.  **Distribute client certificates securely** to authorized users and systems that need to interact with the Docker daemon.
    5.  **Regularly rotate TLS certificates** to maintain security and limit the impact of potential certificate compromise.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Docker Daemon Access:** Severity: High - Without TLS authentication, anyone with network access to the Docker daemon port can potentially control the Docker host.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Docker Daemon Communication):** Severity: Medium - Unencrypted communication with the Docker daemon is vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Docker Daemon Access:** High Risk Reduction - Docker Daemon TLS authentication prevents unauthorized access by requiring valid client certificates.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Docker Daemon Communication):** Medium Risk Reduction - TLS encryption protects communication between Docker clients and the daemon from eavesdropping and tampering.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Docker daemon communication is currently unencrypted and without TLS authentication.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Enable Docker Daemon TLS authentication across all Docker environments. Implement certificate generation, distribution, and rotation processes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Docker Swarm (if applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__for_docker_swarm__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Docker Swarm mode** if you are using Docker in a clustered environment. Docker Swarm provides built-in RBAC features.
    2.  **Define roles and permissions** within Docker Swarm RBAC. Create roles with specific permissions for managing services, secrets, networks, and other Docker resources.
    3.  **Assign roles to users and teams** based on their responsibilities and the principle of least privilege.
    4.  **Utilize Docker Swarm RBAC commands** (`docker role`, `docker grant`, `docker revoke`) to manage roles and permissions.
    5.  **Regularly review and audit RBAC configurations** to ensure they are up-to-date and effectively controlling access to Docker resources.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Docker Resources:** Severity: High - Without RBAC, all users with access to the Docker daemon might have excessive privileges, leading to accidental or malicious misconfiguration or breaches.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Severity: Medium - Lack of granular access control can make privilege escalation easier for malicious actors.
    *   **Lack of Auditability:** Severity: Low - Without RBAC, it's harder to track and audit who performed what actions within the Docker environment.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Docker Resources:** High Risk Reduction - Docker Swarm RBAC restricts access to Docker resources based on roles and permissions, preventing unauthorized actions.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Medium Risk Reduction - RBAC makes privilege escalation more difficult by enforcing granular access control.
    *   **Lack of Auditability:** Low Risk Reduction - RBAC improves auditability by providing a framework for tracking user actions and access to Docker resources.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable - Project is not currently using Docker Swarm mode or RBAC features.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  If considering Docker Swarm for container orchestration, implement Docker Swarm RBAC to manage access control within the Swarm cluster.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Docker Engine](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_docker_engine.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a schedule for regular Docker Engine updates.** Follow Docker's release cycle and security advisories.
    2.  **Monitor Docker security advisories** and release notes for information on security patches and vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Test Docker Engine updates in a non-production environment** before deploying to production. Verify compatibility and functionality after updates.
    4.  **Automate Docker Engine updates** where possible using package managers or configuration management tools.
    5.  **Document the Docker Engine update process** and maintain a record of Docker Engine versions used in different environments.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Docker Engine Vulnerabilities:** Severity: High - Outdated Docker Engine versions may contain known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Delayed Patching):** Severity: Medium - Delaying Docker Engine updates increases the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities before patches are applied.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Docker Engine Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction - Regularly updating Docker Engine patches known vulnerabilities, reducing the attack surface.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Delayed Patching):** Medium Risk Reduction - Timely updates minimize the exposure window to zero-day vulnerabilities by applying patches as soon as they are available.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Docker Engine updates are performed occasionally, but not on a regular, scheduled basis.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement a scheduled and automated process for regularly updating Docker Engine across all environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Apply Security Profiles (AppArmor or SELinux) to Docker Containers](./mitigation_strategies/apply_security_profiles__apparmor_or_selinux__to_docker_containers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable AppArmor or SELinux on the Docker host operating system.** Ensure the chosen security module is properly configured and running.
    2.  **Utilize Docker's security profile options** when running containers (`docker run --security-opt apparmor=<profile_name>` or `--security-opt label=level:<level>`).
    3.  **Apply default Docker security profiles** (e.g., `docker-default` for AppArmor) to containers to provide a baseline level of confinement.
    4.  **Create custom security profiles** tailored to the specific needs of your applications for more granular control over container capabilities and system calls.
    5.  **Test security profiles thoroughly** to ensure they don't interfere with application functionality while providing effective security confinement.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Container Escape Vulnerabilities:** Severity: High - Security profiles can limit the impact of container escape vulnerabilities by restricting container capabilities and system calls, making it harder for attackers to gain host access.
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Container:** Severity: Medium - Security profiles can restrict actions within the container, making privilege escalation more difficult.
    *   **Host System Damage from Compromised Container:** Severity: Medium - Security profiles can limit the damage a compromised container can inflict on the host system by restricting its access to host resources and system calls.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Container Escape Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction - Docker security profiles significantly reduce the impact of container escape vulnerabilities by limiting attacker capabilities after escape.
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Container:** Medium Risk Reduction - Security profiles make privilege escalation within the container more challenging.
    *   **Host System Damage from Compromised Container:** Medium Risk Reduction - Security profiles limit the potential damage a compromised container can cause to the host system.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Security profiles (AppArmor or SELinux) are not currently actively applied to Docker containers.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Enable and configure AppArmor or SELinux on Docker hosts. Implement the use of Docker security profiles, starting with default profiles and progressing to custom profiles for specific applications.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Kernel Namespaces and Cgroups (Ensure Docker Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/enable_kernel_namespaces_and_cgroups__ensure_docker_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify Docker daemon configuration** to ensure that kernel namespaces (PID, network, mount, IPC, UTS, user) and cgroups are enabled and utilized. These are fundamental isolation features of Docker.
    2.  **Check Docker daemon info** (`docker info`) to confirm that namespaces and cgroups are properly configured and supported by the kernel.
    3.  **Ensure the Docker host kernel** supports the required namespaces and cgroups features. Update the kernel if necessary.
    4.  **Avoid disabling namespaces or cgroups** in Docker configurations unless there is a very specific and well-justified reason. Disabling them significantly weakens container isolation.
    5.  **Monitor Docker host and container resource usage** to ensure cgroups are functioning correctly and enforcing resource limits.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Container Breakout (Namespace/Cgroup Vulnerabilities):** Severity: Critical - If namespaces or cgroups are not properly enabled or are vulnerable, containers might be able to break out of their isolation and access host resources or other containers.
    *   **Resource Interference between Containers:** Severity: Medium - Without cgroups, containers might not be properly isolated in terms of resource usage, leading to resource contention and "noisy neighbor" problems.
    *   **Security Feature Bypass:** Severity: Medium - Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in namespace or cgroup implementation can potentially be exploited to bypass other security mechanisms.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Container Breakout (Namespace/Cgroup Vulnerabilities):** High Risk Reduction - Ensuring namespaces and cgroups are enabled and properly configured is fundamental to container isolation and prevents basic container breakout scenarios.
    *   **Resource Interference between Containers:** Medium Risk Reduction - Cgroups enforce resource isolation, preventing resource contention and improving container stability and performance.
    *   **Security Feature Bypass:** Medium Risk Reduction - Proper namespace and cgroup configuration strengthens the overall security posture and reduces the risk of bypassing other security features.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Kernel namespaces and cgroups are fundamental to Docker and are enabled by default in standard Docker installations.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Regularly verify Docker daemon configuration and host kernel to ensure namespaces and cgroups remain enabled and properly functioning. Monitor for any configuration drift or kernel updates that might impact these features.
