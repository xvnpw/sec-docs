Objective: Compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Docker environment it relies on.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**Objective:** Compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Docker environment it relies on.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree and Critical Nodes:**

Compromise Application via Docker Weaknesses [ROOT GOAL]
*   OR: Exploit Docker Daemon Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   AND: Gain Access to Docker Daemon [CRITICAL NODE]
        *   OR: Exploit Unprotected Docker Socket (L: High, I: Critical, E: Low, S: Low, DD: Low) [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   AND: Execute Malicious Commands on Host (L: High, I: Critical, E: Low, S: Low, DD: Low) [HIGH-RISK PATH]
*   OR: Exploit Container Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    *   AND: Gain Access to a Container [CRITICAL NODE]
        *   OR: Exploit Misconfigurations in Container Definition [HIGH-RISK PATH]
            *   OR: Privileged Containers (L: Medium, I: Critical, E: Low, S: Low, DD: Low) [CRITICAL NODE]
*   OR: Exploit Image-Related Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    *   AND: Introduce Malicious Content into an Image [CRITICAL NODE]
        *   OR: Compromise the Image Registry [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
        *   OR: Pull a Publicly Available Malicious Image (L: Medium, I: High, E: Low, S: Low, DD: Low) [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    *   AND: Deploy the Compromised Image (L: High, I: Critical, E: N/A, S: N/A, DD: Low) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Docker Daemon Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_docker_daemon_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Gain Access to Docker Daemon [CRITICAL NODE]:**  This is a critical point as control over the Docker Daemon grants extensive privileges, allowing attackers to manage containers, images, and potentially the host system.
    *   **Exploit Unprotected Docker Socket [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If the Docker Daemon's Unix socket is exposed without proper authentication (like TLS), any process or user with access to this socket can issue commands to the Docker Daemon. This is a direct and easily exploitable vulnerability.
        *   **Impact:** Complete control over the Docker environment, including the ability to create, start, stop, and remove containers, pull and push images, and potentially execute commands on the host system.
*   **Execute Malicious Commands on Host [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Once access to the Docker Daemon is gained, attackers can use commands like `docker exec` or `docker run` with volume mounts to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying host operating system.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the host system, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and further lateral movement within the infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Container Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_container_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Gain Access to a Container [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Compromising a container provides a foothold within the application environment, allowing attackers to interact with the application, access data, and potentially escalate privileges.
    *   **Exploit Misconfigurations in Container Definition [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Privileged Containers [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Running a container with the `--privileged` flag grants it almost all capabilities of the host kernel, bypassing many security restrictions.
            *   **Impact:**  Easy container escape, direct access to the host system, and the ability to perform actions that would normally require root privileges on the host.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image-Related Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image-related_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Introduce Malicious Content into an Image [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Manipulating Docker images allows attackers to inject malicious code that will be executed when the image is run.
    *   **Compromise the Image Registry [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If the Docker image registry is compromised (e.g., through stolen credentials or software vulnerabilities), attackers can push malicious images or modify existing trusted images.
        *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise as developers and systems pull and run these malicious images, potentially affecting numerous applications and environments.
    *   **Pull a Publicly Available Malicious Image [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Developers might unknowingly pull and use publicly available Docker images from untrusted sources that contain malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.
        *   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the application environment, potentially leading to data theft, service disruption, or further exploitation.
*   **Deploy the Compromised Image [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Once a malicious image exists, deploying it to the application environment results in the execution of the injected malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**  Direct compromise of the application, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and unauthorized access to sensitive information. This is the culmination of the image-based attack path.
