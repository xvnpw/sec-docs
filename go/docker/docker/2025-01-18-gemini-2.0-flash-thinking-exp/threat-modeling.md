# Threat Model Analysis for docker/docker

## Threat: [Vulnerable Base Image Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_base_image_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits known vulnerabilities present in the base image used to build the container. This could involve injecting malicious code, gaining shell access within the container, or escalating privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Container compromise, potential data breach if the container has access to sensitive information, denial of service if the vulnerability leads to container instability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docker Image Layers, specifically the layers inherited from the base image.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update base images to the latest stable versions.
        *   Use minimal base images that contain only necessary components.
        *   Implement automated vulnerability scanning for Docker images during the build process and in registries.
        *   Establish a process for patching and rebuilding images when vulnerabilities are identified.

## Threat: [Malicious Image from Untrusted Registry](./threats/malicious_image_from_untrusted_registry.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious Docker image to a public or untrusted registry. A developer, either accidentally or through social engineering, pulls and runs this malicious image, introducing malware or backdoors into the application environment.
    *   **Impact:**  Container compromise, data exfiltration, introduction of malware into the infrastructure, potential supply chain attack.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docker Image Pull functionality, Docker Hub or other container registries (interaction point).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Prefer using private and trusted container registries.
        *   Verify image signatures and checksums before pulling images.
        *   Implement organizational policies regarding approved image sources.
        *   Utilize image scanning tools to analyze images before deployment.
        *   Educate developers about the risks of using untrusted registries.

## Threat: [Secrets Leaked in Docker Image](./threats/secrets_leaked_in_docker_image.md)

*   **Description:** Developers unintentionally include sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or certificates directly in the Dockerfile or during the image build process. This information becomes part of the image layers and can be extracted by attackers.
    *   **Impact:** Credential compromise, unauthorized access to external services or internal resources, potential data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dockerfile, Docker Image Layers (managed by `docker/docker`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding secrets in Dockerfiles.
        *   Utilize multi-stage builds to prevent secrets from being included in the final image.
        *   Use `.dockerignore` to exclude sensitive files and directories from the image context.
        *   Leverage secret management solutions (e.g., Docker Secrets, HashiCorp Vault) to securely manage and inject secrets into containers at runtime.

## Threat: [Container Escape via Kernel Vulnerability](./threats/container_escape_via_kernel_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the host operating system's kernel that is not properly isolated by the container runtime. This allows the attacker to break out of the container's isolation and gain access to the underlying host system.
    *   **Impact:** Full host compromise, access to sensitive data on the host, potential for lateral movement within the infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Component:** Container Runtime (e.g., `runc` - a component used by `docker/docker`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the host operating system kernel updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Utilize security profiles like AppArmor or SELinux to further restrict container capabilities.
        *   Consider using specialized container runtimes with enhanced isolation (e.g., gVisor, Kata Containers).

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion Attack on Host via Container](./threats/resource_exhaustion_attack_on_host_via_container.md)

*   **Description:** A compromised or malicious container consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) on the host system, leading to a denial of service for other containers or the host itself.
    *   **Impact:** Application instability, performance degradation, denial of service for the application and potentially other services on the same host.
    *   **Affected Component:** Container Runtime (resource management features provided by `docker/docker`), Host Operating System (impacted).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Set resource limits and quotas for containers (CPU, memory) using Docker's resource constraints.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for container resource usage.
        *   Use cgroups to enforce resource limits at the kernel level.
        *   Implement proper container orchestration to manage resource allocation and prevent resource starvation.

## Threat: [Docker Daemon Socket Hijacking](./threats/docker_daemon_socket_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Docker daemon socket (`docker.sock`), which allows them to control the Docker daemon and manage containers on the host. This can be achieved through vulnerabilities in applications that have access to the socket or through misconfigurations.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the host system, ability to create, start, stop, and remove containers, potential data breaches, and malware deployment.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docker Daemon (`dockerd` - part of `docker/docker`), Docker API, Docker Socket (`docker.sock`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to the Docker daemon socket to only authorized users and processes.
        *   Avoid exposing the Docker daemon socket directly to containers.
        *   Use TLS authentication and authorization for remote access to the Docker daemon.
        *   Consider using context-aware authorization mechanisms for Docker API access.

## Threat: [Insecure Container Configuration (Privileged Mode)](./threats/insecure_container_configuration__privileged_mode_.md)

*   **Description:** Running containers in privileged mode grants them almost all capabilities of the host operating system. If a container running in privileged mode is compromised, the attacker gains extensive control over the host.
    *   **Impact:** Full host compromise, ability to bypass security restrictions, potential for container escape and lateral movement.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docker Runtime Configuration (controlled by `docker/docker`), Container Process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using privileged mode unless absolutely necessary.
        *   If privileged mode is required, carefully assess the security implications and implement additional security measures.
        *   Explore alternative solutions that do not require privileged mode.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data via Volume Mounts](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_via_volume_mounts.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrectly configured volume mounts can expose sensitive files or directories from the host system into a container. If the container is compromised, the attacker gains access to this sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information on the host system.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docker Volume Management (feature of `docker/docker`), Container Configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when mounting volumes.
        *   Only mount necessary directories and files.
        *   Use read-only mounts where appropriate.
        *   Carefully review volume configurations and permissions.
