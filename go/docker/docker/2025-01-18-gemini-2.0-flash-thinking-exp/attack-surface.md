# Attack Surface Analysis for docker/docker

## Attack Surface: [Docker Daemon Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/docker_daemon_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Security flaws within the Docker daemon itself.
    * **How Docker Contributes:** The Docker daemon is a privileged process essential for managing containers. Exploiting vulnerabilities here grants attackers root-level access to the host.
    * **Example:** A buffer overflow in the Docker daemon's API handling allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host.
    * **Impact:** Full host compromise, data breach, denial of service, container escape.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep the Docker daemon updated to the latest stable version.
        * Regularly review and apply security patches released by Docker.
        * Implement proper access controls to the Docker daemon, limiting who can interact with it.
        * Consider using rootless Docker where applicable to reduce the impact of daemon compromise.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Docker Images](./attack_surfaces/malicious_docker_images.md)

* **Description:** Using Docker images that contain malware, vulnerabilities, or backdoors.
    * **How Docker Contributes:** Docker's image-based deployment model relies on trusting the source and content of images. Pulling and running untrusted images directly introduces this risk.
    * **Example:** Pulling a seemingly legitimate image from an untrusted registry that contains a cryptominer or a backdoor allowing remote access.
    * **Impact:** Data theft, resource hijacking, compromised application, potential for lateral movement within the infrastructure.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Only use images from trusted and verified sources (e.g., official repositories, verified publishers).
        * Implement image scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities and malware in images before deployment.
        * Use a private Docker registry with access controls and vulnerability scanning.
        * Implement content trust using Docker Content Trust to verify image publishers.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Docker Socket](./attack_surfaces/exposed_docker_socket.md)

* **Description:** Unprotected or overly permissive access to the Docker daemon's socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`).
    * **How Docker Contributes:** The Docker socket is the primary interface for controlling the Docker daemon. Granting unauthorized access provides root-level control over the Docker environment.
    * **Example:** Mounting the Docker socket into a container without proper restrictions, allowing a compromised container to create new privileged containers or manipulate existing ones.
    * **Impact:** Full host compromise, container manipulation, data access, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid mounting the Docker socket into containers unless absolutely necessary.
        * If mounting is required, use minimal privileges and consider alternative APIs like the Docker API over HTTP with TLS authentication.
        * Implement strong access controls on the host system to restrict access to the Docker socket.

## Attack Surface: [Container Escape Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/container_escape_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Flaws in the container runtime (e.g., `runc`, `containerd`) that allow a process within a container to break out of its isolation and gain access to the host system.
    * **How Docker Contributes:** Docker relies on the underlying container runtime for isolation. Vulnerabilities in this core component directly impact Docker's security.
    * **Example:** Exploiting a vulnerability in `runc` to gain root access on the host system from within a container.
    * **Impact:** Full host compromise, access to sensitive data on the host, potential for lateral movement.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep the container runtime updated with the latest security patches.
        * Utilize security profiles like AppArmor or SELinux to further restrict container capabilities.
        * Consider using sandboxed container runtimes like gVisor or Kata Containers for enhanced isolation.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Container Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_container_configurations.md)

* **Description:** Running containers with overly permissive configurations that increase the attack surface.
    * **How Docker Contributes:** Docker provides the configuration options for containers. Using insecure options directly increases the risk.
    * **Example:** Running a container in privileged mode, granting it almost all the capabilities of the host kernel.
    * **Impact:** Increased risk of container escape, access to host resources, potential for privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring container capabilities.
        * Avoid running containers in privileged mode unless absolutely necessary and with a clear understanding of the risks.
        * Set appropriate resource limits for containers to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
        * Implement security policies to enforce secure container configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Docker Networking Misconfigurations](./attack_surfaces/docker_networking_misconfigurations.md)

* **Description:** Incorrectly configured Docker networking that exposes containers unnecessarily or allows unauthorized communication.
    * **How Docker Contributes:** Docker's networking features manage how containers connect. Misconfigurations in these features directly create security vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** Exposing a container port directly to the public internet without proper security measures, allowing unauthorized access to the application running inside.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to applications, data breaches, potential for lateral movement.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Only expose necessary ports for containers.
        * Use Docker's networking features to isolate containers and control communication between them.
        * Implement network policies to restrict traffic flow based on need.
        * Consider using overlay networks for enhanced security and isolation.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks on Base Images](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_on_base_images.md)

* **Description:** Compromise of base images used to build application images, introducing vulnerabilities or malicious code early in the development process.
    * **How Docker Contributes:** Docker's layered image system relies on base images. The integrity of these base images is crucial for the security of all dependent images.
    * **Example:** A popular base image on Docker Hub is compromised, and developers unknowingly build their application images on top of it, inheriting the malicious code.
    * **Impact:** Widespread compromise of applications, introduction of backdoors, data theft.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully select and vet base images from trusted sources.
        * Regularly scan base images for vulnerabilities.
        * Consider using minimal base images to reduce the attack surface.
        * Implement a process for updating base images and rebuilding dependent application images.
