# Attack Surface Analysis for docker/docker

## Attack Surface: [High and Critical Docker Attack Surfaces - Unprotected Docker Daemon Socket](./attack_surfaces/high_and_critical_docker_attack_surfaces_-_unprotected_docker_daemon_socket.md)

*   **Description:** The Docker daemon, by default, listens on a Unix socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`). If this socket is accessible to unauthorized users or processes, it grants root-level control over the host system.
    *   **How Docker Contributes:** Docker's architecture relies on this socket for communication between the Docker client and the daemon. Its default location and permissions can be insecure if not properly managed.
    *   **Example:** A web application running on the same host as the Docker daemon has access to the socket. A vulnerability in the web application allows an attacker to send commands to the Docker daemon, potentially creating a privileged container that mounts the host's root filesystem.
    *   **Impact:** Full host compromise, including data exfiltration, malware installation, and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to the Docker socket using file system permissions (e.g., using group ownership and permissions).
        *   Avoid running containers as root user unnecessarily.
        *   Consider using a remote Docker API with TLS authentication instead of directly exposing the socket.
        *   Implement security tools and policies to monitor access to the Docker socket.

## Attack Surface: [High and Critical Docker Attack Surfaces - Exposed Remote Docker API without Proper Authentication](./attack_surfaces/high_and_critical_docker_attack_surfaces_-_exposed_remote_docker_api_without_proper_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** Configuring the Docker daemon to listen on a network interface (e.g., TCP port 2376) for remote access without strong authentication and encryption exposes the Docker API to potential attackers on the network.
    *   **How Docker Contributes:** Docker allows for remote management via its API. Misconfiguration of the API listener and authentication mechanisms creates this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A developer configures the Docker daemon to listen on a public IP address without TLS and authentication. An attacker scans the internet, finds the open port, and uses the Docker API to create and run a malicious container on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Full host compromise, similar to an unprotected socket. Attackers can manipulate containers, access sensitive data, and execute arbitrary commands on the host.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always** enable TLS authentication and authorization for the remote Docker API.
        *   Use strong certificates for both the server and client.
        *   Restrict network access to the Docker API to only authorized clients or networks (e.g., using firewalls).
        *   Consider using a VPN or an internal network for accessing the remote API.

## Attack Surface: [High and Critical Docker Attack Surfaces - Pulling and Running Untrusted Container Images](./attack_surfaces/high_and_critical_docker_attack_surfaces_-_pulling_and_running_untrusted_container_images.md)

*   **Description:** Downloading and running container images from public or unverified registries introduces the risk of executing malicious or vulnerable code within the application environment.
    *   **How Docker Contributes:** Docker's core functionality involves pulling and running images. The lack of inherent trust mechanisms in public registries creates this attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A developer pulls a seemingly legitimate image from Docker Hub, but it contains a backdoor that allows an attacker to gain remote access to the container and potentially the host.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of malicious code, data breaches, denial of service, and potential host compromise if container escapes are possible.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only pull images from trusted and verified registries.
        *   Implement image scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities before deployment.
        *   Utilize image signing and verification mechanisms (e.g., Docker Content Trust).
        *   Build custom images from trusted base images and maintain them with regular updates.
        *   Establish an internal image registry for better control over image sources.

## Attack Surface: [High and Critical Docker Attack Surfaces - Vulnerabilities in Container Base Images](./attack_surfaces/high_and_critical_docker_attack_surfaces_-_vulnerabilities_in_container_base_images.md)

*   **Description:** Base images used to build application containers often contain operating system packages and libraries with known vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Docker Contributes:** Docker relies on layered images, and vulnerabilities in the base layers are inherited by subsequent layers.
    *   **Example:** A Dockerfile uses an outdated Ubuntu base image with a known vulnerability in a core library. An attacker exploits this vulnerability within the running container.
    *   **Impact:** Potential compromise of the container and the application running within it. Depending on the vulnerability, it could lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update base images and rebuild application containers.
        *   Use minimal base images that contain only necessary components.
        *   Implement vulnerability scanning for container images during the build process and in production.
        *   Automate the process of rebuilding images when vulnerabilities are discovered in base images.

## Attack Surface: [High and Critical Docker Attack Surfaces - Secrets Embedded in Container Images](./attack_surfaces/high_and_critical_docker_attack_surfaces_-_secrets_embedded_in_container_images.md)

*   **Description:** Accidentally including sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or certificates directly in the Dockerfile or application code within the image creates a persistent vulnerability.
    *   **How Docker Contributes:** Docker images are layered, and once a secret is added to a layer, it remains there even if later removed.
    *   **Example:** A developer hardcodes an API key in the Dockerfile. Anyone with access to the image (even if not publicly available) can extract this key.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to external services or data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** embed secrets directly in Dockerfiles or application code within the image.
        *   Use Docker Secrets management for sensitive data.
        *   Utilize environment variables to pass secrets to containers at runtime.
        *   Mount secrets as files into containers using volumes.
        *   Use `.dockerignore` to exclude sensitive files from the build context.
        *   Scan images for embedded secrets during the build process.

## Attack Surface: [High and Critical Docker Attack Surfaces - Container Escape Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/high_and_critical_docker_attack_surfaces_-_container_escape_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or misconfigurations in the container runtime (containerd, runc) or the underlying kernel can potentially allow a malicious process within a container to break out of its isolation and gain access to the host system.
    *   **How Docker Contributes:** Docker relies on the container runtime for isolation. Vulnerabilities in this runtime compromise the security boundary.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in `runc` to gain root access on the host system from within a compromised container.
    *   **Impact:** Full host compromise, allowing attackers to control the host operating system, access all data, and potentially pivot to other systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Docker engine and container runtime up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Utilize security profiles (like AppArmor or Seccomp) to restrict container capabilities and system calls.
        *   Regularly audit container configurations and runtime environments.
        *   Harden the host operating system.
