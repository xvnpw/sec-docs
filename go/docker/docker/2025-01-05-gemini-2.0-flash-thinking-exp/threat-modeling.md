# Threat Model Analysis for docker/docker

## Threat: [Insecure Docker Daemon Configuration](./threats/insecure_docker_daemon_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Docker Daemon Configuration
    *   **Description:** The Docker daemon within `github.com/docker/docker` is configured insecurely, such as exposing the Docker API over TCP without TLS and authentication. Attackers can exploit this to gain full control over the Docker host, allowing them to run arbitrary commands through the Docker API, create/destroy containers managed by the Docker daemon, and access sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Docker host, potential compromise of all running containers managed by the affected Docker daemon, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `github.com/docker/docker/daemon/api`, `github.com/docker/docker/daemon/config`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never expose the Docker daemon API over TCP without strong authentication and TLS encryption.
        *   Prefer using the Unix socket for local communication.
        *   If remote access is necessary, use TLS and client certificate authentication as configured within the Docker daemon.
        *   Restrict access to the Docker daemon socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) using file system permissions.
        *   Regularly review and harden the Docker daemon configuration based on security best practices documented within the `docker/docker` project.

## Threat: [Container Escape through Containerd Vulnerabilities](./threats/container_escape_through_containerd_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Container Escape through Containerd Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the `containerd` component (which is part of the `docker/docker` architecture) can be exploited by attackers within a container to escape the container's isolation and gain access to the underlying host system. This allows them to potentially gain root privileges on the host.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Docker host, potential compromise of other containers managed by the same Docker daemon, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `github.com/containerd/containerd` (integrated within `github.com/docker/docker`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `docker/docker` installation up-to-date to ensure you have the latest versions of `containerd` with security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories for `containerd` and update Docker accordingly.
        *   Use a security-hardened operating system for the Docker host.
        *   Implement security profiles like AppArmor or SELinux, leveraging features supported by `containerd`, to further restrict container capabilities.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Docker Socket Access](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_docker_socket_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation via Docker Socket Access
    *   **Description:** A container is granted access to the Docker daemon socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) managed by `github.com/docker/docker` without proper restrictions. An attacker within the container can then use the Docker API exposed through this socket to perform privileged operations on the host, potentially gaining root access by instructing the Docker daemon to create privileged containers or execute commands on the host.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Docker host, potential compromise of other containers managed by the same Docker daemon.
    *   **Affected Component:** `github.com/docker/docker/daemon`, `github.com/docker/docker/api`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid mounting the Docker socket into containers unless absolutely necessary.
        *   If mounting is required, carefully consider the security implications and implement strict access controls.
        *   Explore alternative approaches that don't require direct socket access, such as using the Docker API over a secure network connection with proper authentication.
        *   Consider using specialized tools or patterns for managing Docker from within containers that minimize the need for direct socket access.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion Exploiting Docker's Resource Management](./threats/resource_exhaustion_exploiting_docker's_resource_management.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion Exploiting Docker's Resource Management
    *   **Description:** An attacker deploys a container that leverages vulnerabilities or weaknesses in Docker's resource management (cgroups, namespaces) within `github.com/docker/docker` to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) on the Docker host. This can lead to denial of service for other containers managed by the same Docker daemon and potentially the host system itself.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service for the application and potentially other services on the host.
    *   **Affected Component:** `github.com/docker/docker/daemon/resources`, `github.com/docker/docker/pkg/system`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, disk I/O) for containers using Docker's resource constraints (e.g., `docker run --cpus`, `--memory`).
        *   Monitor resource usage of containers and set up alerts for abnormal behavior.
        *   Utilize features within `github.com/docker/docker` to configure resource reservations and limits effectively.
        *   Consider using container orchestration platforms that provide more advanced resource management capabilities.

## Threat: [Data Exposure via Insecure Volume Handling by Docker](./threats/data_exposure_via_insecure_volume_handling_by_docker.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Exposure via Insecure Volume Handling by Docker
    *   **Description:** Docker's volume management within `github.com/docker/docker` is not configured securely, allowing unauthorized containers or processes on the host to access sensitive data stored within volumes. An attacker gaining access to a compromised container or the host could potentially read or modify data in these volumes due to insufficient access controls enforced by Docker.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, and unauthorized modification of application data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `github.com/docker/docker/volume`, `github.com/docker/docker/daemon/volumes`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to volume mount points on the host operating system using appropriate file system permissions.
        *   Consider using volume drivers that provide encryption at rest, leveraging features potentially integrated with `github.com/docker/docker`.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive data directly in volumes if possible; use dedicated secret management solutions that integrate with Docker.
        *   Regularly audit volume configurations and access permissions managed by Docker.
