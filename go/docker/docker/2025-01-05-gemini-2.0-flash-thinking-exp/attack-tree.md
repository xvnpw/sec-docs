## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Docker Image](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_docker_image.md)

Attackers can target vulnerabilities present within the Docker image itself.
    *   **Utilize Known Vulnerabilities in Base Image:** This involves exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) present in the base operating system or software packages included in the Docker image. Attackers can leverage existing exploits to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Exploit Secrets Leaked in Image Layers:**  Sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or private keys can be accidentally included in Docker image layers. Attackers can inspect the image history to extract these secrets.
    *   **Inject Malicious Code During Image Build:** Attackers can compromise the image build process to inject malicious code, backdoors, or malware into the final image. This could involve modifying Dockerfiles or compromising build dependencies.
    *   **Exploit Supply Chain Vulnerabilities in Image Dependencies:**  Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or packages included in the Docker image can be exploited. Attackers can target known vulnerabilities in these dependencies to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Docker Daemon or Runtime Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__exploit_docker_daemon_or_runtime_vulnerabilities.md)

This involves attacking the underlying Docker daemon or the container runtime environment.
    *   **Achieve Container Escape:** A successful container escape allows the attacker to break out of the isolated container environment and gain access to the host operating system.
        *   **Exploit Kernel Vulnerabilities (affecting the host OS):**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the host operating system's kernel can allow an attacker to gain root privileges on the host from within a container.
        *   **Exploit Docker Daemon Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities in the Docker daemon itself can be exploited to gain control over the daemon and potentially the host system.
        *   **Misconfigured Container Security Options (e.g., `--privileged`, excessive capabilities):**  Running containers with overly permissive security options like `--privileged` or granting excessive Linux capabilities can create pathways for container escape.
        *   **Mount Sensitive Host Paths into Container without Proper Restrictions:**  Mounting sensitive directories or files from the host into a container without proper read-only restrictions can allow attackers within the container to access and potentially modify host resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Docker API Exposure](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__exploit_docker_api_exposure.md)

The Docker API allows for managing Docker containers and images.
    *   **Access Unprotected Docker API Endpoint:** If the Docker API is exposed without proper authentication and authorization, attackers can directly interact with the API to manage containers, images, and potentially gain control over the entire Docker environment.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Docker API Itself:**  Vulnerabilities in the Docker API itself can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Abuse API Permissions (if authentication is present but weak):** Even with authentication in place, weak or easily guessable credentials or vulnerabilities in the authorization mechanisms can allow attackers to abuse API permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Misconfigurations in Application's Docker Setup](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_misconfigurations_in_application's_docker_setup.md)

This focuses on how the application is packaged and run within Docker.
    *   **Insecure Dockerfile Practices:**
        *   **Running as Root User Inside Container:** Running processes as the root user inside a container bypasses security isolation and increases the risk of privilege escalation if a vulnerability is found within the containerized application.
        *   **Exposing Unnecessary Ports:** Exposing ports that are not required for the application's functionality increases the attack surface and provides more potential entry points for attackers.
    *   **Weak Container Networking Configuration:**
        *   **Allowing Unnecessary Inter-Container Communication:** Allowing unrestricted communication between containers can enable lateral movement for attackers who have compromised one container.
        *   **Exposing Containers Directly to the Public Internet without Proper Security Measures:** Directly exposing containers to the internet without using a reverse proxy, firewall, or other security measures makes them vulnerable to a wide range of web application attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Docker Orchestration (if applicable, e.g., Docker Compose, Swarm)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_docker_orchestration__if_applicable__e_g___docker_compos_62e3cd45.md)

If the application uses orchestration tools, vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in these platforms can be exploited.
    *   **Exploit Misconfigurations in Orchestration Files (e.g., insecure volume mounts, weak secrets management):** Misconfigurations in orchestration files like Docker Compose or Swarm configuration files can introduce vulnerabilities, such as insecure volume mounts or storing secrets in plain text.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in the Orchestration Platform Itself:** Vulnerabilities in the orchestration platform (e.g., Docker Swarm, Kubernetes) can be exploited to gain control over the entire orchestrated environment.
    *   **Gain Access to Orchestration Management Interface:** If the management interface for the orchestration platform is not properly secured, attackers can gain access and control the entire cluster and its deployed applications.
