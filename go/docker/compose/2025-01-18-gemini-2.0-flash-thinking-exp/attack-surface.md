# Attack Surface Analysis for docker/compose

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Secrets in Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_secrets_in_configuration_files.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposure of Secrets in Configuration Files
    *   **Description:** Storing sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or database credentials directly within `docker-compose.yml` or `.env` files.
    *   **How Compose Contributes:** Compose reads these files to configure the environment. While it offers some mechanisms for secret management, it doesn't inherently enforce secure secret handling, and developers might fall into the trap of storing secrets directly.
    *   **Example:** A database password is hardcoded in the `environment` section of a service definition in `docker-compose.yml`. This file is committed to a public repository.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches, and potential compromise of the entire application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Docker Secrets or other dedicated secret management solutions.
        *   Avoid storing secrets directly in `docker-compose.yml` or `.env` files.
        *   Use environment variables passed at runtime or through secure secret stores.
        *   Ensure `.env` files are not committed to version control.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Volume Mounts](./attack_surfaces/insecure_volume_mounts.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Volume Mounts
    *   **Description:**  Incorrectly configuring volume mounts that expose sensitive host files or directories to containers, or allow containers to write to critical host locations.
    *   **How Compose Contributes:** The `volumes` directive in `docker-compose.yml` defines how host paths are mapped into containers. Misconfigurations here can create significant security risks.
    *   **Example:** A `docker-compose.yml` file mounts the root directory (`/`) of the host system into a container in read-write mode. A compromised container could then modify any file on the host.
    *   **Impact:**  Host system compromise, data corruption, privilege escalation, and potential takeover of the entire infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining volume mounts.
        *   Only mount necessary directories and files.
        *   Use read-only mounts whenever possible.
        *   Carefully review and understand the implications of each volume mount.

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive Network Configuration](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_network_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Overly Permissive Network Configuration
    *   **Description:** Exposing container ports unnecessarily or using insecure network configurations that allow unauthorized access.
    *   **How Compose Contributes:** Compose simplifies port mapping using the `ports` directive. Developers might expose ports without fully considering the security implications.
    *   **Example:** A database container's port is mapped to the host without any access controls, making it accessible from the public internet.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to services, data breaches, and potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in exposed services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only expose necessary ports.
        *   Use internal networks for inter-container communication.
        *   Implement firewalls or network policies to restrict access to exposed ports.
        *   Avoid mapping ports directly to the host if not required.

## Attack Surface: [Compose File Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/compose_file_manipulation.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Compose File Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker gaining access to and modifying the `docker-compose.yml` file to deploy malicious containers or alter existing configurations.
    *   **How Compose Contributes:** Compose relies on the integrity of the `docker-compose.yml` file. If this file is compromised, the entire application deployment can be manipulated.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the server hosting the `docker-compose.yml` file and modifies it to pull a malicious version of a service image.
    *   **Impact:**  Deployment of compromised applications, service disruption, data breaches, and potential takeover of the infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure access to the server or repository hosting the `docker-compose.yml` file.
        *   Implement version control and access controls for the `docker-compose.yml` file.
        *   Use infrastructure-as-code principles and automate deployments to reduce manual file manipulation.
