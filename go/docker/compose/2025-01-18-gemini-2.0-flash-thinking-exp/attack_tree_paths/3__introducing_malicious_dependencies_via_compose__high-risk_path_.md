### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Introducing Malicious Dependencies via Compose

This high-risk path highlights the inherent trust placed in the Docker images specified within the `docker-compose.yml` file. Attackers can exploit this trust to introduce malicious components into the application environment.

#### 4.1. Specify compromised or backdoored Docker images (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)

This node represents a direct and potent attack vector. By modifying the `docker-compose.yml` file, an attacker can instruct the system to pull and run malicious Docker images instead of the intended, legitimate ones.

**Mechanics of the Attack:**

*   The attacker needs to gain write access to the `docker-compose.yml` file. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    *   **Compromised developer machine:** If a developer's machine is compromised, the attacker can directly modify the file in the project repository.
    *   **Supply chain attack on development tools:**  Compromised CI/CD pipelines or other development tools could be used to inject malicious changes.
    *   **Insider threat:** A malicious insider with access to the repository could intentionally modify the file.
*   Once access is gained, the attacker replaces the legitimate image names with those of malicious images. These malicious images could be hosted on:
    *   **Public registries:** Attackers might upload backdoored images to public registries, hoping developers will mistakenly use them (e.g., through typosquatting of popular image names).
    *   **Compromised private registries:** If the organization uses a private registry, attackers might compromise it to host their malicious images.
    *   **Attacker-controlled registries:** The attacker could set up their own registry to host the malicious images.

**Impact of Using Compromised Images:**

*   **Malware Execution:** Upon container startup, the malware embedded within the malicious image will execute within the container's environment. This could involve:
    *   Establishing reverse shells to grant the attacker remote access.
    *   Stealing sensitive data from the container's environment or mounted volumes.
    *   Launching further attacks on the host system or other containers.
*   **Backdoors:** Backdoored images provide persistent remote access to the container or even the underlying host. This allows attackers to:
    *   Monitor application activity.
    *   Exfiltrate data over time.
    *   Execute arbitrary commands within the compromised environment.
*   **Vulnerabilities:** Malicious images might contain known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by other attackers or by the initial attacker at a later stage. This can lead to:
    *   Privilege escalation within the container or on the host.
    *   Denial-of-service attacks.
    *   Further compromise of the application and its infrastructure.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Secure Access to `docker-compose.yml`:** Implement strict access controls and version control for the `docker-compose.yml` file. Use code reviews and multi-factor authentication for repository access.
*   **Image Scanning:** Implement automated image scanning tools that analyze Docker images for known vulnerabilities and malware before they are deployed. Integrate this into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Use Trusted Registries:**  Preferentially use official and trusted Docker image registries. For private registries, ensure they are properly secured and regularly audited.
*   **Content Trust (Docker Content Trust):** Enable Docker Content Trust to verify the integrity and publisher of Docker images. This ensures that only signed images from trusted publishers are used.
*   **Regularly Update Base Images:** Keep the base images used in your Dockerfiles up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run containers with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a compromise.
*   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the application's Docker Compose configuration and image usage.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring systems to detect unusual container behavior that might indicate a compromise.

#### 4.2. Leverage `build` context vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)

This attack vector focuses on compromising the Docker image build process when the `build` directive is used in `docker-compose.yml`. The `build` context refers to the set of files located in the specified path that are sent to the Docker daemon during the image build.

**Mechanics of the Attack:**

*   The attacker needs to inject malicious content into the build context. This can happen through:
    *   **Compromised developer machine:** Similar to the previous attack, a compromised developer machine can lead to the injection of malicious files into the build context directory.
    *   **Supply chain attacks on dependencies:** If the build process relies on external dependencies (e.g., through package managers), attackers might compromise these dependencies to inject malicious code.
    *   **Vulnerable base images:** Using a base image with known vulnerabilities can allow attackers to exploit these vulnerabilities during the build process.
*   **Injecting malicious files or scripts:** Attackers can add malicious scripts or binaries to the build context. These can be executed during the image build process through commands in the Dockerfile.
*   **Modifying the Dockerfile:** Attackers can alter the `Dockerfile` to include malicious commands that are executed during the image build. This could involve:
    *   Downloading and executing malicious scripts from external sources.
    *   Installing backdoors or malware.
    *   Modifying application code during the build process.

**Impact of Compromised Build Context:**

*   **Compromised Docker Image:** The resulting Docker image will contain the injected malware or vulnerabilities, leading to similar consequences as using pre-built malicious images (malware execution, backdoors, vulnerabilities).
*   **Supply Chain Compromise:** This attack can compromise the entire supply chain, as the malicious image will be used in subsequent deployments.
*   **Difficult Detection:** Detecting compromises introduced during the build process can be more challenging than detecting malicious pre-built images, as the malicious code might be embedded within the image layers.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Secure the Build Environment:**  Ensure the build environment is secure and isolated. Implement access controls and regularly patch the build servers.
*   **Minimize the Build Context:** Only include necessary files in the build context to reduce the attack surface. Avoid including sensitive information directly in the build context.
*   **Use Secure Base Images:** Start your Dockerfiles with trusted and regularly updated base images from reputable sources.
*   **Multi-Stage Builds:** Utilize multi-stage builds to minimize the size of the final image and prevent unnecessary tools and dependencies from being included. This also helps to isolate the build process.
*   **Dockerfile Best Practices:** Follow Dockerfile best practices to minimize the attack surface. Avoid running unnecessary commands as root, and use specific versions for package installations.
*   **Build Secrets Management:**  Avoid hardcoding secrets in Dockerfiles. Use secure secret management solutions to inject secrets during runtime.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Security:** Secure your CI/CD pipeline to prevent unauthorized modifications to the build process and Dockerfiles. Implement code reviews and automated security checks.
*   **Image Scanning During Build:** Integrate image scanning tools into the build process to detect vulnerabilities and potential malware before the image is pushed to a registry.
*   **Regularly Audit Dockerfiles:** Review Dockerfiles for any suspicious or unnecessary commands.

### 5. Conclusion

The attack path "Introducing Malicious Dependencies via Compose" presents significant risks to applications utilizing Docker Compose. Both specifying compromised images and leveraging build context vulnerabilities can lead to severe consequences, including malware execution, backdoors, and the introduction of exploitable vulnerabilities.

By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful attacks through this vector. A layered security approach, encompassing secure access controls, image scanning, trusted registries, secure build processes, and continuous monitoring, is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of applications deployed with Docker Compose. Regular security assessments and awareness training for developers are also essential components of a robust security posture.
