# Threat Model Analysis for docker/compose

## Threat: [Secrets Exposure in `docker-compose.yml`](./threats/secrets_exposure_in__docker-compose_yml_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain access to the `docker-compose.yml` file and read hardcoded sensitive information like database credentials or API keys. This is facilitated by the direct storage of secrets within the Compose configuration.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend systems, data breaches, compromise of external services.

**Affected Compose Component:** `docker-compose.yml` file parsing and environment variable handling.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize Docker Secrets.
* Leverage environment variables from `.env` files (ensure `.env` is not committed).
* Employ dedicated secret management solutions.
* Implement access controls on the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Threat: [Insecure Image Pull from Untrusted Registry](./threats/insecure_image_pull_from_untrusted_registry.md)

**Description:** An attacker could trick developers into using a malicious Docker image referenced in `docker-compose.yml`. When `docker-compose up` or `docker-compose build` is executed, this malicious image is pulled and run.

**Impact:** Compromise of the application environment, data exfiltration, introduction of vulnerabilities, supply chain attacks.

**Affected Compose Component:** Image pulling mechanism during `docker-compose up` or `docker-compose build`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always specify image tags (including digests).
* Prefer private registries with access controls and vulnerability scanning.
* Implement image scanning in the CI/CD pipeline.
* Verify the source and integrity of public images.

## Threat: [Privileged Container Escape](./threats/privileged_container_escape.md)

**Description:** If `privileged: true` is used in `docker-compose.yml`, a compromised container could exploit vulnerabilities to escape and gain root access to the host system. Compose directly enables this privileged execution.

**Impact:** Full host compromise, access to sensitive data on the host, control over other containers.

**Affected Compose Component:** Container creation and configuration based on `docker-compose.yml`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using `privileged: true` unless absolutely necessary.
* Explore specific capabilities or AppArmor/SELinux profiles.
* Keep the Docker daemon and host kernel updated.

## Threat: [Host Path Volume Mount Vulnerability](./threats/host_path_volume_mount_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromising a container with a host path volume mount (configured in `docker-compose.yml`) could access or modify files on the host system outside the intended scope.

**Impact:** Data breaches, host system instability, privilege escalation.

**Affected Compose Component:** Volume mounting configuration in `docker-compose.yml`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully define volume mounts, granting access only to necessary data.
* Use named volumes for better isolation.
* Implement proper file system permissions on the host.

## Threat: [Compromised Host Affecting Compose](./threats/compromised_host_affecting_compose.md)

**Description:** If the host system running Docker and Docker Compose is compromised, an attacker can manipulate Compose commands or the Docker daemon to deploy malicious containers or access container data.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the application environment, data breaches, disruption of infrastructure.

**Affected Compose Component:** The Docker Compose CLI and its interaction with the Docker daemon.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Harden the host operating system.
* Keep Docker and Docker Compose up-to-date.
* Implement strong access controls and authentication for the host.
* Regularly monitor the host for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Docker Socket](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_docker_socket.md)

**Description:** If the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) is exposed to containers via a volume mount in `docker-compose.yml`, an attacker can gain root-level control over the Docker daemon.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the container environment, ability to create, modify, and destroy containers, potential access to host resources.

**Affected Compose Component:** Volume mounting configuration in `docker-compose.yml`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid mounting the Docker socket into containers unless absolutely necessary.
* If required, use alternative solutions with controlled access.
* Implement strong access controls on the Docker socket on the host.

## Threat: [Compose File Tampering Leading to Malicious Deployment](./threats/compose_file_tampering_leading_to_malicious_deployment.md)

**Description:** An attacker gaining access to the `docker-compose.yml` file can modify it to introduce malicious containers or alter configurations, leading to the deployment of a compromised application.

**Impact:** Deployment of compromised applications, data breaches, denial of service, supply chain attacks.

**Affected Compose Component:** `docker-compose up` command and its interpretation of the `docker-compose.yml` file.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access controls on the `docker-compose.yml` file.
* Use version control for `docker-compose.yml` and related files.
* Implement code review processes for changes to the `docker-compose.yml` file.
