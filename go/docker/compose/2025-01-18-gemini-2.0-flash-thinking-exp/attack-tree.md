## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploiting `docker-compose.yml` Configuration (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploiting__docker-compose_yml__configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the configuration defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Attackers who can modify or influence this file can introduce malicious settings that compromise the application.

*   **Malicious Configuration Injection (Critical Node):** This involves directly injecting harmful configurations into the `docker-compose.yml` file.
    *   **Inject malicious commands via `command` or `entrypoint` (High-Risk Path):** Attackers modify the `command` or `entrypoint` directives to execute arbitrary commands within the container. This can lead to:
        *   Data exfiltration by sending sensitive data to an external server.
        *   Installation of backdoors for persistent access.
        *   Denial-of-service attacks by consuming resources.
    *   **Mount sensitive host paths into containers (High-Risk Path):** Attackers configure volume mounts to expose sensitive directories from the host system into the container. This allows a compromised container to:
        *   Access and potentially modify critical system files in `/etc`.
        *   Read sensitive data from user home directories.
        *   Potentially escalate privileges by manipulating host files.
    *   **Define insecure environment variables (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):** Attackers introduce or modify environment variables within the `docker-compose.yml` to expose sensitive information. This can lead to:
        *   Exposure of API keys, allowing unauthorized access to external services.
        *   Disclosure of database credentials, enabling attackers to access or manipulate application data.
        *   Leaking other secrets necessary for application functionality.
*   **Supply Chain Attack on `docker-compose.yml` (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):** This involves compromising the `docker-compose.yml` file before it reaches the deployment environment.
    *   **Compromise the repository hosting `docker-compose.yml`:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the version control system (e.g., Git) where the `docker-compose.yml` is stored. This allows them to:
        *   Inject any of the malicious configurations described above.
        *   Introduce backdoors or other malicious code into the deployment process.
        *   Potentially compromise the entire application deployment pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploiting Compose's Interaction with Docker Engine (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploiting_compose's_interaction_with_docker_engine__high-risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how Docker Compose interacts with the underlying Docker Engine.

*   **Abuse Docker Socket Access (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):** This involves a misconfiguration where the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) is mounted into a container. This grants the container full control over the Docker Engine, allowing a compromised container to:
    *   Create and manage other containers, potentially with escalated privileges.
    *   Access the file system of the host machine.
    *   Potentially compromise the entire host system.
*   **Exploit vulnerabilities in the Docker Engine API (indirectly via Compose) (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):** While not a direct vulnerability in Compose itself, attackers can leverage Compose to trigger specific Docker Engine API calls that exploit known vulnerabilities in the Engine. This can lead to:
    *   Container escape, allowing the attacker to break out of the container's isolation.
    *   Host compromise by exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying Docker Engine.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Introducing Malicious Dependencies via Compose (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/3__introducing_malicious_dependencies_via_compose__high-risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path focuses on the risks associated with the Docker images used by the application, as defined in the `docker-compose.yml`.

*   **Specify compromised or backdoored Docker images (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):** Attackers modify the `docker-compose.yml` to specify malicious Docker images. These images, pulled from public or private registries, can contain:
    *   Malware that executes upon container startup.
    *   Backdoors that allow remote access to the container or the host.
    *   Vulnerabilities that can be exploited by other attackers.
*   **Leverage `build` context vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):** When using the `build` directive in `docker-compose.yml`, attackers can compromise the build context (the files used to build the Docker image). This can involve:
    *   Injecting malicious files or scripts into the build context.
    *   Modifying the Dockerfile to include malicious commands executed during the image build process.
    *   Resulting in a compromised Docker image that contains malware or vulnerabilities.
