# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for docker/compose

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit Network Definition and Segmentation](./mitigation_strategies/explicit_network_definition_and_segmentation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Service Communication:** Identify which services *must* communicate.
    2.  **Define Custom Networks:** In `docker-compose.yml`, use the `networks` top-level key. Create separate networks (e.g., `frontend_network`, `backend_network`).
    3.  **Assign Services to Networks:** In each service definition, use the `networks` key to specify the network(s).
    4.  **Use `internal: true`:** For networks not needing external access (e.g., database), set `internal: true` in the network definition.
    5.  **`expose` vs. `ports`:** Use `expose` for inter-service communication. Use `ports` sparingly, only for external access.
    6.  **Environment Isolation:** Use separate Compose files or environment variables for different environments (dev, staging, prod), with distinct networks.
    7.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review the network configuration.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Unintended Service Exposure (Severity: High)
    *   **Threat:** Lateral Movement (Severity: High)
    *   **Threat:** Data Breach (Severity: High)
    *   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintended Service Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Data Breach:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk partially reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. `backend_network` defined, but `frontend` uses the default network. `database` uses `internal: true`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Move `frontend` to `frontend_network`.
    *   Review `ports` mappings; consider `expose`.
    *   Create `docker-compose.staging.yml` with its own network.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits and Restart Policies](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_and_restart_policies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Resource Needs:** Profile your application.
    2.  **Set Limits:** In `docker-compose.yml`, use `deploy` and `resources` to set `limits` for `cpus` and `memory` for each service.
    3.  **Set Reservations (Optional):** Consider `reservations` for guaranteed resources.
    4.  **Configure Restart Policies:** Use the `restart` option (e.g., `restart: on-failure`). Avoid `restart: always` without careful consideration.
    5.  **Backoff Mechanism:** Ensure restart policies have a backoff (Docker usually handles this).
    6.  **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High)
    *   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Threat:** Container Escape (Severity: Low)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Container Escape:** Risk slightly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No resource limits. Restart policies are `restart: unless-stopped`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Add `deploy` and `resources` with CPU/memory limits.
    *   Re-evaluate `restart: unless-stopped`; consider `restart: on-failure`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Volume Mounts](./mitigation_strategies/secure_volume_mounts.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Necessary Mounts:** Determine needed host files/directories.
    2.  **Use Read-Only Mounts:** Use `:ro` (e.g., `- ./data:/app/data:ro`).
    3.  **Specific Mount Points:** Avoid mounting entire directories.
    4.  **Named Volumes (for Persistence):** Use named volumes (defined with `volumes` top-level key) if host access isn't needed.
    5.  **Avoid Sensitive Data:** Never mount directories with secrets.
    6.  **Regular Audit:** Periodically review mounts.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Host System Compromise (Severity: High)
    *   **Threat:** Data Leakage (Severity: High)
    *   **Threat:** Data Tampering (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Host System Compromise:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Data Tampering:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `web` service mounts `./html` read-write. `database` uses a named volume.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Change `web` mount to read-only if possible, or be more specific.
    *   Ensure no sensitive data in `./html`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secrets Management (Using Docker Secrets with Compose)](./mitigation_strategies/secrets_management__using_docker_secrets_with_compose_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Secrets:** List all sensitive data.
    2.  **Use Docker Secrets:**
        *   Create secrets: `docker secret create my_secret secret_file.txt`
        *   In `docker-compose.yml`, use the `secrets` key within each service:

            ```yaml
            secrets:
              - my_secret
            ```
        *   Define secrets at the top level:
            ```yaml
            secrets:
              my_secret:
                external: true
            ```
    3.  **Remove Hardcoded Secrets:** Remove secrets from `docker-compose.yml`, Dockerfiles, and code.
    4.  **Access Secrets in Code:** Access secrets from `/run/secrets/my_secret` within the container.
    5.  **Rotate Secrets:** Implement a rotation process.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Secret Exposure (Severity: Critical)
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Secret Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Database password hardcoded as an environment variable.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement Docker Secrets for `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`.
    *   Remove hardcoded password.
    *   Update code to read from `/run/secrets/`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid `privileged: true`](./mitigation_strategies/avoid__privileged_true_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review:** Check `docker-compose.yml` for `privileged: true`.
    2.  **Justify:** Analyze *why* it's believed necessary.
    3.  **Alternatives:** See if it can be avoided.
    4.  **`cap_add`/`cap_drop`:** Use these to grant *only* needed capabilities. Start with `cap_drop: - ALL`, then add back.
    5.  **Document:** If unavoidable, document and restrict.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Host System Compromise (Severity: Critical)
    *   **Threat:** Container Escape (Severity: Critical)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Host System Compromise:** Risk eliminated/reduced.
    *   **Container Escape:** Risk eliminated/reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No services use `privileged: true`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None (but maintain vigilance).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Specify User within Compose (Less Preferred, but Compose-Related)](./mitigation_strategies/specify_user_within_compose__less_preferred__but_compose-related_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine UID/GID:** Identify the UID and GID of a non-root user *within the container's image*.  Ideally, this user is created in the Dockerfile.
    2.  **Use `user` in Compose:** In `docker-compose.yml`, use the `user` option: `user: "1000:1000"` (replace with the correct UID:GID).
    3. **Note:** It is better to handle non-root user in Dockerfile.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation (Severity: High)
    *   **Threat:** Host System Compromise (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Host System Compromise:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. Services run as root (default).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Add `user: "1000:1000"` (or appropriate UID/GID) to service definitions *if* the Dockerfiles are not already handling non-root users.  Prioritize Dockerfile changes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Latest Compatible Docker Compose File Version](./mitigation_strategies/use_latest_compatible_docker_compose_file_version.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Check Version:** Find the current version in `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., `version: "3.7"`).
    2.  **Consult Docs:** Check Docker docs for the latest compatible version.
    3.  **Update:** Update the `version` string if newer.
    4.  **Test:** Thoroughly test the application.
    5.  **Review:** Explore new features.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Missing Security Features (Severity: Variable)
    *   **Threat:** Compatibility Issues (Severity: Low to Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Missing Security Features:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Compatibility Issues:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Using version `3.7`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Check for newer compatible versions; update and test.
