# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for docker/compose

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Compose File Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_compose_file_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Version Control for Compose Files:** Store your `docker-compose.yml` and related files (like `.env` files used *by* Compose) in a version control system (e.g., Git). This allows tracking changes *to your Compose configuration*.
    2.  **Access Control to Compose Files:** Implement access control on the repository containing your `docker-compose.yml`. Limit who can modify these files to authorized personnel. This controls who can alter the *application's Compose definition*.
    3.  **Code Review for Compose Changes:** Mandate code reviews for all modifications to `docker-compose.yml` and related files. This ensures scrutiny of *Compose configuration changes* before deployment.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Modifications of Compose Configuration (High Severity):** Malicious or accidental changes to `docker-compose.yml` can lead to insecure container setups, exposed ports, or misconfigured services *defined in Compose*.
        *   **Accidental Misconfigurations in Compose (Medium Severity):** Developers might introduce errors in `docker-compose.yml` that create security vulnerabilities or instability *in the Compose-defined application*.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Modifications of Compose Configuration:** Risk reduced significantly. Access control and code review make unauthorized changes to the *Compose setup* much harder.
        *   **Accidental Misconfigurations in Compose:** Risk reduced moderately. Code review helps catch errors in *Compose definitions* before deployment.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Version control using Git is implemented for infrastructure-as-code, including `docker-compose.yml`.
        *   Basic branch protection is enabled on the `main` branch, requiring pull requests for changes to *all files*, including Compose files.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Mandatory code review *specifically focused on security aspects of Compose file changes* is not strictly enforced.
        *   Detailed access control policies *specifically for Compose file modifications* are not formally documented or enforced beyond general repository access.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Compose File Validation and Linting](./mitigation_strategies/compose_file_validation_and_linting.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize `docker compose config --validate`:**  Incorporate the built-in `docker compose config --validate` command into your CI/CD pipeline or development workflow. This command validates the *syntax and basic structure of your `docker-compose.yml`*.
    2.  **Consider Compose-Specific Linters:** Explore and integrate linters specifically designed for Docker Compose files (e.g., `compose-lint`). These tools can identify potential security issues and best practice violations *within your Compose configuration*.
    3.  **Automate Validation in CI/CD:**  Make `docker compose config --validate` (and any chosen linter) a mandatory step in your CI/CD pipeline. Fail the pipeline if validation or linting errors are found in the `docker-compose.yml`.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Syntax Errors in Compose Files (Low Severity):**  Syntax errors in `docker-compose.yml` can prevent Compose from working, leading to deployment failures *of the Compose application*.
        *   **Misconfigurations Detectable by Linting (Medium Severity):** Linting can catch common misconfigurations in `docker-compose.yml` like insecure image tags, privileged mode usage *defined directly in Compose*, or missing resource limits *specified in Compose*.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Syntax Errors:** Risk eliminated. `docker compose config --validate` will catch syntax errors before deployment *of the Compose application*.
        *   **Misconfigurations Detectable by Linting:** Risk reduced moderately. Linting tools can identify and prevent some common misconfigurations *within the Compose file*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic `docker compose config --validate` is run manually by developers occasionally.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Automated validation using `docker compose config --validate` is not integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   Compose-specific linters are not currently used.
        *   There is no enforced policy to fail the CI/CD pipeline if `docker compose config --validate` or a linter fails.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Docker Networks *Defined in Compose* for Isolation](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_docker_networks_defined_in_compose_for_isolation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Custom Networks in `docker-compose.yml`:**  Use the `networks` section in your `docker-compose.yml` to define custom Docker networks. Avoid relying solely on the default bridge network *implicitly created by Compose*.
    2.  **Network Segmentation via Compose:** Segment your application components (frontend, backend, database) into different Docker networks *defined in your Compose file*.
    3.  **Service Network Assignment in Compose:** In the `services` section of your `docker-compose.yml`, use the `networks` directive to assign each service to the appropriate network(s) *defined in Compose*.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Lateral Movement within Compose Application (Medium to High Severity):** If one container *within the Compose application* is compromised, network segmentation *defined in Compose* limits the attacker's ability to move to other containers *managed by the same Compose setup*.
        *   **Exposure of Internal Services *due to Compose Network Configuration* (Medium Severity):** Proper network configuration *in `docker-compose.yml`* prevents accidental exposure of internal services to the host network or other containers *not intended to communicate*.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Lateral Movement within Compose Application:** Risk reduced significantly. Network segmentation *configured in Compose* makes lateral movement harder within the application.
        *   **Exposure of Internal Services *due to Compose Network Configuration*:** Risk reduced significantly. Custom networks *defined in Compose* and careful port exposure control prevent unintended access.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Custom Docker networks are defined in `docker-compose.yml` for frontend and backend services.
        *   Services are assigned to specific networks *within the Compose file*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Network segmentation *in Compose* could be further refined (e.g., separate database network).
        *   Network policies (beyond basic Docker network isolation *configured in Compose*) are not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Volume Security Considerations in Compose](./mitigation_strategies/volume_security_considerations_in_compose.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prefer Named Volumes in `docker-compose.yml`:** When defining volumes in your `docker-compose.yml`, use named volumes (defined in the `volumes` section) where possible instead of bind mounts. Named volumes offer better isolation *within the Compose environment*.
    2.  **Restrict Bind Mount Access in Compose:** If bind mounts are necessary in your `docker-compose.yml`, carefully consider the permissions granted to containers on the mounted host directories. Apply least privilege.
    3.  **Read-Only Mounts in Compose:**  In `docker-compose.yml`, mount volumes as read-only whenever possible using the `read_only: true` option in the `volumes` section of service definitions.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Container Escape via Volume Mounts (High Severity):** Misconfigured bind mounts in `docker-compose.yml` can potentially allow container escape if containers have excessive write access to sensitive host paths.
        *   **Data Corruption via Container Write Access (Medium Severity):**  Containers with write access to volumes *defined in Compose* could potentially corrupt data if compromised or due to application errors.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Container Escape via Volume Mounts:** Risk reduced moderately. Named volumes and careful bind mount configuration *in Compose* reduce the risk.
        *   **Data Corruption via Container Write Access:** Risk reduced moderately. Read-only mounts *configured in Compose* prevent accidental or malicious data modification in certain scenarios.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Named volumes are used for some persistent data in `docker-compose.yml`.
        *   Bind mounts are used for development purposes, but permissions are not consistently reviewed for security implications *in the Compose context*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Consistent use of named volumes over bind mounts *in `docker-compose.yml`* is not enforced.
        *   Read-only mounts are not systematically used where applicable *in Compose configurations*.
        *   Formal review process for bind mount permissions in `docker-compose.yml` is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secrets Management *with Compose (if applicable)* or External Solutions](./mitigation_strategies/secrets_management_with_compose__if_applicable__or_external_solutions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Docker Secrets *with Compose* (if using Swarm or standalone with secrets enabled):** If your Docker environment supports Docker Secrets, use them to manage sensitive information *within your Compose application*. Refer to Compose documentation for secret definition and usage.
    2.  **External Secrets Management Integration (Recommended for Compose):** Integrate with external secrets management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and retrieve secrets securely *for your Compose application*. Configure your application containers *defined in Compose* to fetch secrets from these external sources.
    3.  **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets in `docker-compose.yml` or `.env` files:** Never hardcode secrets directly in `docker-compose.yml` files or `.env` files that are part of your Compose setup. This is a critical security practice *when using Compose*.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exposure of Secrets in Compose Files (Critical Severity):** Hardcoding secrets in `docker-compose.yml` or related files directly exposes them in version control and deployment artifacts, leading to potential compromise of credentials and sensitive data.
        *   **Secrets Leakage via Environment Variables (High Severity):**  While slightly better than hardcoding, storing secrets as plain environment variables *directly in Compose or `.env` files* still poses a significant risk of exposure.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exposure of Secrets in Compose Files:** Risk eliminated (if avoided). Using proper secrets management prevents secrets from being directly embedded in Compose files.
        *   **Secrets Leakage via Environment Variables:** Risk reduced significantly. External secrets management and Docker Secrets provide secure ways to handle secrets *outside of Compose configuration files*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Environment variables are used for some configuration, but secrets are *not* currently managed using Docker Secrets or external solutions. Secrets are often passed as environment variables *defined in `.env` files or directly in Compose for development*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Docker Secrets or external secrets management solutions are not integrated for managing sensitive information *in the Compose application*.
        *   Hardcoding secrets in `.env` files (used with Compose) is still a practice in development environments.
        *   Secure secrets management is not enforced as part of the deployment process for Compose applications.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits *Defined in Compose*](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_defined_in_compose.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Resource Limits in `docker-compose.yml`:** Use the `resources` section within service definitions in your `docker-compose.yml` to set resource limits (CPU and memory) for containers.
    2.  **Appropriate Resource Allocation in Compose:**  Set resource limits based on the expected needs of each service *defined in Compose*. Avoid overly generous limits that could lead to resource waste or denial of service.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion by a Single Container (Medium Severity):** A runaway container *within the Compose application* without resource limits can consume excessive resources, potentially causing denial of service or impacting other services *in the Compose setup*.
        *   **"Noisy Neighbor" Effect (Medium Severity):**  Without resource limits *defined in Compose*, one container can negatively impact the performance of other containers on the same host due to resource contention.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion by a Single Container:** Risk reduced significantly. Resource limits *in Compose* prevent a single container from monopolizing resources.
        *   **"Noisy Neighbor" Effect:** Risk reduced moderately. Resource limits help ensure fairer resource allocation *within the Compose environment*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Resource limits are *not* consistently defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Resource limits are not systematically defined for services in `docker-compose.yml`.
        *   There is no policy or process to determine and set appropriate resource limits for containers *defined in Compose*.
