# Project Design Document: Docker Compose for Threat Modeling

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2023-10-27
**Author:** AI Software Architect

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed design overview of Docker Compose, a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. This document is specifically tailored for threat modeling activities. It outlines the architecture, key components, data flow, and technology stack of Docker Compose, with a strong focus on security-relevant aspects and potential vulnerabilities. This document will serve as the foundation for identifying threats, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors associated with Docker Compose deployments.

## 2. Project Overview

**Docker Compose** is a command-line tool designed to simplify the management and orchestration of multi-container Docker applications. It leverages a YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`) to declaratively define the services, networks, volumes, and configurations required for an application stack. Docker Compose streamlines the process of setting up and running complex applications, particularly in development, testing, and staging environments.

**Key Features (Security Relevant Highlights):**

*   **Declarative Configuration (YAML):**  Configuration is defined in human-readable YAML, which can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly validated or secured. Secrets management within YAML is a key security concern.
*   **Multi-Container Orchestration:** Manages the lifecycle of multiple containers, increasing the attack surface compared to single-container applications. Inter-container communication and isolation become critical security aspects.
*   **Service Dependencies & Startup Order:** Defines dependencies, which can impact availability and introduce cascading failures if dependencies are compromised.
*   **Networking & Volumes Management:**  Manages Docker networks and volumes, which are crucial for container communication and data persistence. Misconfigurations in networks and volumes can lead to data exposure or unauthorized access.
*   **Client-Side CLI Tool:** Operates as a client-side tool, meaning security relies on the security of the user's environment and the Docker host it interacts with.
*   **Docker API Interaction:**  Relies heavily on the Docker Engine API. Security of the Docker API is paramount for Docker Compose security.

## 3. System Architecture

Docker Compose functions as a client application that communicates with the Docker Engine to orchestrate containers. It interprets the `docker-compose.yml` file and translates the declarative configuration into imperative commands for the Docker Engine via its API.

### 3.2. Component Description (Security Focused)

*   **User:** The individual interacting with Docker Compose. User privileges and security practices are crucial. Compromised user accounts can lead to unauthorized Compose operations.
*   **docker-compose CLI:** The Python-based command-line tool.
    *   **Security Responsibilities:** Parsing and validating `docker-compose.yml`, securely handling secrets (if any), authenticating to Docker Engine (if necessary), and preventing command injection vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities in the CLI itself (Python dependencies) can be exploited.
    *   **Attack Surface:** Local filesystem access (for Compose file and potentially volume mounts), interaction with Docker Engine API, processing user input (commands and YAML).
*   **docker-compose.yml:** The YAML configuration file.
    *   **Security Risks:**  Exposure of sensitive information (secrets, credentials) if not managed properly. Misconfigurations can lead to insecure containers, networks, and volumes. YAML parsing vulnerabilities could be exploited.
    *   **Security Best Practices:**  Secret management (using Docker Secrets or external secret stores), input validation, least privilege configurations.
*   **Docker Engine:** The core container runtime.
    *   **Security Responsibilities:** Container isolation, resource management, network and volume security, image security scanning (if configured), API security and access control. Docker Engine vulnerabilities are critical as they can impact all containers it manages.
    *   **Attack Surface:** Docker API, container runtime environment, interaction with host OS kernel, image registry interactions.
*   **Containers:** Isolated runtime environments.
    *   **Security Risks:** Vulnerabilities within containerized applications, insecure configurations within containers, exposed ports, insufficient resource limits, privilege escalation within containers.
    *   **Security Best Practices:**  Minimal base images, vulnerability scanning, least privilege user within containers, secure application configurations, network segmentation.
*   **Networks:** Virtual networks for container communication.
    *   **Security Risks:**  Unnecessary exposure of container ports to external networks, lack of network segmentation, insecure network policies, potential for network-based attacks between containers.
    *   **Security Best Practices:**  Network segmentation (using Docker networks), network policies to restrict inter-container communication, avoid exposing ports unnecessarily.
*   **Volumes:** Persistent storage mechanisms.
    *   **Security Risks:**  Data exposure if volumes are not properly secured, insecure volume mounts allowing containers to access sensitive host files, insufficient access control on volume data.
    *   **Security Best Practices:**  Restrict volume mounts to necessary paths, use volume drivers with encryption if needed, ensure proper file permissions within volumes.
*   **Images:** Container image templates.
    *   **Security Risks:**  Vulnerable base images, malware embedded in images, outdated software within images, supply chain attacks through compromised registries.
    *   **Security Best Practices:**  Use trusted base images, regularly scan images for vulnerabilities, implement image signing and verification, minimize image size.
*   **Container Registry (e.g., Docker Hub):**  Stores and distributes container images.
    *   **Security Risks:**  Compromised registries can distribute malicious images. Public registries may host vulnerable or malicious images.
    *   **Security Best Practices:**  Use trusted registries, implement image scanning and vulnerability assessment, consider using private registries for sensitive applications.
*   **User's Local System (OS, Filesystem):** The user's machine where `docker-compose CLI` is executed.
    *   **Security Risks:**  Compromised local system can lead to compromised Compose operations, exposure of `docker-compose.yml` and secrets, and potential attacks on the Docker Host if the local system is used to manage it.
*   **Docker Host OS:** The operating system running the Docker Engine.
    *   **Security Risks:**  Vulnerabilities in the host OS can directly impact the security of Docker Engine and all containers. Host OS security is fundamental to Docker security.

## 4. Data Flow (Security Perspective)

This data flow focuses on the movement of security-relevant data and configurations during `docker-compose up`.

    B --> C["CLI reads 'docker-compose.yml' (potentially containing secrets, configs)"]
    C --> D["YAML Parser validates syntax, extracts service definitions, network configs, volume mounts, environment variables (including potential secrets)"]
    D --> E["Secret Management (if used): CLI retrieves secrets from external store or decrypts secrets in compose file"]
    E --> F["Docker API Client constructs API calls with configurations, including network settings, volume paths, environment variables, security context settings, image names"]

    G --> K["Container Creation: Engine creates containers with specified security context, resource limits, environment variables, volume mounts, port mappings"]
    K --> L["Container Start: Engine starts containers"]
    L --> M["Running Application: Containers communicate over networks, access volumes, potentially expose ports"]

```

**Security Data Flow Steps:**

1.  **User Input & Configuration:** User provides commands and the `docker-compose.yml` file, which may contain sensitive configurations like secrets, environment variables, volume mounts, and network settings.
2.  **Configuration Parsing & Validation:** The `docker-compose CLI` parses and validates the YAML file. This step is crucial for preventing injection attacks and ensuring configuration integrity.
3.  **Secret Management:** If secrets are used (e.g., Docker Secrets, environment variables referencing external secret stores), the CLI handles secret retrieval and injection into containers. Secure secret management is vital.
4.  **Docker API Call Construction:** The CLI constructs Docker API calls, embedding security-relevant configurations such as:
    *   **Security Context:** User ID, group ID, capabilities, SELinux/AppArmor profiles.
    *   **Resource Limits:** CPU, memory limits to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
    *   **Network Settings:** Port mappings, network attachments, network policies.
    *   **Volume Mounts:** Host paths mounted into containers, volume permissions.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Including potentially sensitive credentials.
    *   **Image Names:**  Determining the source of container images.
5.  **Docker Engine Processing:** The Docker Engine receives and processes these API calls, enforcing security configurations and managing container lifecycles.
6.  **Image Pull (Supply Chain Risk):** Docker Engine pulls container images from registries. This step introduces supply chain security risks if images are compromised or contain vulnerabilities.
7.  **Network & Volume Creation (Configuration Security):** Docker Engine creates networks and volumes based on configurations. Misconfigurations here can lead to network segmentation issues or data exposure.
8.  **Container Creation & Start (Runtime Security):** Docker Engine creates and starts containers, enforcing security contexts and resource limits. Container runtime security is critical to prevent container escapes and other runtime attacks.
9.  **Running Application (Operational Security):** The running application's security depends on the security of the containers, networks, volumes, and the underlying Docker Engine and host OS.

## 5. Technology Stack (Security Implications)

*   **Python:** Docker Compose CLI is written in Python.
    *   **Security Implications:** Python dependencies can have vulnerabilities. Regular dependency scanning and updates are necessary. Python code itself can be vulnerable to injection attacks or other software vulnerabilities if not developed securely.
*   **PyYAML (YAML Parsing):** Used for parsing `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   **Security Implications:** YAML parsing libraries can be vulnerable to parsing vulnerabilities that could lead to denial of service or even remote code execution if processing maliciously crafted YAML files.
*   **Docker SDK for Python (docker-py):**  Used for interacting with the Docker Engine API.
    *   **Security Implications:**  Vulnerabilities in the SDK could be exploited. Secure API communication is crucial.
*   **Click (CLI Framework):** Used for building the command-line interface.
    *   **Security Implications:**  CLI frameworks can have vulnerabilities. Input validation and secure command handling are important.
*   **Docker Engine API:** The core API for container management.
    *   **Security Implications:**  Docker API security is paramount. Unauthorized access to the API can lead to complete compromise of the Docker host and all containers. API access control, authentication, and authorization are critical.
*   **Operating System (Host OS):**  Underlying operating system for both the CLI host and the Docker Host.
    *   **Security Implications:**  Host OS vulnerabilities can directly impact Docker Compose and Docker Engine security. OS hardening, patching, and secure configuration are essential.

## 6. Deployment Model (Security Considerations)

*   **Local Development Environments:**
    *   **Security Considerations:**  Less stringent security controls are typically in place. However, vulnerabilities in development environments can still be exploited to gain access to developer machines or sensitive development data. Ensure developer machines are reasonably secure and avoid running containers as root unnecessarily.
*   **Testing and Staging Environments:**
    *   **Security Considerations:**  Should mirror production environments as closely as possible in terms of security configurations. Data in staging environments might be sensitive (production-like data). Access control, network segmentation, and vulnerability scanning are important.
*   **Single-Server Deployments (Simple Production):**
    *   **Security Considerations:**  Increased security requirements compared to development/staging. Docker Host hardening, secure Docker API configuration, network security, and container security are crucial. Consider using firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Docker Compose alone is not designed for high availability or robust security in production.
*   **CI/CD Pipelines:**
    *   **Security Considerations:**  CI/CD pipelines often handle sensitive credentials and deploy applications to production. Secure pipeline configurations, secret management within pipelines, and secure build processes are essential. Ensure that Docker images built in CI/CD are scanned for vulnerabilities.

## 7. Threat Modeling Scope

This threat model focuses on the following aspects of Docker Compose:

*   **docker-compose CLI and its interactions with the user and Docker Engine.**
*   **`docker-compose.yml` file and its processing.**
*   **Docker Engine API interactions initiated by Docker Compose.**
*   **Security of containers, networks, and volumes orchestrated by Docker Compose.**
*   **Supply chain security related to container images used by Docker Compose.**

**Out of Scope:**

*   **Security of applications running *inside* containers managed by Docker Compose.** (Application-level vulnerabilities are a separate concern).
*   **Detailed security analysis of the Docker Engine itself.** (This document assumes a reasonably secure Docker Engine setup, but vulnerabilities in Docker Engine are a broader topic).
*   **Specific cloud provider security infrastructure when Docker Compose is used in cloud environments.** (Cloud-specific security controls are outside the scope of Docker Compose itself).
*   **Performance and reliability aspects (unless directly related to security, e.g., DoS).**

## 8. Security Considerations and Potential Threats (For Threat Modeling)

This section categorizes potential threats using the STRIDE model for a more structured threat analysis.

**STRIDE Threat Model:**

*   **Spoofing:**
    *   **Threat:** Spoofing Docker Engine API endpoint. An attacker could redirect `docker-compose CLI` to a malicious Docker Engine to execute unauthorized commands.
    *   **Threat:** Spoofing container registries. An attacker could host a malicious registry and trick Docker Compose into pulling compromised images.
    *   **Threat:** Spoofing network identities within Docker networks.

*   **Tampering:**
    *   **Threat:** Tampering with `docker-compose.yml` file. An attacker could modify the Compose file to inject malicious configurations, expose ports, or mount insecure volumes.
    *   **Threat:** Tampering with container images in transit or at rest. An attacker could modify images to inject malware or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Threat:** Tampering with Docker API calls. (Less likely in typical scenarios, but possible with man-in-the-middle attacks on API communication if not secured).

*   **Repudiation:**
    *   **Threat:** Lack of audit logging for Docker Compose operations. It might be difficult to track who performed which actions using Docker Compose, hindering incident response and accountability. (This is more related to Docker Engine logging and host OS logging).

*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Threat:** Exposure of secrets in `docker-compose.yml` if not properly managed.
    *   **Threat:** Exposure of sensitive data through insecure volume mounts.
    *   **Threat:** Exposure of container ports unnecessarily, allowing unauthorized access to services.
    *   **Threat:** Information leakage through verbose error messages or logs from `docker-compose CLI` or containers.
    *   **Threat:**  Exposure of Docker API without proper authentication and authorization.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Threat:** Resource exhaustion attacks by misconfigured containers (e.g., no resource limits).
    *   **Threat:**  DoS attacks against the Docker Engine via excessive API calls initiated by a compromised `docker-compose CLI` or malicious Compose file.
    *   **Threat:**  Vulnerabilities in `docker-compose CLI` or Docker Engine that could be exploited for DoS.

*   **Elevation of Privilege:**
    *   **Threat:** Container escape vulnerabilities in Docker Engine or container runtime.
    *   **Threat:** Running containers in privileged mode unnecessarily, granting excessive capabilities, or misconfiguring security contexts, leading to potential privilege escalation within containers or on the host.
    *   **Threat:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in `docker-compose CLI` or its dependencies to gain elevated privileges on the user's system.
    *   **Threat:** Insecure volume mounts allowing containers to gain access to sensitive host system files and potentially escalate privileges.

This improved document provides a more detailed and security-focused design overview of Docker Compose, suitable for in-depth threat modeling. The STRIDE categorization helps to systematically analyze potential threats and vulnerabilities. The next step would be to elaborate on these threats, assess their likelihood and impact, and develop mitigation strategies.
