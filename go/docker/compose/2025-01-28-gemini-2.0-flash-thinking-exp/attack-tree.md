## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit docker-compose.yml Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_docker-compose_yml_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities directly related to the `docker-compose.yml` file itself, either through insecure storage/access or misconfigurations within the file.
*   **Attack Vectors within this path:**
    *   Insecure Storage/Access of `docker-compose.yml` [HIGH RISK PATH]:
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain access to the `docker-compose.yml` file due to insecure storage or access controls. This could be through publicly accessible repositories, weak file permissions on the host, or insecure configuration management systems.
        *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information like secrets, credentials, and application configuration. This can lead to direct compromise of the application and potentially the host system.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Never commit secrets directly to `docker-compose.yml` or version control.** Use environment variables, Docker Secrets, or dedicated secret management tools.
            *   **Implement robust access control for repositories.** Ensure repositories containing `docker-compose.yml` are private and access is restricted to authorized personnel.
            *   **Restrict file permissions on `docker-compose.yml` on the host system.** Use `chmod 600 docker-compose.yml` for user-only access.
            *   **Secure configuration management systems.** Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest, use secure channels (HTTPS, SSH).
    *   Misconfigurations in `docker-compose.yml` [HIGH RISK PATH]:
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations within the `docker-compose.yml` file that introduce security vulnerabilities. This includes insecure volume mounts and the use of privileged containers.
        *   **Impact:** Container escape, host system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Insecure Volume Mounts [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Host Path Mounts with Write Access [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                    *   **Attack Vector:** Mounting host directories with write access into containers allows attackers within the container to modify files on the host system, potentially leading to container escape or host compromise.
                    *   **Impact:** Container escape, host system compromise, data modification.
                    *   **Mitigation:**
                        *   **Avoid host path mounts with write access whenever possible.**
                        *   **Use named volumes instead of host path mounts.**
                        *   **If host path mounts are necessary, use read-only mounts (`ro`).**
                        *   **Restrict the paths mounted from the host to the minimum required.**
                *   **Mounting Sensitive Host Paths [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                    *   **Attack Vector:** Mounting sensitive host directories like `/`, `/etc`, or `/var/run/docker.sock` into containers grants excessive privileges to containers, potentially leading to full host control.
                    *   **Impact:** Catastrophic host system compromise.
                    *   **Mitigation:**
                        *   **Never mount sensitive host paths into containers unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.**
                        *   **Implement strict container security profiles (AppArmor, SELinux) to limit container capabilities even if sensitive paths are mounted (though this is not a replacement for avoiding sensitive mounts).**
            *   **Privileged Containers [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Running containers in privileged mode (`privileged: true`) disables container isolation and grants near-host-level access to the container.
                *   **Impact:** Catastrophic host system compromise.
                *   **Mitigation:**
                    *   **Avoid privileged containers unless absolutely necessary.**
                    *   **If privileged mode is required, carefully assess the risks and implement compensating controls.**
                    *   **Use capabilities (`cap_add`, `cap_drop`) to grant only the required privileges instead of full privileged mode.**
                    *   **Implement container security profiles (AppArmor, SELinux) to further restrict container capabilities.**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Compose's Interaction with Docker Daemon [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_compose's_interaction_with_docker_daemon__high_risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities arising from how Docker Compose interacts with the Docker daemon, specifically through Docker socket exposure.
*   **Attack Vectors within this path:**
    *   Docker Socket Exposure (Indirectly via Compose Configuration) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exposing the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) inside containers through volume mounts in `docker-compose.yml` grants containers full control over the Docker daemon and, consequently, the host system.
        *   **Impact:** Catastrophic host system compromise. Attackers within the container can use the Docker socket to control the Docker daemon, launch new containers, access host resources, and potentially escape containerization entirely.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` into Containers via `docker-compose.yml` [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Mitigation:**
                    *   **Never mount `/var/run/docker.sock` into containers unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.**
                    *   **Consider alternative approaches for containerized Docker access if needed, such as using the Docker API over TCP with TLS authentication and authorization.**
                    *   **If Docker socket mounting is unavoidable, implement very strict access controls within the container and monitor container activity closely.**
