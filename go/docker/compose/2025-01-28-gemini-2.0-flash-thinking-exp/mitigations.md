# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for docker/compose

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Secret Management using Docker Secrets](./mitigation_strategies/implement_secret_management_using_docker_secrets.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Identify sensitive information (passwords, API keys, database credentials) in your `docker-compose.yml` or `.env` files.
*   Step 2: Create Docker Secrets using `docker secret create` for each secret (e.g., `echo "secret_value" | docker secret create my_secret -`).
*   Step 3: Define secrets in the top-level `secrets` section of your `docker-compose.yml`:
    ```yaml
    secrets:
      my_secret:
        external: true
    ```
*   Step 4: In services needing secrets, declare them and mount as files:
    ```yaml
    services:
      app:
        image: your-app-image
        secrets:
          - my_secret
        environment:
          MY_SECRET_FILE: /run/secrets/my_secret
    ```
*   Step 5: Update application code to read secrets from mounted file paths (e.g., `/run/secrets/my_secret`).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Exposure of Secrets in Version Control - Severity: High
*   Unauthorized Access to Secrets in Configuration Files - Severity: High

**Impact:**
*   Exposure of Secrets in Version Control: High Risk Reduction
*   Unauthorized Access to Secrets in Configuration Files: High Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:** Partial - Database passwords in production use external secret management (Vault), but Docker Secrets are not consistently used for other secrets or across all environments.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Extend Docker Secrets usage to development and staging environments.
*   Apply Docker Secrets for API keys, service account credentials, and other sensitive data.
*   Standardize secret management across all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Apply Least Privilege Principles using `user` directive](./mitigation_strategies/apply_least_privilege_principles_using__user__directive.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Determine the least privileged user to run application processes within containers.
*   Step 2: Ensure your Dockerfile creates a non-root user and group (if not in base image). Example Dockerfile:
    ```dockerfile
    RUN groupadd -r appuser && useradd -r -g appuser appuser
    ```
*   Step 3: In `docker-compose.yml`, use the `user` directive in each service to specify the non-root user:
    ```yaml
    services:
      app:
        image: your-app-image
        user: "appuser:appuser"
    ```
*   Step 4: Verify file permissions in container images and volumes allow the non-root user access to necessary files and directories.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Container Escape and Host Compromise - Severity: High
*   Privilege Escalation within Container - Severity: High

**Impact:**
*   Container Escape and Host Compromise: High Risk Reduction
*   Privilege Escalation within Container: High Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:** Partial - `user` directive is used for the main web application container in production, but not consistently for all services in all environments.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Apply `user` directive to all services in `docker-compose.yml` across development, staging, and production.
*   Review and adjust file permissions to ensure non-root user functionality for all services.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Distinct Compose Networks for Service Isolation](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_distinct_compose_networks_for_service_isolation.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Define separate networks in the `networks` section of your `docker-compose.yml`. Example:
    ```yaml
    networks:
      frontend-net:
      backend-net:
      db-net:
        internal: true
    ```
*   Step 2: Assign services to appropriate networks in their `networks` section within `docker-compose.yml`:
    ```yaml
    services:
      web:
        image: your-web-app-image
        networks:
          - frontend-net
          - backend-net
      api:
        image: your-api-app-image
        networks:
          - backend-net
          - db-net
      db:
        image: db-image
        networks:
          - db-net
    ```
*   Step 3: Design network architecture to restrict inter-service communication to necessary paths, enhancing isolation.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Lateral Movement within Compose Environment - Severity: Medium
*   Network-based Attacks between Containers - Severity: Medium

**Impact:**
*   Lateral Movement within Compose Environment: Medium Risk Reduction
*   Network-based Attacks between Containers: Medium Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:** Yes - Distinct networks are defined in production and staging `docker-compose.yml` to separate tiers (frontend, backend, database).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistently use network segmentation in development environments.
*   Document the intended network architecture and service communication flows.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Resource Limits in Compose](./mitigation_strategies/implement_resource_limits_in_compose.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Analyze resource requirements (CPU, memory) for each service in your Compose application.
*   Step 2: In `docker-compose.yml`, use resource limit directives (`cpu_limit`, `mem_limit`, `memswap_limit`) within each service definition to constrain resource usage. Example:
    ```yaml
    services:
      app:
        image: your-app-image
        deploy:
          resources:
            limits:
              cpus: '0.5'
              memory: 512M
    ```
*   Step 3: Test resource limits in staging to ensure application stability and performance within defined boundaries.
*   Step 4: Monitor resource usage in production to detect and address potential resource exhaustion issues.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Denial of Service due to Resource Exhaustion - Severity: Medium
*   Resource Starvation of Other Services - Severity: Medium

**Impact:**
*   Denial of Service due to Resource Exhaustion: Medium Risk Reduction
*   Resource Starvation of Other Services: Medium Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:** Partial - Resource limits are defined for some services in production `docker-compose.yml`, but not comprehensively applied to all services or environments.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Define and apply resource limits consistently to all services in `docker-compose.yml` across all environments.
*   Regularly review and adjust resource limits based on performance monitoring and application needs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Apply Security Context at Runtime using `security_opt` and `privileged`](./mitigation_strategies/apply_security_context_at_runtime_using__security_opt__and__privileged_.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Identify necessary security capabilities and constraints for each service.
*   Step 2: In `docker-compose.yml`, use the `security_opt` directive to configure security settings like `seccomp` profiles and `apparmor` profiles. Example:
    ```yaml
    services:
      app:
        image: your-app-image
        security_opt:
          - seccomp:unconfined # Example - use a specific profile instead of unconfined in production
    ```
*   Step 3:  Carefully consider and avoid using `privileged: true` unless absolutely necessary. If required, document the justification and security implications.
*   Step 4:  For capability management, use `cap_drop` to remove unnecessary capabilities and `cap_add` to grant only essential capabilities. Example:
    ```yaml
    services:
      app:
        image: your-app-image
        cap_drop:
          - ALL
        cap_add:
          - NET_BIND_SERVICE
    ```
*   Step 5: Test security context configurations in staging to ensure application functionality is not broken by restrictions.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Container Escape and Host Compromise - Severity: High
*   Privilege Escalation within Container - Severity: High
*   Reduced Attack Surface - Severity: Medium

**Impact:**
*   Container Escape and Host Compromise: High Risk Reduction
*   Privilege Escalation within Container: High Risk Reduction
*   Reduced Attack Surface: Medium Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:** Partial - `security_opt` and `cap_drop`/`cap_add` are not systematically used across all services in `docker-compose.yml`. `privileged: true` is avoided in production.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Implement `security_opt` (specifically `seccomp` and `apparmor` profiles) for relevant services in `docker-compose.yml`.
*   Consistently apply `cap_drop` to remove `ALL` capabilities and selectively add only necessary ones.
*   Conduct a security review to identify optimal security context configurations for each service.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Compose File Management and Image Sources](./mitigation_strategies/secure_compose_file_management_and_image_sources.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Store `docker-compose.yml` files in version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and enable rollback.
*   Step 2: Implement access control for the repository containing `docker-compose.yml` files, limiting access to authorized personnel.
*   Step 3: Utilize trusted and reputable image registries for pulling container images defined in `docker-compose.yml`. Prefer official images or verified publishers.
*   Step 4: For internal images, use a private registry with access control to manage and distribute trusted images within the organization.
*   Step 5: Consider using Docker Content Trust (DCT) to verify image integrity and publisher authenticity when pulling images in Compose.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Unauthorized Modification of Compose Configuration - Severity: Medium
*   Use of Malicious or Vulnerable Images - Severity: High
*   Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised Images - Severity: Medium

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized Modification of Compose Configuration: Medium Risk Reduction
*   Use of Malicious or Vulnerable Images: High Risk Reduction
*   Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised Images: Medium Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:** Yes - `docker-compose.yml` files are version controlled and stored in private repositories with access control. Private registry is used for internal images.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Enforce Docker Content Trust (DCT) for image pulls in Compose environments.
*   Regularly audit and review access control for `docker-compose.yml` repositories and image registries.
*   Establish a process for verifying the integrity and security of third-party images used in Compose applications.
