# Attack Surface Analysis for docker/compose

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Misconfigured Compose File](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_misconfigured_compose_file.md)

*   **Description:** A `docker-compose.yml` file containing malicious configurations or unintentional errors that can compromise the application or the host system.
    *   **How Compose Contributes:** Compose directly interprets and executes the instructions within the `docker-compose.yml` file. It automates the creation and configuration of containers based on this file, making it a central point of control and potential vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A `docker-compose.yml` file defines a service that mounts the host's root directory (`/`) into a container with read-write access, allowing a compromised container to modify any file on the host.
    *   **Impact:** Full host compromise, data breaches, denial of service, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement code review processes for `docker-compose.yml` files.
        *   Use linters and validators to check for syntax errors and potential security issues in the Compose file.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining volume mounts, port mappings, and container capabilities.
        *   Avoid mounting sensitive host directories into containers.
        *   Store `docker-compose.yml` files securely and control access to them.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Secrets in Compose Files](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_secrets_in_compose_files.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or database credentials being directly embedded within the `docker-compose.yml` file or passed as insecure environment variables.
    *   **How Compose Contributes:** Compose allows defining environment variables directly in the file or referencing them from the environment. Without proper secret management, this can lead to secrets being stored in plain text.
    *   **Example:** A `docker-compose.yml` file includes `DATABASE_PASSWORD: mysecretpassword` directly in the environment variables section.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches, account compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Docker Secrets or other dedicated secret management solutions instead of embedding secrets directly in the Compose file or environment variables.
        *   Leverage Compose's support for referencing external secret files or environment variables loaded at runtime.
        *   Avoid committing `docker-compose.yml` files with sensitive information to version control systems.
        *   Implement proper access controls and encryption for secret storage.

## Attack Surface: [Use of Insecure or Vulnerable Container Images](./attack_surfaces/use_of_insecure_or_vulnerable_container_images.md)

*   **Description:** Referencing container images in the `docker-compose.yml` file that contain known vulnerabilities or are built with insecure practices.
    *   **How Compose Contributes:** Compose simplifies the deployment of multiple containers based on specified images. If the specified images are vulnerable, Compose facilitates the deployment of these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A `docker-compose.yml` file uses an outdated version of a web server image with known security flaws.
    *   **Impact:** Container compromise, potential host compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy or Clair.
        *   Use trusted and official container images whenever possible.
        *   Pin specific image versions in the `docker-compose.yml` file to avoid unexpected updates with vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a process for updating container images regularly to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Use multi-stage builds to minimize the attack surface of final images.

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive Volume Mounts](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_volume_mounts.md)

*   **Description:** Defining volume mounts in the `docker-compose.yml` file that grant containers excessive access to the host filesystem.
    *   **How Compose Contributes:** Compose provides a straightforward way to define volume mounts, and misconfiguration can easily lead to overly permissive access.
    *   **Example:** A `docker-compose.yml` file mounts the entire `/home` directory of the host into a container with read-write permissions.
    *   **Impact:** Container escape, host compromise, data breaches, modification of critical system files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining volume mounts. Only mount necessary directories with the minimum required permissions (read-only if possible).
        *   Avoid mounting sensitive host directories like `/`, `/etc`, or user home directories unless absolutely necessary and with careful consideration.
        *   Use named volumes instead of bind mounts when possible to improve isolation.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation through `privileged` Mode](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation_through__privileged__mode.md)

*   **Description:** Using the `privileged: true` directive in the `docker-compose.yml` file, which disables many security features and grants containers almost all capabilities of the host.
    *   **How Compose Contributes:** Compose allows easily enabling privileged mode, which, while sometimes necessary, significantly increases the risk if misused.
    *   **Example:** A `docker-compose.yml` file defines a container with `privileged: true` without a clear justification, potentially allowing container escape and host compromise.
    *   **Impact:** Full host compromise, complete control over the underlying system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `privileged: true` whenever possible.
        *   If privileged mode is absolutely necessary, carefully document the reasons and implement additional security measures.
        *   Explore alternative solutions using specific capabilities instead of granting all privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Docker Socket Exposure](./attack_surfaces/docker_socket_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Mounting the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) into a container, granting the container full control over the Docker daemon and other containers.
    *   **How Compose Contributes:** Compose facilitates mounting volumes, and mounting the Docker socket is a common but risky practice that can be easily implemented.
    *   **Example:** A `docker-compose.yml` file mounts `/var/run/docker.sock` into a utility container for management purposes. If this container is compromised, the attacker gains control over the entire Docker environment.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the Docker host and all running containers, potential for data exfiltration and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid mounting the Docker socket into containers unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        *   Explore alternative solutions for container management that don't require direct socket access, such as using the Docker API over a network.
        *   Implement strict access controls and monitoring for containers that have access to the Docker socket.
