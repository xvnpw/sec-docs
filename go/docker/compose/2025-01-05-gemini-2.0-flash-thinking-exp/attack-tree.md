## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Compose File Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_compose_file_vulnerabilities.md)

**Exploit Compose File Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

*   **Malicious Image Specification [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Use a known vulnerable base image [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Attackers can specify a base Docker image in the `docker-compose.yml` file that is known to contain security vulnerabilities. When containers are created from this image, those vulnerabilities are present and can be exploited to compromise the container and potentially the host system.
    *   **Specify an image with backdoors [CRITICAL NODE]:** An attacker can specify a Docker image, either from a public registry or a private one they control, that has been intentionally modified to include backdoors or malicious software. Deploying containers from such an image directly introduces a compromised component into the application.
    *   **Override entrypoint to execute malicious commands [CRITICAL NODE]:** The `entrypoint` directive in the `docker-compose.yml` file defines the main command executed when a container starts. Attackers can manipulate this directive to execute arbitrary commands within the container upon startup, potentially gaining initial access or performing malicious actions.
*   **Volume Mount Exploitation [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Mount host system directories with write access [CRITICAL NODE]:**  The `volumes` directive in `docker-compose.yml` allows mounting directories from the host system into containers. If an attacker can influence the Compose file to mount sensitive host directories with write permissions, they can modify critical system files, install malware, or escalate privileges on the host.
    *   **Mount sensitive application data directories [CRITICAL NODE]:** Mounting directories containing sensitive application data into containers without proper access controls can expose this data to compromised containers. If a container is compromised through other means, the attacker can then access and exfiltrate sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Interaction with Docker Daemon](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_interaction_with_docker_daemon.md)

**Exploit Interaction with Docker Daemon [HIGH RISK PATH - Abusing insecure Docker socket access]:**

*   **Gain access to the Docker socket (e.g., `/var/run/docker.sock`) from within a container [CRITICAL NODE]:** The Docker daemon listens on a Unix socket (typically `/var/run/docker.sock`). This socket provides full control over the Docker daemon. If a container is configured to mount this socket, or if an attacker can otherwise gain access to it from within a container, they can perform any Docker command, including creating, stopping, and manipulating other containers, pulling malicious images, and potentially compromising the host system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Underlying System via Compose](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_underlying_system_via_compose.md)

**Exploit Underlying System via Compose [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

*   **Privilege Escalation via Container Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Use `privileged: true` in the Compose file [CRITICAL NODE]:** Setting `privileged: true` for a container in the `docker-compose.yml` file grants the container almost all the capabilities of the host system. This effectively bypasses container isolation and allows an attacker within the container to perform actions that can compromise the host.
*   **Accessing sensitive host resources via volume mounts [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Mount sensitive files or directories from the host without proper restrictions [CRITICAL NODE]:** Similar to the previous volume mount scenario, but focusing specifically on the risk of accessing sensitive host resources. Even read-only access to certain files might reveal secrets or configuration details that can be used for further attacks.
*   **Network namespace manipulation to access host network [CRITICAL NODE]:** Configuring a container with `network_mode: "host"` in the `docker-compose.yml` file makes the container share the host's network namespace. This bypasses network isolation, allowing the container to access services running on the host's network interfaces and potentially intercept or manipulate network traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Compose CLI Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_compose_cli_vulnerabilities.md)

**Exploit Compose CLI Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inject malicious commands into Compose commands (e.g., `docker compose run`) [CRITICAL NODE]:** If user input or other untrusted data is directly incorporated into `docker compose` commands without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject arbitrary shell commands. When these commands are executed by the system, the attacker gains the privileges of the user running the Compose command.
*   **Leverage known vulnerabilities in the `docker compose` binary [CRITICAL NODE]:** Like any software, the `docker compose` CLI tool itself might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the system running the Compose CLI, potentially gaining control over the orchestration process or the underlying host.
*   **Trigger vulnerabilities during parsing or processing of malicious Compose files [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Vulnerabilities might exist in how the `docker compose` CLI parses and processes `docker-compose.yml` files. An attacker could craft a malicious Compose file that, when processed by a vulnerable CLI, triggers a buffer overflow, arbitrary code execution, or other security flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Interaction with Docker Daemon](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_interaction_with_docker_daemon.md)

**Exploit Interaction with Docker Daemon:**

*   **Trigger vulnerabilities in the Docker daemon through Compose commands [CRITICAL NODE]:** The `docker compose` tool interacts with the Docker daemon through its API. If vulnerabilities exist in the Docker daemon's API, an attacker might be able to craft specific Compose configurations or commands that trigger these vulnerabilities, leading to container escapes, denial of service, or other forms of compromise.
