# Threat Model Analysis for docker/compose

## Threat: [Exposure of Secrets in `docker-compose.yml`](./threats/exposure_of_secrets_in__docker-compose_yml_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the `docker-compose.yml` file and finds sensitive information like credentials stored as plain text environment variables. Compose's loader directly parses this information, making it accessible. The attacker can then use these credentials to access the corresponding resources.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, compromise of backend services.

**Which https://github.com/docker/compose component is affected:** `compose-go/loader` (responsible for parsing and loading the `docker-compose.yml` file, including environment variables).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid storing secrets directly in `docker-compose.yml`.
* Utilize Docker Secrets or external secret management solutions and reference them in the `docker-compose.yml`.
* Use environment variables loaded from `.env` files (ensure these files are not committed to version control).
* Implement proper access control for the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Threat: [Tampering with Service Definitions in `docker-compose.yml`](./threats/tampering_with_service_definitions_in__docker-compose_yml_.md)

**Description:** An attacker modifies the `docker-compose.yml` file to alter service configurations. Compose's CLI and type handling directly apply these changes, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code within containers, altered port mappings, or manipulated volume mounts.

**Impact:** Execution of malicious code within the application's containers, data breaches, denial of service, and potential compromise of the host system if volume mounts are abused.

**Which https://github.com/docker/compose component is affected:** `compose-go/cli` (handles the application of the configuration), `compose-go/types` (data structures representing the configuration).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access control and version control for the `docker-compose.yml` file.
* Utilize code review processes for any changes to the `docker-compose.yml` file.
* Employ file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications.
* Store `docker-compose.yml` in secure locations with appropriate permissions.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Misconfigured Volume Mounts](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_misconfigured_volume_mounts.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages incorrectly configured volume mounts defined in `docker-compose.yml`. Compose's Docker client interaction directly creates these mounts, potentially granting containers unauthorized access to the host filesystem, leading to privilege escalation.

**Impact:** Container escape, compromise of the host operating system, and potential control over the entire infrastructure.

**Which https://github.com/docker/compose component is affected:** `compose-go/dockerclient` (interacts with the Docker daemon to create and manage volumes).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow the principle of least privilege when defining volume mounts. Only mount necessary directories.
* Consider using read-only mounts where containers only need to access data without modification.
* Avoid mounting sensitive host directories into containers.
* Regularly review and audit volume mount configurations in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Threat: [Use of Compromised or Vulnerable Images](./threats/use_of_compromised_or_vulnerable_images.md)

**Description:** An attacker can exploit vulnerabilities present in the Docker images specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Compose's Docker client directly pulls these images, introducing potential security flaws into the environment.

**Impact:** Introduction of known vulnerabilities into the application environment, potential for remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Which https://github.com/docker/compose component is affected:** `compose-go/dockerclient` (pulls the specified images from registries).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly scan Docker images for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy or Clair.
* Use trusted and verified base images from reputable sources.
* Keep base images up-to-date by rebuilding images regularly.
* Implement image signing and verification mechanisms.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks through Build Context](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_through_build_context.md)

**Description:** An attacker could compromise the build context referenced in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Compose's builder orchestrates the image build process, incorporating any malicious code or dependencies present in the compromised context.

**Impact:** Introduction of malware or vulnerabilities into the application's container images, potentially leading to various security breaches.

**Which https://github.com/docker/compose component is affected:** `compose-go/builder` (orchestrates the image build process based on the `build` context).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the build context and restrict access to it.
* Implement code review processes for Dockerfiles and related build scripts.
* Utilize dependency scanning and vulnerability management tools during the build process.
* Use multi-stage builds to minimize the attack surface of the final image.

## Threat: [Local Privilege Escalation when Running Compose](./threats/local_privilege_escalation_when_running_compose.md)

**Description:** An attacker with limited privileges on the host system could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the `docker-compose` command itself or its interaction with the Docker daemon if run with elevated privileges. Compose's CLI interacts directly with the Docker daemon, and vulnerabilities here could lead to gaining root access.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the host operating system.

**Which https://github.com/docker/compose component is affected:** `compose-go/cli` (the command-line interface for Docker Compose), interaction with the Docker daemon.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid running `docker-compose` commands with `sudo` whenever possible.
* Configure Docker to allow non-root users to manage containers.
* Keep the Docker Compose binary updated to the latest version to patch potential vulnerabilities.
