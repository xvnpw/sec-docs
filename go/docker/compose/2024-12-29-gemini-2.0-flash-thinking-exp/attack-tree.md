## Threat Model: Compromising Applications Using Docker Compose - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to the application, its data, or the underlying host system by leveraging vulnerabilities or misconfigurations related to Docker Compose.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

*   *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit docker-compose.yml Misconfiguration/Vulnerability
    *   [CRITICAL] *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Inject Malicious Image Specification
    *   [CRITICAL] *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Command Injection via Variable Substitution
    *   [CRITICAL] *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Volume Mount to Sensitive Host Paths
    *   *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Build Stage Vulnerabilities
*   [CRITICAL] Trigger Privileged Operations
*   *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Image Handling by Compose
    *   [CRITICAL] *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Pulling Malicious Images
*   [CRITICAL] Parsing Vulnerabilities

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **High-Risk Path: Exploit `docker-compose.yml` Misconfiguration/Vulnerability**
    *   This path encompasses several common and impactful misconfigurations within the `docker-compose.yml` file. Attackers often target this file due to its direct influence on container deployment and configuration.

*   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Image Specification**
    *   Attack Vector: An attacker with write access to the `docker-compose.yml` file (or by tricking a developer) can replace the intended image with a malicious one. This malicious image could contain backdoors, malware, or vulnerabilities that allow the attacker to gain control of the container and potentially the host.
    *   Mitigation Focus: Implement strict access control for `docker-compose.yml` files, use version control, code review processes, and employ image scanning and verification.

*   **Critical Node: Command Injection via Variable Substitution**
    *   Attack Vector: Docker Compose allows using environment variables within the `docker-compose.yml` file. If these variables are not properly sanitized and are used in commands (e.g., in `entrypoint` or `command`), an attacker can inject malicious commands by controlling the value of these variables.
    *   Mitigation Focus: Avoid using untrusted input directly in `docker-compose.yml` commands. Sanitize and validate all external input used in variable substitution. Consider using secrets management solutions instead of environment variables for sensitive data.

*   **Critical Node: Volume Mount to Sensitive Host Paths**
    *   Attack Vector: By defining volume mounts that map sensitive host directories (e.g., `/`, `/etc`, user home directories) into containers without proper read-only restrictions, an attacker within the container can access and potentially modify critical host files, leading to privilege escalation or system compromise.
    *   Mitigation Focus: Minimize volume mounts. When necessary, use specific, read-only mounts. Avoid mounting root or sensitive system directories. Implement container security policies to restrict file system access.

*   **High-Risk Path: Build Stage Vulnerabilities**
    *   Attack Vector: If the `docker-compose.yml` uses the `build:` directive, malicious commands or scripts can be injected into the Dockerfile or build context. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code during the image build process, potentially embedding backdoors or compromising the final image.
    *   Mitigation Focus: Carefully review Dockerfiles and build scripts. Use trusted base images and implement security scanning for build artifacts. Secure the build environment.

*   **Critical Node: Trigger Privileged Operations**
    *   Attack Vector: Docker Compose interacts with the Docker daemon to manage containers. If Compose can be manipulated to request privileged operations (e.g., mounting devices, accessing host namespaces) without proper authorization checks, it can be exploited to gain elevated privileges on the host.
    *   Mitigation Focus: Restrict access to the Docker daemon. Implement proper authorization mechanisms for Docker commands. Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring container capabilities.

*   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Image Handling by Compose**
    *   This path focuses on the risks associated with how Docker Compose retrieves and uses container images. The lack of inherent verification makes it a prime target for malicious image deployment.

*   **Critical Node: Pulling Malicious Images**
    *   Attack Vector: Docker Compose, by default, pulls images without inherent verification. An attacker could trick users into using images from untrusted sources that contain malware or vulnerabilities.
    *   Mitigation Focus: Enforce the use of trusted image registries. Implement image scanning and vulnerability analysis before deployment. Use image signing and verification mechanisms.

*   **Critical Node: Parsing Vulnerabilities**
    *   Attack Vector: Vulnerabilities in the way Docker Compose parses the `docker-compose.yml` file could be exploited by crafting malicious files that cause unexpected behavior, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service on the system running Compose.
    *   Mitigation Focus: Keep Docker Compose updated to the latest version to patch known parsing vulnerabilities. Implement validation of `docker-compose.yml` files.
