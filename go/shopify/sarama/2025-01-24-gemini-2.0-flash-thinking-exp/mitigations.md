# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for shopify/sarama

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Sarama](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_sarama.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update Sarama Library
*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a process for monitoring new releases of the `shopify/sarama` library on GitHub or through Go package management tools.
    2.  Review release notes and changelogs for each new version, paying close attention to security-related updates and bug fixes in Sarama.
    3.  Test the new Sarama version in a non-production environment to ensure compatibility and identify any potential regressions with your application's Sarama usage.
    4.  Update the `go.mod` file in your project to use the latest stable version of Sarama.
    5.  Run `go mod tidy` and `go build` to update dependencies and rebuild the application using the updated Sarama library.
    6.  Deploy the updated application to production environments following your standard deployment procedures.
    7.  Repeat this process periodically (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or whenever security advisories are released specifically for Sarama.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity): Outdated Sarama libraries are susceptible to publicly known vulnerabilities within Sarama itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: High risk reduction. Staying updated directly addresses known Sarama vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, we have a monthly dependency update schedule documented in `docs/development-process.md`. We use `govulncheck` in our CI pipeline to identify outdated dependencies, including Sarama.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated notifications specifically for new Sarama releases are not yet implemented. We rely on general dependency update monitoring and manual checks of GitHub releases.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable TLS Encryption](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tls_encryption.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce TLS Encryption for Kafka Connections using Sarama Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  Obtain valid TLS certificates and private keys for your Kafka brokers.
    2.  Configure your Kafka brokers to enable TLS listeners and require TLS connections.
    3.  In your application's Sarama configuration, set `sarama.Config.Net.TLS.Enable = true`.
    4.  Load the TLS certificates and keys into your application. This can be done by reading them from files or using a secret management system.
    5.  Configure `sarama.Config.Net.TLS.Config` with the loaded TLS certificates and keys using `tls.Config` struct from the `crypto/tls` package. Ensure `InsecureSkipVerify` is set to `false` in production and that you are verifying the server certificate if using a CA. This configuration is directly passed to Sarama's underlying network connections.
    6.  Deploy the updated application configuration and ensure Kafka brokers are configured for TLS.
    7.  Test the connection to Kafka brokers using your Sarama client to verify TLS encryption is active.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Eavesdropping (High Severity): Prevents unauthorized interception of data transmitted between the Sarama client and Kafka brokers.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity): Protects against attackers intercepting and manipulating communication between the Sarama client and Kafka brokers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Eavesdropping: High risk reduction. TLS encryption, configured through Sarama, makes data unreadable to eavesdroppers.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: High risk reduction. TLS, configured through Sarama, provides authentication and integrity checks, making MITM attacks significantly harder.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, TLS encryption is enabled for production Kafka connections using Sarama's TLS configuration. Configuration is managed in `config/kafka.go` and certificates are loaded from Kubernetes secrets.
*   **Missing Implementation:** TLS encryption is not consistently enforced in development and testing environments using Sarama configuration. We should enable it there as well for more realistic testing of Sarama TLS setup.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement SASL Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/implement_sasl_authentication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement SASL Authentication for Kafka Clients using Sarama Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  Choose a suitable SASL mechanism supported by your Kafka brokers (e.g., `SASL/PLAIN`, `SASL/SCRAM-SHA-256`, `SASL/GSSAPI`).
    2.  Configure your Kafka brokers to enable SASL authentication and enforce the chosen mechanism.
    3.  Create dedicated Kafka users for your application with the principle of least privilege.
    4.  In your application's Sarama configuration, set `sarama.Config.Net.SASL.Enable = true`.
    5.  Set `sarama.Config.Net.SASL.Mechanism` to the chosen SASL mechanism (e.g., `sarama.SASLTypeSCRAMSHA256`).
    6.  Provide SASL credentials (username and password) using `sarama.Config.Net.SASL.User` and `sarama.Config.Net.SASL.Password`. Retrieve these credentials securely from environment variables or a secret management system, *not* hardcoded in the application, and pass them to Sarama's configuration.
    7.  Deploy the updated application configuration and ensure Kafka brokers are configured for SASL authentication.
    8.  Test the connection to Kafka brokers using your Sarama client to verify SASL authentication is working.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity): Prevents unauthorized applications or users from connecting to Kafka brokers and accessing data through Sarama clients.
    *   Data Breaches (High Severity): Reduces the risk of data breaches by limiting access to authorized applications using properly configured Sarama clients.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access: High risk reduction. SASL authentication, configured in Sarama, effectively controls access to Kafka.
    *   Data Breaches: High risk reduction. Limiting access via Sarama client configuration is a fundamental security control.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, SASL/SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication is implemented for production Kafka connections using Sarama's SASL configuration. Credentials are loaded from Kubernetes secrets and passed to Sarama.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  SASL authentication is not consistently enforced in development and testing environments using Sarama configuration.  We should enable it there as well for more realistic testing of Sarama SASL setup and to prevent accidental unauthorized access even in non-production environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Client-Side Limits in Sarama](./mitigation_strategies/configure_client-side_limits_in_sarama.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Client-Side Resource Limits using Sarama Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  Review Sarama configuration options related to resource limits, such as `sarama.Config.Producer.MaxMessageBytes`, `sarama.Config.Consumer.Fetch.MaxBytes`, `sarama.Config.Net.DialTimeout`, `sarama.Config.Net.ReadTimeout`, `sarama.Config.Net.WriteTimeout`. These are all configurable parameters within Sarama.
    2.  Set appropriate values for these limits within your Sarama configuration based on your application's requirements and Kafka cluster capacity.
    3.  Limit the maximum message size produced by your application using `sarama.Config.Producer.MaxMessageBytes` to prevent oversized messages being sent by Sarama producers.
    4.  Limit the maximum fetch size for consumers using `sarama.Config.Consumer.Fetch.MaxBytes` to control memory usage of Sarama consumers and prevent excessive data retrieval.
    5.  Configure connection timeouts using `sarama.Config.Net.DialTimeout`, `sarama.Config.Net.ReadTimeout`, and `sarama.Config.Net.WriteTimeout` to prevent indefinite connection attempts and resource exhaustion within Sarama's connection management.
    6.  Test the configured limits to ensure they are effective and do not negatively impact application performance when using Sarama.
    7.  Document the configured Sarama limits and their rationale.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (Medium Severity): Prevents resource exhaustion attacks targeting Kafka brokers or application clients by limiting resource consumption through Sarama client configurations.
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity): Protects application clients using Sarama from consuming excessive resources due to misconfiguration or malicious messages handled by Sarama.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service: Medium risk reduction. Sarama's limits help mitigate some DoS attack vectors.
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Medium risk reduction. Sarama's configuration improves application stability and resource management.
*   **Currently Implemented:** We have default timeouts configured in `config/kafka.go` using Sarama's configuration, but `MaxMessageBytes` and `Fetch.MaxBytes` are using default Sarama values.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  We need to explicitly configure `MaxMessageBytes` and `Fetch.MaxBytes` in Sarama's configuration based on our application's message sizes and resource constraints. We should also review and potentially adjust other timeout settings within Sarama configuration for optimal security and performance.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor Sarama Client Metrics](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_sarama_client_metrics.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Monitoring of Sarama Client Metrics
*   **Description:**
    1.  Choose a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, etc.) to collect and visualize Sarama client metrics.
    2.  Utilize Sarama's built-in metrics collection capabilities or integrate with a metrics library (e.g., `prometheus/client_golang`). Sarama exposes metrics that can be scraped or pushed to monitoring systems.
    3.  Collect key Sarama metrics such as producer message send rates (reported by Sarama), consumer lag (reported by Sarama), connection errors (reported by Sarama), Kafka broker latency (as observed by Sarama), and client-side errors within Sarama.
    4.  Configure dashboards and alerts in your monitoring system to visualize Sarama metrics and detect anomalies or potential security issues related to Sarama client behavior.
    5.  Set up alerts for critical Sarama metrics that indicate potential problems (e.g., high error rates reported by Sarama, increasing consumer lag reported by Sarama, connection failures reported by Sarama).
    6.  Regularly review monitoring dashboards and alerts to proactively identify and address security-related issues detected through Sarama metrics.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (Low Severity): Early detection of DoS attempts or performance degradation affecting Sarama clients through metric monitoring.
    *   Operational Issues (Medium Severity): Proactive identification of operational problems within Sarama clients that could indirectly lead to security vulnerabilities or data loss.
    *   Unauthorized Activity (Low Severity): Anomaly detection in Sarama client metrics might indicate unusual or unauthorized activity involving Sarama.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service: Low risk reduction. Monitoring Sarama metrics provides early warning but doesn't prevent DoS directly.
    *   Operational Issues: Medium risk reduction. Improved visibility into Sarama client behavior helps prevent operational issues that could have security implications.
    *   Unauthorized Activity: Low risk reduction. Sarama metrics are not a primary security control but can provide indicators.
*   **Currently Implemented:** We have Prometheus integration for collecting application metrics, but Sarama-specific metrics are not yet explicitly exposed and monitored.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  We need to instrument our Sarama clients to expose relevant metrics for Prometheus collection. This involves leveraging Sarama's metrics capabilities. Create Grafana dashboards to visualize these Sarama metrics and set up alerts for critical thresholds based on Sarama client performance.
