## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Sarama [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_sarama__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application by exploiting weaknesses in its use of the `sarama` library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Sarama Library [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_sarama_library__critical_node_.md)

This involves directly exploiting weaknesses within the `sarama` library itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Known Sarama Bugs/CVEs [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_known_sarama_bugscves__high_risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_publicly_disclosed_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers monitor for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in `sarama`. If the application uses an outdated version, attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities by sending crafted Kafka requests that trigger the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Kafka Communication via Sarama [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_kafka_communication_via_sarama__critical_node_.md)

This category focuses on attacks that manipulate the communication flow between the application and Kafka, leveraging `sarama`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Producer Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_producer_configuration__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Send Malicious Messages [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/send_malicious_messages__high_risk_path_.md)

If the producer is not configured securely, attackers can send malicious messages to Kafka.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Payloads into Produced Messages [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_payloads_into_produced_messages__high_risk_path_.md)

If the application doesn't sanitize data before sending, attackers can inject malicious payloads.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Code on Consumers via Deserialization Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_code_on_consumers_via_deserialization_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

If consumers deserialize messages without proper validation, malicious payloads can trigger deserialization vulnerabilities, leading to remote code execution on the consumer side.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Consumer Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_consumer_configuration__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Messages into Consumed Topics (External Attack) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_messages_into_consumed_topics__external_attack___high_risk_path_.md)

If other producers or the Kafka infrastructure is compromised, attackers can inject malicious messages into topics the application consumes, which `sarama` will deliver.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Consumer [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_consumer__high_risk_path_.md)

If the application doesn't sanitize messages received from Kafka before deserialization, attackers can inject malicious payloads that exploit deserialization vulnerabilities, leading to remote code execution within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Encryption/Authentication (If Not Properly Configured) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_encryptionauthentication__if_not_properly_configured___high_risk_path_.md)

If communication isn't encrypted or authenticated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept and Modify Messages in Transit [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_and_modify_messages_in_transit__high_risk_path_.md)

Without TLS/SSL, attackers can intercept and modify messages in transit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Impersonate Producers or Consumers [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/impersonate_producers_or_consumers__high_risk_path_.md)

Without SASL or other authentication, attackers can impersonate legitimate producers or consumers.
