# Attack Surface Analysis for shopify/sarama

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Communication (Lack of TLS)](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_communication__lack_of_tls_.md)

* **Description:** Communication between the application using Sarama and the Kafka brokers occurs without encryption.
    * **How Sarama Contributes:** Sarama allows configuration of whether to use TLS for connections. If TLS is not enabled or configured correctly, the communication channel is vulnerable.
    * **Example:** An attacker on the network intercepts data being sent or received by the application, including sensitive message content or authentication credentials.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive information, potential manipulation of data in transit.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enable TLS:** Configure Sarama to use TLS for all connections to Kafka brokers.
        * **Verify Server Certificate:** Ensure Sarama is configured to verify the Kafka broker's TLS certificate to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (Improper TLS Configuration)](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks__improper_tls_configuration_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker intercepts and potentially modifies communication between the application and Kafka brokers even when TLS is enabled, due to misconfiguration.
    * **How Sarama Contributes:** Sarama's TLS configuration options, if not set correctly (e.g., `InsecureSkipVerify` set to true), can leave the application vulnerable to MITM attacks.
    * **Example:** An attacker intercepts the connection and presents their own certificate, which the application trusts due to insecure configuration, allowing them to eavesdrop or modify traffic.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to Kafka topics.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid `InsecureSkipVerify: true`:** Never use this option in production environments.
        * **Use Proper Certificate Authority (CA):** Ensure the application trusts the CA that signed the Kafka broker's certificate.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass or Weak Authentication (SASL Misconfiguration)](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass_or_weak_authentication__sasl_misconfiguration_.md)

* **Description:**  The application fails to properly authenticate with the Kafka brokers, or uses weak authentication mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access.
    * **How Sarama Contributes:** Sarama provides support for various SASL mechanisms (e.g., Plain, SCRAM, GSSAPI). Misconfiguration or using insecure mechanisms can lead to vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:**  Using the "PLAIN" SASL mechanism over a non-TLS connection exposes credentials. Incorrectly configured Kerberos (GSSAPI) can lead to authentication failures or bypasses.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Kafka topics, data breaches, ability to produce or consume malicious messages.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Use Strong SASL Mechanisms:** Prefer SCRAM or GSSAPI over less secure options like PLAIN, especially without TLS.
        * **Configure SASL Correctly:** Ensure all necessary SASL configurations (username, password, Kerberos settings) are accurate and secure.

## Attack Surface: [Connecting to Malicious Brokers](./attack_surfaces/connecting_to_malicious_brokers.md)

* **Description:** The application is tricked into connecting to a rogue Kafka broker controlled by an attacker.
    * **How Sarama Contributes:** Sarama uses the provided broker list to establish connections. If this list is compromised or dynamically generated without proper validation, it can lead to connecting to malicious brokers.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies the application's configuration to point to their malicious Kafka broker. The application connects and sends sensitive data to the attacker.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive information, potential for the attacker to inject malicious messages into the real Kafka cluster.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Broker List Configuration:**  Store and manage the Kafka broker list securely.
        * **Implement Broker Discovery Mechanisms Carefully:** If using dynamic broker discovery, ensure the source of truth is trusted and validated.
