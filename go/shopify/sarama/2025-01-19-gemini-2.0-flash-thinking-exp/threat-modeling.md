# Threat Model Analysis for shopify/sarama

## Threat: [Plaintext Communication Vulnerability](./threats/plaintext_communication_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker could eavesdrop on network traffic between the application and Kafka brokers if TLS/SSL is not enabled in Sarama's configuration. They could capture sensitive data being transmitted, including message payloads and potentially authentication credentials handled by Sarama.

**Impact:** Information Disclosure, potential compromise of sensitive data.

**Affected Sarama Component:** `Config` (related to TLS configuration), underlying network connections managed by Sarama.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure TLS/SSL is explicitly enabled in Sarama's `Config`.
* Configure Sarama with the appropriate TLS configuration, including specifying the necessary certificates and enabling certificate verification to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Threat: [Insecure Authentication Configuration](./threats/insecure_authentication_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the Kafka cluster if weak or default authentication mechanisms are configured in Sarama or if credentials used by Sarama are not securely managed. This allows them to impersonate the application, produce or consume messages, potentially disrupting operations or accessing sensitive data.

**Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Data Breach, Service Disruption.

**Affected Sarama Component:** `Config` (related to SASL configuration), underlying authentication mechanisms used by Sarama.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize strong authentication mechanisms like SASL/SCRAM or mutual TLS (mTLS) within Sarama's `Config`.
* Securely manage and store Kafka credentials used by Sarama, avoiding hardcoding them in the application. Use environment variables or secrets management systems.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Connection Establishment](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_connection_establishment.md)

**Description:** An attacker positioned between the application and the Kafka brokers could intercept the connection establishment process initiated by Sarama. Without proper TLS configuration and certificate validation in Sarama, they could potentially impersonate either the application or the broker, leading to the application connecting to a malicious entity or the attacker gaining access to communication handled by Sarama.

**Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Data Tampering, Information Disclosure.

**Affected Sarama Component:** Underlying network connection establishment within Sarama, particularly during the initial handshake governed by Sarama's internal logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce TLS/SSL with proper certificate validation within Sarama's `Config` to ensure the identity of the Kafka brokers.
* Consider using mTLS for stronger authentication and mutual verification configured through Sarama.

## Threat: [Message Injection or Modification (Without TLS)](./threats/message_injection_or_modification__without_tls_.md)

**Description:** If TLS is not enabled in Sarama's configuration, an attacker could intercept network traffic and inject malicious messages into Kafka topics or modify existing messages in transit handled by Sarama's producer. This could lead to data corruption, application malfunction, or the execution of unintended actions by consumers.

**Impact:** Data Tampering, Service Disruption, Potential for further exploitation depending on message content.

**Affected Sarama Component:** `SyncProducer`, `AsyncProducer` components within Sarama responsible for sending messages.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce TLS/SSL for all Kafka connections configured through Sarama.
* While TLS protects in transit, consider implementing message signing or encryption at the application level for end-to-end security, independent of Sarama's transport layer security.
