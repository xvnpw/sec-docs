## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce TLS Encryption (Sarama Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_tls_encryption__sarama_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce TLS Encryption for all Kafka communication using Sarama's configuration options.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain Certificates:** Obtain valid TLS certificates (CA, client certificate, client key).
    2.  **Configure Sarama:** In your Sarama configuration (`sarama.Config`):
        *   `Config.Net.TLS.Enable = true`
        *   `Config.Net.TLS.Config = &tls.Config{...}`: Populate this with certificate information. Load the CA certificate, client certificate, and client key.
            ```go
            tlsConfig = &tls.Config{
                Certificates: []tls.Certificate{clientCert}, // Load client cert and key
                RootCAs:      caCertPool,                   // Load CA cert
            }
            config.Net.TLS.Config = tlsConfig
            ```
        *   *Crucially: Avoid `InsecureSkipVerify = true` in production.* If used during development, remove it before deployment.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Data Eavesdropping:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** (Severity: Medium) - Contributes to authentication.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **MITM Attacks:** Risk reduced to near zero with proper certificate validation.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping:** Risk reduced to near zero.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (with SASL).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. TLS enabled in `producer` (`producer/config.go`), but `InsecureSkipVerify = true`. `consumer` (`consumer/config.go`) has no TLS.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Remove `InsecureSkipVerify = true` from `producer`.
    *   Implement TLS in `consumer`, including certificate loading.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement SASL Authentication (Sarama Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_sasl_authentication__sarama_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement SASL Authentication using Sarama's configuration.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a SASL Mechanism:** Select `SASL/SCRAM-SHA-256`, `SASL/SCRAM-SHA-512`, `SASL/PLAIN`, `SASL/GSSAPI`, or `SASL/OAUTHBEARER`.
    2.  **Configure Sarama:** In your `sarama.Config`:
        *   `Config.Net.SASL.Enable = true`
        *   `Config.Net.SASL.Mechanism = sarama.SASLTypeSCRAMSHA256` (or your choice)
        *   `Config.Net.SASL.User = "your_kafka_user"`
        *   `Config.Net.SASL.Password = "your_kafka_password"` (or credentials for other mechanisms)
        *   For SCRAM, you might need `Config.Net.SASL.SCRAMClientGeneratorFunc`.
        *   For OAUTHBEARER, you will need to set `Config.Net.SASL.TokenProvider`.
    3.  **Secure Credential Storage:** *Never* hardcode credentials. Use environment variables or a secrets management service.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** (Severity: Medium) - Strong SASL mechanisms help.
    *   **Credential Theft:** (Severity: High) - Secure storage is crucial.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk near zero with proper SASL and strong credentials.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced with strong SASL.
    *   **Credential Theft:** Risk significantly reduced with secure storage.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. Neither `producer` nor `consumer` have SASL configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement SASL in both `producer` and `consumer`.
    *   Implement secure credential storage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Consumer Group Settings (Sarama Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_consumer_group_settings__sarama_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Sarama's Consumer Group settings to optimize rebalancing and failure detection.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`Session.Timeout` and `Heartbeat.Interval`:**
        *   `Config.Consumer.Group.Session.Timeout`:  Set to a reasonable value (e.g., 10-30 seconds) based on processing time and latency.
        *   `Config.Consumer.Group.Heartbeat.Interval`:  Should be significantly less than `Session.Timeout` (e.g., 1/3).
    2.  **`Rebalance.Timeout`:** Set `Config.Consumer.Group.Rebalance.Timeout`.
    3.  **Static Membership (Optional):** If using Kafka 2.3+, consider static membership: `Config.Consumer.Group.InstanceId = "unique_id"`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **DoS due to Frequent Rebalancing:** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Delayed Failure Detection:** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Data Loss/Duplication (Indirectly):** (Severity: Low)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS (Rebalancing):** Risk significantly reduced with proper timeouts and static membership.
    *   **Delayed Failure Detection:** Risk significantly reduced with proper timeouts.
    *   **Data Loss/Duplication:** Risk indirectly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. `consumer` has basic settings, but not optimized. Defaults used for timeouts.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Tune `Session.Timeout` and `Heartbeat.Interval`.
    *   Consider static membership.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Producer and Consumer Resource Usage (Sarama Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/control_producer_and_consumer_resource_usage__sarama_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Control resource usage via Sarama's producer and consumer configuration.

*   **Description:**
    *   **Producer:**
        1.  **`Config.Producer.Flush` Settings:**
            *   `Config.Producer.Flush.Frequency`
            *   `Config.Producer.Flush.Messages`
            *   `Config.Producer.Flush.Bytes`
            *   Tune these based on throughput and broker capacity.
        2.  **`Config.Producer.MaxMessageBytes`:** Set a reasonable limit.
    *   **Consumer:**
        1.  **`Config.Consumer.Fetch.Default` and `Config.Consumer.Fetch.Max`:**
            *   Set these to avoid fetching excessive data.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **DoS (Producer):** (Severity: High) - Overwhelming brokers.
    *   **DoS (Consumer):** (Severity: High) - Excessive resource consumption.
    *   **Application Instability:** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS (Producer):** Risk significantly reduced with proper buffer sizes and `MaxMessageBytes`.
    *   **DoS (Consumer):** Risk significantly reduced with controlled fetch sizes.
    *   **Application Instability:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. `producer` and `consumer` have some settings, but not fully optimized.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Tune `Config.Producer.Flush` settings.
    *   Tune `Config.Consumer.Fetch` settings.
    *   Set `Config.Producer.MaxMessageBytes`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Error Handling and Recovery (Sarama Usage)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_error_handling_and_recovery__sarama_usage_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Use Sarama's features and proper coding practices for robust error handling.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Check All Errors:** Always check errors returned by Sarama functions.
    2.  **Idempotent Producers:** Use `Config.Producer.Idempotent = true` (Kafka 0.11+).
    3.  **Transactional Producers:** For exactly-once semantics, use Sarama's transactional API.
    4.  **Offset Management:** Carefully manage consumer offsets.  Choose between automatic (`Config.Consumer.Offsets.AutoCommit.Enable = true`) and manual committing. If manual, commit *after* successful processing.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Loss:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Data Duplication:** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Application Crashes:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Inconsistent State:** (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Loss:** Risk significantly reduced with error handling, retries, and potentially DLQs (DLQs themselves are not a *direct* Sarama feature).
    *   **Data Duplication:** Risk significantly reduced with idempotent/transactional producers and offset management.
    *   **Application Crashes:** Risk significantly reduced with error handling.
    *   **Inconsistent State:** Risk significantly reduced with transactions and offset management.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. Basic error handling exists, but not comprehensive. No retries or DLQs.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Idempotent or transactional producers should be considered.
    *   Offset management needs review and potential improvement.
