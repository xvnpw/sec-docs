## Threat: [Unauthorized Kafka Access via Stolen Credentials (Used by Sarama)](./threats/unauthorized_kafka_access_via_stolen_credentials__used_by_sarama_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Kafka Access via Stolen Credentials (Used by Sarama)

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to credentials (username/password, API keys, TLS certificates) that are *used by the Sarama client* to connect to Kafka. The attacker could then use a *different* Kafka client (or even a modified version of Sarama) with these stolen credentials to connect directly to the Kafka cluster, bypassing any application-specific logic. The vulnerability isn't *within* Sarama's code, but Sarama is the configured *mechanism* for connection, and its configuration holds the vulnerable credentials.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach: Sensitive data within Kafka topics is exposed.
        *   Data corruption: Attacker can inject malicious messages or delete existing data.
        *   Service disruption: Attacker can delete topics or disrupt consumer groups.
    *   **Sarama Component Affected:**  `Config` object (specifically, fields related to authentication: `Config.Net.SASL`, `Config.Net.TLS`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** hardcode credentials in the application code or configuration files loaded by Sarama.
        *   Use environment variables to store credentials.
        *   Employ a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) and integrate it with the application to dynamically provide credentials to Sarama.
        *   Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for Kafka users (if supported by the Kafka cluster).
        *   Regularly rotate credentials.
        *   Monitor Kafka access logs for suspicious activity originating from the application's configured identity.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack due to Disabled TLS or Incorrect Certificate Validation in Sarama](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_due_to_disabled_tls_or_incorrect_certificate_validation_in_sarama.md)

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack due to Disabled TLS or Incorrect Certificate Validation in Sarama

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the network traffic between the Sarama client and the Kafka brokers. If TLS is disabled within Sarama's configuration, or if TLS is enabled but improperly configured (e.g., `InsecureSkipVerify = true` in the `tls.Config`), the attacker can read and modify messages in transit without detection. This is a direct vulnerability in how Sarama is *used* to establish the connection.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach: Sensitive data transmitted between the application and Kafka is exposed.
        *   Data corruption: Attacker can modify messages in transit, leading to incorrect data processing.
        *   Loss of message integrity: The application cannot trust the data received from Kafka.
    *   **Sarama Component Affected:** `Config.Net.TLS` configuration options. Specifically, `Config.Net.TLS.Enable`, `Config.Net.TLS.Config`, and the `InsecureSkipVerify` field within the Go standard library's `tls.Config` struct (which Sarama uses).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always** enable TLS encryption: Set `Config.Net.TLS.Enable = true` when connecting to a TLS-enabled Kafka cluster.
        *   Provide the correct CA certificate(s) to `Config.Net.TLS.Config`.
        *   **Never** set `InsecureSkipVerify = true` in a production environment. This bypasses crucial security checks.
        *   Ensure the Kafka brokers are configured to require TLS connections.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Client-Side, Sarama Configuration)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion__client-side__sarama_configuration_.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Client-Side, Sarama Configuration)

    *   **Description:** Improper configuration of Sarama's internal buffers, connection limits, or retry mechanisms can lead to the *client application* consuming excessive resources (memory, CPU, file descriptors, network connections). This is a direct consequence of how Sarama is configured and used, making the application vulnerable to crashes or unresponsiveness, even without malicious intent (e.g., under heavy, legitimate load).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application unavailability: The application using Sarama becomes unable to process Kafka messages.
        *   Potential data loss: Messages may be lost if the application crashes before committing offsets (depending on consumer configuration).
        *   System instability: Resource exhaustion can impact other applications running on the same host.
    *   **Sarama Component Affected:** Various `Config` options related to resource management:
        *   `Config.Producer.Flush`: Controls buffering and flushing behavior for producers.
        *   `Config.Consumer.Fetch`: Controls the amount of data fetched by consumers.
        *   `Config.Net.MaxOpenRequests`: Limits concurrent requests.
        *   `Config.Producer.Retry`, `Config.Consumer.Retry`, `Config.Metadata.Retry`: Control retry behavior, which can consume resources if not limited.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully tune Sarama's configuration parameters based on expected load, message sizes, and available resources.  There's no one-size-fits-all; testing is crucial.
        *   Implement rate limiting and backpressure mechanisms *within the application* to prevent overwhelming Sarama.
        *   Monitor application resource usage (memory, CPU, open connections) and set alerts.
        *   Use appropriate timeouts for network operations within Sarama's configuration.
        *   Implement circuit breakers or other resilience patterns *in the application* to handle temporary broker unavailability gracefully.

## Threat: [Message Loss due to Insufficient Producer Acknowledgements (Sarama Configuration)](./threats/message_loss_due_to_insufficient_producer_acknowledgements__sarama_configuration_.md)

*   **Threat:** Message Loss due to Insufficient Producer Acknowledgements (Sarama Configuration)

    *   **Description:** If the Sarama producer is configured with a low `RequiredAcks` setting (e.g., `NoResponse`), messages may be lost if a broker fails *before* replicating the message. The producer, as configured through Sarama, sends the message and doesn't wait for sufficient confirmation, leading to potential data loss. This is a direct result of Sarama's configuration.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data loss: Messages sent by the producer are not persisted to Kafka.
        *   Data inconsistency: Downstream systems may receive incomplete or inconsistent data.
    *   **Sarama Component Affected:** `Config.Producer.RequiredAcks`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the criticality of the data; can be Critical for some use cases)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Set `Config.Producer.RequiredAcks` to `WaitForAll` (or at least `WaitForLocal`) for strong durability guarantees. The appropriate setting depends on the application's requirements.
        *   Implement error handling for producer failures (check the `Errors()` channel of the `AsyncProducer`). This allows the application to react to failures.
        *   Consider using idempotent producers (`Config.Producer.Idempotent = true`) to prevent duplicate messages in case of retries, especially when using `WaitForAll`.

## Threat: [Deadlock in Asynchronous Operations (Improper Sarama Usage)](./threats/deadlock_in_asynchronous_operations__improper_sarama_usage_.md)

* **Threat:** Deadlock in Asynchronous Operations (Improper Sarama Usage)

    * **Description:** Improper use of channels when interacting with Sarama's `AsyncProducer` or `ConsumerGroup` can lead to deadlocks *within the application*.  For example, failing to read from the `Errors()` or `Successes()` channels of an `AsyncProducer` can cause the producer to block indefinitely, even if Kafka is functioning correctly. This is a direct consequence of how the application interacts with Sarama's asynchronous APIs.
    * **Impact:**
        * Application hangs: The application becomes completely unresponsive and stops processing messages.
        * Resource exhaustion: Goroutines and other resources may be leaked, potentially impacting the entire system.
    * **Sarama Component Affected:** `AsyncProducer`, `ConsumerGroup`, and their associated channels (`Errors()`, `Successes()`, `Notifications()`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Always** read from the `Errors()` and `Successes()` channels of an `AsyncProducer` in a separate goroutine. This is essential for correct operation.
        * **Always** handle the `Notifications()` channel of a `ConsumerGroup` in a separate goroutine.
        * Use buffered channels where appropriate to avoid blocking.
        * Use timeouts when reading from channels to prevent indefinite waits.
        * Thoroughly test concurrent code for potential deadlocks using tools like the Go race detector and deadlock detection tools.
