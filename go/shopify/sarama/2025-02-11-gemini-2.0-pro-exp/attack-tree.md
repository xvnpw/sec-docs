## Attack Tree Path: [1. Disrupt Service Availability ([[1. Disrupt Service Availability]])](./attack_tree_paths/1__disrupt_service_availability____1__disrupt_service_availability___.md)

*   **Overall Goal:** To make the application unavailable to legitimate users. This is a *critical* node because service disruption directly impacts business operations.

*   **1.1 Denial of Service (DoS) via Sarama ([[1.1 Denial of Service (DoS) via Sarama]])**
    *   **Overall Goal:** Render the application unresponsive by exploiting Sarama or its interaction with the application.
    *   **1.1.2 Network-Level Attacks Amplified by Sarama:**
        *   **Description:** Attacker uses general network attacks (e.g., SYN floods, connection exhaustion) that are made more effective because of how Sarama manages connections.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium/High
        *   **Effort:** Low/Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy/Medium

*   **1.2 Inject Malicious Messages (Poison Pill) ([[1.2 Inject Malicious Messages (Poison Pill)]])**
    *   **Overall Goal:** Send specially crafted messages that cause the application to crash or malfunction when processed.
    *   **1.2.1 Exploit Application Logic Vulnerabilities ([[1.2.1 Exploit Application Logic Vulnerabilities]]):**
        *   **Description:** The message exploits a bug in the application's code that handles data received from Kafka.  This is *critical* due to its high impact and medium likelihood.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High/Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium/High
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium/Hard
    *   **1.2.2 Trigger Deserialization Issues ([[1.2.2 Trigger Deserialization Issues]]):**
        *   **Description:** If the application uses an insecure deserializer, the attacker sends a malicious serialized object, potentially leading to remote code execution. This is *critical* due to its very high impact.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium/High
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

*   **1.3 Exploit Sarama Configuration Errors ([[1.3 Exploit Sarama Configuration Errors]])**
    *   **Overall Goal:** Leverage misconfigurations in how Sarama is used to cause service disruption.
    *   **1.3.1 Incorrect Timeout Settings ([[1.3.1 Incorrect Timeout Settings]]):**
        *   **Description:** Overly long timeouts allow an attacker to tie up resources, leading to slow performance or unavailability. This is *critical* due to its low effort and medium impact.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Low/Medium
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie/Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **1.3.2 Insufficient Retry Limits ([[1.3.2 Insufficient Retry Limits]]):**
        *   **Description:** An attacker can cause repeated retries, exhausting resources. This is *critical* due to its low effort and medium impact.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Low/Medium
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie/Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **1.3.3 Unintentional Topic Creation ([[1.3.3 Unintentional Topic Creation]]):**
        *   **Description:** If automatic topic creation is enabled and not controlled, an attacker can create many topics, overwhelming the Kafka brokers. This is *critical* due to its low effort and potentially high impact.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low/Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium/High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Gain Unauthorized Access/Control ([[3. Gain Unauthorized Access/Control]])](./attack_tree_paths/3__gain_unauthorized_accesscontrol____3__gain_unauthorized_accesscontrol___.md)

*   **Overall Goal:** To obtain unauthorized access to data or control over the Kafka-based application. This is a *critical* node because it represents a severe security breach.

*   **3.3 Leverage Weak Authentication/Authorization ([[3.3 Leverage Weak Authentication/Authorization]])**
    *   **Overall Goal:** Exploit weak security configurations to gain access.
    *   **3.3.1 Weak Credentials ([[3.3.1 Weak Credentials]]):**
        *   **Description:** Using default, easily guessable, or compromised passwords. This is *critical* due to its high likelihood and very high impact.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie/Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy/Medium
    *   **3.3.2 Missing Authentication ([[3.3.2 Missing Authentication]]):**
        *   **Description:** Not enabling authentication at all, allowing anyone to connect. This is *critical* due to its trivial exploitability and very high impact.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie

    *   **3.3.3 Overly Permissive ACLs ([[3.3.3 Overly Permissive ACLs]]):**
        *   **Description:** Granting users or applications more permissions than they need. This is *critical* due to its low effort and high impact.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low/Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
