# Threat Model Analysis for shopify/sarama

## Threat: [Plaintext Credentials in Configuration](./threats/plaintext_credentials_in_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker gains unauthorized access to application configuration files and extracts plaintext Kafka credentials used by Sarama.
*   **Impact:** Attacker can authenticate as the application to Kafka brokers, enabling unauthorized data access, manipulation, or disruption within Kafka.
*   **Sarama Component Affected:** Configuration loading, affecting all Sarama components (Producer, Consumer, Admin) that rely on authentication.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use secure secrets management systems to store Kafka credentials instead of plaintext configuration.
    *   Encrypt configuration files at rest.
    *   Utilize environment variables with restricted access for credentials.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in SASL Mechanisms](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_sasl_mechanisms.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits vulnerabilities in SASL mechanisms implemented within Sarama or its underlying Go dependencies for authentication.
*   **Impact:** Complete bypass of Kafka authentication, granting unauthorized access to Kafka brokers and data. Potential for data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.
*   **Sarama Component Affected:** `sarama/sasl` package, specifically the implementation of SASL mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong and up-to-date SASL mechanisms like SCRAM-SHA-256 or SCRAM-SHA-512.
    *   Regularly update Sarama and Go dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor security advisories related to Sarama and Go's SASL implementations.

## Threat: [Unencrypted Communication (Plaintext Kafka Protocol)](./threats/unencrypted_communication__plaintext_kafka_protocol_.md)

*   **Description:** Sarama is configured to communicate with Kafka brokers using the plaintext Kafka protocol without TLS encryption.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted in Kafka messages to network eavesdroppers. Potential for data breaches and compromise of confidential information.
*   **Sarama Component Affected:** Network connection handling within Sarama's Producer and Consumer components.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always enable TLS encryption for Kafka communication in Sarama configuration.**
    *   Configure Sarama to use `net.Config.TLSConfig` to enable TLS and verify server certificates.
    *   Ensure Kafka brokers are configured to enforce TLS.

## Threat: [Weak TLS Configuration](./threats/weak_tls_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** TLS is enabled in Sarama, but configured with weak settings (outdated TLS versions, weak cipher suites, disabled certificate verification).
*   **Impact:** Compromise of data confidentiality and integrity in transit. Potential for man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept or modify Kafka messages despite TLS being enabled in principle.
*   **Sarama Component Affected:** `net.Config.TLSConfig` configuration within Sarama's Producer and Consumer components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or higher).
    *   Configure strong cipher suites and disable weak ones.
    *   **Enable and enforce certificate verification** in Sarama's TLS configuration.
    *   Regularly review and update TLS configurations based on security best practices.

## Threat: [Message Tampering in Transit (Without TLS)](./threats/message_tampering_in_transit__without_tls_.md)

*   **Description:** If TLS is not used, an attacker can intercept and modify messages in transit between the application and Kafka brokers.
*   **Impact:** Compromised data integrity. Attacker can alter message content, potentially leading to incorrect application behavior, data corruption, or malicious data injection.
*   **Sarama Component Affected:** Network communication within Sarama's Producer and Consumer components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce TLS encryption for all Kafka communication. This is the primary mitigation.**
    *   Consider application-level message signing or encryption for defense in depth.
