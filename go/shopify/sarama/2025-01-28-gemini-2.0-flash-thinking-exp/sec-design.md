# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Sarama project, as a Go client library for Apache Kafka, aims to provide a robust, efficient, and widely adopted solution for Go applications to interact with Kafka clusters.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Enable Go developers to easily integrate with Apache Kafka.
- Provide a high-performance Kafka client library in Go.
- Offer a reliable and stable client for production environments.
- Support core Kafka features and functionalities.
- Maintain compatibility with various Kafka versions.
- Foster community adoption and contribution.

Business Risks:
- Data loss or corruption during message production or consumption.
- Service disruption due to client library instability or bugs.
- Performance bottlenecks introduced by inefficient client implementation.
- Security vulnerabilities in the client library leading to unauthorized access or data breaches.
- Compatibility issues with newer or older Kafka versions causing application failures.
- Lack of community support or maintenance leading to project stagnation.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Code review process for contributions (described in GitHub repository contribution guidelines).
- security control: Dependency management using Go modules to track and manage dependencies (implicitly used in Go projects).
- security control: Static analysis and linting as part of development process (best practice in Go development, not explicitly mentioned but assumed).

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in dependencies (mitigated by dependency management and updates).
- accepted risk: Misconfiguration of the library by end-users leading to security issues (user responsibility).
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in Kafka brokers themselves (external dependency, user responsibility to secure Kafka cluster).

Recommended Security Controls:
- recommended security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline for the library.
- recommended security control: Provide clear documentation and examples on secure configuration and usage of the library, including TLS/SSL and SASL authentication.
- recommended security control: Establish a process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in the library.
- recommended security control: Consider providing security-focused configuration options with safer defaults.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Support SASL/PLAIN and SASL/SCRAM authentication mechanisms for secure connection to Kafka brokers.
    - Requirement: Support TLS/SSL encryption for communication with Kafka brokers.
    - Requirement: Provide mechanisms for users to configure and manage authentication credentials securely (e.g., environment variables, configuration files).
- Authorization:
    - Requirement:  The library should correctly implement Kafka's authorization protocols to ensure users can only access authorized topics and perform allowed operations (this is largely dependent on Kafka broker configuration and user permissions, but the client must correctly handle authorization responses).
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Implement input validation to prevent common injection attacks, especially when handling user-provided data that might be used in Kafka messages or configurations. While the library primarily handles Kafka protocol, validation of configuration parameters is crucial.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Utilize robust and well-vetted cryptographic libraries for TLS/SSL and SASL/SCRAM implementations.
    - Requirement: Ensure proper handling of cryptographic keys and secrets, avoiding hardcoding or insecure storage.

2.  **Cloud Deployment (IaaS):** Go application and Kafka cluster are deployed on cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs, GCP Compute Engine).
3.  **Cloud Deployment (PaaS/Managed Kafka):** Go application is deployed on cloud platform (e.g., AWS ECS, Azure Kubernetes Service, GCP Cloud Run), and Kafka cluster is a managed service (e.g., AWS MSK, Azure Event Hubs, GCP Cloud Pub/Sub - although Pub/Sub is not strictly Kafka, it's a similar managed messaging service).
4.  **Hybrid Deployment:** Combination of on-premise and cloud deployments.

```

Build Process Description:

1.  **Code Changes:** A Go developer makes code changes to the Sarama library and commits them to a version control system (e.g., GitHub).
2.  **Version Control System (e.g., GitHub):** The version control system stores the source code and triggers the CI/CD pipeline upon code changes (e.g., via webhook).
3.  **CI/CD System (e.g., GitHub Actions):** A CI/CD system (like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI) is configured to automate the build, test, and security scanning process.
4.  **Checkout Code:** The CI/CD system checks out the latest source code from the version control system.
5.  **Build & Test:** The CI/CD system builds the Go library using Go build tools and runs automated tests (unit tests, integration tests).
6.  **Build Artifacts (Go Library):** The build process produces build artifacts, which are the compiled Go library files.
7.  **Security Scans (SAST, Dependency Check):** Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools and dependency check tools are used to scan the source code and dependencies for potential security vulnerabilities.
8.  **Scan Results:** The security scan tools generate reports with findings of potential vulnerabilities.
9.  **Quality Gates & Policy Checks:** Automated quality gates and policy checks are implemented to evaluate the build quality and security scan results against predefined criteria. This step determines if the build process should proceed or fail.
10. **Pass/Fail:** Based on the quality gates and policy checks, the build process either passes or fails.
11. **Artifact Repository (e.g., Go Modules Proxy):** If the build process passes, the build artifacts (Go library) are published to an artifact repository (e.g., Go Modules Proxy, JFrog Artifactory, Sonatype Nexus).
12. **Notification to Developers:** If the build process fails, notifications are sent to developers to address the issues.
13. **Artifact Repository (e.g., Go Modules Proxy):** The artifact repository securely stores and manages the released versions of the Sarama library, making them available for Go developers to use in their applications.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Applications relying on Sarama for real-time data ingestion, processing, and streaming.
- Event-driven architectures that depend on Kafka messaging facilitated by Sarama.
- Data pipelines that use Kafka and Sarama for data movement and transformation.
- Any business process that depends on the reliable and secure delivery of messages through Kafka using the Sarama library.

Data Sensitivity:
- The sensitivity of data handled by Sarama depends entirely on the Kafka topics and messages being processed by applications using the library.
- Data sensitivity can range from public information to highly confidential data, including personal data, financial data, and proprietary business information.
- The Sarama library itself does not inherently handle sensitive data, but it facilitates the transport and processing of data within applications.
- Data sensitivity should be assessed in the context of the applications using Sarama and the Kafka topics they interact with.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the primary use case for the Sarama library within the organization? (e.g., real-time analytics, microservices communication, data ingestion).
- What type of data will be processed using Sarama and Kafka? What is the sensitivity level of this data?
- What is the deployment environment for applications using Sarama and Kafka? (On-premise, cloud, hybrid).
- What are the specific security requirements and compliance standards that need to be met?
- What existing security controls are in place for the Kafka infrastructure and the applications using Sarama?
- What is the organization's risk appetite regarding security vulnerabilities in open-source libraries?

Assumptions:
- The Sarama library will be used in production environments for business-critical applications.
- Security and reliability are important considerations for the use of the Sarama library.
- Applications using Sarama will handle some level of sensitive data (at least business-related data).
- The deployment environment will likely involve cloud infrastructure or a hybrid approach.
- The organization is concerned about security risks associated with open-source software and wants to ensure secure usage of Sarama.
- The organization has a standard software development lifecycle and security practices that should be integrated with the use of Sarama.
