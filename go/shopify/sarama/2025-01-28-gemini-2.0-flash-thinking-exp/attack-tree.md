## Attack Tree Path: [1. High-Risk Path: Exploit Kafka Interaction via Sarama](./attack_tree_paths/1__high-risk_path_exploit_kafka_interaction_via_sarama.md)

*   **Category:** Attacks that leverage the interaction between the application (using Sarama) and the Kafka cluster itself. These attacks exploit weaknesses in how the application handles Kafka messages and communication.

    *   **High-Risk Path: Message Injection/Manipulation**
        *   **Description:** Attackers aim to inject malicious messages into Kafka topics or manipulate messages in transit to compromise the application's logic or data.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Critical Node: Produce Malicious Messages to Kafka Topics (2.1.1)**
                *   **Attack Vector Details:**
                    *   Attacker gains the ability to produce messages to Kafka topics consumed by the application. This could be due to:
                        *   Unauthorized access to Kafka producer credentials.
                        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in systems that produce messages to Kafka (if the attacker can compromise an upstream system).
                        *   In scenarios where Kafka topic production is less strictly controlled (e.g., development environments).
                    *   Attacker crafts malicious messages designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's message processing logic. This could include:
                        *   Payloads designed to trigger buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues in the application's message handling code.
                        *   Messages containing malicious commands or data that, when processed by the application, lead to unintended actions, data corruption, or security breaches.
                        *   Messages designed to bypass input validation if it is weak or incomplete.
                *   **Impact:** Data corruption, application logic compromise, potentially leading to broader system compromise depending on application functionality.
                *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all messages consumed from Kafka within the application logic. Define and enforce message schemas. Apply principle of least privilege for Kafka producer access.

            *   **High-Risk Path: Intercept and Modify Messages in Transit (Man-in-the-Middle - Mitigated by TLS, but consider misconfigurations) (2.1.2)**
                *   **Attack Vector Details:**
                    *   Attacker positions themselves in the network path between the application (Sarama client) and the Kafka brokers.
                    *   If TLS encryption is not enabled or is misconfigured for Kafka communication, the attacker can intercept network traffic.
                    *   Attacker modifies messages in transit before they reach the application or Kafka broker. This could involve:
                        *   Changing message content to inject malicious data or commands.
                        *   Altering message metadata to disrupt message routing or processing.
                        *   Eavesdropping on message content to steal sensitive information if encryption is absent.
                *   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, confidentiality breach if messages contain sensitive data.
                *   **Mitigation:** **Enforce TLS encryption for all Kafka communication in Sarama configurations.** Regularly review TLS configurations and certificate management. Ensure proper network segmentation and access control to minimize attacker positioning opportunities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. High-Risk Path: Application Misuse of Sarama (Configuration & Implementation Flaws)](./attack_tree_paths/2__high-risk_path_application_misuse_of_sarama__configuration_&_implementation_flaws_.md)

*   **Category:** Vulnerabilities arising from how the application is configured to use Sarama and how the application code interacts with the Sarama library. These are often due to developer errors or oversights.

    *   **Critical Node: Insecure Sarama Configuration (3.1)**
        *   **Description:**  Misconfigurations in Sarama settings that weaken security and create vulnerabilities.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Critical Node: Hardcoded or Weak Credentials in Sarama Configuration (3.1.1)**
                *   **Attack Vector Details:**
                    *   Kafka credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys, TLS certificates/keys) are directly embedded in the application's source code, configuration files, or environment variables without proper protection.
                    *   Attackers can discover these credentials through:
                        *   Source code analysis (if code is exposed or leaked).
                        *   Access to configuration files (if improperly secured).
                        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow reading environment variables or configuration settings.
                    *   Compromised credentials grant attackers unauthorized access to the Kafka cluster.
                *   **Impact:** Critical - Full compromise of Kafka cluster access, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and DoS.
                *   **Mitigation:** **Never hardcode credentials.** Use secure configuration management practices (e.g., environment variables, secrets management systems like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager). Ensure proper access control to configuration files and secrets storage.

            *   **Critical Node: Disabled or Weak Security Features (e.g., No TLS, No Authentication) (3.1.2)**
                *   **Attack Vector Details:**
                    *   Sarama is configured to communicate with Kafka without TLS encryption, leaving communication vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation.
                    *   Authentication mechanisms (like SASL/SCRAM or mutual TLS) are disabled or weakly configured, allowing unauthorized access to Kafka brokers.
                    *   Attackers can exploit this by:
                        *   Eavesdropping on network traffic to intercept messages (if TLS is disabled).
                        *   Connecting to Kafka brokers without proper authentication (if authentication is disabled or weak).
                        *   Performing Man-in-the-Middle attacks to modify communication (if TLS is disabled).
                *   **Impact:** High - Confidentiality breach, data integrity compromise, unauthorized access to Kafka cluster.
                *   **Mitigation:** **Always enable TLS encryption and strong authentication (SASL/SCRAM or mutual TLS) for Kafka communication in Sarama configurations.** Regularly audit security configurations to ensure they are correctly applied and enforced.

    *   **Critical Node: Improper Error Handling in Sarama Client (3.2)**
        *   **Description:**  Insufficient or incorrect error handling in the application's Sarama client code.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Critical Node: Application Fails to Handle Sarama Errors Gracefully (3.2.1)**
                *   **Attack Vector Details:**
                    *   Application code does not properly check for and handle errors returned by Sarama during Kafka operations (e.g., connection errors, produce errors, consume errors).
                    *   This can lead to:
                        *   Application crashes or unexpected behavior when errors occur.
                        *   Information leakage through unhandled error messages that might expose internal system details or sensitive data.
                        *   Denial of Service if errors cause resource exhaustion or application instability.
                        *   Potential for further exploitation if error states leave the application in an insecure state.
                *   **Impact:** Medium - Application instability, DoS, information leakage through error messages, potential for further exploitation if errors lead to insecure states.
                *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust error handling for all Sarama operations (produce, consume, connect, etc.). Log errors appropriately for monitoring and debugging, but avoid logging sensitive information in error messages. Implement retry mechanisms and circuit breakers to handle transient errors gracefully.

    *   **Critical Node: Lack of Input Validation on Consumed Messages (Application Logic Flaw, but related to Sarama usage) (3.3)**
        *   **Description:**  The application processes messages consumed from Kafka without proper validation of their content.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Critical Node: Process Untrusted Data from Kafka Topics Without Validation (3.3.1)**
                *   **Attack Vector Details:**
                    *   Application code directly processes data from Kafka messages without validating its format, type, or content against expected schemas or security policies.
                    *   Attackers can inject malicious data into Kafka topics (as described in 2.1.1) that exploits this lack of validation.
                    *   This can lead to various vulnerabilities depending on how the application processes the unvalidated data, including:
                        *   Data corruption in application databases or storage.
                        *   Application logic bypass or manipulation.
                        *   Injection vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, XSS) if the unvalidated data is used in database queries, system commands, or web outputs.
                *   **Impact:** High - Data corruption, application logic compromise, potentially leading to broader system compromise, XSS, SQL injection if data is used in web contexts or databases.
                *   **Mitigation:** **Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all data consumed from Kafka within the application logic.** Treat Kafka messages as untrusted input. Define and enforce message schemas. Use secure parsing and data handling libraries.
