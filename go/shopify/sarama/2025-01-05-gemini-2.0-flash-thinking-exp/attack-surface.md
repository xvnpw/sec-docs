# Attack Surface Analysis for shopify/sarama

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Network Communication (Lack of TLS)](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_network_communication__lack_of_tls_.md)

*   **Description:** Data exchanged between the Sarama client and Kafka brokers is transmitted in plaintext.
    *   **How Sarama Contributes:** Sarama handles the network connection setup and data transmission. If TLS is not configured within Sarama, it will establish unencrypted connections.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the network can eavesdrop on the communication and read sensitive data being sent to or received from Kafka. This could include message content or even authentication credentials if transmitted insecurely.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configure Sarama for TLS:** Explicitly enable and configure TLS settings within your Sarama configuration, pointing to the necessary certificate authority (CA) certificates. Ensure `config.Net.TLS.Enable = true` and configure `config.Net.TLS.Config`.
        *   **Use Strong Cipher Suites:** Configure Sarama to use strong and up-to-date TLS cipher suites to prevent downgrade attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Authentication/Authorization](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_authenticationauthorization.md)

*   **Description:** The Sarama client connects to Kafka without proper authentication, or the Kafka brokers do not enforce adequate authorization policies related to the authenticated client.
    *   **How Sarama Contributes:** Sarama provides mechanisms to configure authentication (e.g., SASL). If not configured, Sarama will attempt to connect anonymously.
    *   **Example:** An unauthorized client (or attacker) can connect to Kafka, produce messages to topics they shouldn't, consume messages they are not authorized to access, or perform administrative actions if authorization is not properly configured on the broker side for the identity Sarama uses.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access, potential disruption of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configure Sarama Authentication:** In your Sarama configuration, provide the necessary authentication credentials and mechanisms that match your Kafka broker setup (e.g., `config.Net.SASL.Enable = true` and configure the specific SASL mechanism like PLAIN, SCRAM, or GSSAPI).
        *   **Use Strong Credentials Management:** Ensure that credentials used by Sarama are stored securely and are not hardcoded.

## Attack Surface: [Potential Vulnerabilities in Sarama's Core Logic](./attack_surfaces/potential_vulnerabilities_in_sarama's_core_logic.md)

*   **Description:**  Bugs or vulnerabilities within Sarama's code itself could be exploited.
    *   **How Sarama Contributes:** As a library responsible for interacting with Kafka's protocol, vulnerabilities in its parsing, connection management, or other core functionalities could be exploitable.
    *   **Example:** A yet-undiscovered bug in Sarama's handling of a specific Kafka protocol feature could be triggered by a malicious Kafka broker or a crafted message, potentially leading to crashes, unexpected behavior, or in severe cases, memory corruption within the client application.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, unexpected application behavior, potential for more severe exploits.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Sarama Updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable version of Sarama. The maintainers actively address reported bugs and security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Monitor for Security Advisories:** Stay informed about any security advisories or vulnerability disclosures related to Sarama.
        *   **Consider Security Audits:** For critical applications, consider conducting security audits of your application's usage of Sarama and potentially the Sarama library itself.
