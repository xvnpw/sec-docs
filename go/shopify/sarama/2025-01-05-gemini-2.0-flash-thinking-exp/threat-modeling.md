# Threat Model Analysis for shopify/sarama

## Threat: [Message Injection/Tampering (Producer)](./threats/message_injectiontampering__producer_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could intercept the communication between the Sarama producer and the Kafka broker if the connection is not secured. They could then inject malicious messages into topics or modify existing messages in transit by manipulating the data packets. This directly involves Sarama's sending mechanism.

**Impact:** Leads to data corruption in Kafka topics, potentially causing consumers to process incorrect or malicious data. This can result in application errors, incorrect business logic execution, or even security breaches if the injected data is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in downstream systems.

**Affected Sarama Component:** `SyncProducer.SendMessage` or `AsyncProducer.Input` (depending on the producer type) and the underlying connection handling logic within Sarama.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always enable TLS encryption for connections to Kafka brokers using the `sarama.Config.Net.TLS` settings. This is a direct Sarama configuration.
*   Implement authentication and authorization on the Kafka broker to restrict who can produce messages to specific topics (while not directly Sarama, it's a necessary countermeasure).
*   Consider implementing message signing or encryption at the application level for sensitive data to ensure integrity even if the transport layer is compromised (application-level, but relevant).

## Threat: [Message Tampering/Injection (Consumer)](./threats/message_tamperinginjection__consumer_.md)

**Description:** Similar to the producer threat, if the connection between the Sarama consumer and the Kafka broker is not secured, an attacker could intercept messages before they reach the consumer and modify their content or inject malicious messages. This directly involves Sarama's receiving mechanism.

**Impact:** Consumers process tampered or malicious data, potentially leading to application errors, incorrect business logic execution, security vulnerabilities, or denial of service if the malicious messages cause resource exhaustion.

**Affected Sarama Component:** `ConsumerGroup.Consume` or `PartitionConsumer.Messages()` and the underlying connection handling logic within Sarama.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always enable TLS encryption for connections to Kafka brokers using the `sarama.Config.Net.TLS` settings. This is a direct Sarama configuration.
*   Implement authentication and authorization on the Kafka broker to restrict access to topics (while not directly Sarama, it's a necessary countermeasure).
*   Implement message validation and sanitization within the consumer application to detect and handle potentially malicious data (application-level, but crucial).

## Threat: [Insecure Kafka Broker Connection (Plaintext)](./threats/insecure_kafka_broker_connection__plaintext_.md)

**Description:** If TLS encryption is not enabled in the Sarama configuration, communication between the Sarama client and the Kafka brokers occurs in plaintext. This allows attackers to eavesdrop on the communication and potentially intercept sensitive data, including message content and metadata. This is a direct Sarama configuration issue.

**Impact:** Confidential information within messages can be exposed. Authentication credentials, if transmitted, could also be compromised.

**Affected Sarama Component:** `sarama.Config.Net` settings, specifically related to TLS configuration within Sarama.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always configure Sarama to use TLS encryption for connections to Kafka brokers using the `sarama.Config.Net.TLS` settings. This directly addresses the Sarama configuration.

## Threat: [Weak or Missing Authentication Credentials](./threats/weak_or_missing_authentication_credentials.md)

**Description:** Using weak or default authentication credentials or failing to implement authentication altogether allows unauthorized access to the Kafka cluster. This directly involves Sarama's authentication configuration.

**Impact:** Unauthorized producers can inject malicious messages, and unauthorized consumers can access sensitive data from topics they shouldn't have access to.

**Affected Sarama Component:** `sarama.Config.Net.SASL` settings (for SASL authentication) or `sarama.Config.Net.TLS` settings (for mTLS) within Sarama.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., SASL/PLAIN, SASL/SCRAM, mTLS) for connections to Kafka brokers. This involves configuring Sarama.
*   Securely manage and store Kafka credentials (external to Sarama, but essential).

## Threat: [Credential Exposure in Application Code or Configuration](./threats/credential_exposure_in_application_code_or_configuration.md)

**Description:** Storing Kafka credentials directly in application code or unencrypted configuration files exposes them to potential attackers who gain access to the application's codebase or configuration. This relates to how the application uses Sarama's configuration.

**Impact:** Compromised credentials can be used to gain unauthorized access to the Kafka cluster, leading to data breaches, message manipulation, or denial of service.

**Affected Sarama Component:** How the application initializes the `sarama.Config` with authentication details. While not a vulnerability *in* Sarama, it's a direct consequence of how Sarama's configuration is handled.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use secure methods for storing and retrieving Kafka credentials (e.g., environment variables, secrets management systems). This affects how Sarama is configured.
*   Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Sarama's Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_sarama's_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Sarama relies on other Go libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could potentially be exploited through the Sarama library. This directly involves the security of Sarama's codebase and its dependencies.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from denial of service to remote code execution, potentially affecting the application using Sarama.

**Affected Sarama Component:** Indirectly affects various Sarama components depending on which dependency is vulnerable. The entire Sarama library is potentially affected.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Sarama to the latest version to benefit from security patches in its dependencies. This is a direct action related to managing the Sarama library.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address vulnerabilities in Sarama's dependencies. This is about managing Sarama's environment.
