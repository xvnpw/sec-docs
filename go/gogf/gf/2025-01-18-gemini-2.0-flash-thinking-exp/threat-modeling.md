# Threat Model Analysis for gogf/gf

## Threat: [ORM Injection via Unsanitized Input in `Where` Clause](./threats/orm_injection_via_unsanitized_input_in__where__clause.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates user input that is directly incorporated into a GoFrame ORM `Where` clause without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows the attacker to inject malicious SQL queries that are executed against the database, potentially bypassing authentication or accessing sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access.
*   **Affected GoFrame Component:** `database/gdb` (ORM module), specifically the `Where` function.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use parameterized queries with the `Where()` function using placeholders (`?`).
    *   Avoid constructing raw SQL queries using string concatenation with user input.
    *   Utilize GoFrame's query builder methods securely.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Unescaped Output in Templates](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_unescaped_output_in_templates.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into user-controlled data that is then rendered by GoFrame's template engine without proper escaping. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server when the template is processed.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, server compromise.
*   **Affected GoFrame Component:** `os/gview` (template engine).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always escape user-provided data before rendering it in templates using GoFrame's built-in escaping mechanisms (e.g., `{{.Var | safe}}` for explicitly marking as safe, or configuring default escaping).
    *   Avoid allowing users to directly control template content or logic.

## Threat: [Session Fixation Vulnerability due to Predictable Session IDs](./threats/session_fixation_vulnerability_due_to_predictable_session_ids.md)

*   **Description:** If GoFrame's session management generates predictable session IDs, an attacker can potentially guess or obtain a valid session ID and use it to impersonate a legitimate user.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access.
*   **Affected GoFrame Component:** `net/ghttp` (session management).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure GoFrame's session management is configured to generate cryptographically secure, random session IDs.
    *   Regenerate session IDs after successful login or privilege escalation.
    *   Use secure cookies (HttpOnly, Secure).

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerability in File Serving or Upload Functionality](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerability_in_file_serving_or_upload_functionality.md)

*   **Description:** If GoFrame's file serving or upload functionality doesn't properly sanitize user-provided file paths, an attacker can potentially access or manipulate files outside of the intended directories on the server.
*   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files, potential for arbitrary file read or write.
*   **Affected GoFrame Component:** `net/ghttp` (file serving), potentially custom file upload handlers.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Validate and sanitize file paths provided by users.
    *   Use absolute paths or canonicalize paths to prevent traversal.
    *   Implement strict access controls for file system operations.

## Threat: [Arbitrary File Upload Leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/arbitrary_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** If GoFrame's file upload functionality lacks proper validation of file types and content, an attacker can upload malicious executable files (e.g., PHP scripts, shell scripts) and then execute them on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise.
*   **Affected GoFrame Component:** `net/ghttp` (file upload handling), potentially custom upload handlers.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Validate file types based on content (magic numbers) rather than just the file extension.
    *   Store uploaded files in a non-executable directory.
    *   Rename uploaded files to prevent naming collisions and potential exploits.
    *   Implement virus scanning on uploaded files.
