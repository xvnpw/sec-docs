## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities -> Route Hijacking/Spoofing](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_routing_vulnerabilities_-_route_hijackingspoofing.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting loose or ambiguous route definitions in GoFrame.
    * **How it works:** Developers might define routes with overly broad patterns or fail to properly anchor routes, allowing attackers to craft request paths that match unintended routes.
    * **Example:** A route defined as `/user/{id}` without proper validation could be manipulated to access other resources by providing unexpected values for `id` or appending extra path segments.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized access to functionalities or data intended for different users or roles.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities -> Bypass GoFrame's Input Validation/Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities_-_bypass_goframe's_input_validationsanitizatio_03812c6e.md)

**Attack Vector:** Identifying weaknesses in GoFrame's built-in validation rules.
    * **How it works:** Attackers analyze GoFrame's default validation rules or custom validation logic implemented by the developer to find weaknesses or edge cases that allow malicious input to bypass checks.
    * **Example:**  A validation rule might check for a maximum length but not properly sanitize special characters, allowing for injection attacks.
    * **Impact:** Bypassing input validation can pave the way for various other attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or command injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node and Part of High-Risk Path: Exploit GoFrame's Request Body Parsing -> Exploit vulnerabilities in underlying JSON/XML parsing libraries used by GoFrame](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_and_part_of_high-risk_path_exploit_goframe's_request_body_parsing_-_exploit_vulnerabil_df207ef0.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the libraries GoFrame uses to parse JSON or XML request bodies.
    * **How it works:** Attackers send specially crafted JSON or XML payloads that trigger vulnerabilities within the parsing library. These vulnerabilities can range from denial-of-service to remote code execution.
    * **Example:**  A vulnerable JSON parsing library might be susceptible to integer overflows when handling large numbers, leading to crashes or memory corruption.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to application crashes, denial of service, or in severe cases, remote code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node and Part of High-Risk Path: Exploit Data Access (ORM) Vulnerabilities -> GoFrame ORM Injection](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_and_part_of_high-risk_path_exploit_data_access__orm__vulnerabilities_-_goframe_orm_inj_889162fc.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious SQL code through GoFrame's ORM functions.
    * **How it works:** Developers might use GoFrame's ORM in a way that allows user-controlled input to be directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    * **Example:**  Constructing a `WHERE` clause by directly concatenating user input into the query string instead of using parameterized queries.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification, or even complete database takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node and Part of High-Risk Path: Exploit Templating Engine Vulnerabilities -> Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_and_part_of_high-risk_path_exploit_templating_engine_vulnerabilities_-_server-side_tem_fbe60598.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious code into template inputs processed by GoFrame's templating engine.
    * **How it works:** If user-provided data is directly embedded into template code without proper escaping or if the templating engine itself has vulnerabilities, attackers can inject code that will be executed on the server when the template is rendered.
    * **Example:**  A user-controlled variable is directly used within a template expression that allows for code execution.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server.
