# Attack Surface Analysis for gogf/gf

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template expressions, which is then executed by GoFrame's template engine.
    *   **How GoFrame Contributes:** GoFrame's `gtpl` template engine, if used to render user-controlled data directly without proper escaping, is the direct mechanism for this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:**  A comment form allows users to input their name. The template uses `{{.Comment}}` to display the comment. An attacker inputs `{{exec "rm -rf /"}}` as their comment. If not properly escaped by `gtpl`, the server might execute this command.
    *   **Impact:**  Full server compromise, remote code execution, data exfiltration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid rendering user-controlled data directly in `gtpl` templates.**
        *   **Utilize GoFrame's built-in escaping functions or context-aware output encoding provided by `gtpl`.**
        *   **Sanitize user input before passing it to the `gtpl` engine.**

## Attack Surface: [ORM SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/orm_sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries executed through GoFrame's ORM.
    *   **How GoFrame Contributes:** GoFrame's ORM (`gdb`), if used improperly without proper sanitization of user inputs when constructing queries, can directly lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. This includes using raw SQL or dynamic query building.
    *   **Example:** A search functionality uses `g.DB().Table("users").Where("name = '" + userInput + "'").All()` where `userInput` is directly taken from the user. An attacker could input `' OR '1'='1` to bypass the intended query.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access, potential denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by GoFrame's `gdb`.**
        *   **Avoid constructing SQL queries using string concatenation with user input within `gdb`.**
        *   **Utilize GoFrame's `gdb` methods that automatically handle escaping and parameter binding.**

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Upload Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_upload_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files to the server through GoFrame's file upload mechanisms.
    *   **How GoFrame Contributes:** GoFrame provides functionalities for handling file uploads (`Request.GetUploadFile`). Insecure implementation using these features directly contributes to the attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to upload profile pictures using `Request.GetUploadFile`. Without proper validation, an attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image. If the web server executes PHP files in the upload directory, the attacker can execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, defacement, data exfiltration, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Validate file types based on content (magic numbers) rather than just the extension when using `Request.GetUploadFile`.**
        *   **Sanitize file names obtained from `Request.GetUploadFile` to prevent path traversal attacks.**
        *   **Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a location with restricted execution permissions.**

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Session Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_session_management.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in how user sessions are created, managed, and invalidated using GoFrame's session management features.
    *   **How GoFrame Contributes:** GoFrame provides session management features (`ghttp.Session`). Vulnerabilities arise from insecure configuration or usage of these features.
    *   **Example:** The application uses the default session configuration of `ghttp.Session` without customizing session ID generation, leading to predictable session IDs that can be easily guessed.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive data, impersonation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configure `ghttp.Session` to generate cryptographically secure, random session IDs.**
        *   **Use secure session storage mechanisms when configuring `ghttp.Session` (e.g., server-side storage).**
        *   **Encrypt session data if stored in cookies when using `ghttp.Session` cookie-based storage.**
        *   **Implement proper session invalidation on logout and after a period of inactivity using `ghttp.Session` methods.**

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Exposure](./attack_surfaces/configuration_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information stored in GoFrame's configuration files is exposed to unauthorized access.
    *   **How GoFrame Contributes:** GoFrame uses configuration files (`gcfg`) to manage application settings. Storing sensitive information directly in these files makes them a direct attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A `config.yaml` file managed by `gcfg` containing database username and password is accidentally committed to a public repository or is accessible through a misconfigured web server.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to resources, compromise of external services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid storing sensitive information directly in GoFrame configuration files managed by `gcfg`.**
        *   **Use environment variables or secure secrets management systems to store sensitive data accessed by GoFrame applications.**
        *   **Ensure GoFrame configuration files are not accessible through the web server.**

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Misconfiguration/Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/middleware_misconfigurationvulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured or vulnerable custom middleware used within GoFrame's request handling pipeline introduces security flaws.
    *   **How GoFrame Contributes:** GoFrame's middleware system (`ghttp.Use`) allows developers to add custom logic. Vulnerabilities in this custom middleware or its configuration directly impact the application's security.
    *   **Example:** A custom authentication middleware added using `ghttp.Use` has a flaw that allows bypassing authentication under certain conditions.
    *   **Impact:**  Bypass of security controls, unauthorized access, potential for other vulnerabilities depending on the middleware's function.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thoroughly review and test custom middleware used with `ghttp.Use` for security vulnerabilities.**
        *   **Keep third-party middleware used within GoFrame up-to-date.**
        *   **Carefully consider the order of middleware added using `ghttp.Use` in the request processing pipeline.**
        *   **Follow secure coding practices when developing custom middleware for GoFrame applications.**
