## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation using `gvalid`](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_using__gvalid_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Leverage GoFrame's `gvalid` for Input Validation

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Points:** Pinpoint all locations in your GoFrame application where user input is received via `ghttp` request parameters, headers, and bodies.
    2.  **Define Validation Rules using `gvalid`:** For each input point, meticulously define validation rules using `gvalid`'s declarative syntax. Specify data types, required status, format constraints (e.g., `length`, `regex`, `email`, `url`), and custom validation functions. Rules can be defined in struct tags, configuration, or programmatically.
    3.  **Implement Validation in `ghttp` Handlers:** Within your `ghttp` handler functions, utilize `gvalid.CheckRequest(r)` or `gvalid.CheckMap(data, rules)` to validate incoming request data against the defined rules.
    4.  **Handle `gvalid` Errors:** If validation fails, `gvalid` returns an error. Implement error handling within your handlers to:
        *   Return user-friendly error responses (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request) using `r.Response.WriteJson`.
        *   Log validation errors using `glog` for debugging and security monitoring.
        *   Halt further request processing for invalid inputs.
    5.  **Centralize Validation Rules (Recommended):** For larger applications, consider centralizing `gvalid` rule definitions using configuration files or dedicated Go structs to promote reusability and maintainability.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity)
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity)
    *   Command Injection (High Severity)
    *   Path Traversal (Medium Severity)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity)
    *   Business Logic Errors (Medium Severity)

*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High reduction
    *   XSS: Moderate to High reduction
    *   Command Injection: High reduction
    *   Path Traversal: Moderate reduction
    *   DoS: Low to Moderate reduction
    *   Business Logic Errors: High reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially Implemented: Basic `gvalid` usage exists in some controllers for simple data type checks, particularly in user-related endpoints.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive Validation Rules: Many `ghttp` handlers lack detailed `gvalid` rules for all input parameters and headers.
    *   Custom Validation Functions:  No custom `gvalid` validation functions are used for application-specific business logic validation.
    *   Centralized Rule Management: `gvalid` rules are not centrally managed, leading to potential inconsistencies and maintenance overhead.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries with `gdb`](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries_with__gdb_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize GoFrame's `gdb` for Parameterized Database Queries

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Employ `gdb` Query Builders:**  Consistently use `gdb`'s query builder methods (e.g., `Model()`, `Where()`, `Insert()`, `Update()`, `Delete()`) for all database interactions within your GoFrame application.
    2.  **Parameterize Input Values:** When incorporating user-provided data into database queries using `gdb` methods like `Where()`, `Data()`, etc., always pass the data as parameters (e.g., `Where("username = ?", username)`). `gdb` automatically handles parameterization.
    3.  **Avoid Raw SQL and String Concatenation:**  **Strictly avoid** writing raw SQL queries or constructing SQL queries by concatenating strings with user input. This practice bypasses `gdb`'s parameterization and introduces SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    4.  **Code Review for `gdb` Usage:**  Enforce code reviews to ensure all database interactions are performed exclusively through `gdb`'s parameterized query methods and that raw SQL is not used.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (Critical Severity)

*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Largely Implemented:  The application primarily uses `gdb`'s query builder for database operations in services and data access objects (DAOs).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Verification of Complex Queries:  Double-check complex or dynamically built queries using `gdb` to ensure parameterization is correctly applied in all scenarios.
    *   Legacy Code Audit: Review older code sections or newly integrated modules for any potential instances of raw SQL queries that need to be refactored to use `gdb`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authentication and Authorization Middleware with `ghttp`](./mitigation_strategies/authentication_and_authorization_middleware_with__ghttp_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement `ghttp` Middleware for Authentication and Authorization

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Develop Authentication Middleware:** Create a GoFrame `ghttp` middleware function that:
        *   Extracts authentication credentials from the `ghttp.Request` (e.g., headers, cookies).
        *   Validates credentials against your authentication system.
        *   On successful authentication, store user identity information in the `ghttp.Request` context using `r.SetCtxVar`.
        *   On authentication failure, return an unauthorized response (e.g., HTTP 401) using `r.Response.WriteHeader` and `r.Response.Write`.
    2.  **Develop Authorization Middleware:** Create a `ghttp` authorization middleware (or extend the authentication middleware) that:
        *   Retrieves user identity from the `ghttp.Request` context using `r.GetCtxVar`.
        *   Checks user permissions against the requested resource or action.
        *   If authorized, call `r.Middleware.Next()` to proceed to the next middleware or handler.
        *   If unauthorized, return a forbidden response (e.g., HTTP 403) using `r.Response.WriteHeader` and `r.Response.Write`.
    3.  **Apply Middleware using `ghttp.Server.Use` or Route Groups:** Register your authentication and authorization middleware globally using `server.Use()` for application-wide protection or selectively for specific route groups using `group.Middleware()`.
    4.  **Context-Based Authorization:** Leverage `ghttp.Request` context to pass user information to handlers, enabling context-aware authorization logic within handlers if needed, in addition to middleware-based checks.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity)
    *   Privilege Escalation (High Severity)
    *   Data Breaches (High Severity)
    *   Business Logic Bypass (Medium Severity)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access: High reduction
    *   Privilege Escalation: High reduction
    *   Data Breaches: High reduction
    *   Business Logic Bypass: Moderate to High reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic Authentication Middleware: A rudimentary JWT authentication middleware exists, verifying tokens for certain API routes using `ghttp` middleware.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive Authorization:  Authorization middleware is lacking. Implement role-based or attribute-based access control within `ghttp` middleware.
    *   Granular Route Protection: Apply authorization middleware to all sensitive `ghttp` routes and route groups.
    *   Permission Management Integration: Integrate authorization middleware with a permission management system to dynamically manage user roles and permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Session Management with `ghttp`](./mitigation_strategies/secure_session_management_with__ghttp_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Secure Session Management in GoFrame's `ghttp`

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Session Settings in `gf.yaml` or Programmatically:**  Review and harden session configuration within your `gf.yaml` file under the `server.session` section or programmatically using `ghttp.SetServerOption`.
        *   **`cookieHttpOnly: true`:**  Enable HTTP-only session cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript access, mitigating XSS-based session hijacking.
        *   **`cookieSecure: true`:**  Enable Secure session cookies to ensure transmission only over HTTPS, protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks.
        *   **`cookieSameSite: "Lax"` or `"Strict"`:** Configure the `SameSite` attribute to mitigate CSRF attacks.
        *   **`storage: "redis"` (or other secure backend):**  Switch from the default in-memory session storage to a secure backend like Redis, a database, or file system storage (ensure proper permissions) by configuring the `storage` option.
        *   **`maxAge`:** Set an appropriate session timeout using `maxAge` to limit session lifespan.
    2.  **Verify Strong Session ID Generation:**  Confirm that GoFrame's `ghttp` session management is generating cryptographically secure session IDs (this is generally the default behavior, but verify).
    3.  **Session ID Regeneration on Privilege Change:** Implement session ID regeneration using `r.Session.RegenerateId()` when user privileges are elevated (e.g., after login) to prevent session fixation.
    4.  **Implement Logout Functionality:** Provide a secure logout mechanism that invalidates the session server-side using `r.Session.ClearAll()` and clears the session cookie client-side.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Session Hijacking (High Severity)
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) based Session Hijacking (High Severity)
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Medium Severity)
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium Severity)
    *   Session Fixation (Medium Severity)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Session Hijacking: High reduction
    *   XSS-based Session Hijacking: High reduction
    *   MitM Attacks: Moderate reduction
    *   CSRF: Moderate reduction
    *   Session Fixation: Moderate reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic Session Management: GoFrame's default `ghttp` session management is in use, but secure configuration options are likely not fully enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Secure Session Configuration in `gf.yaml`:  Explicitly set `cookieHttpOnly`, `cookieSecure`, and `cookieSameSite` in `gf.yaml` under `server.session`.
    *   Secure Session Storage Backend: Transition from default in-memory storage to a more robust and secure backend by configuring `storage` in `gf.yaml`.
    *   Session ID Regeneration: Implement session ID regeneration on login or privilege updates using `r.Session.RegenerateId()`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration Management with `gcfg` and `gf.yaml`](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_management_with__gcfg__and__gf_yaml_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure GoFrame Configuration Management using `gcfg` and `gf.yaml`

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Externalize Sensitive Configuration:** Identify sensitive configuration parameters (e.g., database credentials, API keys) and avoid hardcoding them in Go code or directly in `gf.yaml`.
    2.  **Utilize Environment Variables:** Store sensitive configuration values as environment variables and access them in your GoFrame application using `g.Cfg().GetEnv("VARIABLE_NAME")`.
    3.  **Secure `gf.yaml` File Permissions:**  Restrict access to `gf.yaml` and any other configuration files by setting appropriate file system permissions. Ensure only authorized users and processes can read and modify these files.
    4.  **Configuration Validation with `gcfg` (Programmatic):** Implement programmatic validation of configuration values loaded by `gcfg`. Use `g.Cfg().Get()` to retrieve configuration and validate data types, required fields, and value ranges. Fail fast if configuration is invalid during application startup.
    5.  **Regular Configuration Review:** Periodically review your `gf.yaml` and environment variable configurations to identify and rectify any potential security weaknesses or misconfigurations.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of Sensitive Information (High Severity)
    *   Unauthorized Access to Resources (High Severity)
    *   Configuration Tampering (Medium Severity)
    *   Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of Sensitive Information: High reduction
    *   Unauthorized Access to Resources: High reduction
    *   Configuration Tampering: Moderate reduction
    *   Supply Chain Attacks: Moderate reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially Implemented: `gf.yaml` is used for configuration, but sensitive credentials might be directly within it. Environment variables are used for some deployment settings.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Migrate Secrets to Environment Variables: Move all sensitive configuration values from `gf.yaml` to environment variables.
    *   Configuration Validation: Implement validation logic for critical configuration parameters loaded by `gcfg` during application startup.
    *   `gf.yaml` File Permissions Hardening: Review and restrict file permissions for `gf.yaml` and other configuration files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Error Handling and Logging with `glog`](./mitigation_strategies/secure_error_handling_and_logging_with__glog_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Secure Error Handling and Logging using GoFrame's `glog`

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Custom Error Handling in `ghttp`:** Implement custom error handling in your `ghttp` handlers to prevent leaking sensitive information in error responses to end-users. Use `r.Response.WriteStatusError` to return generic error messages to clients in production.
    2.  **Comprehensive Logging with `glog`:** Utilize `glog` for detailed logging of security-relevant events, including authentication failures, authorization denials, input validation errors, database access attempts, and application exceptions.
    3.  **`glog` Configuration for Security:** Configure `glog` settings in `gf.yaml` or programmatically to:
        *   **`level: "all"` or specific levels:** Set the logging level to capture sufficient security-related information.
        *   **`path: "/path/to/secure/logs"`:**  Configure a secure log file path with restricted access permissions.
        *   **`rotate: "size"` or `"time"`:** Enable log rotation to manage log file size and prevent disk exhaustion.
    4.  **Centralized Logging (Optional):** Configure `glog` to output logs to a centralized logging system (e.g., using `glog.SetHandler`) for enhanced security monitoring and analysis.
    5.  **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data with `glog`:**  Be extremely cautious about logging sensitive data (passwords, API keys, PII). If logging sensitive data is unavoidable, implement redaction or masking techniques before logging using custom `glog` formatting or handlers.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Medium Severity)
    *   Security Monitoring Deficiencies (Medium Severity)
    *   Data Breaches (High Severity - if sensitive data is logged insecurely)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Moderate reduction
    *   Security Monitoring Deficiencies: Moderate to High reduction
    *   Data Breaches: Moderate to High reduction (depending on logging practices)

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic Logging: `glog` is likely used for general application logging, but might not be configured with security best practices in mind.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Secure `glog` Configuration: Review and harden `glog` configuration in `gf.yaml` or programmatically, focusing on log levels, secure log paths, and rotation.
    *   Custom Error Handling for Security: Implement custom error handling in `ghttp` handlers to prevent information leakage in error responses.
    *   Centralized Logging Integration: Consider integrating `glog` with a centralized logging system for improved security monitoring.
    *   Sensitive Data Redaction in Logging: Implement mechanisms to redact or mask sensitive data before logging with `glog` if necessary.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management with Go Modules (within GoFrame context)](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management_with_go_modules__within_goframe_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure GoFrame Dependency Management using Go Modules

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly Update GoFrame and Dependencies:** Keep GoFrame itself and all other Go dependencies in your `go.mod` file up-to-date using `go mod tidy` and `go get -u all`. Regularly check for security advisories related to GoFrame and its dependencies on platforms like GitHub or Go vulnerability databases.
    2.  **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., `govulncheck`, `snyk`, `OWASP Dependency-Check`) into your development pipeline to automatically detect and report known vulnerabilities in your GoFrame project's dependencies.
    3.  **Vendor Dependencies (Considered Approach):**  Consider vendoring dependencies using `go mod vendor` to create a local copy of dependencies within your project. This can provide more control over dependencies and reduce reliance on external repositories during builds. However, remember to update vendored dependencies regularly as well.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Dependency Vulnerabilities (High Severity)
    *   Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Dependency Vulnerabilities: High reduction
    *   Supply Chain Attacks: Moderate reduction (vendoring)

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic Dependency Management: Go Modules are used for dependency management in the GoFrame project.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Regular Dependency Updates: Establish a process for regularly updating GoFrame and project dependencies.
    *   Dependency Vulnerability Scanning Integration: Integrate a dependency vulnerability scanning tool into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically check for vulnerabilities.
    *   Vendoring Strategy Evaluation: Evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of vendoring dependencies for your GoFrame project and implement vendoring if deemed appropriate.
