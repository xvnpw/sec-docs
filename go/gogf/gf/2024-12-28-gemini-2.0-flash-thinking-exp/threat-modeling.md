## High and Critical GoFrame Application Threats

| Threat | Description | Impact | Affected GoFrame Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Parameter Pollution/Injection via Route Parameters** | An attacker crafts malicious URLs by injecting unexpected or malicious data into route parameters. This can lead to the application processing unintended values, potentially bypassing security checks or triggering errors. For example, an attacker might manipulate an ID parameter to access unauthorized resources or inject code snippets that are later interpreted. | Unauthorized access to data, bypassing security checks, application errors, potential for further exploitation depending on how the parameter is used. | `ghttp` (routing, request handling) | High | Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all route parameters using GoFrame's built-in validation features (`gvalid`). Avoid directly using route parameters in sensitive operations without thorough checks. Use type assertions and conversions carefully. |
| **Middleware Bypass due to Incorrect Configuration** | An attacker bypasses security middleware due to misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in custom middleware logic. This can occur if middleware is not applied to all relevant routes or if the middleware itself has flaws. | Bypassing authentication, authorization, rate limiting, or other security measures implemented in middleware. | `ghttp` (middleware) | High | Carefully review and test middleware configurations, ensuring it's applied to all necessary routes. Develop custom middleware with security in mind and conduct thorough testing. Utilize GoFrame's built-in middleware where possible and understand their limitations. |
| **ORM Injection (Indirect SQL Injection)** | An attacker manipulates input that is used to construct database queries through GoFrame's ORM without proper sanitization or parameterization. While GoFrame's ORM offers some protection, improper usage can still lead to vulnerabilities. | Data breaches, data manipulation, potential for remote code execution depending on database privileges. | `gdb` (ORM) | Critical | Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by the ORM. Avoid constructing dynamic queries by concatenating user input. Sanitize user input before using it in database queries, even with the ORM. Be cautious when using raw SQL queries. |
| **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** | An attacker injects malicious code into template data that is then executed by the template engine. This can occur if user-controlled data is directly embedded into templates without proper escaping. | Remote code execution on the server, information disclosure, denial of service. | `gtpl` (templating) | Critical | Always escape user-provided data before rendering it in templates using GoFrame's built-in escaping mechanisms. Avoid allowing users to directly control template content. Use a secure templating engine and keep it updated. |
| **Sensitive Data Caching** | The application unintentionally caches sensitive information that should not be stored in the cache, potentially exposing it to unauthorized access. | Information disclosure of sensitive data. | `gcache` (caching) | High | Avoid caching sensitive data unless absolutely necessary. Implement appropriate access controls and encryption for cached data. Review caching strategies to ensure they align with security requirements. |
| **Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data** | Sensitive configuration data (e.g., database credentials, API keys) is stored insecurely and can be accessed by attackers. | Full compromise of the application and associated resources. | `gcfg` (configuration management) | Critical | Store sensitive configuration data securely, preferably using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the application code. Ensure proper file permissions for configuration files. |
| **Path Traversal** | An attacker manipulates file paths provided by the user to access or modify files outside of the intended directories. This can occur in file upload or download functionalities. | Accessing sensitive files, overwriting critical files, potential for remote code execution in some scenarios. | `os` package usage within GoFrame context (file handling) | High | Always validate and sanitize file paths received from users. Use absolute paths or restrict file access to specific directories. Avoid directly using user input in file system operations. Implement proper access controls on the file system. |
| **Command Injection via Process Execution** | An attacker injects malicious commands into arguments passed to functions that execute external processes (e.g., using `gproc`). | Remote code execution on the server. | `gproc` (process management) | Critical | Avoid executing external commands based on user input whenever possible. If necessary, sanitize user input rigorously using allow-lists and escaping techniques. Use parameterized commands or dedicated libraries for specific tasks instead of relying on shell execution. |
| **gRPC Specific Vulnerabilities (if using gRPC)** | Exploiting vulnerabilities inherent in gRPC implementations, such as denial of service via resource exhaustion, authentication bypass, or message manipulation. | Denial of service, unauthorized access, data manipulation. | `grpool`, `grpc` (gRPC support) | High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability) | Implement proper gRPC security best practices, including TLS encryption, authentication (e.g., mutual TLS, API keys), authorization, input validation, and rate limiting. Keep gRPC libraries updated. |
| **WebSocket Specific Vulnerabilities (if using WebSockets)** | Exploiting vulnerabilities in WebSocket communication, such as message injection, denial of service by flooding, or lack of proper authentication/authorization. | Message manipulation, denial of service, unauthorized access to WebSocket communication. | `gws` (WebSocket support) | Medium to High (depending on the vulnerability) | Implement secure WebSocket communication using TLS. Enforce authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections. Validate and sanitize WebSocket messages. Implement rate limiting to prevent flooding. |
