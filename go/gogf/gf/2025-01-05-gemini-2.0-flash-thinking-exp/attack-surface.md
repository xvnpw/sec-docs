# Attack Surface Analysis for gogf/gf

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected HTTP Route](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_http_route.md)

*   **Description:**  An HTTP endpoint is accessible without proper authentication or authorization, allowing unauthorized access to functionality or data.
    *   **How gf Contributes:** GoFrame's router allows defining routes with varying levels of protection. If middleware for authentication or authorization is not applied to a specific route using GoFrame's routing mechanisms, it becomes an unprotected entry point directly managed by the framework.
    *   **Example:** A route `/admin/deleteUser` is defined in the GoFrame application using `g.Server().BindHandler("/admin/deleteUser", admin.DeleteUser)` but lacks any associated authentication middleware defined through GoFrame's middleware system. Any user can access this route and potentially delete user accounts.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Authentication Middleware:** Use GoFrame's middleware functionality (e.g., `g.Server().Use(AuthMiddleware)`) to enforce authentication checks for sensitive routes.
        *   **Implement Authorization Middleware:** Implement middleware within the GoFrame framework to verify if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access the route.
        *   **Utilize GoFrame's Route Grouping:**  Group related routes and apply middleware to the entire group for better organization and security enforcement.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Data Binding](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_data_binding.md)

*   **Description:**  The application automatically binds user-provided data (from request parameters, JSON, etc.) to Go structs without proper validation, allowing malicious input to corrupt data or cause unexpected behavior.
    *   **How gf Contributes:** GoFrame's automatic data binding feature (`r.GetStruct`, `r.Parse`) simplifies data handling but can be a vulnerability if not used with caution. If validation rules are not defined using GoFrame's validation tools or are insufficient, attackers can inject unexpected data types or values directly through the framework's input processing.
    *   **Example:** A user registration handler uses `r.Parse(&userInput)` to bind request data to a `UserInput` struct. If the `UserInput` struct lacks validation rules for an `isAdmin` field, an attacker could send a request with `isAdmin: true`, and GoFrame will bind this value, potentially granting administrative privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, privilege escalation, unexpected application behavior, potential for further exploitation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Utilize GoFrame's Validation Features:** Employ GoFrame's built-in validation mechanisms (`v` package, struct tags like `v:"required|email"`) to define rules for each field being bound. Integrate this validation directly within the struct definitions used with GoFrame's data binding.
        *   **Define Validation Rules in Handlers:** Use GoFrame's validation functions within request handlers before processing the bound data.
        *   **Sanitize Input (with GoFrame tools):** Utilize GoFrame's data conversion and sanitization functions before or during the binding process.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via Raw Queries](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_raw_queries.md)

*   **Description:**  The application constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user-provided input, leading to the possibility of SQL injection attacks.
    *   **How gf Contributes:** While GoFrame provides an ORM, developers might still use raw SQL queries (`db.Raw`) provided by GoFrame's database interaction layer for specific tasks. If user input obtained through GoFrame's request handling is not properly escaped or parameterized in these raw queries managed by the framework's DB component, it introduces a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:**  A database query is constructed using `g.DB().Raw("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + r.Get("username").String() + "'")`. The `r.Get("username").String()` retrieves user input via GoFrame's request handling. An attacker could provide a username like `' OR '1'='1`, bypassing the intended query.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to the database, potential for complete database compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prefer GoFrame's ORM:** Utilize GoFrame's ORM features with parameterized queries provided by the framework for most database interactions.
        *   **Parameterize Raw Queries (using GoFrame):** When raw queries are necessary using GoFrame's `db.Raw`, always use parameterized queries or prepared statements supported by GoFrame's database interface. Use placeholders and pass parameters separately.
        *   **Avoid String Concatenation:**  Do not construct SQL queries by directly concatenating strings, especially when those strings originate from user input obtained through GoFrame's request handling.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Upload Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_upload_handling.md)

*   **Description:** The application allows users to upload files without proper validation of file type, size, or content, potentially leading to the storage of malicious files.
    *   **How gf Contributes:** GoFrame provides functionalities for handling file uploads through its HTTP request handling (`r.GetUploadFile`, `r.GetUploadFiles`). If developers don't implement sufficient checks on the uploaded files using GoFrame's provided methods and configurations, it can become an attack vector directly related to the framework's file handling capabilities.
    *   **Example:** A file upload handler uses `r.GetUploadFile("avatar")` to retrieve an uploaded file. Without further validation using GoFrame's file handling utilities or custom checks, an attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image. If the server is configured to execute PHP, this could lead to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, cross-site scripting (if malicious scripts are served), denial of service (if large files are uploaded), storage exhaustion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Validate File Type (using GoFrame):** Check the file's MIME type obtained through GoFrame's file handling methods instead of relying solely on the file extension.
        *   **Limit File Size (using GoFrame's configuration or custom checks):** Enforce maximum file size limits using GoFrame's server configuration or by implementing checks within the upload handler.
        *   **Sanitize File Names (before using GoFrame's save methods):**  Rename uploaded files before saving them using GoFrame's file saving functions to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities and potential execution of malicious filenames.
        *   **Store Files Outside Web Root:** Configure the application (potentially using GoFrame's configuration) to store uploaded files in a location that is not directly accessible by the web server.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** User-controlled data is embedded directly into template code without proper escaping, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **How gf Contributes:** GoFrame's template engine (`gview`) can be vulnerable to SSTI if user input obtained through GoFrame's request handling is directly passed to the template engine for rendering without proper escaping or sanitization within the GoFrame templating context.
    *   **Example:** A handler renders a template using `gview.Assign("message", r.Get("userInput").String())` and the template contains `{{.message}}`. If an attacker provides `{{exec "rm -rf /"}}` as `userInput`, GoFrame's template engine might execute this command if not configured with proper escaping or if using unsafe functions.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Direct User Input in Templates:** Do not directly embed user-provided data obtained through GoFrame's request methods into template code rendered by GoFrame's template engine.
        *   **Use Template Escaping (GoFrame's features):** Ensure that all user-provided data is properly escaped by GoFrame's template engine before rendering. Utilize GoFrame's template directives or functions for escaping.
        *   **Sanitize Input Before Templating:** Sanitize user input obtained via GoFrame's request handling before passing it to the template engine.
        *   **Review Template Functions:** Be cautious when using custom template functions in GoFrame, as they can introduce security vulnerabilities if not implemented securely.
