## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit a vulnerability in request handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_a_vulnerability_in_request_handling.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit a vulnerability in request handling**
    * **Attack Vector: Route Manipulation**
        * Description: Attacker manipulates routing parameters or patterns to access unintended functionalities or bypass security checks.
        * How GoFrame is Involved: GoFrame's router (`ghttp.RouterGroup`) might have vulnerabilities in how it matches routes, especially with complex patterns, optional parameters, or regular expressions. Incorrectly defined or overly permissive routes can be exploited.
        * Attack Scenario: An application uses a route like `/user/{id:[0-9]+}`. If the regex is flawed or the routing logic doesn't handle edge cases, an attacker might bypass it with `/user/abc` or `/user/1/../admin`.
    * **Attack Vector: Parameter Tampering/Injection**
        * Description: Attacker modifies request parameters (GET, POST, headers, cookies) to inject malicious data or bypass validation.
        * How GoFrame is Involved: GoFrame's request handling (`ghttp.Request`) provides methods to access parameters. If the application doesn't properly sanitize and validate these inputs, vulnerabilities can arise. This includes potential issues with how GoFrame parses and handles different data types.
        * Attack Scenario: An application relies on a hidden form field or URL parameter to determine user privileges. An attacker modifies this parameter to escalate their privileges. GoFrame's parameter retrieval might not inherently prevent injection if the application logic is flawed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit a vulnerability in data handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_a_vulnerability_in_data_handling.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit a vulnerability in data handling**
    * **Critical Node: ORM Injection (if using GoFrame's ORM or an integrated ORM)**
        * Description: Attacker injects malicious SQL or ORM-specific queries through application inputs, leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
        * How GoFrame is Involved: If the application uses GoFrame's ORM features (or integrates another ORM) and constructs database queries dynamically based on user input without proper parameterization or escaping, it's vulnerable to ORM injection.
        * Attack Scenario: An application uses user-provided data in a `Where` clause without proper escaping: `db.Model("users").Where("username = '" + userInput + "'").Find()`. An attacker provides `'; DROP TABLE users; --` as input.
    * **Critical Node: Template Injection (if using GoFrame's template engine)**
        * Description: Attacker injects malicious code into template expressions, which is then executed by the template engine on the server.
        * How GoFrame is Involved: If the application uses GoFrame's template engine (`gview`) and allows user-controlled data to be directly embedded into templates without proper escaping or sandboxing, it's vulnerable to template injection.
        * Attack Scenario: An application renders a welcome message using user input: `{{.Username}}`. An attacker provides `{{exec "rm -rf /"}}` as input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in GoFrame's core functionalities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_goframe's_core_functionalities.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit vulnerabilities in GoFrame's core functionalities**
    * **Attack Vector: Session Hijacking/Fixation (if using GoFrame's session management)**
        * Description: Attacker steals or manipulates user session identifiers to gain unauthorized access.
        * How GoFrame is Involved: If GoFrame's session management implementation has weaknesses (e.g., predictable session IDs, insecure storage, lack of proper regeneration after login), it can be exploited.
        * Attack Scenario: GoFrame generates sequential session IDs. An attacker can predict the session ID of another user. Or, the application doesn't regenerate the session ID after successful login, allowing for session fixation attacks.
    * **Critical Node: Configuration File Exposure or Manipulation**
        * Description: Attacker gains access to sensitive configuration files or manipulates them to compromise the application.
        * How GoFrame is Involved: If GoFrame's configuration management (e.g., using `.ini`, `.yaml` files) is not properly secured, attackers might be able to read sensitive information (database credentials, API keys) or modify configurations to their advantage.
        * Attack Scenario: Configuration files containing database credentials are stored in a publicly accessible directory or have insecure permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in GoFrame's dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_goframe's_dependencies.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit vulnerabilities in GoFrame's dependencies**
    * **Attack Vector: Dependency Vulnerabilities**
        * Description: Attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries or modules that GoFrame relies on.
        * How GoFrame is Involved: GoFrame, like any framework, depends on other libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect applications using GoFrame.
        * Attack Scenario: A vulnerability is discovered in a logging library used by GoFrame. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain code execution.
