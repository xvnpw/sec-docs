# Threat Model Analysis for gogf/gf

## Threat: [Configuration Disclosure](./threats/configuration_disclosure.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive configuration files or environment variables used by the GoFrame application due to insecure handling or storage mechanisms within the framework's configuration management. This could be through vulnerabilities that allow reading arbitrary files or by exploiting default configurations that expose sensitive information.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, internal network details, and other critical application settings. This can lead to further attacks like data breaches, unauthorized access to external services, or complete compromise of the application and its environment.

**Affected GoFrame Component:** `gcfg` (configuration management module)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Secure configuration files with appropriate file system permissions (restrict read access to the application user).
* Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files; use environment variables or secrets management solutions.
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization if configuration values are read from external sources.

## Threat: [ORM Injection Vulnerability](./threats/orm_injection_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** If developers use GoFrame's ORM (`gdb`) without proper input sanitization or parameterized queries, an attacker could inject malicious SQL queries through user-supplied input. This is a direct consequence of how the ORM allows constructing and executing database queries.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, modification or deletion of data, potential execution of arbitrary SQL commands leading to data breaches or complete database compromise.

**Affected GoFrame Component:** `gdb` (database ORM module)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by `gdb` for database interactions involving user input.
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data that is used in database queries.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Description:** If user-provided data is directly embedded into GoFrame's template engine (`gtpl`) without proper escaping or sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious template code. The framework's template rendering process would then execute this code on the server.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, read sensitive files, or pivot to other systems.

**Affected GoFrame Component:** `gtpl` (template engine module)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Always sanitize user input before embedding it into templates.
* Use template engines in a way that prevents direct execution of arbitrary code. Consider using safe or sandboxed rendering modes if available.

## Threat: [Middleware Misconfiguration](./threats/middleware_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** Improperly configured or vulnerable middleware components within GoFrame's HTTP server (`ghttp`) request handling pipeline can directly lead to security vulnerabilities. This could involve authentication bypasses, authorization failures, or the introduction of exploitable flaws within the middleware itself.

**Impact:** Bypassing security controls, unauthorized access to resources, or potential exploitation of middleware vulnerabilities leading to various attacks.

**Affected GoFrame Component:** `ghttp` (HTTP server module and its middleware handling capabilities).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Thoroughly review and test all middleware configurations.
* Ensure middleware components are correctly ordered in the pipeline to enforce security policies as intended.
* Keep middleware dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring middleware.
