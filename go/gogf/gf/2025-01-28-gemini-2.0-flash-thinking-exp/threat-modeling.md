# Threat Model Analysis for gogf/gf

## Threat: [gf Framework Bugs and Exploits](./threats/gf_framework_bugs_and_exploits.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the gf framework's code. This could involve sending crafted requests to trigger bugs in routing, middleware, or core libraries, leading to unexpected behavior or system compromise. Attackers might use public exploits or discover zero-day vulnerabilities through reverse engineering or fuzzing.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service (DoS), information disclosure (sensitive data leaks), bypassing authentication/authorization, complete system compromise.

**Affected GF Component:** Core framework libraries, ghttp module, groute module, middleware components, gdb module, gview module, etc. (potentially any part of the framework).

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update gf framework to the latest stable version.
* Monitor official gf security advisories and community channels.
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization.
* Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
* Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block exploit attempts.

## Threat: [Insecure Routing Configuration](./threats/insecure_routing_configuration.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit overly permissive or misconfigured routes. They might access administrative panels, internal APIs, or sensitive functionalities by manipulating URLs or HTTP methods due to poorly defined route patterns or missing middleware.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to application features, bypassing authentication and authorization, information disclosure, potential for further exploitation by accessing internal functionalities.

**Affected GF Component:** `ghttp.Server` module, `groute` module, routing configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully define route patterns, using specific paths instead of broad wildcards.
* Apply appropriate middleware (authentication, authorization) to all relevant routes.
* Regularly review and test route configurations.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when defining route access.
* Use route groups to organize and apply middleware consistently.

## Threat: [Improper Use of gf's ORM (gdb)](./threats/improper_use_of_gf's_orm__gdb_.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities arising from insecure ORM usage. This could involve crafting malicious input that, when processed by poorly written ORM queries, leads to data breaches or manipulation. While not direct SQL injection in raw queries, misuse of ORM features can create similar vulnerabilities leading to significant data compromise.

**Impact:** Data breaches (unauthorized access to database records), data manipulation (modification or deletion of data), potential for SQL injection-like vulnerabilities through ORM misuse leading to critical data impact.

**Affected GF Component:** `gdb` module, ORM query building functions, database interaction.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by `gdb`.
* Thoroughly understand `gdb`'s query building and escaping mechanisms.
* Avoid constructing raw SQL queries within the ORM context unless absolutely necessary and carefully reviewed.
* Implement input validation before using data in ORM queries.
* Use ORM features for data sanitization where applicable.
* Apply database access controls and least privilege principles.

## Threat: [Template Engine Vulnerabilities (gview) Misuse](./threats/template_engine_vulnerabilities__gview__misuse.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into templates due to improper handling of user input within `gview`. If user-controlled data is directly embedded in templates without proper escaping, attackers can inject scripts that execute in the user's browser (XSS) or potentially achieve server-side template injection (SSTI) leading to remote code execution.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution (in SSTI scenarios), information disclosure, defacement of web pages.

**Affected GF Component:** `gview` module, template rendering engine, template files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always sanitize and escape user-provided input before rendering it in templates.
* Utilize `gview`'s built-in escaping mechanisms correctly (e.g., context-aware escaping).
* Avoid directly executing arbitrary code within templates.
* Use a templating engine with robust security features and stay updated on security best practices for template usage.
* Content Security Policy (CSP) can mitigate the impact of XSS.

## Threat: [Insecure Session Management Configuration (ghttp.Server)](./threats/insecure_session_management_configuration__ghttp_server_.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in session management. This could involve session hijacking by stealing session IDs due to insecure storage or transmission, session fixation by forcing a known session ID on a user, or brute-forcing weak session keys, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data.

**Impact:** Session hijacking (unauthorized access to user accounts), session fixation, unauthorized actions performed under a legitimate user's session, information disclosure.

**Affected GF Component:** `ghttp.Server` module, session management features, session storage mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use secure session storage mechanisms (e.g., Redis, database-backed sessions) instead of default file-based storage in production.
* Generate strong and unpredictable session keys.
* Implement appropriate session timeout and idle timeout settings.
* Enforce secure transmission of session identifiers over HTTPS only.
* Consider using HTTP-only and Secure flags for session cookies.
* Implement session regeneration after authentication.
