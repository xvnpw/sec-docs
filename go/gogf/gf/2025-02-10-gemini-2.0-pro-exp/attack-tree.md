## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured Logging (Data Leak) -> Expose Sensitive Data via Logs](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_logging__data_leak__-_expose_sensitive_data_via_logs.md)

Description: The `gf` framework's logging capabilities, if misconfigured, can expose sensitive data. This occurs when developers inadvertently log information like passwords, API keys, session tokens, or personally identifiable information (PII) to files or the console.
Attack Vector:
The attacker gains access to log files. This could be through:
Direct access to the server (if log files are stored in an insecure location).
Exploiting another vulnerability (e.g., path traversal) to read log files.
Accessing a publicly exposed log aggregation service (if logs are sent to an insecurely configured external service).
The attacker parses the log files and extracts the sensitive information.
Likelihood: Medium
Impact: High to Very High
Effort: Low
Skill Level: Novice
Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Default Settings -> Unprotected Routes](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_default_settings_-_unprotected_routes.md)

Description: The `gf` framework, like many frameworks, may have default settings or routes that are convenient for development but insecure for production. These might include default administrator accounts, exposed debugging endpoints, or overly permissive configurations.
Attack Vector:
The attacker attempts to access known default routes (e.g., `/debug`, `/admin`, `/status`, etc.).
If these routes are not properly secured (e.g., no authentication or authorization), the attacker gains access to the functionality exposed by the route. This could include:
Access to sensitive information (e.g., server configuration, database credentials).
Ability to modify application settings.
Ability to execute arbitrary code (in extreme cases).
Likelihood: Medium
Impact: High to Very High
Effort: Very Low
Skill Level: Novice
Detection Difficulty: Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ORM (gdb) -> SQLi via Unsafe Methods](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_orm__gdb__-_sqli_via_unsafe_methods.md)

Description: `gf`'s ORM (gdb) provides database interaction. If used incorrectly, it can be vulnerable to SQL injection (SQLi). This occurs when user-supplied data is directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
Attack Vector:
The attacker identifies an input field that is used in a database query.
The attacker crafts a malicious SQL payload and injects it into the input field.
The application, due to the lack of proper sanitization, executes the attacker's SQL payload.
The attacker can then:
Read sensitive data from the database.
Modify or delete data in the database.
Potentially gain control of the database server.
Likelihood: Low to Medium
Impact: Very High
Effort: Medium
Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Router (ghttp) -> Code Injection via Params](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_router__ghttp__-_code_injection_via_params.md)

Description: `gf`'s router (ghttp) handles HTTP requests. If user-supplied parameters are used to dynamically generate code (e.g., in templates or other parts of the application), code injection is possible.
Attack Vector:
The attacker identifies an input field that is used to generate code dynamically.
The attacker crafts a malicious code payload and injects it into the input field.
The application, due to the lack of proper sanitization or escaping, executes the attacker's code.
The attacker can then:
Execute arbitrary code on the server.
Gain full control of the application.
Potentially gain control of the server.
Likelihood: Low
Impact: Very High
Effort: Medium to High
Skill Level: Advanced
Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit gutil (Utility Functions) -> Command Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gutil__utility_functions__-_command_injection.md)

Description: `gf`'s `gutil` package contains various utility functions. If a utility function executes external commands and uses user-supplied input without proper sanitization, command injection is possible.
Attack Vector:
The attacker identifies an input field that is used in a utility function that executes an external command.
The attacker crafts a malicious command payload and injects it into the input field.
The application, due to the lack of proper sanitization, executes the attacker's command.
The attacker can then:
Execute arbitrary commands on the server.
Gain full control of the application.
Potentially gain control of the server.
Likelihood: Low
Impact: Very High
Effort: Medium
Skill Level: Advanced
Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard
