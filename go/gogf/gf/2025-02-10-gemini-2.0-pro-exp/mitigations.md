# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for gogf/gf

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Rule-Based Input Validation (gvalid)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_rule-based_input_validation__gvalid_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Enforce strict and comprehensive input validation using `gf`'s `gvalid` package.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all input points:** Determine every point where the application receives data from external sources, focusing on points where `gf` handles input (e.g., `ghttp.Request` parameters, `ghttp.UploadFile`).
    2.  **Define validation rules:** For each input field, define specific validation rules using `gvalid`'s built-in rules (e.g., `required`, `email`, `integer`, `min`, `max`, `length`, `regex`, etc.). Use the most restrictive rules possible.
    3.  **Implement custom rules (if needed):** For complex validation logic, create custom validation rules using `gvalid.RegisterRule`. Thoroughly test these custom rules.
    4.  **Chain rules:** Use rule chaining to combine multiple validation checks (e.g., `email|length:6,64`). Order rules logically.
    5.  **Struct validation:** Use struct tags to define validation rules directly within data structures, leveraging `gf`'s integration with `gvalid`.
    6.  **Check validation results:** *Always* check the return value of `gvalid.Check*` functions (or the result of struct validation). Handle validation errors appropriately.
    7.  **Return user-friendly errors:** Provide clear and concise error messages to the user, using `gf`'s error handling mechanisms, but *never* reveal sensitive information.
    8.  **Log detailed errors:** Log detailed validation errors internally for debugging, using `glog`.
    9.  **Bail Early (Optional):** Consider using the `bail` rule to stop on the first error.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Critical):** By validating input types and formats *before* they reach `gdb`, you prevent malicious SQL code.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High):** Validating input and preventing malicious scripts mitigates XSS, especially when combined with `gview`'s output encoding.
    *   **Command Injection (Critical):** Validating input to prevent execution of arbitrary commands, particularly relevant if using `gf` to interact with system processes.
    *   **Data Type Mismatches (Medium):** Ensuring data conforms to expected types prevents unexpected behavior within `gf` components.
    *   **Business Logic Errors (Variable):** Custom validation rules can enforce application-specific business logic constraints within the `gf` framework.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination if combined with `gdb`'s parameterized queries).
    *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced (effectiveness depends on `gview`'s output encoding as well).
    *   **Command Injection:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Data Type Mismatches:** Risk eliminated for validated fields within `gf`.
    *   **Business Logic Errors:** Risk reduced depending on the comprehensiveness of custom rules within `gf`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `/api/user/register`: Basic validation rules (`required`, `email`, `password`) are implemented using struct tags and `gf`'s integration.
    *   `/api/product/create`: Validation rules for product name, description, and price are implemented using `gvalid.CheckMap` within a `gf` handler.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `/api/user/profile`: No validation is currently implemented for user profile updates (e.g., address, phone number) handled by `gf`. **High Priority**
    *   `/api/search`: The search query parameter, processed by `gf`, is not validated. **Medium Priority**
    *   Custom validation rules are not used anywhere. **Medium Priority** (Assess if needed based on business logic within `gf` handlers).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries (gdb - Always)](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries__gdb_-_always_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Exclusively use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions using `gf`'s `gdb` ORM.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all `gdb` interactions:** Locate all instances where the application uses `gf`'s `gdb` to interact with the database.
    2.  **Use ORM methods:** Prefer using `gdb`'s ORM methods (e.g., `Model`, `Data`, `Where`, `Insert`, `Update`, `Delete`) over raw SQL.  These methods are designed to use parameterized queries.
    3.  **Avoid string concatenation:** *Never* construct SQL queries by concatenating strings with user-supplied data within `gdb` calls.
    4.  **Use placeholders:** Use placeholders (e.g., `?`) in your `Where` clauses and other query parts within `gdb` methods.
    5.  **Pass data separately:** Pass user-supplied data as separate arguments to the `gdb` methods (e.g., `Where("id = ?", userID)`).
    6.  **Avoid `Raw`:** Minimize the use of `gdb.Raw`. If unavoidable, ensure the SQL is static and contains *no* user input. Even then, be extremely cautious.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Critical):** Parameterized queries within `gdb` are the primary defense against SQL injection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk virtually eliminated if implemented correctly and consistently within all `gdb` interactions.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Most database interactions in `/api/product` use parameterized queries via `gdb`'s ORM.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `/api/report`: A custom report generation feature uses string concatenation within a `gdb` call to build a dynamic SQL query. **Critical Priority** (Immediate remediation required).
    *   Review all uses of `db.Raw` to ensure they are safe. **High Priority**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Session Management (gsession)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_session_management__gsession_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure and use `gf`'s `gsession` package with secure settings and practices.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose secure storage:** Use a secure session storage backend supported by `gsession` (e.g., Redis, database) instead of in-memory storage for production.
    2.  **Configure session ID length:** Ensure the session ID length is sufficiently long (check `gf`'s `gsession` default).
    3.  **Set timeouts:** Configure appropriate session idle and absolute timeouts using `gsession`'s configuration options.
    4.  **Enable HTTPOnly:** Verify that the `HTTPOnly` flag is set for session cookies (should be the default in `gsession`, but verify).
    5.  **Enable Secure:** Verify that the `Secure` flag is set for session cookies (should be automatic with HTTPS and `gsession`, but verify).
    6.  **Set SameSite:** Set the `SameSite` attribute to `Strict` or `Lax` using `gsession`'s configuration.
    7.  **Regenerate ID:** Regenerate the session ID after a successful login using `gsession.SetId`.
    8.  **Validate session:** On each request handled by `gf`, verify the session's validity (e.g., check for expiration, user ID) using `gsession`'s methods.
    9.  **Implement logout:** Provide a logout function that destroys the session using `gsession.Destroy`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Session Hijacking (High):** Secure flags and proper `gsession` management reduce the risk.
    *   **Session Fixation (High):** Session ID regeneration after login prevents fixation.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (High):** The `SameSite` attribute, set via `gsession`, helps mitigate CSRF.
    *   **Session Prediction (Medium):** A sufficiently long and random session ID, managed by `gsession`, makes prediction difficult.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Session Fixation:** Risk virtually eliminated.
    *   **CSRF:** Risk significantly reduced (especially with `SameSite=Strict`).
    *   **Session Prediction:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic session management is implemented using `gsession` with default settings.
    *   Redis is used as the session storage backend, configured through `gf`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Session ID regeneration after login (using `gsession.SetId`) is *not* implemented. **High Priority**
    *   `SameSite` attribute is not explicitly set via `gsession`'s configuration. **Medium Priority**
    *   Session validation on each request is basic (only checks for existence using `gsession`). **Medium Priority** (Enhance to check user ID and other attributes).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure File Uploads (ghttp.UploadFile)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_file_uploads__ghttp_uploadfile_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement strict file upload validation and secure storage practices, leveraging `gf`'s `ghttp.UploadFile` features.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Content-Based Type Validation:** Validate the file type based on its *content* (magic numbers), not just the extension or MIME type provided by the client. Use a library like `filetype` in conjunction with `ghttp.UploadFile.Content`.
    2.  **Size Limits:** Enforce strict file size limits using `ghttp.Request.SetMaxMemory`.
    3.  **Filename Sanitization:** Sanitize filenames to remove dangerous characters, using `gstr` functions or generating unique filenames (UUIDs) within your `gf` handler.
    4.  **Storage Outside Web Root:** Store uploaded files *outside* of the web root directory, ensuring the path is configured correctly within your `gf` application.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **File Upload Vulnerabilities (Critical):** Uploading and executing malicious files (e.g., shells) via `gf`'s upload handling.
    *   **Directory Traversal (High):** Uploading files to unintended locations through manipulation of `ghttp.UploadFile`.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High):** Uploading malicious HTML or JavaScript files that could be served by `gf`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **File Upload Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Directory Traversal:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced (effectiveness depends on other factors).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   File size limits are enforced using `ghttp.Request.SetMaxMemory`.
    *   Uploaded files are stored in a separate directory, configured within the `gf` application.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Content-based file type validation is *not* implemented. **Critical Priority** (Must be done in conjunction with `ghttp.UploadFile`).
    *   Filename sanitization is basic (only removes spaces). **High Priority** (Implement more robust sanitization or UUID generation within the `gf` handler).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Logging Practices (glog)](./mitigation_strategies/safe_logging_practices__glog_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Prevent sensitive data leakage in logs by using `gf`'s `glog` package with appropriate logging levels, masking sensitive data, and securing log storage.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Determine all types of sensitive data handled by the application.
    2.  **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data:** *Never* log sensitive data directly using `glog`.
    3.  **Masking/Redaction:** Use `glog`'s formatting capabilities or a dedicated library to mask or redact sensitive data before logging.
    4.  **Log Level Control:** Use appropriate log levels (Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Critical) provided by `glog`. Use a higher level (Info or Warning) in production.
    5.  **Log Rotation:** Configure log rotation using `glog`'s built-in features to prevent files from growing indefinitely.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Leakage (High):** Exposure of sensitive data in logs generated by `glog`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Leakage:** Risk significantly reduced if sensitive data is never logged or is properly masked using `glog`'s features.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `glog` is used for logging throughout the application.
    *   Log rotation is configured using `glog`'s settings.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Sensitive data masking is *not* implemented within `glog` calls. **Critical Priority** (Review all `glog` usage and implement masking).
    *   Log level is set to `Debug` in production. **High Priority** (Change to `Info` or `Warning` using `glog`'s configuration).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Generic Error Handling (gerror)](./mitigation_strategies/generic_error_handling__gerror_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Prevent information leakage through error messages by returning generic messages to users and logging detailed errors internally using `gf`'s `gerror` package.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Error Points:** Locate all places where errors can occur, particularly within `gf` components (e.g., `gdb`, `ghttp` handlers).
    2.  **Catch Errors:** Use `try...catch` blocks (or equivalent error handling) to catch potential errors, especially those returned by `gf` functions.
    3.  **Generic User Messages:** Return generic error messages to the user (e.g., "An error occurred. Please try again later.") within your `gf` handlers.
    4.  **Detailed Internal Logging:** Log detailed error information (including stack traces using `gerror.Stack()`) internally for debugging, using `glog`.
    5.  **Custom Error Handling:** Implement custom error handling logic using `gerror` to manage and wrap errors within your `gf` application.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Leakage (Medium):** Exposure of internal application details (including `gf` internals) through error messages.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Leakage:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic error handling is implemented in some areas using `gerror`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent use of generic error messages within `gf` handlers is *not* enforced. **Medium Priority** (Review all error handling and ensure generic messages are returned).
    *   Detailed internal logging with stack traces (using `gerror.Stack()`) is inconsistent. **Medium Priority**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure HTTP Request Handling (ghttp)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_http_request_handling__ghttp_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Use `gf`'s `ghttp` middleware, validate request components, restrict HTTP methods, and configure CORS properly, all within the `gf` framework.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Middleware:** Create `ghttp` middleware to:
        *   Validate request headers.
        *   Enforce rate limiting.
        *   Implement CSRF protection.
        *   Check authentication/authorization.
    2.  **Input Validation (Again):** Validate all request parameters, headers, and the body using `gvalid` within your `ghttp` handlers.
    3.  **HTTP Methods:** Explicitly define allowed HTTP methods for each route using `ghttp.Server.BindHandlerMethod`.
    4.  **CORS Configuration:** Configure CORS using `ghttp.Server.SetCors` with appropriate restrictions (avoid `AllowAllOrigins: true`).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (High):** `ghttp` middleware and `gsession`'s `SameSite` cookies can mitigate CSRF.
    *   **Request Smuggling (Medium):** Proper header validation within `ghttp` handlers can help.
    *   **Header Injection (Medium):** Validating headers within `ghttp` prevents injection attacks.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High):** Authentication/authorization middleware within `ghttp` prevents unauthorized access.
    *   **CORS Misconfiguration (Medium):** Proper CORS settings using `ghttp.Server.SetCors` prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSRF:** Risk significantly reduced with proper `ghttp` middleware and `gsession` cookie settings.
    *   **Request Smuggling/Header Injection:** Risk reduced with header validation within `ghttp`.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced with authentication/authorization middleware in `ghttp`.
    *   **CORS Misconfiguration:** Risk eliminated with correct CORS configuration using `ghttp.Server.SetCors`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic authentication middleware is implemented using `ghttp`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   CSRF protection middleware is *not* implemented within `ghttp`. **High Priority**
    *   Rate limiting middleware is *not* implemented within `ghttp`. **Medium Priority**
    *   CORS is not explicitly configured using `ghttp.Server.SetCors`. **Medium Priority**
    *   HTTP methods are not explicitly restricted for all routes using `ghttp.Server.BindHandlerMethod`. **Low Priority**
