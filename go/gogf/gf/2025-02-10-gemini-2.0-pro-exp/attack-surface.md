# Attack Surface Analysis for gogf/gf

## Attack Surface: [Template Injection (gview)](./attack_surfaces/template_injection__gview_.md)

*   **Description:**  User-supplied data is rendered directly into templates without proper escaping, allowing attackers to inject malicious code.
    *   **How gf Contributes:**  gf's `gview` template engine provides flexibility, but incorrect usage can lead to template injection.  This is a *direct* consequence of using `gview`.
    *   **Example:**  Rendering user input directly in a template: `{{.UserInput}}` without using the built-in escaping functions (like `{{.UserInput | html}}` or the auto-escaping features).
    *   **Impact:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or even Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the template engine allows it.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  **Critical** (if RCE is possible), **High** (for XSS)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Always use gf's built-in escaping functions (e.g., `html`, `js`, `url`) when rendering user-supplied data in templates.  Enable auto-escaping if available.  Avoid using "unsafe" template functions that bypass escaping.  Sanitize user input before passing it to the template engine.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (gdb - ORM Misuse)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__gdb_-_orm_misuse_.md)

*   **Description:**  Improper use of the ORM or raw SQL queries allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
    *   **How gf Contributes:**  While gf's ORM aims to prevent SQLi, incorrect usage (e.g., string concatenation with user input) can bypass these protections. The vulnerability exists *because* of the ORM and how it's used.
    *   **Example:**  Using string concatenation to build a query: `db.Table("users").Where("name = '" + userInput + "'").All()`.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches, data modification, data deletion, database server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by the gf ORM.  Avoid constructing SQL queries using string concatenation with user-provided input.  Use the ORM's built-in methods for filtering, sorting, and updating data.  Example of safe usage: `db.Table("users").Where("name", userInput).All()`.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal (Static File Serving)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal__static_file_serving_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers manipulate file paths to access files or directories outside the intended web root.
    *   **How gf Contributes:**  gf's built-in static file serving functionality (`ghttp.Server`'s static file handling) is the *direct source* of this potential vulnerability if misconfigured.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker might use a URL like `/static/../../etc/passwd` to try to access the system's password file.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive files (configuration files, source code, etc.), potentially leading to further compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Carefully define the root directory for static file serving using `ghttp.Server`.  Use gf's configuration options to restrict access to specific files or directories.  Sanitize user-provided input used in file paths.  Avoid serving sensitive files directly.  Use a dedicated web server (like Nginx or Apache) for static file serving in production, as they often have more robust path traversal protection.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Cryptography (gcrypto)](./attack_surfaces/weak_cryptography__gcrypto_.md)

*   **Description:** Using outdated or weak cryptographic algorithms or improper key management.
    *   **How gf Contributes:** gf provides cryptographic functions (`gcrypto`), and the *choice* of which functions to use and *how* to use them directly impacts security. This is a direct attack surface of using `gcrypto`.
    *   **Example:** Using MD5 for password hashing or hardcoding encryption keys in the codebase.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of sensitive data, authentication bypass.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use strong, recommended cryptographic algorithms (e.g., SHA-256 or SHA-3 for hashing, AES-256 with a secure mode like GCM for encryption). Store cryptographic keys securely, outside of the codebase (e.g., using a key management system or environment variables). Generate strong, random keys. Avoid hardcoding keys. Follow cryptographic best practices (e.g., using appropriate initialization vectors and nonces).

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Request Body Limit](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_request_body_limit.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send excessively large request bodies to exhaust server resources.
    *   **How gf Contributes:** gf's `ghttp.Server` needs to be configured with appropriate limits to prevent this. The lack of a default, safe limit in `ghttp.Server` is a direct contributor.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a multi-gigabyte request body to an endpoint that doesn't have a size limit.
    *   **Impact:** Server resource exhaustion, service unavailability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use the `ClientMaxBodySize` option in `ghttp.Server` to set a reasonable limit on the size of request bodies.

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive CORS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_cors_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allows unauthorized websites to interact with the application.
    *   **How gf Contributes:** gf provides extensive CORS configuration options via `ghttp.Server`, increasing the risk of misconfiguration if not handled carefully. The extensive configuration *options* are the direct attack surface.
    *   **Example:** Setting `AllowAllOrigins: true` in the `ghttp.Server` configuration allows *any* website to make requests to the application.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized actions, account takeover. Malicious websites can steal user data or perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Explicitly define allowed origins, methods, and headers in the CORS configuration. Avoid using wildcards (`*`) for origins in production. Use specific origins (e.g., `https://www.example.com`). Test CORS configuration thoroughly. Use gf's built-in CORS middleware with careful, restrictive settings.
