# Threat Model Analysis for gogf/gf

## Threat: [ORM Data Tampering via Unsafe Methods](./threats/orm_data_tampering_via_unsafe_methods.md)

**1. Threat: ORM Data Tampering via Unsafe Methods**

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when used with gf's `gdb` ORM's `Raw` or `Unsafe` methods (or similar functions that bypass prepared statements), allows for SQL injection. The attacker might try to insert, modify, or delete data, or even execute arbitrary SQL commands.  This *directly* involves the misuse of gf's database interaction methods.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data corruption, unauthorized data modification, potential server compromise (if the database user has excessive privileges).
*   **Affected gf Component:** `gdb` (ORM module), specifically functions like `Raw`, `Unsafe`, and any custom query builders that don't use parameterized queries.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly avoid** using `Raw` or `Unsafe` unless absolutely necessary.
    *   If `Raw` or `Unsafe` are unavoidable, *always* use parameterized queries (using `?` placeholders and passing values separately).  Never concatenate user input directly into the SQL string.
    *   Prefer using the ORM's structured query builder methods (e.g., `Where`, `Select`, `Insert`, `Update`, `Delete`) whenever possible.
    *   Implement input validation *before* data reaches the ORM layer (although this is a general mitigation, the core vulnerability is within `gdb`).
    *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with SQL injection detection capabilities (general mitigation, but helpful).

## Threat: [Request Parameter Tampering with Insufficient Validation (Direct gf Usage)](./threats/request_parameter_tampering_with_insufficient_validation__direct_gf_usage_.md)

**2. Threat: Request Parameter Tampering with Insufficient Validation (Direct gf Usage)**

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates HTTP request parameters. While this is a general web vulnerability, the *direct* gf involvement is the failure to properly utilize gf's `gvalid` module or creating inadequate custom validation *within* gf's request handling. The attacker exploits weaknesses in how gf's request processing and validation features are *used*.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to data or functionality, data corruption, business logic bypass, potential for other vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected gf Component:** `ghttp` (HTTP server module), `gvalid` (validation module). The threat arises from *incorrect or insufficient use* of these modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use `gvalid` extensively and define strict validation rules for *all* request parameters. This is the *primary* mitigation, directly addressing the gf component usage.
    *   Validate data types, formats, lengths, ranges, and allowed values, leveraging `gvalid`'s capabilities.
    *   Validate nested data structures recursively, using `gvalid`'s support for this.
    *   Implement server-side validation using `gvalid`; do not rely solely on client-side validation.

## Threat: [Template Injection via Unsafe Template Rendering (Direct gf Usage)](./threats/template_injection_via_unsafe_template_rendering__direct_gf_usage_.md)

**3. Threat: Template Injection via Unsafe Template Rendering (Direct gf Usage)**

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into a template.  The *direct* gf involvement is either disabling `gview`'s auto-escaping, using custom template functions insecurely *within* `gview`, or loading templates from untrusted sources *through* `gview`. The vulnerability stems from misusing or bypassing gf's template engine's security features.
*   **Impact:**  Cross-site scripting (XSS), server-side code execution (in severe cases), data exfiltration, website defacement.
*   **Affected gf Component:** `gview` (template engine module). The threat is directly tied to the use (or misuse) of this module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that auto-escaping is enabled in `gview` (this is usually the default and is the *primary* gf-specific mitigation).
    *   Load templates only from trusted sources (e.g., the application's file system) *using gview's intended loading mechanisms*.
    *   Avoid passing unsanitized user input directly to `gview`'s template rendering functions.
    *   If custom template functions are necessary, ensure they properly escape any user-provided data using gf's escaping functions or Go's `html/template` package, *integrating this securely with gview*.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Direct ghttp)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__direct_ghttp_.md)

**4. Threat: Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Direct ghttp)**

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests, uploads large files, or uses other techniques to consume server resources. This *directly* targets gf's `ghttp` server's ability to handle concurrent requests, manage connections, and enforce resource limits. The vulnerability lies in the inherent capabilities and limitations of the `ghttp` server itself.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption.
*   **Affected gf Component:** `ghttp` (HTTP server module).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting (using gf's built-in features *if available and appropriate*, or a third-party library integrated with `ghttp`). This is a key mitigation directly related to `ghttp`'s request handling.
    *   Configure timeouts for requests and connections within `ghttp`'s configuration to prevent slowloris attacks. This is a *direct* configuration of the `ghttp` component.
    *   Limit the size of file uploads *through ghttp's configuration or handling*.
    *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) (general mitigation).
    *   Monitor server resource usage (general mitigation).
    *   Use a load balancer (general mitigation).

## Threat: [Configuration Spoofing (Direct gf Configuration)](./threats/configuration_spoofing__direct_gf_configuration_.md)

**5. Threat: Configuration Spoofing (Direct gf Configuration)**

* **Description:** An attacker gains access to and modifies the application's configuration files, impacting how gf components behave. This *directly* targets gf's configuration loading and management system. The vulnerability is the ability to alter the settings that control gf's behavior.
* **Impact:** Application compromise, data breach, denial of service, depending on the specific configuration changes.
* **Affected gf Component:** gf's configuration management system (how it loads and parses configuration files, and how those settings affect all other components).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Protect configuration files with strict file system permissions (read-only for the application user). This is a general mitigation, but crucial for protecting gf's configuration.
    * Use environment variables for sensitive configuration values (e.g., passwords, API keys) *that are then read by gf's configuration system*.
    * Consider using a dedicated secrets management solution (general mitigation).
    * Implement configuration file integrity monitoring (general mitigation).

## Threat: [Component Misconfiguration Leading to Privilege Escalation (Direct gf Components)](./threats/component_misconfiguration_leading_to_privilege_escalation__direct_gf_components_.md)

**6. Threat: Component Misconfiguration Leading to Privilege Escalation (Direct gf Components)**

* **Description:** Misconfiguration of gf components, particularly those related to authentication, authorization (e.g., `gaccess`), or session management (`gsession`), creates vulnerabilities. This *directly* involves the incorrect setup of gf's security-related features.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, privilege escalation.
* **Affected gf Component:** Any gf component with security-related configuration options, including `ghttp`, `gaccess`, `gsession`, `gdb`. The threat is the *incorrect configuration* of these components.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Thoroughly understand the configuration options for all security-relevant gf components used. This is *crucial* for secure use of gf.
    * Follow security best practices and the principle of least privilege when configuring gf components.
    * Use a secure configuration management system (general mitigation, but important for managing gf's configuration).
    * Regularly audit component configurations for security weaknesses, *specifically focusing on gf components*.
    * Keep gf and its components up to date to benefit from security patches (general, but applies to gf).
