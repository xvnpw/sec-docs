Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Loki, with high and critical risk severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Log Injection via Push API
    *   **Description:** Malicious actors inject crafted log messages containing control characters or escape sequences.
    *   **How Loki Contributes:** Loki's Push API accepts arbitrary log data, and if not sanitized properly by downstream systems consuming these logs (e.g., Grafana dashboards, alerting rules), it can lead to unintended consequences.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a log message like `User 'admin' logged in successfully\n<script>alert('XSS')</script>` which, if displayed directly in a Grafana dashboard without proper escaping, could execute JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) in dashboards, command injection in vulnerable log processing pipelines, information disclosure through manipulated log displays.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on systems consuming logs from Loki (e.g., Grafana).
        *   Use templating engines in dashboards that automatically escape special characters.
        *   Educate users about the risks of clicking on potentially malicious content within logs.

*   **Attack Surface:** Denial of Service (DoS) via High Volume Ingestion
    *   **Description:** Attackers flood the Loki ingestion endpoint with a massive volume of logs.
    *   **How Loki Contributes:** Loki's design, while scalable, can be overwhelmed by a sufficiently large influx of data, especially if resource limits are not properly configured.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends thousands of log entries per second with random data, overwhelming the Loki ingesters and potentially making the service unavailable for legitimate log data.
    *   **Impact:**  Loki service unavailability, impacting monitoring and alerting capabilities. Increased infrastructure costs due to excessive resource consumption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on the Loki push API endpoint.
        *   Configure resource limits (CPU, memory) for Loki components (ingesters, distributors).
        *   Use authentication and authorization to restrict access to the push API.
        *   Implement network-level controls (e.g., firewalls) to filter malicious traffic.

*   **Attack Surface:** Information Disclosure via Log Content
    *   **Description:** Unauthorized users gain access to sensitive information contained within the logs.
    *   **How Loki Contributes:** If access controls within Loki are not properly configured, users with query access might be able to view logs they shouldn't.
    *   **Example:** A developer with read access to all logs queries for logs containing "password=" and inadvertently gains access to sensitive credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential compliance violations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement granular access control policies within Loki to restrict access to specific log streams based on user roles or permissions.
        *   Avoid logging sensitive information directly. If necessary, redact or mask sensitive data before logging.
        *   Regularly review and audit Loki access control configurations.

*   **Attack Surface:** Unauthorized Access to Storage Backend
    *   **Description:** Attackers gain direct access to the underlying storage where Loki stores log data.
    *   **How Loki Contributes:** Loki relies on an external storage backend (e.g., object storage, filesystem). If this storage is not properly secured, it bypasses Loki's access controls.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker gains access to the AWS S3 bucket used by Loki and can directly download all stored log data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of all log data, potential for data manipulation or deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the underlying storage backend with strong access controls (e.g., IAM roles for object storage).
        *   Encrypt data at rest in the storage backend.
        *   Regularly review and audit storage backend access policies.

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposure of Configuration Files
    *   **Description:** Loki's configuration files are exposed or accessible to unauthorized users.
    *   **How Loki Contributes:** Configuration files can contain sensitive information like API keys, storage credentials, and internal network details.
    *   **Example:** A misconfigured web server exposes the `loki.yaml` file, allowing an attacker to retrieve storage credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of Loki instance, potential access to underlying storage, exposure of internal network details.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to Loki configuration files using appropriate file system permissions.
        *   Store sensitive configuration data (e.g., credentials) securely using secrets management tools.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files if possible.

*   **Attack Surface:** Weak or Default Credentials
    *   **Description:** Using default or weak credentials for any authentication mechanisms within Loki.
    *   **How Loki Contributes:** If authentication is enabled but uses weak or default credentials, it provides an easy entry point for attackers.
    *   **Example:**  The basic authentication for the Loki push API is left with the default username and password.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the push API, allowing injection of malicious logs or DoS attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all authentication mechanisms.
        *   Change default credentials immediately upon deployment.
        *   Consider using more robust authentication methods like client certificates or OAuth 2.0.
