# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for kataras/iris

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Iris's Request Binding and Validation](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_iris's_request_binding_and_validation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Validation Rules using Iris:** Leverage Iris's built-in request binding and validation capabilities. Define validation rules directly within your Iris route handlers or using struct tags for request models.
    2.  **Use `Context.ReadJSON`, `Context.ReadForm`, `Context.Bind`:** Employ Iris's `Context` methods like `ReadJSON`, `Context.ReadForm`, or `Bind` to automatically parse and validate incoming request data based on defined rules.
    3.  **Handle Validation Errors:** Utilize Iris's validation error handling to gracefully catch validation failures and return appropriate error responses (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request) to the client.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Input Data Integrity Issues - Medium Severity: Ensures data conforms to expected formats and types, preventing unexpected application behavior.
    *   Injection Vulnerabilities (Indirectly) - Medium Severity: By enforcing data types and formats, it reduces the likelihood of certain injection attacks by limiting the attack surface.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Input Data Integrity Issues: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Injection Vulnerabilities (Indirectly): Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic data type validation using `Context.Bind` is implemented in `controllers/auth_controller.go` for user registration and login requests.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive validation rules are not defined for all API endpoints. Many endpoints rely on implicit data type checks but lack explicit validation rules for format, range, or allowed values using Iris's validation features.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Employ Iris's Template Engine Escaping](./mitigation_strategies/employ_iris's_template_engine_escaping.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Iris's HTML Template Engine:** Utilize Iris's built-in HTML template engine for rendering dynamic web pages.
    2.  **Automatic Output Escaping:** Rely on Iris's template engine's automatic HTML escaping feature. When using template actions like `{{.Data}}`, the engine automatically escapes output to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Verify Escaping Configuration:** Ensure that Iris's template engine is configured to enable automatic escaping by default. Review template engine initialization settings in your `main.go` or template loading logic.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity: Prevents injection of malicious scripts into web pages by automatically encoding dynamic content rendered through templates.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Iris's default HTML template engine is used for rendering web pages in the application. It is assumed that automatic HTML escaping is enabled by default.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit verification of template engine escaping configuration is needed to confirm it is active and functioning as expected. Configuration settings related to template engine escaping in Iris are not explicitly reviewed or documented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Secure Iris Session Management](./mitigation_strategies/configure_secure_iris_session_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Iris's Session Middleware:** Implement Iris's built-in session middleware to manage user sessions.
    2.  **Configure Secure Cookie Settings:** When initializing the session manager using `sessions.New`, configure secure cookie attributes:
        *   `CookieHTTPOnly: true`:  Prevent client-side JavaScript access to session cookies.
        *   `CookieSecure: true`: Ensure cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.
        *   `CookieSameSite`: Set to `http.SameSiteStrictMode` or `http.SameSiteLaxMode` to mitigate CSRF risks.
    3.  **Apply Session Middleware to Routes:** Ensure the session middleware is applied to all relevant routes that require session management using `app.Use(sess.Handler())`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Session Hijacking - High Severity: Secure cookie settings mitigate various session hijacking techniques.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) based Session Stealing - High Severity: `CookieHTTPOnly` prevents JavaScript access to session cookies.
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - Medium Severity: `CookieSameSite` helps mitigate CSRF attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Session Hijacking: High Risk Reduction
    *   XSS based Session Stealing: High Risk Reduction
    *   CSRF: Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Iris session middleware is used for user authentication. `CookieHTTPOnly` and `CookieSecure` are set to `true` in the session configuration in `main.go`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `CookieSameSite` attribute is not explicitly set in the session configuration. It should be configured for enhanced CSRF protection.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Custom Iris Error Handlers](./mitigation_strategies/implement_custom_iris_error_handlers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `app.OnErrorCode` or `app.OnAnyErrorCode`:** Define custom error handlers in Iris using `app.OnErrorCode(errorCode, handler)` or `app.OnAnyErrorCode(handler)` to intercept and manage HTTP errors.
    2.  **Control Error Responses in Handlers:** Within custom error handlers, control the error information presented to users. Avoid exposing sensitive details like stack traces or internal paths in production.
    3.  **Utilize `iris.Logger()` for Error Logging:** Use Iris's built-in logger (`iris.Logger()`) within error handlers to log error details securely on the server-side for debugging and monitoring.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure - Medium Severity: Prevents attackers from gaining sensitive information from default error pages.
    *   Security Misconfiguration - Medium Severity: Reduces the risk of exposing internal application details through error responses.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Security Misconfiguration: Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Custom error handlers are implemented for 404 and 500 errors in `main.go` using `app.OnErrorCode`, displaying user-friendly error pages. `iris.Logger()` is used for basic application logging.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Error handlers are not implemented for all relevant HTTP error codes. Need to consider adding handlers for other codes like 403, 401, etc.
    *   Error responses in production might still leak some internal information. Review error handlers to ensure minimal information disclosure in production environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Iris Middleware for Security Headers](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_iris_middleware_for_security_headers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create or Use Security Headers Middleware:** Develop custom Iris middleware or utilize existing middleware packages to automatically set security-related HTTP headers in responses.
    2.  **Apply Middleware Globally or Route-Specific:** Apply the security headers middleware globally using `app.Use(securityHeadersMiddleware)` or to specific routes/groups using `app.Party("/api").Use(securityHeadersMiddleware)`.
    3.  **Configure Headers in Middleware:** Within the middleware, set essential security headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `Strict-Transport-Security` using `ctx.Header().Set()`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity: CSP and `X-XSS-Protection` headers mitigate XSS attacks.
    *   Clickjacking - Medium Severity: `X-Frame-Options` header prevents clickjacking.
    *   MIME-Sniffing Vulnerabilities - Low Severity: `X-Content-Type-Options` header prevents MIME-sniffing.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks - High Severity: HSTS header enforces HTTPS.
*   **Impact:**
    *   XSS: High Risk Reduction
    *   Clickjacking: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   MIME-Sniffing Vulnerabilities: Low Risk Reduction
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No security headers middleware is currently implemented in the project.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Security headers middleware needs to be created or integrated and applied to the Iris application in `main.go`. Configuration of specific security headers within the middleware is required.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Iris CORS Middleware (If Needed)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_iris_cors_middleware__if_needed_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Iris CORS Middleware:** If cross-origin requests are necessary, use Iris's CORS middleware (`cors.New`).
    2.  **Define CORS Configuration:** Configure the CORS middleware with specific options like `AllowedOrigins`, `AllowedMethods`, `AllowedHeaders` to control cross-origin access.
    3.  **Apply CORS Middleware:** Apply the CORS middleware to relevant routes or globally using `app.Use(corsMiddleware)`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Misconfiguration - Medium Severity: Prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests if properly configured.
*   **Impact:**
    *   CORS Misconfiguration: Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   CORS middleware is not implemented as the application is currently designed for same-origin access.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   If cross-origin functionality is required in the future, Iris CORS middleware needs to be implemented and configured in `main.go` with appropriate CORS settings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Iris CSRF Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/implement_iris_csrf_middleware.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Iris CSRF Middleware:** Implement Iris's built-in CSRF middleware (`csrf.New`).
    2.  **Configure CSRF Middleware:** Configure CSRF middleware options like token lookup methods, cookie settings, and token length.
    3.  **Apply CSRF Middleware to Routes:** Apply CSRF middleware to routes that handle state-changing requests (forms, API endpoints for POST, PUT, DELETE) using `app.Use(csrfMiddleware)`.
    4.  **Template Integration (for Forms):** For HTML forms, ensure CSRF tokens are automatically injected into forms by Iris's CSRF middleware or manually include the token in form submissions.
    5.  **Token Validation (Automatic):** Iris CSRF middleware automatically validates CSRF tokens on incoming requests.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - Medium Severity: Prevents CSRF attacks by validating tokens on state-changing requests.
*   **Impact:**
    *   CSRF: Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   CSRF protection is not currently implemented in the project.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Iris CSRF middleware needs to be implemented and configured in `main.go`. It should be applied to all relevant routes that handle state-changing operations. Integration with HTML forms to include CSRF tokens is also required.
