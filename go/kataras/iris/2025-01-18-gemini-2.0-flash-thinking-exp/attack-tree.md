## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH] Path Traversal via Route Parameters](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high-risk_path__path_traversal_via_route_parameters.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Craft URLs with manipulated route parameters to access unauthorized files or directories.
*   **Insight:** If Iris routes directly map to file system paths based on parameters, vulnerabilities can arise, allowing attackers to access sensitive files or even application code.
*   **Mitigation:** Avoid directly mapping route parameters to file system paths. Use secure file handling mechanisms and validate file access permissions rigorously.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high-risk_path__exploit_middleware_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This represents a broad category of attacks targeting weaknesses in the middleware layer.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH] Bypass Security Middleware](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high-risk_path__bypass_security_middleware.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Find ways to circumvent authentication, authorization, or other security middleware implemented in Iris.
*   **Insight:** Incorrect middleware ordering or vulnerabilities within custom middleware can lead to bypasses, effectively negating security controls.
*   **Mitigation:** Ensure correct middleware ordering in the Iris application. Thoroughly audit custom middleware for vulnerabilities and adhere to secure coding practices. Utilize Iris's built-in middleware features securely.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Middleware](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_middleware.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Leverage known vulnerabilities in middleware packages used with Iris.
*   **Insight:** Applications often integrate third-party middleware, which can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly managed and updated.
*   **Mitigation:** Keep all middleware dependencies up-to-date. Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Session Management Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_session_management_weaknesses.md)

*   This encompasses various attacks targeting the way user sessions are managed.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH] Session Fixation](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high-risk_path__session_fixation.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Force a user to use a known session ID.
*   **Insight:** If Iris's session management doesn't properly regenerate session IDs after login or other sensitive actions, attackers can fix a user's session ID and then hijack their session.
*   **Mitigation:** Ensure session IDs are regenerated upon successful login and other sensitive actions. Use secure session ID generation mechanisms provided by Iris or well-vetted libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Error Handling Issues](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_error_handling_issues.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Trigger errors that reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings, database structure, or file paths through error messages.
*   **Insight:** Default error handling in Iris or poorly configured custom error handling might expose too much detail to users, aiding attackers in reconnaissance and further exploitation.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement custom error handling that logs detailed errors securely (e.g., to a dedicated log file) but presents generic, non-revealing error messages to users.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Template Engine Vulnerabilities (if used)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high-risk_path__exploit_template_engine_vulnerabilities__if_used_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Inject malicious code into template inputs that gets executed on the server (Server-Side Template Injection - SSTI).
*   **Insight:** If user-controlled data is directly used in template rendering without proper sanitization or escaping, attackers can inject malicious code that the template engine will execute on the server, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution.
*   **Mitigation:** Avoid using user-controlled data directly in template rendering. Sanitize or escape user input appropriately before using it in templates. Use a secure templating engine and keep it updated. Consider using template engines that offer automatic contextual escaping.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit File Serving Vulnerabilities (if serving static files)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_file_serving_vulnerabilities__if_serving_static_files_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Craft requests to access files outside the intended static file directory (Path Traversal).
*   **Insight:** Incorrect configuration or lack of input validation in Iris's static file serving functionality can allow attackers to access sensitive configuration files, application code, or other unauthorized files.
*   **Mitigation:** Ensure proper configuration of static file serving directories and restrict access to only necessary files. Avoid using user input to construct file paths for serving static content.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Default Configurations or Examples](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_default_configurations_or_examples.md)

*   This category highlights risks associated with using default settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH] Use of Default Secrets or Keys](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high-risk_path__use_of_default_secrets_or_keys.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Utilize default API keys, encryption keys, or other secrets provided in Iris examples or default configurations that haven't been changed.
*   **Insight:** Developers might overlook or forget to change default security credentials, leaving the application vulnerable to easy compromise if these defaults are known or easily guessed.
*   **Mitigation:** Enforce the changing of all default secrets and keys during the application setup process. Provide clear instructions and mechanisms for developers to manage secrets securely.
