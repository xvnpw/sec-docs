**Security Implications of Key Components:**

**Client ("User Browser/Application"):**

*   **Security Consideration:**  Susceptibility to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the application renders user-generated content without proper sanitization.
    *   **Iris Specific Implication:**  If the Iris application uses a template engine (like Django Templates or Pug/Jade as mentioned in the technology stack), vulnerabilities in how data is passed to and rendered by the template engine can lead to XSS.
*   **Security Consideration:**  Risk of storing sensitive data insecurely on the client-side (e.g., in local storage).
    *   **Iris Specific Implication:**  While Iris doesn't directly control client-side storage, the application logic within Iris handlers might instruct the client to store sensitive information.
*   **Security Consideration:**  Potential for manipulation of client-side logic if not properly secured.
    *   **Iris Specific Implication:**  If the Iris application relies heavily on client-side JavaScript for critical operations, vulnerabilities in this JavaScript could be exploited.

**Network ("Internet/Network"):**

*   **Security Consideration:**  Vulnerability to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks if communication is not encrypted using TLS.
    *   **Iris Specific Implication:**  The Iris Web Server component is responsible for handling TLS. Misconfiguration of TLS settings within Iris can lead to weak encryption or the absence of encryption.
*   **Security Consideration:**  Exposure to Denial-of-Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.
    *   **Iris Specific Implication:**  While Iris itself has some basic protection, relying solely on the framework might not be sufficient. Load Balancers (if used) play a crucial role in mitigating these attacks.
*   **Security Consideration:**  Risk of network-based attacks if network segmentation is not properly implemented.
    *   **Iris Specific Implication:**  The deployment environment and network configuration surrounding the Iris application are critical.

**Load Balancer ("Load Balancer (Optional)"):**

*   **Security Consideration:**  Risk of Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) if the template engine allows for the execution of arbitrary code within templates.
    *   **Iris Specific Implication:**  Avoid allowing user input to directly influence the template being rendered or the template syntax itself.

**Session Manager ("Session Manager"):**

*   **Security Consideration:**  Insecure generation or storage of session IDs, making them susceptible to prediction or hijacking.
    *   **Iris Specific Implication:**  Use Iris's built-in session management features or a well-vetted third-party library that generates cryptographically secure session IDs. Store session data securely (e.g., using HTTPOnly and Secure flags for cookies).
*   **Security Consideration:**  Vulnerability to session fixation attacks if the application accepts session IDs from untrusted sources.
    *   **Iris Specific Implication:**  Regenerate session IDs upon successful login to prevent session fixation.
*   **Security Consideration:**  Lack of proper session timeout mechanisms, allowing sessions to remain active indefinitely.
    *   **Iris Specific Implication:**  Configure appropriate session timeouts within the Iris application.

**External Services ("External API/Service"):**
