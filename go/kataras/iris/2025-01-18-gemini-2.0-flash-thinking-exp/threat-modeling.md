# Threat Model Analysis for kataras/iris

## Threat: [Ambiguous Route Exploitation](./threats/ambiguous_route_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies overlapping or poorly defined route patterns within the Iris application's routing configuration. They craft specific URLs that exploit these ambiguities to access unintended handler functions, potentially bypassing security checks or accessing sensitive data managed by Iris's routing logic.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, execution of unintended code paths, potential for privilege escalation if the accessed handler has elevated permissions.
*   **Affected Iris Component:** `github.com/kataras/iris/v12.Router` (Route registration and matching logic).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully design and test route definitions to avoid overlaps.
    *   Utilize Iris's route parameter constraints (e.g., regular expressions) to enforce specific input formats.
    *   Use explicit route definitions instead of relying heavily on wildcard or catch-all routes.
    *   Implement thorough integration testing of all routes to ensure expected behavior.

## Threat: [Insecure Session Storage Exploitation](./threats/insecure_session_storage_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker targets the session storage mechanism used by the Iris application. If the default or easily compromised storage is used (e.g., default in-memory storage in production) or misconfigured within Iris's session management, attackers might be able to access, modify, or steal session data, potentially leading to session hijacking.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts, data breaches, manipulation of user data.
*   **Affected Iris Component:** `github.com/kataras/iris/v12/sessions` (Session management module).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use a secure and persistent session storage backend supported by Iris, like Redis or a database.
    *   Configure session storage with appropriate security settings provided by Iris, such as encryption and secure cookies.
    *   Regularly rotate session keys as configured within Iris.
    *   Implement proper session timeout mechanisms using Iris's session configuration.

## Threat: [Predictable Session ID Hijacking](./threats/predictable_session_id_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** If Iris's default session ID generation algorithm is weak or predictable, an attacker might be able to guess valid session IDs. Once a valid session ID is obtained, the attacker can hijack the corresponding user session managed by Iris.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, impersonation, data breaches, manipulation of user data.
*   **Affected Iris Component:** `github.com/kataras/iris/v12/sessions` (Session ID generation).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Iris is configured to use a cryptographically secure random number generator for session ID generation (this is generally the default, but verify).
    *   Consider using a custom session manager if more control over session ID generation is required beyond Iris's built-in options.
    *   Implement measures to detect and prevent brute-force session ID guessing attempts.

## Threat: [Session Fixation Attack](./threats/session_fixation_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker tricks a user into using a specific session ID controlled by the attacker. If Iris's session management doesn't regenerate the session ID after successful login, the attacker can then use the same session ID to access the user's account after they log in.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, impersonation, data breaches, manipulation of user data.
*   **Affected Iris Component:** `github.com/kataras/iris/v12/sessions` (Session management during login).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the application calls Iris's session regeneration methods upon successful user authentication (login).
    *   Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies using Iris's session configuration to prevent client-side script access and transmission over insecure connections.

## Threat: [Exposure of Debug Endpoints in Production](./threats/exposure_of_debug_endpoints_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might accidentally leave Iris's built-in debugging endpoints or functionalities enabled in a production deployment. Attackers can discover and exploit these endpoints to gain insights into the application's internal state, configuration managed by Iris, or even potentially trigger actions.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for code execution or manipulation of application state through Iris's debugging features.
*   **Affected Iris Component:** Iris's built-in debugging features (e.g., pprof endpoints if enabled).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure all debugging endpoints and functionalities provided by Iris are explicitly disabled or removed in production deployments.
    *   Use environment variables or configuration files to manage debug settings for Iris.
    *   Implement strict access controls for any remaining administrative or debugging interfaces, even if they are not directly part of Iris.
