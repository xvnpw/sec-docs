# Analysis of Path Traversal via Static File Serving Misconfiguration in Iris

## 1. Understanding the Threat

**Threat Name:** Path Traversal via Static File Serving Misconfiguration

**OWASP Category:** A01:2021 â€“ Broken Access Control

**CWE ID:** CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')

**Attack Surface:** The `iris.StaticWeb(...)` function, specifically the `root` parameter and how it handles incoming file requests.

**Attacker Motivation:**
* **Information Disclosure:** Accessing sensitive configuration files (database credentials, API keys), source code, internal documents, user data backups, logs, etc.
* **System Compromise (Indirect):** Potentially gaining access to executable files or scripts that could be executed to further compromise the server.
* **Denial of Service (Indirect):**  Repeatedly accessing large files or triggering errors could potentially lead to resource exhaustion.
* **Reputation Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.

**Likelihood of Exploitation:** Moderate to High. Misconfiguration is a common occurrence, and path traversal techniques are well-known and easily automated. The likelihood depends on the developer's understanding of secure configuration and the rigor of their testing process.

## 2. Deep Dive into the Vulnerability

The core issue lies in the way `iris.StaticWeb(...)` maps incoming URL paths to files on the server's filesystem. If the `root` directory is not carefully chosen and the framework doesn't sufficiently sanitize or restrict the requested path, attackers can manipulate the URL to access files outside the intended static directory.

**Breakdown of the Vulnerable Process:**

1. **Request Reception:** Iris receives an HTTP request targeting the path configured for static file serving (e.g., `/static/<file_path>`).
2. **Path Construction:** Iris takes the portion of the URL after the static path prefix (`<file_path>`) and appends it to the configured `root` directory.
3. **File System Access:** The resulting path is used to attempt to access a file on the server's filesystem.

**Vulnerability Point:** If `<file_path>` contains path traversal sequences like `../`, `..%2f`, or other encoded variations, and Iris doesn't properly normalize or sanitize this input, it can navigate up the directory structure, potentially accessing sensitive files outside the intended `root`.

**Example Scenario (Vulnerable Configuration):**

```go
package main

import "github.com/kataras/iris/v12"

func main() {
	app := iris.New()

	// Vulnerable configuration - serving from the application root
	app.HandleDir("/static", "./")

	app.Listen(":8080")
}
```

In this case, if an attacker sends a request like `GET /static/../config/database.ini`, Iris will attempt to access `./../config/database.ini`, which resolves to the `config/database.ini` file relative to the application's root directory.

**Factors Contributing to the Vulnerability:**

* **Overly Permissive `root` Directory:** Setting the `root` to the application's root directory or a parent directory significantly increases the attack surface.
* **Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization:** If Iris doesn't properly validate or sanitize the incoming file path, it will blindly attempt to access the requested file, even if it contains traversal sequences.
* **Lack of Path Normalization:** Failure to normalize paths (e.g., resolving `//`, redundant `/`, and decoding encoded characters) can leave the application vulnerable to various path traversal techniques.
* **Operating System Differences:** Path traversal behavior can vary slightly between operating systems (e.g., case sensitivity, handling of trailing slashes), which attackers might exploit.

## 3. Detailed Impact Analysis

A successful path traversal attack can have severe consequences:

* **Direct Access to Sensitive Data:**
    * **Configuration Files:** Database credentials, API keys, internal service URLs, etc.
    * **Source Code:** Exposing intellectual property and potentially revealing other vulnerabilities.
    * **Log Files:** Containing sensitive user information, internal system details, and potentially security-related events.
    * **Backup Files:**  May contain snapshots of sensitive data.
    * **Temporary Files:** Could contain intermediate processing data.
* **Potential for Secondary Attacks:**
    * **Remote Code Execution (Indirect):** If an attacker can access and overwrite executable files or scripts, they could potentially gain remote code execution.
    * **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** Accessing files with elevated permissions might reveal information that can be used for privilege escalation.
* **Compliance Violations:** Exposure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or other regulated data can lead to significant fines and legal repercussions (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
* **Loss of Trust and Reputation:** A data breach resulting from path traversal can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.

**Risk Severity Justification:**

The "High" risk severity is justified due to the potential for significant impact (confidentiality breach, system compromise) and the moderate to high likelihood of exploitation, especially if developers are not fully aware of the security implications of `iris.StaticWeb(...)` configuration.

## 4. Analyzing the Affected Iris Component: `iris.StaticWeb(...)`

The `iris.StaticWeb(...)` function is designed to efficiently serve static files. Understanding its parameters is crucial for secure configuration:

* **`requestPath string`:**  The URL path prefix that triggers the static file serving (e.g., `/static`).
* **`root string`:** This is the **critical parameter**. It specifies the **root directory** from which static files will be served. **Misconfiguration of this parameter is the primary cause of this vulnerability.**

**How `iris.StaticWeb(...)` Works (Simplified):**

1. When a request matching the `requestPath` is received, Iris extracts the remaining part of the URL.
2. This remaining part is treated as a relative path to a file within the `root` directory.
3. Iris attempts to locate and serve the file at the constructed path.

**Security Implications of `root`:**

* **Setting `root` to the application's root (`"./"`) or a parent directory is extremely dangerous.** It allows attackers to traverse up the directory structure and access almost any file on the server.
* **The `root` directory should be the most restrictive directory possible, containing only the intended static assets.**

**Iris's Built-in Protections (and their Limitations):**

While Iris likely includes some basic path sanitization or normalization, relying solely on these built-in protections is insufficient. Misconfiguration of the `root` directory can often bypass these safeguards. It's the developer's responsibility to configure `iris.StaticWeb(...)` securely.

## 5. Deep Dive into Mitigation Strategies

Let's analyze the provided mitigation strategies in detail:

* **Carefully configure the root directory for static file serving when using `iris.StaticWeb(...)`.**
    * **Best Practice:** Create a dedicated directory specifically for static assets (e.g., `public`, `static-content`) and set the `root` parameter to this directory.
    * **Example (Secure):**
        ```go
        app.HandleDir("/static", "./public") // Assuming a 'public' directory exists
        ```
    * **Rationale:** This confines the scope of static file serving, preventing access to files outside the designated directory. It adheres to the principle of least privilege.
    * **Verification:** Regularly review the `iris.StaticWeb(...)` configurations in your codebase to ensure they are correctly set.

* **Avoid serving sensitive files from the directory served by `iris.StaticWeb(...)`.**
    * **Best Practice:**  Strictly separate sensitive files from publicly accessible static assets. Store configuration files, logs, and other sensitive data outside the directory served by `iris.StaticWeb(...)`.
    * **Alternative:** If absolutely necessary to serve some dynamic content or restricted files, implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms *before* serving them, not relying on the static file server.
    * **Rationale:** This reduces the potential impact even if a path traversal vulnerability exists due to misconfiguration. It implements a defense-in-depth strategy.
    * **Implementation:**  Carefully plan the directory structure of your application, ensuring a clear separation between static and sensitive files.

* **Ensure that user-provided input is not used to construct file paths for serving static content through `iris.StaticWeb(...)`.**
    * **Best Practice:** Never directly incorporate user input (e.g., from URL parameters, request body) into the file path used by `iris.StaticWeb(...)`. If dynamic file selection is required, use a predefined mapping or a secure identifier that maps to specific files within the allowed static directory.
    * **Example (Vulnerable - Avoid):**
        ```go
        app.Get("/image/{filename}", func(ctx iris.Context) {
            filename := ctx.Params().Get("filename")
            ctx.ServeFile("./public/" + filename) // Highly vulnerable!
        })
        ```
    * **Example (More Secure):**
        ```go
        var allowedImages = map[string]string{
            "logo": "logo.png",
            "banner": "banner.jpg",
        }

        app.Get("/image/{imageID}", func(ctx iris.Context) {
            imageID := ctx.Params().Get("imageID")
            if filename, ok := allowedImages[imageID]; ok {
                ctx.ServeFile("./public/" + filename)
            } else {
                ctx.NotFound()
            }
        })
        ```
    * **Rationale:** This prevents attackers from directly controlling the file path and injecting traversal sequences. It enforces secure coding practices.
    * **Code Review Focus:** Pay close attention to any code that constructs file paths based on user input, especially in the context of static file serving.

## 6. Detection and Prevention Strategies

Beyond the core mitigation strategies, consider these additional measures:

* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools to analyze the codebase for potential misconfigurations in `iris.StaticWeb(...)` and other path traversal vulnerabilities. These tools can identify instances where the `root` parameter is set to a potentially dangerous location.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools to simulate attacks, including path traversal attempts, against the running application. These tools can send requests with various path traversal payloads to identify exploitable vulnerabilities.
* **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on the configuration of `iris.StaticWeb(...)` and any code that handles file paths. Ensure that developers understand the security implications.
* **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Engage security professionals to perform regular audits and penetration tests to identify potential vulnerabilities, including path traversal issues.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to detect and block malicious requests, including those containing path traversal sequences. Configure the WAF with rules to identify common attack patterns (e.g., `../`, encoded characters).
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not directly preventing path traversal, a strong CSP can mitigate the impact of a successful attack by restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources.
* **Regular Updates:** Keep the Iris framework and all dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches and bug fixes that may address path traversal or related vulnerabilities.
* **Principle of Least Privilege (Operating System Level):** Ensure that the user account running the Iris application has the minimum necessary permissions to access the required files and directories. This can limit the scope of damage if a path traversal vulnerability is exploited.

## 7. Conclusion

Path Traversal via Static File Serving Misconfiguration is a critical threat that can have significant consequences for applications using the Iris framework. A thorough understanding of the vulnerability, the affected component (`iris.StaticWeb(...)`), and the available mitigation strategies is essential for building secure applications.

By adhering to the best practices outlined above, including careful configuration of the `root` directory, avoiding serving sensitive files from the static directory, and preventing the use of user-provided input in file paths, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability. Combining these preventive measures with proactive detection strategies like SAST, DAST, and regular security audits provides a robust defense against path traversal attacks.
