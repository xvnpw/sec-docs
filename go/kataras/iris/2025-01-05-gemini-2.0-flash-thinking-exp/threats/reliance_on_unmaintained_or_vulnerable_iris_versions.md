        * **SQL Injection vulnerabilities:** If Iris has a vulnerability related to database interactions, attackers could manipulate SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities:**  In severe cases, vulnerabilities in the framework itself could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting our application.
        * **Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerabilities:**  Attackers could exploit weaknesses to overwhelm our application with requests, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
        * **Authentication/Authorization bypasses:**  Vulnerabilities might allow attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms or gain access to resources they shouldn't have.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:** While less direct, attackers could target vulnerabilities in outdated Iris versions as a stepping stone to compromise other parts of our infrastructure or connected systems.

* **Impact Assessment (Expanding on the provided Impact):**  The exploitation of vulnerabilities in outdated Iris versions can have severe consequences:
    * **Data Breaches:**  Loss or theft of sensitive user data, confidential business information, or proprietary algorithms. This can lead to financial losses, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.
    * **Service Disruption:**  Successful attacks could lead to the application becoming unavailable, impacting business operations and user experience.
    * **Reputational Damage:**  A security breach can severely damage the trust of our users and stakeholders, leading to loss of customers and negative publicity.
    * **Financial Losses:**  Costs associated with incident response, data recovery, legal fees, regulatory fines, and loss of business.
    * **Compliance Violations:**  Depending on the industry and regulations, a security breach resulting from known vulnerabilities could lead to significant penalties.
    * **Compromise of Underlying Infrastructure:** In the worst-case scenario, RCE vulnerabilities could allow attackers to gain control of the server hosting our application, potentially affecting other services and data.

* **Affected Iris Components (Expanding on the provided Component):** While the entire framework codebase is theoretically affected, certain areas are more likely to harbor exploitable vulnerabilities:
    * **Routing and Request Handling:**  Vulnerabilities in how Iris handles incoming requests could lead to bypasses or unexpected behavior.
    * **Middleware and Handlers:**  Flaws in built-in or custom middleware could be exploited to intercept or manipulate requests.
    * **Template Engine:**  Vulnerabilities in the template engine could lead to XSS attacks.
    * **Session Management:**  Weaknesses in session handling could allow attackers to hijack user sessions.
    * **File Upload Handling:**  Improperly handled file uploads could introduce vulnerabilities like path traversal or remote code execution.
    * **Database Integration:**  If Iris components directly interact with the database without proper sanitization, SQL injection vulnerabilities could arise.

**Mitigation Strategies (Detailed Explanation and Expansion):**

* **Keep the Iris framework updated to the latest stable version:**
    * **Establish a Regular Update Cadence:**  Implement a process for regularly checking for and applying Iris updates. This should be part of the standard development workflow.
    * **Prioritize Security Patches:**  Treat security updates with high priority and apply them as soon as possible after thorough testing in a non-production environment.
    * **Implement a Staging Environment:**  Test updates in a staging environment that mirrors the production environment to identify potential compatibility issues before deploying to production.
    * **Automate Dependency Updates (with caution):**  Consider using tools that can automate dependency updates, but ensure proper review and testing processes are in place to prevent unintended consequences.

* **Regularly review security advisories and patch notes for Iris releases:**
    * **Subscribe to Iris Mailing Lists/Notifications:**  Stay informed about security announcements and updates from the Iris maintainers.
    * **Monitor Security News and Vulnerability Databases:**  Keep track of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities that might affect Iris.
    * **Establish a Process for Reviewing Advisories:**  Assign responsibility for reviewing security advisories and assessing their impact on our application.

* **Use Go's dependency management tools to track and update the Iris dependency:**
