# Attack Tree Analysis for kataras/iris

Objective: Gain unauthorized access or cause harm to the application by exploiting vulnerabilities introduced by the Iris web framework itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
Compromise Application via Iris Weakness
├── **HIGH-RISK PATH:** AND Exploit Iris Routing Vulnerabilities
│   ├── **CRITICAL NODE:** OR Route Parameter Injection
│   │   └── Leverage insufficient sanitization of route parameters to inject malicious code or access unintended resources.

│   │   │   └── Inject newline characters into response headers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and potentially control subsequent requests.
│   ├── **CRITICAL NODE:** OR File Upload Vulnerabilities (Iris Specifics)
│   │   └── Exploit weaknesses in Iris's file upload handling, such as lack of filename sanitization or insufficient checks on file content type, leading to remote code execution or other attacks.
├── **HIGH-RISK PATH:** AND Exploit Iris Session Management Vulnerabilities
│   ├── **CRITICAL NODE:** OR Session Fixation
│   │   └── Force a known session ID onto a user, potentially allowing the attacker to hijack their session.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Iris Routing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_iris_routing_vulnerabilities.md)

├── **CRITICAL NODE:** OR Route Parameter Injection
│   └── Leverage insufficient sanitization of route parameters to inject malicious code or access unintended resources.

* **CRITICAL NODE: Route Parameter Injection:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Iris allows defining routes with parameters. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate these parameters, an attacker can inject malicious code (e.g., for Server-Side Request Forgery - SSRF) or manipulate the parameter to access unauthorized resources.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Iris Request Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_iris_request_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

├── **CRITICAL NODE:** OR Header Injection
│   ├── **HIGH-RISK PATH:** OR HTTP Response Splitting
│   │   └── Inject newline characters into response headers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and potentially control subsequent requests.
├── **CRITICAL NODE:** OR File Upload Vulnerabilities (Iris Specifics)
│   │   └── Exploit weaknesses in Iris's file upload handling, such as lack of filename sanitization or insufficient checks on file content type, leading to remote code execution or other attacks.

* **CRITICAL NODE: Header Injection:**
    * **HIGH-RISK PATH: HTTP Response Splitting:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Injecting newline characters into response headers can allow the attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and potentially control subsequent requests (e.g., setting cookies, redirecting users).
        * **Likelihood:** Medium
        * **Impact:** High
        * **Effort:** Low to Medium
        * **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **CRITICAL NODE: File Upload Vulnerabilities (Iris Specifics):**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the application uses Iris's file upload features, vulnerabilities might exist in how Iris handles filenames, content types, or storage. This could lead to remote code execution by uploading malicious files.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on application implementation)
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Medium
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Iris Session Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_iris_session_management_vulnerabilities.md)

├── **CRITICAL NODE:** OR Session Fixation
│   │   └── Force a known session ID onto a user, potentially allowing the attacker to hijack their session.
├── **CRITICAL NODE:** OR Insecure Session Storage (Iris Defaults)
│   │   └── Exploit vulnerabilities in Iris's default session storage mechanism if it's not secure (e.g., predictable session IDs, insecure storage).

* **CRITICAL NODE: Session Fixation:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers might try to force a known session ID onto a user, potentially allowing them to hijack the user's session.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on session handling implementation)
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **CRITICAL NODE: Insecure Session Storage (Iris Defaults):**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the application relies on Iris's default session storage mechanism and it's not secure (e.g., predictable session IDs, insecure storage), attackers might be able to compromise sessions.
    * **Likelihood:** Low (if default is used insecurely)
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Medium
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
