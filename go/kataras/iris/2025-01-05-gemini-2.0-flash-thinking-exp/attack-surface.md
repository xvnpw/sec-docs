# Attack Surface Analysis for kataras/iris

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_path_traversal.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate route parameters intended for file paths to access files or directories outside the intended scope on the server's filesystem.

**How Iris Contributes:** Iris's dynamic routing allows defining routes with parameters that can be used to construct file paths. If these parameters are not properly sanitized and validated *within the Iris handler*, they can be exploited for path traversal.

**Example:** A route defined as `/files/{filepath}`. An attacker could send a request like `/files/../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to access the server's password file.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential code execution if accessible files are scripts.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Validation and Sanitization within Iris Handlers:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all route parameters used for file paths *within the Iris route handler*. Use whitelisting of allowed characters and patterns.
* **Path Canonicalization:**  Resolve symbolic links and normalize paths *within the Iris handler* to prevent traversal using techniques like `..`.
* **Restricting File Access:** Ensure the application's user has the least necessary privileges to access files. Avoid constructing file paths directly from user input *within the Iris handler*.

## Attack Surface: [Route Overlapping and Confusion](./attack_surfaces/route_overlapping_and_confusion.md)

**Description:** Ambiguous or overlapping route definitions lead to the framework matching requests to unintended handlers, potentially bypassing security checks or exposing sensitive functionality.

**How Iris Contributes:** Iris's flexible routing mechanism itself can lead to this if route patterns are not carefully designed and can overlap, causing the router to match requests in unexpected ways.

**Example:** Defining both `/admin` and `/admin/{action}`. A request to `/admin/settings` might be incorrectly routed or handled depending on the order and specifics of the Iris route handlers.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to administrative functions, unexpected application behavior, potential security bypasses.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Careful Route Design in Iris:**  Design routes with clear and distinct patterns within the Iris application, avoiding overlaps.
* **Explicit Route Definitions:**  Prefer more specific route definitions over overly broad wildcards where possible when defining Iris routes.
* **Route Testing:**  Thoroughly test all defined Iris routes to ensure requests are handled as expected and no unintended matches occur.
* **Review Route Order:** Understand how Iris prioritizes routes and ensure the order of definition aligns with the intended behavior within the Iris application.

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Request Body Processing](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_request_body_processing.md)

**Description:**  The application processes request bodies (e.g., JSON, form data) without proper validation, leading to potential vulnerabilities like injection attacks or denial-of-service.

**How Iris Contributes:** Iris provides methods to easily access and parse request body data. If developers don't implement sufficient validation on this data *within their Iris handlers*, it becomes an attack vector.

**Example:** An API endpoint expects a JSON payload with a `name` field. An attacker could send a very large string in the `name` field to cause memory exhaustion or other issues *within the Iris application*.

**Impact:** Denial-of-service, application crashes, potential for data manipulation or injection attacks if the data is used in further processing *by the Iris application*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Validation within Iris Handlers:**  Implement robust validation for all data received in the request body *within Iris route handlers*, including type checking, length limits, and format validation.
* **Data Sanitization within Iris Handlers:** Sanitize input data to remove or escape potentially harmful characters before processing *within Iris handlers*.
* **Request Size Limits:** Configure Iris to enforce limits on the maximum size of request bodies to prevent resource exhaustion.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Session Management Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_session_management_configuration.md)

**Description:**  Default or misconfigured session management settings expose session data to unauthorized access or make sessions vulnerable to hijacking.

**How Iris Contributes:** Iris provides built-in session management. If developers don't explicitly configure secure settings *using Iris's session configuration options*, the defaults might be less secure.

**Example:** Session cookies are not marked as `HttpOnly` or `Secure` *due to default or incorrect Iris session configuration*, allowing client-side scripts to access them or transmitting them over insecure connections.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Configure Secure Session Cookies in Iris:**  Explicitly set the `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` flags for session cookies *using Iris's session configuration*.
* **Use Strong Session IDs:** Ensure Iris is configured to generate cryptographically secure and unpredictable session IDs *through its session management*.
* **Session Regeneration:** Regenerate session IDs after successful login *using Iris's session management features* to prevent session fixation attacks.
* **Secure Session Storage:** Choose a secure backend for session storage and ensure it is properly configured *in conjunction with Iris's session management*.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_uploads.md)

**Description:**  The application allows users to upload files without proper restrictions on file types, sizes, or content, potentially leading to malicious file uploads.

**How Iris Contributes:** Iris provides easy ways to handle file uploads. Lack of proper validation and configuration *within the Iris file upload handling logic* creates this attack surface.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image *through an Iris file upload handler*. If the application doesn't properly validate the file content and stores it in a publicly accessible location, the attacker could execute the script.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial-of-service (through large file uploads), storage exhaustion, defacement.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **File Type Validation in Iris Handlers:**  Validate file types based on content (magic numbers) rather than just the file extension *within the Iris file upload handler*. Use a whitelist of allowed file types.
* **File Size Limits in Iris:**  Enforce strict limits on the maximum size of uploaded files *within the Iris file upload handling*.
* **Secure File Storage:** Store uploaded files outside the web root or in locations with restricted access.
* **Filename Sanitization in Iris:** Sanitize uploaded filenames *within the Iris handler* to prevent path traversal or other injection attacks.
* **Content Scanning:**  Consider using antivirus or malware scanning tools on uploaded files.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (if using templates)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__if_using_templates_.md)

**Description:**  User-controlled data is directly embedded into server-side templates without proper escaping, allowing attackers to inject malicious code that gets executed on the server.

**How Iris Contributes:** If Iris's built-in template engine or an integrated template engine is used and user input is not properly handled *before being passed to the Iris template rendering functions*, it can lead to SSTI.

**Example:** A template renders a user's name, taken directly from a request parameter *and passed to the Iris template engine without escaping*. An attacker could input malicious template code as their name, which would then be executed by the template engine.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Context-Aware Output Encoding in Iris Templates:**  Always encode user-provided data based on the context in which it's being used within the template (e.g., HTML escaping, JavaScript escaping) *before passing it to the Iris template engine*.
* **Avoid Raw String Interpolation in Iris Templates:**  Minimize or avoid directly embedding raw user input into templates *when using Iris's template rendering*.
* **Use a Secure Templating Engine:** Ensure the chosen template engine (if not Iris's built-in) has built-in protections against SSTI.
* **Template Sandboxing (if available):** Utilize any sandboxing features provided by the template engine to restrict the capabilities of template code.
