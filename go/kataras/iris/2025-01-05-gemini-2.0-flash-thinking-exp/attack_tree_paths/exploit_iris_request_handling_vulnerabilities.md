**CRITICAL NODE: OR Header Injection**

This node represents a fundamental weakness where an attacker can inject arbitrary data into HTTP headers. This manipulation can have significant security implications.

**HIGH-RISK PATH: OR HTTP Response Splitting**

This is a specific type of header injection where the attacker injects newline characters (`\r\n`) into response headers. This allows them to effectively terminate the current HTTP response and start crafting a new, malicious response.

**Analysis:**

* **Attack Vector:** The core of this attack lies in the application's failure to properly sanitize or encode data that is used to construct HTTP response headers. When user-controlled input is directly incorporated into headers without proper validation, attackers can inject `\r\n` sequences. This sequence signals the end of a header and the beginning of a new one, or even the start of the response body.

* **Iris Specifics:** While Iris provides functions for setting headers, developers might inadvertently use string concatenation or other methods that bypass built-in sanitization if not careful. Specifically, if developers are manually constructing header strings instead of using Iris's `Ctx.Header()` or similar methods with proper escaping, they become vulnerable.

* **Exploitation Techniques:**
    * **Setting Malicious Cookies:** Injecting `Set-Cookie` headers allows the attacker to set arbitrary cookies in the user's browser. This can be used for session hijacking, account takeover, or tracking user behavior.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting headers like `Content-Type: text/html`, the attacker can then inject HTML and JavaScript code into the response body that the browser will execute in the context of the vulnerable website.
    * **Redirection Attacks:** Injecting `Location` headers can redirect users to malicious websites, potentially for phishing or malware distribution.
    * **Cache Poisoning:** By injecting headers that control caching behavior, attackers can potentially poison the caches of intermediary proxies or the user's browser, serving malicious content to other users.

* **Likelihood:** Medium. While modern frameworks often have built-in protections, developer errors in handling user input or constructing headers can still introduce this vulnerability.

* **Impact:** High. The ability to control the browser's behavior and inject arbitrary content can have devastating consequences, including data theft, account compromise, and malware distribution.

* **Effort:** Low to Medium. Exploiting this vulnerability often involves crafting specific URLs or manipulating request parameters, which doesn't require highly specialized skills.

* **Skill Level:** Low to Medium. Understanding basic HTTP concepts and how to manipulate requests is sufficient to attempt this attack.

* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Identifying this vulnerability requires careful code review and dynamic testing, specifically looking for instances where user input influences response headers. Automated scanners might flag potential issues, but manual verification is often necessary.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before using it in HTTP headers. Implement whitelisting of allowed characters and reject any input containing newline characters (`\r`, `\n`).
* **Use Secure Header Setting Functions:** Rely on Iris's built-in functions for setting headers (`Ctx.Header()`, `Ctx.SetCookie()`, etc.). These functions often provide built-in escaping and prevent direct injection of newline characters.
* **Output Encoding:**  Encode header values before setting them to prevent interpretation of special characters. While less common for headers than HTML body, encoding can add an extra layer of defense.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implementing a strong CSP can mitigate the impact of XSS attacks even if response splitting is successful.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential header injection vulnerabilities.

**CRITICAL NODE: OR File Upload Vulnerabilities (Iris Specifics)**

This node focuses on vulnerabilities specific to how an Iris application handles file uploads. Improper implementation can create significant security risks.

**Analysis:**

* **Attack Vector:** This category encompasses various weaknesses in the file upload process, including:
    * **Filename Sanitization Issues:** Lack of proper sanitization of uploaded filenames can allow attackers to upload files with malicious names, potentially overwriting critical system files or exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities.
    * **Insufficient Content-Type Validation:** Relying solely on the client-provided `Content-Type` header is insecure. Attackers can easily manipulate this header. Proper validation should involve inspecting the file's magic number or using other server-side methods to determine the true file type.
    * **Lack of File Content Scanning:**  Failing to scan uploaded files for malware or malicious scripts can lead to remote code execution if the uploaded file is later accessed or executed by the server.
    * **Insecure Storage Location and Permissions:** Storing uploaded files in publicly accessible directories or with overly permissive permissions can allow unauthorized access and manipulation.
    * **Bypass of File Size Limits:**  Vulnerabilities might exist that allow attackers to bypass configured file size limits, potentially leading to denial-of-service attacks.

* **Iris Specifics:**  Understanding how Iris handles file uploads is crucial. Key areas to investigate include:
    * **Iris's `Context.FormFile()` function:** How does this function handle filename extraction and validation? Are there any built-in sanitization mechanisms?
    * **Configuration options for file uploads:** Does Iris offer configuration options related to file size limits, allowed file types, or storage locations?
    * **Middleware for file upload handling:** Are there any recommended or commonly used middleware packages within the Iris ecosystem for secure file upload management?
    * **Example code and best practices in the Iris documentation:** Examining the official documentation and community examples can reveal potential pitfalls and recommended secure practices.

* **Exploitation Techniques:**
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Uploading malicious scripts (e.g., PHP, Python) and then accessing them through the web server can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Path Traversal:**  Crafting filenames with ".." sequences can allow attackers to upload files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Uploading HTML or SVG files containing malicious JavaScript can lead to stored XSS attacks when these files are accessed by other users.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Uploading excessively large files can consume server resources and lead to denial of service.
    * **Data Exfiltration or Manipulation:**  Uploading files to overwrite existing sensitive data or exfiltrating data by uploading it to a controlled location.

* **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on application implementation). If the application implements file uploads without careful consideration for security, the likelihood increases significantly.

* **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation can lead to complete server compromise, data breaches, and other severe consequences.

* **Effort:** Medium. Exploiting file upload vulnerabilities often requires some understanding of server-side technologies and how to craft malicious files.

* **Skill Level:** Medium. Attackers need to understand file types, server-side scripting, and common file upload vulnerabilities.

* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard. Detecting these vulnerabilities requires a combination of static analysis of the code handling file uploads, dynamic testing with various malicious files, and potentially runtime monitoring for suspicious file access or execution.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Strict Filename Sanitization:**  Implement robust filename sanitization. Avoid relying on blacklists and instead use whitelists of allowed characters. Consider renaming uploaded files to unique, randomly generated names.
* **Content-Type Validation:**  Perform server-side content-type validation using techniques like checking the file's magic number (the first few bytes of the file) instead of solely relying on the `Content-Type` header.
* **File Content Scanning:** Integrate with antivirus or malware scanning tools to scan uploaded files for malicious content before storing them.
* **Secure Storage Location and Permissions:** Store uploaded files in a dedicated directory outside the webroot and with restricted permissions. Ensure the web server has only the necessary permissions to access these files.
* **Implement File Size Limits:** Enforce strict file size limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
* **Input Validation for Other File Metadata:** Validate other metadata associated with the file upload, such as file size and MIME type, provided by the client.
* **Consider using a dedicated file storage service:** For sensitive applications, consider using a dedicated cloud-based file storage service that offers built-in security features.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Specifically test the file upload functionality for potential vulnerabilities.
