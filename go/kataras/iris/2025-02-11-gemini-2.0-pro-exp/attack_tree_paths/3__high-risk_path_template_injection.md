# Deep Analysis of Template Injection Attack Path in Iris Web Framework

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Template Injection" attack path within an Iris web application, identify specific vulnerabilities, assess their exploitability, and propose robust mitigation strategies.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to enhance the application's security posture against this specific threat.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following attack path:

**[4. View Engine] -> [4.1] Template Injection**

This includes:

*   **Iris-supported View Engines:**  We will consider the common view engines supported by Iris, such as Pug (formerly Jade), Handlebars, Amber, Ace, and the standard Go `html/template` package.  The analysis will consider the specific escaping mechanisms and potential vulnerabilities of each.
*   **Template Variable Handling:**  We will examine how Iris handles user-supplied data that is passed to template variables.  This includes identifying potential injection points where user input is not properly sanitized.
*   **Exploitation Scenarios:** We will explore realistic scenarios where an attacker could exploit a template injection vulnerability to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) or other malicious outcomes.
*   **Mitigation Techniques:** We will evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation techniques, including built-in escaping, input validation, Content Security Policy (CSP), and secure coding practices.
*   **Iris-Specific Considerations:** We will analyze any Iris-specific features or configurations that might influence the vulnerability or mitigation of template injection attacks.

This analysis *excludes* other attack vectors within the broader attack tree, such as SQL injection, XSS (except where it directly relates to template injection), or denial-of-service attacks.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow a structured approach:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the Iris framework's source code (from the provided GitHub repository: [https://github.com/kataras/iris](https://github.com/kataras/iris)) related to view engine integration and template rendering.  This will help us understand the underlying mechanisms and identify potential weaknesses.
2.  **Vulnerability Research:** We will research known vulnerabilities and exploits related to template injection in the specific view engines supported by Iris.  This includes consulting vulnerability databases (CVE), security advisories, and blog posts.
3.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Development (Ethical Hacking):**  We will attempt to develop *ethical* PoC exploits to demonstrate the feasibility of template injection attacks in a controlled environment.  This will help us assess the real-world impact and exploitability of potential vulnerabilities.  *This will be done in a sandboxed environment and will not target any production systems.*
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:** We will evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation techniques, considering their implementation complexity and potential impact on application performance.
5.  **Documentation and Reporting:**  We will document our findings, including vulnerability details, PoC examples (if applicable), and recommended mitigation strategies, in a clear and concise report.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path: Template Injection

### 2.1 Understanding Template Injection

Template injection occurs when an attacker can control the content of a template that is rendered by the server.  Unlike Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which primarily affects the client-side, template injection targets the server-side rendering process.  This often leads to more severe consequences, including Remote Code Execution (RCE).

The core issue is the failure to properly distinguish between *code* (the template logic) and *data* (the user-supplied input).  When user input is treated as part of the template code, it can be interpreted and executed by the view engine.

### 2.2 Iris View Engine Integration

Iris provides a flexible view engine system.  Key components to analyze:

*   **`iris.Application.RegisterView(...)`:** This function registers a view engine with the Iris application.  It's crucial to understand how Iris handles different view engine configurations and their default security settings.
*   **`ctx.View(...)`:** This function renders a template.  We need to examine how data is passed to the view engine and whether any automatic escaping is performed.
*   **`ctx.ViewData(...)`:** This function adds data to the context that will be passed to the template.  This is a primary area of concern for potential injection points.

### 2.3 Vulnerability Analysis (per View Engine)

We'll analyze common Iris-supported view engines:

#### 2.3.1 Go `html/template`

*   **Escaping:** Go's `html/template` package provides *context-aware automatic escaping*.  This is a strong defense against template injection.  It understands the context (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, URL) and applies the appropriate escaping rules.
*   **Vulnerabilities:** While `html/template` is generally secure, vulnerabilities can arise if:
    *   **`template.HTML`, `template.JS`, `template.CSS`, `template.URL` types are misused:** These types bypass automatic escaping.  They should *only* be used with trusted data.  If user input is directly used to construct these types, it creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Custom template functions are insecure:** If custom functions are defined and used within templates, they must be carefully reviewed to ensure they don't introduce injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Delimiters are changed:** While unlikely, if the default delimiters (`{{` and `}}`) are changed, it could potentially interact poorly with other parts of the system.
*   **Example (Vulnerable):**

    ```go
    package main

    import (
    	"html/template"
    	"net/http"

    	"github.com/kataras/iris/v12"
    )

    func main() {
    	app := iris.New()
    	app.RegisterView(iris.HTML("./views", ".html"))

    	app.Get("/", func(ctx iris.Context) {
    		userInput := ctx.URLParam("name") // UNSAFE: Direct user input
    		// Vulnerable: Bypassing escaping with template.HTML
    		ctx.ViewData("name", template.HTML(userInput))
    		ctx.View("index.html")
    	})

    	app.Listen(":8080")
    }
    ```

    `index.html`:

    ```html
    <h1>Hello, {{ .name }}!</h1>
    ```

    If a user provides `?name=<script>alert('XSS')</script>` as input, the `template.HTML` will bypass escaping, leading to XSS (and potentially more severe consequences if the template engine allows it).

*   **Example (Safe):**

    ```go
    // ... (same imports as above)

    app.Get("/", func(ctx iris.Context) {
        userInput := ctx.URLParam("name")
        ctx.ViewData("name", userInput) // SAFE: Automatic escaping
        ctx.View("index.html")
    })
    ```
    Here, `userInput` is passed directly. `html/template` will automatically escape it.

#### 2.3.2 Pug (formerly Jade)

*   **Escaping:** Pug provides automatic escaping by default.  Unescaped output is achieved using `!=` instead of `=`.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Using `!=` with user input:** This is the primary vulnerability.  If user-supplied data is rendered using `!=`, it bypasses escaping.
    *   **Complex expressions:**  While Pug's syntax is generally safe, complex expressions or custom filters might introduce vulnerabilities if not carefully reviewed.
*   **Example (Vulnerable):**

    ```pug
    //- views/index.pug
    h1 Hello, !{name}
    ```
    ```go
    // ... (Iris setup)
    app.Get("/", func(ctx iris.Context) {
        userInput := ctx.URLParam("name")
        ctx.ViewData("name", userInput) // Data is passed
        ctx.View("index.pug")
    })
    ```
    If `name` is `"<script>alert(1)</script>"`, it will be rendered unescaped.

*   **Example (Safe):**

    ```pug
    //- views/index.pug
    h1 Hello, #{name}
    ```
    Using `#{}` ensures escaping.

#### 2.3.3 Handlebars

*   **Escaping:** Handlebars escapes values returned by `{{expression}}` by default.  Unescaped output is achieved using `{{{expression}}}`.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Using `{{{expression}}}` with user input:** This bypasses escaping and creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Helper functions:** Custom helper functions must be carefully reviewed to ensure they don't introduce injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Example (Vulnerable):**
    ```handlebars
    <h1>Hello, {{{name}}}!</h1>
    ```
    ```go
    // ... (Iris setup)
    app.Get("/", func(ctx iris.Context) {
        userInput := ctx.URLParam("name")
        ctx.ViewData("name", userInput)
        ctx.View("index.hbs")
    })
    ```
    If `name` is malicious code, it will be executed.

*   **Example (Safe):**
    ```handlebars
    <h1>Hello, {{name}}!</h1>
    ```
    Using `{{}}` ensures escaping.

#### 2.3.4 Other View Engines (Amber, Ace)

Similar principles apply to other view engines.  The key is to identify:

1.  **The default escaping behavior.**
2.  **The syntax for bypassing escaping.**
3.  **Any potential vulnerabilities in custom functions or filters.**

### 2.4 Exploitation Scenarios (RCE)

The severity of template injection often depends on the capabilities of the view engine.  Some template engines are designed to be purely presentational, while others allow more powerful operations.

*   **Go `html/template` (Limited RCE):**  While `html/template` is primarily focused on safe HTML rendering, it's possible to achieve limited code execution through carefully crafted injections, especially if custom functions are involved.  However, direct access to system commands is generally not possible.
*   **Pug/Handlebars (Potential RCE):**  These engines, and others like them, often have features that allow for more complex logic within templates.  If an attacker can inject code that calls helper functions or uses built-in features to execute arbitrary code, RCE is possible.  For example, if a helper function exists that allows file system access or shell command execution, an attacker could leverage this.

**Example (Hypothetical RCE with Handlebars):**

Let's assume a hypothetical (and insecure) Handlebars helper function called `exec` exists:

```javascript
// Insecure helper (DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION)
Handlebars.registerHelper('exec', function(command) {
  // This is extremely dangerous and should never be implemented like this.
  return require('child_process').execSync(command).toString();
});
```

If an attacker can inject the following into a template:

```handlebars
{{{exec 'ls -la /'}}}
```

This could lead to the execution of the `ls -la /` command on the server, revealing the contents of the root directory.  A more malicious attacker could use this to execute arbitrary commands.

### 2.5 Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Use Built-in Escaping:**  This is the *primary* defense.  Always use the view engine's default escaping mechanisms (e.g., `{{}}` in Handlebars, `#{}` in Pug, and the automatic escaping in Go's `html/template`).  Avoid using unescaped output (e.g., `{{{}}}` in Handlebars, `!=` in Pug, or `template.HTML` in Go) with user-supplied data.

2.  **Input Validation:**  While escaping is crucial, input validation adds another layer of defense.  Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and constraints.  For example, if a field is expected to be a number, validate that it is indeed a number before passing it to the template.

3.  **Avoid Passing Raw User Input:**  Instead of directly passing raw user input to templates, process and sanitize it first.  Create a safe, intermediate representation of the data that is then passed to the template.

4.  **Keep View Engines Updated:**  Regularly update the view engine to the latest version to patch any known vulnerabilities.

5.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  CSP can mitigate the impact of template injection, even if a vulnerability exists.  By restricting the resources that the browser can load, CSP can prevent the execution of injected scripts.  A strict CSP can significantly reduce the risk of XSS resulting from template injection.  However, CSP is less effective against RCE that occurs entirely on the server-side.

6.  **Secure Coding Practices:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do if they achieve RCE.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Regularly review code, especially template files and any code that handles user input, to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits:**  Conduct periodic security audits to identify and address potential weaknesses.

7.  **Iris-Specific Recommendations:**
    *   **Review Iris Documentation:**  Thoroughly review the Iris documentation on view engines and template rendering to understand best practices and security recommendations.
    *   **Use `ctx.ViewData` Carefully:**  Be mindful of the data passed to `ctx.ViewData`.  Ensure that all data is properly sanitized before being passed to the template.
    *   **Consider a Whitelist Approach:** If possible, use a whitelist approach for template variables.  Define a set of allowed variables and reject any input that attempts to use variables outside of this whitelist.

### 2.6 Detection

*   **Server Logs:** Monitor server logs for unusual activity, such as unexpected errors or suspicious output.
*   **Output Monitoring:**  Monitor the rendered output of the application for unexpected content.
*   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  Use an IDS to detect and alert on potential template injection attacks.
*   **Static Analysis Tools:** Use static analysis tools to scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Use DAST tools to test application and find vulnerabilities.

## 3. Conclusion

Template injection is a serious vulnerability that can lead to RCE in web applications.  By understanding the attack vectors, implementing robust mitigation strategies, and regularly monitoring the application, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of template injection attacks in their Iris-based application.  The most important defense is to consistently use the view engine's built-in escaping mechanisms and to avoid passing raw, unsanitized user input to templates.  A combination of secure coding practices, input validation, and CSP can provide a strong defense-in-depth approach.
