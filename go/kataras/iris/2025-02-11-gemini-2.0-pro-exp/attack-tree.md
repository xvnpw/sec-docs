## Attack Tree Path: [1. High-Risk Path: Dependency Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/1__high-risk_path_dependency_exploitation.md)

*   **[5. Dependency Issues] -> [5.1] Outdated Deps.:**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of libraries that Iris depends on, or outdated versions of Iris itself.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Varies (but often High, potentially leading to RCE or data breaches)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Exploiting known vulnerabilities is often easy with publicly available tools)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice (Often requires using publicly available exploit code)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Vulnerability scanners can identify outdated dependencies)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Regularly update Iris and all its dependencies to the latest versions.
        *   Use a dependency management tool (e.g., `go mod`) to track dependencies and their versions.
        *   Employ a vulnerability scanner to automatically identify outdated dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. High-Risk Path: Middleware Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/2__high-risk_path_middleware_bypass.md)

*   **[2. Middleware Flaws] -> [2.1] Bypass AuthZ:**
    *   **Description:** Circumventing authentication or authorization checks implemented in Iris middleware (either custom middleware or Iris's built-in middleware).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Allows unauthorized access to protected resources, potentially with elevated privileges)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding a flaw in the middleware logic or configuration)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by monitoring authentication and authorization logs, but bypasses might be subtle)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test all middleware, especially custom middleware, for logic flaws and bypass vulnerabilities.
        *   Ensure middleware is applied in the correct order and that there are no gaps in coverage.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within middleware.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. High-Risk Path: Template Injection](./attack_tree_paths/3__high-risk_path_template_injection.md)

*   **[4. View Engine] -> [4.1] Template Injection:**
    *   **Description:** Injecting malicious code into template variables, leading to code execution within the context of the view engine (e.g., Pug, Handlebars).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding a vulnerable template and crafting the appropriate injection payload)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by monitoring server logs and output, but sophisticated injections might be obfuscated)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use the view engine's built-in escaping mechanisms to automatically sanitize user input before rendering it in templates.
        *   Avoid passing raw user input directly to templates.
        *   Keep the view engine updated to the latest version to patch any known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of template injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Nodes Approaching Critical Status (Detailed Breakdown): [1.2] Route Hijacking](./attack_tree_paths/nodes_approaching_critical_status__detailed_breakdown___1_2__route_hijacking.md)

*   **[1.2] Route Hijacking:**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker is able to redefine or override existing routes, potentially redirecting legitimate traffic.
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Monitor Iris's security advisories.
        *   Ensure the framework is up-to-date.
        *   Review route registration code.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Nodes Approaching Critical Status (Detailed Breakdown): [3.1] Session Fixation](./attack_tree_paths/nodes_approaching_critical_status__detailed_breakdown___3_1__session_fixation.md)

*   **[3.1] Session Fixation:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker sets a known session ID for a victim, then waits for the victim to log in.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Regenerate session IDs after authentication.
        *   Use HTTPS.
        *   Set `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on cookies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Nodes Approaching Critical Status (Detailed Breakdown): [3.2] Session Hijacking](./attack_tree_paths/nodes_approaching_critical_status__detailed_breakdown___3_2__session_hijacking.md)

*   **[3.2] Session Hijacking:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker steals a valid session ID.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (with HTTPS)
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low (without HTTPS), Medium (with HTTPS)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice (without HTTPS), Intermediate (with HTTPS)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use HTTPS.
        *   Set `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on cookies.
        *   Implement session timeouts.
