## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation for `iris.Context` Methods](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation_for__iris_context__methods.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Iris Input Points:**  Pinpoint all locations in your Iris application where you access user-provided data using Iris's `iris.Context` methods such as `Params()`, `PostValue()`, `FormValue()`, `URLParam()`, `Header()`, and `Body()`. These methods are the primary way Iris applications receive and process client requests.
    2.  **Validate After Iris Retrieval:**  Crucially, perform input validation *immediately after* retrieving data using Iris's context methods and *before* using this data in any application logic, database queries, or further processing.  Iris itself does not automatically sanitize or validate input.
    3.  **Utilize Go Validation Libraries:** Integrate Go validation libraries (e.g., `github.com/go-playground/validator/v10`, `github.com/asaskevich/govalidator`) to define and enforce validation rules. These libraries work seamlessly within Iris handlers.
    4.  **Context-Aware Validation Rules:** Design validation rules that are specific to the context of each Iris handler and the expected data format for each input parameter obtained via `iris.Context`.
    5.  **Iris Error Handling for Validation Failures:**  When validation fails, use Iris's context methods to send appropriate HTTP error responses (e.g., `ctx.StatusCode(iris.StatusBadRequest)`) and informative error messages back to the client. Leverage Iris's error handling mechanisms to manage validation failures gracefully.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):**  Mitigates SQL injection by preventing malicious SQL code from being passed through Iris context parameters to database queries.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium to High Severity):** Reduces XSS risks by validating and sanitizing user input obtained through Iris context, preventing injection of malicious scripts.
        *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Prevents command injection by validating input processed by Iris handlers before it's used in system commands.
        *   **Path Traversal (Medium Severity):**  Reduces path traversal vulnerabilities by validating file paths received via Iris context parameters.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Helps prevent DoS attacks caused by malformed input processed by Iris handlers.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **SQL Injection:** High risk reduction. Directly addresses SQL injection vulnerabilities arising from Iris input handling.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Medium to High risk reduction. Significantly reduces XSS risks related to Iris input.
        *   **Command Injection:** High risk reduction. Directly mitigates command injection related to Iris input.
        *   **Path Traversal:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces path traversal risks associated with Iris input.
        *   **Denial of Service:** Medium risk reduction.  Offers some protection against DoS via malformed Iris input.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Implemented in user registration and login forms using basic validation for email format and password complexity within Iris handlers in `userHandler.go`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Missing in API endpoints for updating user profiles (`api/users/{id}` endpoint in `apiHandler.go`), which use Iris context to retrieve parameters.
        *   Not fully implemented for file upload handling in `uploadHandler.go`, which uses `Context.UploadFormFile()`.
        *   Lacks comprehensive sanitization for rich text input fields in `blogHandler.go`, which processes form data via Iris context.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Request Body Size Limits and Streaming for Iris `Context.ReadBody()`](./mitigation_strategies/request_body_size_limits_and_streaming_for_iris__context_readbody___.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Iris Configuration for Body Limits:**  Utilize Iris's configuration options, specifically `iris.Configuration{ MaxRequestBodySize: "..." }`, to set a global limit on the maximum allowed request body size for the entire Iris application. This is a direct Iris framework setting.
    2.  **Middleware for Iris Context Size Check (Optional):**  Develop custom Iris middleware that intercepts requests *before* they reach Iris handlers and checks the `Content-Length` header against the configured limit. This middleware, integrated into the Iris middleware chain, provides an early rejection point within the Iris request lifecycle.
    3.  **Iris Context Request Body Streaming:**  For Iris handlers dealing with large payloads, leverage `Context.Request().Body` to access the request body as a stream within the Iris context. This avoids loading the entire body into memory, a crucial consideration when using Iris for file uploads or large data processing.
    4.  **Resource Management within Iris Deployment:**  Configure resource limits (memory, CPU) for the Iris application's deployment environment. This complements Iris's body size limits by preventing resource exhaustion at the system level when Iris handles requests.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Prevents DoS attacks targeting Iris applications by exploiting large request bodies that can overwhelm server resources when processed by `Context.ReadBody()` or similar Iris methods.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service:** High risk reduction. Directly mitigates DoS attacks related to large request bodies processed by Iris.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   A basic request body size limit of 5MB is configured in `main.go` using `iris.Configuration{ MaxRequestBodySize: "5MB" }`, demonstrating use of Iris configuration.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Streaming is not implemented for file upload endpoints in `uploadHandler.go`, which currently uses `Context.UploadFormFile()` potentially loading entire files into memory within the Iris context.
        *   No custom Iris middleware for early request size checking is implemented, relying solely on Iris's built-in size limit enforcement when `Context.ReadBody()` is invoked.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Session Configuration within Iris](./mitigation_strategies/secure_session_configuration_within_iris.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Iris Session Configuration Options:**  When configuring Iris's session management, explicitly set the following security-focused options using Iris's session configuration API:
        *   `CookieSecure(true)`:  Ensure session cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS, a direct Iris session setting.
        *   `CookieHTTPOnly(true)`: Prevent client-side JavaScript access to session cookies, configured through Iris session options.
        *   `CookieSameSite(http.SameSiteStrictMode)` or `CookieSameSite(http.SameSiteLaxMode)`:  Mitigate CSRF by controlling cookie behavior in cross-site requests, an Iris session cookie attribute setting.
    2.  **Strong Session Secret for Iris:** Generate a cryptographically strong and unpredictable session secret specifically for your Iris application's session management. This secret is used by Iris for session cookie signing and should be securely managed within the Iris application's environment.
    3.  **Iris Session Regeneration (`session.Renew()`):**  Implement session ID regeneration using Iris's `session.Renew()` method after critical actions like login, logout, or password changes within your Iris handlers. This is a direct Iris session management function.
    4.  **Iris Session Timeout Configuration (`session.Lifetime()`):**  Configure appropriate session expiration times using Iris's `session.Lifetime()` setting. Balance security and user experience by setting timeouts relevant to your Iris application's needs.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Session Hijacking (High Severity):** Reduces session hijacking risks by securing Iris session cookies and implementing session management best practices within the Iris application.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) based Session Theft (High Severity):** `CookieHTTPOnly` in Iris session configuration directly mitigates session theft via XSS.
        *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium Severity):** `CookieSameSite` in Iris session configuration helps prevent CSRF attacks.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Session Hijacking:** High risk reduction. Directly improves session security within the Iris framework.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting based Session Theft:** High risk reduction. Effectively prevents XSS-based session theft in Iris applications.
        *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery:** Medium risk reduction. Enhances CSRF protection for Iris applications.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `CookieSecure(true)` and `CookieHTTPOnly(true)` are enabled in `sessionManager.go` initialization, demonstrating Iris session configuration.
        *   Session secret is loaded from an environment variable `SESSION_SECRET` for Iris session management.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `CookieSameSite` attribute is not explicitly set in Iris session configuration in `sessionManager.go`.
        *   Session regeneration using `session.Renew()` is not implemented in `authHandler.go` after login/password changes within the Iris application.
        *   Session timeout via `session.Lifetime()` might need review and adjustment in `sessionManager.go` for better security within the Iris context.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Error Handling using Iris `app.OnErrorCode()`](./mitigation_strategies/secure_error_handling_using_iris__app_onerrorcode___.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Iris Custom Error Handlers (`app.OnErrorCode()`):**  Utilize Iris's `app.OnErrorCode()` function to define custom error handlers for specific HTTP status codes (e.g., 404, 500) within your Iris application. This is Iris's mechanism for customizing error responses.
    2.  **Generic Iris Error Responses:**  Within Iris error handlers defined by `app.OnErrorCode()`, ensure that production environments return generic, user-friendly error messages. Avoid exposing detailed error information that Iris might generate by default.
    3.  **Iris Logging within Error Handlers:**  Inside your custom Iris error handlers, implement detailed logging of error information using Iris's logger or a dedicated logging system. This logging, triggered by Iris error conditions, is crucial for debugging and security monitoring within the Iris application.
    4.  **Secure Logging for Iris Errors:**  Ensure that logs generated by Iris error handlers are stored securely, protecting them from unauthorized access.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents information leakage through default Iris error pages by using custom handlers via `app.OnErrorCode()` to control error responses.
        *   **Security Misconfiguration (Medium Severity):** Reduces security risks associated with overly verbose default Iris error messages.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium risk reduction. Directly addresses information disclosure through Iris error responses.
        *   **Security Misconfiguration:** Medium risk reduction. Improves security posture by controlling Iris error output.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Custom error handler for 404 errors is implemented in `main.go` using `app.OnErrorCode()` to display a custom "Page Not Found" page within the Iris application.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Custom error handler for 500 errors is missing for Iris applications. Default Iris error page might be displayed, potentially revealing stack traces in production.
        *   Detailed error logging within Iris error handlers to secure files or a centralized system is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Iris Framework Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_iris_framework_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Iris Updates:** Regularly check for new releases and security updates specifically for the Iris web framework on its official GitHub repository or channels.
    2.  **Apply Iris Updates Promptly:** When security updates are released for Iris, prioritize updating your Iris application to the latest version. Follow the official Iris upgrade guides to ensure a smooth and secure update process for your Iris framework.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Iris Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities that are specific to the Iris framework itself.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Iris Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction. Directly mitigates risks associated with known vulnerabilities in the Iris framework.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Manual checks for Iris framework updates are performed occasionally.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Automated checks for Iris framework updates are not integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   No regular schedule for Iris framework updates is in place, updates are performed reactively.
