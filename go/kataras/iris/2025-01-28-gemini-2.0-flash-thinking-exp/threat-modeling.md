# Threat Model Analysis for kataras/iris

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Misconfigured Routes](./threats/path_traversal_via_misconfigured_routes.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious URLs with manipulated path parameters or wildcard patterns to access files and directories outside the intended web application root. They might read sensitive configuration files, application code, or user data.
**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential data exfiltration, application compromise, and in severe cases, server compromise if write access is gained.
**Iris Component Affected:** Routing Module, `iris.Party` and `iris.Get/Post/etc` route handlers.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly define routes with specific paths instead of broad wildcards.
*   Sanitize and validate all path parameters used in route handlers.
*   Use functions like `filepath.Clean` and `filepath.Join` in Go to normalize and validate paths.
*   Regularly review route configurations and test for path traversal vulnerabilities.
*   Implement input validation middleware to check path parameters against allowed patterns.

## Threat: [Middleware Misconfiguration and Bypass](./threats/middleware_misconfiguration_and_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits incorrect ordering or configuration of Iris middleware. For example, if authentication middleware is placed after data processing middleware, sensitive data might be accessed without proper authentication.
**Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization bypass, access to sensitive data, potential for further exploitation depending on the bypassed middleware and application logic.
**Iris Component Affected:** Middleware System (`app.Use`, `party.Use`), Middleware Functions.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully design and order middleware chains to ensure security middleware is executed before processing sensitive data or actions.
*   Thoroughly test middleware configurations to verify they function as intended and provide the expected security controls.
*   Document the purpose and order of each middleware in the application.
*   Use unit tests to verify middleware behavior and interactions.

## Threat: [Handler Logic Vulnerabilities Specific to Iris Features (Insecure Session Handling)](./threats/handler_logic_vulnerabilities_specific_to_iris_features__insecure_session_handling_.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or insecure usage of Iris-specific session management features within handler logic. This could include improper session initialization, lack of session regeneration after authentication, or insecure handling of session data.
**Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, unauthorized access to user accounts and data.
**Iris Component Affected:** Session Management (`iris.Sessions`), `ctx.Session`.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly understand Iris's session management features and best practices.
*   Always regenerate session IDs after successful authentication using `ctx.Session().Reset()`.
*   Use secure session storage mechanisms and configurations.
*   Follow Iris documentation and community guidelines for secure session management.
*   Conduct code reviews focusing on the correct and secure implementation of session handling in handler logic.

## Threat: [Insecure Session Storage Configuration](./threats/insecure_session_storage_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to session data due to insecure session storage configuration within Iris. This could involve exploiting insecure cookies (e.g., missing `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite` flags) or using insecure server-side storage options without proper encryption or access controls.
**Impact:** Session hijacking, authentication bypass, access to user accounts and sensitive data, potential for account takeover.
**Iris Component Affected:** Session Management (`iris.Sessions`), Session Storage Backends.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Choose secure session storage mechanisms (e.g., encrypted cookies, secure server-side storage like Redis or database with encryption).
*   Configure session settings appropriately, including setting `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` flags for cookies.
*   Use strong encryption for sensitive session data if stored in cookies or server-side storage.
*   Regularly review session storage configurations and ensure they align with security best practices.

## Threat: [Outdated Iris Framework Version](./threats/outdated_iris_framework_version.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities present in an outdated version of the Iris framework. Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in older versions can be easily exploited if the application is not updated.
**Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the flaw.
**Iris Component Affected:** Core Iris Framework, All Modules.
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Iris to the latest stable version.
*   Monitor Iris security advisories and release notes for any reported vulnerabilities.
*   Apply updates promptly to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Use dependency management tools to track and manage Iris version.

## Threat: [Exposure of Iris Debug Features in Production](./threats/exposure_of_iris_debug_features_in_production.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to Iris debug features or endpoints that are accidentally exposed in a production environment. These features might provide valuable information about the application's internal workings, configuration, or even allow for code execution.
**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for remote code execution if debug features allow it, application compromise, server compromise in severe cases.
**Iris Component Affected:** Debug Features (`iris.Configuration.IsDevelopment()`, Debug Endpoints).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure debug features and endpoints are disabled or properly secured in production deployments.
*   Use build flags or environment variables to control debug settings and ensure they are disabled in production builds.
*   Implement access controls and authentication for debug endpoints if they are absolutely necessary in production (which is generally discouraged).
*   Regularly review deployed configurations to ensure debug features are not inadvertently enabled.
