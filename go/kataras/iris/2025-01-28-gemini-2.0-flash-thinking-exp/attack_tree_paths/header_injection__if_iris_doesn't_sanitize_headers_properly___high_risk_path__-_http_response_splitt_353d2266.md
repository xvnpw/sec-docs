### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Header Injection -> HTTP Response Splitting / Session Hijacking

This attack path exploits a fundamental weakness: **improper handling of HTTP headers**. If an Iris application, or the underlying code, fails to sanitize or validate user-controlled input that is used to construct HTTP headers, attackers can inject malicious content into these headers. This injection can lead to two primary high-risk outcomes: HTTP Response Splitting and Session Hijacking (via `Set-Cookie` injection).

#### 4.1. Header Injection (HIGH RISK PATH)

* **Vulnerability Description:** Header Injection occurs when an attacker can control part of an HTTP header value. This is typically achieved by injecting special characters, most notably Carriage Return (CR - `%0d` or `\r`) and Line Feed (LF - `%0a` or `\n`), often referred to as CRLF injection. These characters are used to separate headers and the header section from the body in HTTP responses.
* **Attack Vector:** Attackers can inject malicious headers by manipulating user-supplied input that is directly or indirectly used to set HTTP headers in the Iris application. Common injection points include:
    * **Query Parameters:**  Data passed in the URL query string.
    * **Form Data:** Data submitted through HTML forms.
    * **Path Parameters:**  Parts of the URL path used to identify resources.
    * **Custom Headers:**  Input from other sources that the application might use to set headers.
* **Iris Context:** Iris, like most web frameworks, provides mechanisms to set HTTP headers programmatically. If developers directly use unsanitized user input to set header values using Iris's header manipulation functions (e.g., `ctx.Header().Set()`, `ctx.Header().Add()`), the application becomes vulnerable to header injection.
* **Risk Level:** **HIGH RISK PATH**. Successful header injection is the foundation for more severe attacks like HTTP Response Splitting and Session Hijacking.

#### 4.2. HTTP Response Splitting (via injected headers) (HIGH RISK PATH)

* **Vulnerability Description:** HTTP Response Splitting is a direct consequence of successful header injection. By injecting CRLF characters followed by malicious headers and potentially a body, an attacker can effectively split the server's response into multiple HTTP responses. This allows the attacker to control the content of subsequent responses delivered to the client.
* **Mechanism:**
    1. **CRLF Injection:** The attacker injects CRLF sequences into a header value.
    2. **Header Termination:** The CRLF sequence terminates the current header.
    3. **Malicious Header Injection:**  The attacker injects new, malicious headers after the CRLF.
    4. **Malicious Body Injection (Optional):** The attacker can also inject a malicious HTTP body after the injected headers, further controlling the response.
* **Impact:**
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the injected HTTP body. Since the browser interprets the split response as legitimate, the injected script will be executed in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable domain, leading to XSS.
    * **Page Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the content of the page displayed to the user by injecting arbitrary HTML in the malicious body.
    * **Cache Poisoning:**  Injected malicious responses can be cached by proxies or browsers, affecting subsequent users who request the same resource.
    * **Serving Malicious Content:** Attackers can serve malware or phishing pages by controlling the injected response body.
* **Iris Context:** If an Iris application is vulnerable to header injection, it is directly susceptible to HTTP Response Splitting. Iris itself does not inherently prevent this if developers are not careful with header handling.
* **Risk Level:** **HIGH RISK PATH**. HTTP Response Splitting can lead to significant security breaches, including XSS and other forms of malicious content delivery.

#### 4.3. Session Hijacking (via Set-Cookie injection) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)

* **Vulnerability Description:**  Session Hijacking via `Set-Cookie` injection is a particularly critical outcome of header injection. By injecting a `Set-Cookie` header, an attacker can force the user's browser to store a cookie value controlled by the attacker. This injected cookie can be used to hijack the user's session.
* **Mechanism:**
    1. **CRLF Injection:** The attacker injects CRLF sequences into a header value.
    2. **Header Termination:** The CRLF sequence terminates the current header.
    3. **`Set-Cookie` Header Injection:** The attacker injects a `Set-Cookie` header with a malicious cookie value. For example: `Set-Cookie: SESSIONID=malicious_session_id; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure`
    4. **Cookie Setting:** The user's browser, upon receiving the split response, will process the injected `Set-Cookie` header and store the malicious cookie.
* **Impact:**
    * **Account Takeover:** If the injected `Set-Cookie` header sets a session identifier, the attacker can use this identifier to impersonate the victim user and gain unauthorized access to their account.
    * **Data Breach:**  Once the attacker has hijacked the session, they can access sensitive user data and perform actions on behalf of the victim.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, session hijacking can lead to privilege escalation if the attacker can hijack an administrator's session.
* **Iris Context:**  Similar to HTTP Response Splitting, Iris applications are vulnerable to `Set-Cookie` injection if header injection is possible.  If developers use unsanitized input to set headers, attackers can inject `Set-Cookie` headers.
* **Risk Level:** **CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH**. Session Hijacking is a severe security vulnerability that can lead to complete account compromise and significant data breaches. The "CRITICAL NODE" designation highlights the severity and direct impact of this outcome.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the Header Injection attack path and its consequences (HTTP Response Splitting and Session Hijacking), the following mitigation strategies should be implemented in Iris applications:

* **5.1. Header Sanitization and Validation (Crucial Mitigation):**
    * **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-supplied input before using it to construct HTTP headers. This includes:
        * **Removing CRLF Characters:**  Strip or encode Carriage Return (`\r` or `%0d`) and Line Feed (`\n` or `%0a`) characters from user input.
        * **Input Validation:**  Validate the format and content of user input to ensure it conforms to expected patterns and does not contain malicious characters.
    * **Output Encoding (Context-Aware Encoding):**  If direct sanitization is not feasible or sufficient, consider context-aware encoding of header values. However, for headers, direct sanitization by removing CRLF is generally the most effective approach.

* **5.2. Avoid Direct Header Manipulation (Best Practice):**
    * **Framework Features:**  Utilize Iris's built-in features and functions for setting headers whenever possible. These functions are often designed to handle header encoding and escaping correctly.
    * **Abstraction Layers:**  Create abstraction layers or helper functions to manage header setting, ensuring consistent sanitization and validation across the application.
    * **Minimize Custom Header Logic:**  Reduce the amount of custom code that directly manipulates HTTP headers based on user input.

* **5.3. Content Security Policy (CSP) (Defense in Depth for XSS):**
    * **Implement CSP Headers:**  Deploy Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks that might arise from HTTP Response Splitting. CSP allows you to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, reducing the impact of injected scripts.
    * **`Content-Security-Policy` Header:**  Configure CSP headers to restrict script sources, object sources, and other resource loading policies.

* **5.4. Secure Cookie Handling (Mitigation for Session Hijacking):**
    * **`HttpOnly` Flag:**  Always set the `HttpOnly` flag for session cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript from accessing them, reducing the risk of XSS-based session hijacking (though not directly related to header injection, it's a general best practice for session security).
    * **`Secure` Flag:**  Set the `Secure` flag for session cookies to ensure they are only transmitted over HTTPS, protecting them from interception in transit.
    * **`SameSite` Attribute:**  Use the `SameSite` attribute to mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, which can sometimes be related to session hijacking scenarios.

* **5.5. Regular Security Audits and Testing:**
    * **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing to identify and validate header injection vulnerabilities and other security weaknesses in the Iris application.
    * **Code Reviews:**  Perform code reviews to ensure that header handling logic is secure and follows best practices.
    * **Security Scanning:**  Utilize automated security scanning tools to detect potential header injection vulnerabilities.

### 6. Conclusion

The Header Injection attack path, leading to HTTP Response Splitting and Session Hijacking, represents a significant security risk for Iris applications.  **Proper header sanitization and validation are paramount to prevent these vulnerabilities.** Developers must be vigilant in handling user input that influences HTTP headers and should adopt secure coding practices, leveraging Iris's features and implementing defense-in-depth strategies like CSP and secure cookie handling.  Regular security assessments are crucial to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of these mitigation measures and to protect Iris applications from these critical attack vectors. The "CRITICAL NODE" of Session Hijacking underscores the importance of prioritizing the mitigation of header injection vulnerabilities in Iris applications.
