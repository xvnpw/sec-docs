### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Route Parameter Injection -> Achieve RCE / Data Exfiltration

#### 4.1. Understanding Route Parameter Injection

Route Parameter Injection occurs when an attacker manipulates the parameters within a URL path (route parameters) to inject malicious code or commands. Web applications often use route parameters to dynamically handle requests and identify specific resources. If these parameters are not properly validated and sanitized, they can become a conduit for various attacks.

In the context of Iris, route parameters are defined within route patterns using placeholders like `/{param}` or `/{param:string}`. Iris then extracts these parameters and makes them available to route handlers.

**Example Iris Route Definition:**

```go
package main

import "github.com/kataras/iris/v12"

func main() {
	app := iris.New()

	app.Get("/user/{id:int}", func(ctx iris.Context) {
		userID := ctx.Params().GetIntDefault("id", 0)
		ctx.Writef("User ID: %d", userID)
	})

	app.Listen(":8080")
}
```

In this example, `id` is a route parameter.  A request to `/user/123` would extract `123` as the `id` parameter.  The vulnerability arises when developers use these parameters in a way that can be exploited if malicious input is provided.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector: Injecting Malicious Code/Commands via Route Parameters

Attackers can inject malicious payloads into route parameters by crafting URLs that include harmful characters or commands. The success of this attack depends on how the application processes and uses these parameters.

**Common Injection Techniques:**

* **Command Injection:** Injecting operating system commands into parameters that are subsequently used in system calls (e.g., using `os/exec` in Go).
* **SQL Injection:** Injecting SQL code into parameters that are used to construct database queries.
* **Path Traversal:** Injecting path manipulation characters (e.g., `../`) to access files or directories outside the intended scope.
* **Code Injection (Less common via route parameters directly, but possible in certain scenarios):** Injecting code snippets that might be interpreted and executed by the application, especially if dynamic code evaluation is involved (which is generally discouraged in Go and Iris).

#### 4.3. Achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)

**Path to RCE:**

1. **Vulnerable Code:** The Iris application contains code that uses route parameters to execute system commands or perform other unsafe operations without proper sanitization.
2. **Parameter Injection:** An attacker crafts a URL with a malicious payload in a route parameter designed to be used in a system command.
3. **Command Execution:** The application, without proper validation, executes the system command with the attacker-controlled parameter, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Example Vulnerable Iris Code (Illustrative - **DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**):**

```go
app.Get("/report/{filename}", func(ctx iris.Context) {
	filename := ctx.Params().GetStringDefault("filename", "default.txt")

	// Vulnerable code - Directly using filename in system command without sanitization
	cmd := exec.Command("cat", "reports/"+filename) // Potential command injection vulnerability
	output, err := cmd.Output()
	if err != nil {
		ctx.StatusCode(iris.StatusInternalServerError)
		ctx.WriteString("Error generating report")
		return
	}
	ctx.WriteString(string(output))
})
```

In this vulnerable example, if an attacker sends a request like `/report/../../../../etc/passwd`, the `filename` parameter becomes `../../../../etc/passwd`.  The `cat` command would then attempt to read `/etc/passwd`, potentially exposing sensitive system files.  Even worse, an attacker could inject commands like `; rm -rf /` (depending on shell interpretation and command execution context).

**Impact of RCE:**

* **Full System Compromise:** Attackers gain complete control over the server.
* **Data Breach:** Access to all data stored on the server.
* **Service Disruption:**  Attackers can shut down or disrupt the application and server.
* **Malware Installation:**  The server can be used to host and distribute malware.
* **Lateral Movement:**  Compromised server can be used to attack other systems within the network.

#### 4.4. Achieving Data Exfiltration (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)

**Path to Data Exfiltration:**

1. **Vulnerable Code:** The Iris application contains code that uses route parameters in database queries or file system operations without proper sanitization, leading to vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or Path Traversal.
2. **Parameter Injection:** An attacker crafts a URL with a malicious payload in a route parameter designed to exploit these vulnerabilities.
3. **Data Access and Extraction:** The application, due to the injected parameter, executes unintended database queries or file system operations, allowing the attacker to access and exfiltrate sensitive data.

**Example Vulnerable Iris Code (Illustrative - **DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION** - SQL Injection):**

```go
app.Get("/users/{username}", func(ctx iris.Context) {
	username := ctx.Params().GetStringDefault("username", "")

	db, err := sql.Open("sqlite3", "users.db") // Example SQLite database
	if err != nil {
		ctx.StatusCode(iris.StatusInternalServerError)
		ctx.WriteString("Database error")
		return
	}
	defer db.Close()

	// Vulnerable code - String concatenation for SQL query - SQL Injection vulnerability
	query := "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'"
	rows, err := db.Query(query)
	if err != nil {
		ctx.StatusCode(iris.StatusInternalServerError)
		ctx.WriteString("Database query error")
		return
	}
	defer rows.Close()

	// ... process rows and display user data ...
})
```

In this vulnerable example, an attacker could inject SQL code into the `username` parameter. For instance, a request like `/users/admin' OR '1'='1` would modify the SQL query to `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR '1'='1'`. This would bypass the intended username filtering and potentially return all user records, leading to data exfiltration.

**Example Vulnerable Iris Code (Illustrative - **DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION** - Path Traversal):**

```go
app.Get("/files/{filepath}", func(ctx iris.Context) {
	filepath := ctx.Params().GetStringDefault("filepath", "default.txt")

	// Vulnerable code - Directly using filepath to access files without sanitization
	content, err := ioutil.ReadFile("uploads/" + filepath) // Potential path traversal vulnerability
	if err != nil {
		ctx.StatusCode(iris.StatusNotFound)
		ctx.WriteString("File not found")
		return
	}
	ctx.WriteString(string(content))
})
```

In this path traversal example, a request like `/files/../../../../etc/passwd` could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server if proper path sanitization is not implemented.

**Impact of Data Exfiltration:**

* **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive data is exposed to unauthorized parties.
* **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust and damage to brand image.
* **Financial Loss:** Fines, legal costs, and loss of business due to data breach.
* **Compliance Violations:** Failure to comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
* **Identity Theft:** Stolen personal data can be used for identity theft and fraud.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the Route Parameter Injection attack path in Iris applications, the following strategies should be implemented:

**4.5.1. Input Validation and Sanitization:**

* **Strict Validation:** Implement robust input validation for all route parameters. Define expected data types, formats, and allowed character sets. Use Iris's built-in parameter constraints (e.g., `/{id:int}`, `/{name:string}`) and custom validation logic within route handlers.
* **Sanitization:** Sanitize input parameters to remove or encode potentially harmful characters before using them in any operations. This includes:
    * **Encoding special characters:**  For example, HTML encoding, URL encoding, or database-specific escaping.
    * **Removing or replacing dangerous characters:**  Blacklisting or whitelisting allowed characters.
    * **Data type conversion and casting:** Ensure parameters are converted to the expected data type (e.g., integer, string) and handle potential conversion errors.
* **Iris Context Parameter Handling:** Utilize Iris's `ctx.Params()` methods (e.g., `GetIntDefault`, `GetStringDefault`, `GetInt64`) which provide some basic type safety and default value handling. However, these are not sufficient for comprehensive validation and sanitization.
* **Custom Validation Middleware:** Create reusable Iris middleware to enforce validation rules for route parameters across multiple routes. This promotes code reusability and consistency.
* **Example Iris Input Validation (Illustrative):**

```go
app.Get("/user/{id:int}", func(ctx iris.Context) {
	userID := ctx.Params().GetIntDefault("id", 0)

	if userID <= 0 { // Custom validation - ensure ID is positive
		ctx.StatusCode(iris.StatusBadRequest)
		ctx.WriteString("Invalid user ID")
		return
	}

	// ... proceed with processing valid userID ...
})

app.Get("/search/{query}", func(ctx iris.Context) {
	query := ctx.Params().GetStringDefault("query", "")

	// Sanitization example - basic URL encoding (more robust sanitization might be needed)
	sanitizedQuery := url.QueryEscape(query)

	// ... use sanitizedQuery in search operation ...
})
```

**4.5.2. Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements (for SQL Injection Prevention):**

* **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements** when interacting with databases. This is the most effective way to prevent SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
* **Avoid string concatenation** to build SQL queries with user-provided input.
* **Iris Database Integration:**  If using an ORM with Iris (e.g., GORM), ensure that you are using its features for parameterized queries and not constructing raw SQL queries with user input.
* **Go `database/sql` Package:** When using the standard `database/sql` package in Go, utilize `db.Prepare()` and `stmt.Exec()` or `stmt.Query()` to execute parameterized queries.
* **Example Iris with Parameterized Query (Illustrative):**

```go
app.Get("/users/{username}", func(ctx iris.Context) {
	username := ctx.Params().GetStringDefault("username", "")

	db, err := sql.Open("sqlite3", "users.db")
	if err != nil { /* ... error handling ... */ }
	defer db.Close()

	// Prepared statement - Prevents SQL Injection
	stmt, err := db.Prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?")
	if err != nil { /* ... error handling ... */ }
	defer stmt.Close()

	rows, err := stmt.Query(username) // Parameter passed separately
	if err != nil { /* ... error handling ... */ }
	defer rows.Close()

	// ... process rows ...
})
```

**4.5.3. Avoid System Command Execution (or Secure Alternatives):**

* **Minimize or eliminate the need to execute system commands** based on user input.
* **If system command execution is absolutely necessary:**
    * **Never directly use route parameters in commands without extreme caution and rigorous sanitization.**
    * **Use secure alternatives to system commands** whenever possible. For example, if you need to manipulate files, use Go's built-in file system functions instead of shell commands.
    * **If system commands are unavoidable, use libraries that provide safer command execution** with input sanitization and command whitelisting (though this is still risky).
    * **Implement strict input validation and sanitization** for any parameters used in system commands.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential RCE.
* **Example - Using Go's built-in functions instead of system commands (Illustrative):**

Instead of: `cmd := exec.Command("rm", "files/"+filename)`

Use Go's `os` package: `err := os.Remove("files/" + filename)` (after proper path validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal).

**4.5.4. Path Traversal Prevention:**

* **Validate and sanitize file paths:** When route parameters are used to access files, implement robust path traversal prevention measures.
* **Whitelist allowed file paths or directories:** Restrict access to specific directories and files.
* **Use absolute paths:** Resolve user-provided paths to absolute paths and check if they fall within the allowed directory.
* **Avoid directly concatenating user input with file paths.**
* **Use secure file handling functions:** Utilize Go's `filepath.Clean()` to sanitize paths and remove potentially malicious components like `..`.
* **Example Iris Path Traversal Prevention (Illustrative):**

```go
app.Get("/files/{filepath}", func(ctx iris.Context) {
	filepathParam := ctx.Params().GetStringDefault("filepath", "default.txt")

	baseDir := "uploads/" // Allowed base directory
	unsafePath := filepath.Join(baseDir, filepathParam)
	safePath := filepath.Clean(unsafePath) // Sanitize path

	if !strings.HasPrefix(safePath, baseDir) { // Path traversal check
		ctx.StatusCode(iris.StatusBadRequest)
		ctx.WriteString("Invalid file path")
		return
	}

	content, err := ioutil.ReadFile(safePath)
	if err != nil { /* ... error handling ... */ }
	ctx.WriteString(string(content))
})
```

**4.5.5. Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**

* **Regular security audits and code reviews:** Conduct regular security assessments of the Iris application to identify potential vulnerabilities, including Route Parameter Injection.
* **Penetration testing:** Perform penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and validate the effectiveness of security measures.
* **Static and Dynamic Analysis Tools:** Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.

**4.5.6. Web Application Firewall (WAF):**

* Consider deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the Iris application. A WAF can help detect and block common web attacks, including some forms of parameter injection, before they reach the application.

**Conclusion:**

Route Parameter Injection is a serious vulnerability that can lead to critical consequences like RCE and Data Exfiltration in Iris applications. By understanding the attack mechanisms and implementing comprehensive mitigation strategies, particularly focusing on input validation, parameterized queries, secure coding practices, and Iris-specific features, development teams can significantly reduce the risk and build more secure Iris applications.  Proactive security measures, including regular audits and penetration testing, are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.
