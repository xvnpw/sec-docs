### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Path Traversal in Static File Serving -> Access Sensitive Files

#### 4.1. Attack Description

Path traversal, also known as directory traversal, is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to access files and directories that are located outside the web server's document root. This occurs when an application uses user-supplied input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization. By manipulating the file path, attackers can bypass intended access restrictions and potentially read sensitive files, execute arbitrary code, or cause other malicious actions.

In the context of static file serving, a web application often allows users to request files from a designated directory (e.g., `/static/`).  A path traversal vulnerability arises when the application fails to properly validate the requested file path, allowing attackers to use special characters like `../` (dot-dot-slash) to navigate up the directory tree and access files outside the intended static file directory.

#### 4.2. Technical Details in Iris Context

Iris, like many web frameworks, provides functionalities to serve static files.  Typically, this involves configuring a route or middleware to handle requests for static assets from a specific directory on the server's file system.

**How Iris Serves Static Files (Conceptual):**

Iris provides functions like `iris.StaticFS` and `iris.StaticHandler` to serve static files.  These functions generally take a URL path prefix and a file system path as arguments. When a request matches the URL path prefix, Iris attempts to serve the corresponding file from the specified file system path.

**Potential Vulnerability Point:**

The vulnerability arises if Iris, or the application developer using Iris, does not adequately validate the requested file path *after* it's constructed based on user input (the URL path).  If the application simply concatenates user-provided path segments without proper checks, an attacker can inject path traversal sequences (`../`) into the URL to escape the intended static file directory.

**Example Vulnerable Scenario (Conceptual Iris Code):**

```go
package main

import "github.com/kataras/iris/v12"

func main() {
	app := iris.New()

	// Vulnerable static file serving - simplified for demonstration
	app.Get("/static/{filepath:path}", func(ctx iris.Context) {
		filepath := ctx.Params().Get("filepath")
		// Potentially vulnerable: Directly using user input 'filepath'
		fullPath := "./public/" + filepath // Assumes static files are in 'public' directory

		err := ctx.SendFile(fullPath) // Iris function to send file
		if err != nil {
			ctx.StatusCode(iris.StatusNotFound)
			ctx.WriteString("File not found")
		}
	})

	app.Listen(":8080")
}
```

In this simplified example, if a user requests `/static/../../../../etc/passwd`, the `filepath` parameter becomes `../../../../etc/passwd`. The `fullPath` becomes `./public/../../../../etc/passwd`.  If Iris's `SendFile` function or the underlying OS file system access doesn't prevent traversal, the attacker might be able to access `/etc/passwd` (or equivalent sensitive files depending on the OS and server setup), which is outside the intended `./public/` directory.

**Note:** Iris's actual `StaticFS` and `StaticHandler` functions likely have some built-in protections. However, vulnerabilities can still occur due to:

* **Misconfiguration:** Incorrectly configuring the root directory for static file serving.
* **Developer Error:**  Custom implementations or modifications to static file serving logic that bypass built-in protections or introduce new vulnerabilities.
* **Framework Vulnerabilities (Less Likely but Possible):**  Although less common, vulnerabilities can sometimes be found within the framework itself. It's crucial to use up-to-date versions of Iris.

#### 4.3. Vulnerability Analysis

**Why Path Traversal is a Vulnerability:**

Path traversal is a vulnerability because it violates the principle of least privilege and exposes sensitive resources to unauthorized access. Web applications are designed to control access to files and directories based on user roles and permissions. Path traversal bypasses these intended access controls, allowing attackers to read files they should not have access to.

**Underlying Causes:**

* **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary cause is the lack of proper validation and sanitization of user-supplied input used to construct file paths.
* **Direct File Path Manipulation:** Directly concatenating user input with file paths without security checks.
* **Misunderstanding of File System Operations:**  Developers may not fully understand how file system path resolution works and the implications of using relative paths and special characters like `../`.
* **Framework Misuse:** Incorrectly using framework features for static file serving or overriding default security mechanisms.

#### 4.4. Real-world Examples (General Web Application Context)

While specific public examples of path traversal vulnerabilities in Iris applications might be less readily available, path traversal is a common vulnerability in web applications across various frameworks and languages.

**General Examples:**

* **Accessing `/etc/passwd` on Linux servers:** Attackers often target `/etc/passwd` to obtain user account information (though passwords are usually hashed, usernames can be valuable).
* **Reading application configuration files:** Configuration files often contain sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and internal system details.
* **Retrieving source code:** Accessing source code can reveal application logic, algorithms, and potentially hardcoded secrets or vulnerabilities.
* **Accessing log files:** Log files can contain sensitive user data, application errors, and internal system information.

**Relevance to Iris/Go:**

Go, being a systems programming language, provides direct access to file system operations.  If developers using Iris are not careful with input validation and file path handling, they can easily introduce path traversal vulnerabilities, similar to those seen in applications built with other languages and frameworks.

#### 4.5. Exploitation Steps

An attacker would typically exploit a path traversal vulnerability in Iris static file serving through the following steps:

1. **Identify Static File Serving Endpoint:**  The attacker first identifies endpoints in the Iris application that serve static files. This might be through observing URL patterns (e.g., `/static/`, `/assets/`, `/files/`) or by analyzing the application's behavior.
2. **Craft Path Traversal Payloads:** The attacker crafts malicious URLs containing path traversal sequences (`../`) to navigate outside the intended static file directory. Examples:
    * `/static/../../../../etc/passwd`
    * `/static/../../../config/app.ini`
    * `/static/../../../src/main.go`
3. **Send Malicious Requests:** The attacker sends HTTP GET requests to the identified static file serving endpoint with the crafted path traversal payloads.
4. **Analyze Server Response:** The attacker analyzes the server's response.
    * **Successful Exploitation:** If the server returns the content of the requested sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, configuration file), the path traversal attack is successful.
    * **Error Response (Potentially Still Vulnerable):** Even if the server returns an error (e.g., "File not found"), it might still indicate a vulnerability if the error message reveals information about the file system structure or if different error codes are returned for valid vs. invalid paths.
    * **Mitigation in Place:** If the server consistently returns "404 Not Found" or a generic error for path traversal attempts, it might indicate that mitigation measures are in place. However, further testing is needed to confirm robust protection.

#### 4.6. Impact Assessment

Successful path traversal attacks leading to the access of sensitive files can have severe consequences:

* **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposure of sensitive configuration files, source code, database credentials, API keys, and other confidential data can lead to significant data breaches and compromise the application's security.
* **Intellectual Property Theft:** Access to source code can lead to the theft of intellectual property and proprietary algorithms.
* **Security Misconfiguration Disclosure:** Configuration files often reveal details about the application's architecture, dependencies, and security settings, which can be used to plan further attacks.
* **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):**  Compromised credentials or exposed internal system details can be used to escalate privileges within the application or the underlying infrastructure.
* **Reputation Damage:**  A data breach resulting from path traversal can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Exposure of sensitive data may lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and result in legal and financial penalties.

#### 4.7. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate path traversal vulnerabilities in Iris static file serving, implement the following strategies:

* **Secure Static File Serving Configuration (Iris Specific):**
    * **Use `iris.StaticFS` or `iris.StaticHandler` Correctly:**  Utilize Iris's built-in static file serving functions and ensure they are configured with the correct root directory.  **Crucially, avoid serving the entire root directory (`/`) or overly broad directories.**  Restrict the served directory to only the necessary static assets.
    * **Define Specific Static File Paths:**  Instead of serving a broad directory, consider serving specific static files or subdirectories if possible. This reduces the attack surface.
    * **Review Iris Documentation:**  Carefully review the Iris documentation on static file serving to understand best practices and security considerations.

* **Path Sanitization and Validation:**
    * **Input Validation:**  **Never directly use user-provided input to construct file paths without validation.**  Implement robust input validation to check for and reject path traversal sequences like `../`, `./`, absolute paths (`/`), and potentially encoded versions of these sequences.
    * **Path Canonicalization:**  Canonicalize file paths to resolve symbolic links and remove redundant path separators and traversal sequences.  Go's `filepath.Clean()` function can be helpful for this purpose. However, be aware that `filepath.Clean()` alone might not be sufficient for all security scenarios and might need to be combined with other validation steps.
    * **Whitelist Approach:**  If possible, use a whitelist approach to define allowed file paths or file extensions. Only serve files that match the whitelist.
    * **Restrict File Extensions:**  Limit the types of files served statically to only necessary file extensions (e.g., `.css`, `.js`, `.png`, `.jpg`). Block serving potentially sensitive file types like `.config`, `.ini`, `.yaml`, `.log`, `.go`, `.sh`, etc.

* **Operating System Level Security:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Iris application process with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the impact if a path traversal vulnerability is exploited.
    * **File System Permissions:**  Configure file system permissions to restrict access to sensitive files and directories for the user account running the Iris application. Ensure that the web server process only has read access to the necessary static files and not to sensitive configuration or system files.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    * **Deploy a WAF:**  A Web Application Firewall can help detect and block path traversal attacks by inspecting HTTP requests and identifying malicious patterns. Configure the WAF with rules to specifically detect path traversal attempts.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Conduct Regular Audits:**  Perform regular security audits of the Iris application's code and configuration, specifically focusing on static file serving and file handling logic.
    * **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security professionals to conduct penetration testing to identify and exploit potential path traversal vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

#### 4.8. Testing and Detection

To ensure effective mitigation, implement the following testing and detection methods:

* **Manual Testing:**
    * **Path Traversal Payloads:**  Manually test the static file serving endpoints with various path traversal payloads (e.g., `../`, encoded sequences, long paths) to attempt to access files outside the intended directory.
    * **File Existence Checks:**  Test if you can access known sensitive files (e.g., `/etc/passwd` - if testing in a controlled environment or using dummy files for testing) using path traversal.
    * **Browser Developer Tools:** Use browser developer tools to inspect HTTP requests and responses to analyze server behavior and identify successful or failed path traversal attempts.

* **Automated Security Scanning:**
    * **Vulnerability Scanners:**  Utilize web vulnerability scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite Scanner, Nikto) to automatically scan the Iris application for path traversal vulnerabilities. Configure the scanners to specifically target static file serving endpoints.
    * **Static Code Analysis:**  Employ static code analysis tools to analyze the Iris application's source code for potential path traversal vulnerabilities in file handling logic.

* **Logging and Monitoring:**
    * **Detailed Logging:** Implement detailed logging of all static file requests, including the requested file path. Monitor logs for suspicious patterns, such as attempts to access files outside the expected static file directory or frequent requests with path traversal sequences.
    * **Security Monitoring Tools:** Integrate security monitoring tools to detect and alert on anomalous activity, including potential path traversal attacks.
