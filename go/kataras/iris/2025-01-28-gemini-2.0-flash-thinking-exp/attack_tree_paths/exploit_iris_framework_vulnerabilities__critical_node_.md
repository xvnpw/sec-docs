    * **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Iris applications construct SQL queries to inject malicious SQL code, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries.
    * **Attack Vectors:**  Exploiting insufficient input validation when constructing database queries using user-provided data.
    * **Impact:**  Data breaches, data modification, data deletion, authentication bypass, potential command execution on the database server.
    * **Iris Specific Considerations:**  If Iris applications directly construct SQL queries (less common with ORMs, but possible), vulnerabilities could arise.  Even with ORMs, improper usage or ORM vulnerabilities could lead to SQLi.

* **Command Injection:**
    * **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server.
    * **Attack Vectors:**  Exploiting insufficient input validation when passing user-provided data to system commands or external processes.
    * **Impact:**  Full server compromise, data breaches, service disruption, malware installation.
    * **Iris Specific Considerations:**  Less likely in typical web applications, but if Iris applications interact with system commands based on user input, this risk exists.

* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    * **Description:**  Tricking a logged-in user into unknowingly performing actions on a web application without their consent.
    * **Attack Vectors:**  Exploiting the lack of CSRF protection in Iris applications by crafting malicious requests that are triggered when a user visits a malicious website or clicks a malicious link.
    * **Impact:**  Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, such as changing passwords, making purchases, or modifying data.
    * **Iris Specific Considerations:**  Iris provides built-in CSRF protection mechanisms. Vulnerabilities could arise if these mechanisms are not properly implemented or configured in the application.

* **Authentication and Authorization Bypass:**
    * **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms, gaining unauthorized access to protected resources or functionalities.
    * **Attack Vectors:**  Exploiting flaws in Iris's authentication middleware, session management, or authorization logic.

    * **Attack Vectors:**  Exploiting insufficient input validation when handling file paths or URLs, allowing attackers to manipulate paths to access sensitive files.
    * **Impact:**  Disclosure of sensitive files (configuration files, source code, etc.), potential for code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.
    * **Iris Specific Considerations:**  Vulnerabilities could arise in file serving functionalities or in custom file handling logic within Iris applications.

* **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Iris applications deserialize data, potentially leading to code execution or other malicious actions.
    * **Attack Vectors:**  Exploiting insecure deserialization of untrusted data, allowing attackers to inject malicious objects that are executed during deserialization.
    * **Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches.
    * **Iris Specific Considerations:**  If Iris applications use serialization/deserialization mechanisms (e.g., for session management or data storage), vulnerabilities could arise if not handled securely.

* **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and packages that Iris depends on.
    * **Attack Vectors:**  Exploiting known vulnerabilities in dependencies that are used by Iris, even if Iris itself is secure.
    * **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, potentially mirroring any of the above vulnerability types.
    * **Iris Specific Considerations:**  Regularly auditing and updating Iris dependencies is crucial to mitigate this risk.

**4.2. Attack Vectors and Techniques:**

Attackers can exploit Iris framework vulnerabilities through various attack vectors, including:

* **Crafted HTTP Requests:**  Manipulating HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) to inject malicious payloads, bypass security checks, or trigger vulnerable code paths within the Iris framework.
* **Malicious Input Data:**  Providing malicious input data through forms, URL parameters, headers, or cookies to exploit input validation vulnerabilities.
* **Social Engineering:**  Tricking users into clicking malicious links or visiting compromised websites that exploit CSRF vulnerabilities or deliver XSS payloads.
