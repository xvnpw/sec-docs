Attacker's Goal: Compromise Application via esbuild Exploitation

Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

└─── ***[HIGH-RISK PATH]*** Exploit Build-Time Vulnerabilities (AND) ***[CRITICAL NODE]***
    └─── ***[HIGH-RISK PATH]*** Introduce Malicious Code via esbuild Plugin (OR) ***[CRITICAL NODE]***
    │   └─── Supply Chain Attack on Plugin Dependency
    │   └─── Compromise Developer Machine with Plugin Development Access
    └─── ***[HIGH-RISK PATH]*** Manipulate esbuild Configuration (OR) ***[CRITICAL NODE]***
    │   └─── Compromise CI/CD Pipeline
    │   └─── Compromise Developer Machine with Build Configuration Access
    └─── ***[HIGH-RISK PATH]*** Exploit esbuild's Dependency Resolution (OR) ***[CRITICAL NODE]***
        └─── Dependency Confusion Attack

Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

* **High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit Build-Time Vulnerabilities**
    * This represents the overarching category of attacks that occur during the application's build process, leveraging esbuild. Success here allows for the injection of malicious code directly into the final application artifacts.

* **High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Introduce Malicious Code via esbuild Plugin**
    * **Attack Vector: Supply Chain Attack on Plugin Dependency**
        * An attacker compromises a dependency of an esbuild plugin used by the application.
        * Malicious code is injected into the compromised dependency.
        * When the application's build process runs, esbuild includes the plugin and its compromised dependency.
        * The malicious code is executed during the build, potentially modifying the build output or introducing backdoors.
    * **Attack Vector: Compromise Developer Machine with Plugin Development Access**
        * An attacker gains unauthorized access to a developer's machine who is working on a custom esbuild plugin for the application.
        * The attacker injects malicious code directly into the plugin's source code.
        * When the application is built, the malicious plugin is included, and its code is incorporated into the final application.

* **High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Manipulate esbuild Configuration**
    * **Attack Vector: Compromise CI/CD Pipeline**
        * An attacker gains unauthorized access to the application's Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
        * The attacker modifies the esbuild configuration files (e.g., `esbuild.config.js`).
        * These modifications can include adding malicious code, altering build steps to include external resources, or changing output settings to introduce vulnerabilities.
        * When the CI/CD pipeline runs the build process, the modified configuration is used, leading to a compromised application.
    * **Attack Vector: Compromise Developer Machine with Build Configuration Access**
        * An attacker gains unauthorized access to a developer's machine that contains the application's codebase and build configuration.
        * The attacker directly modifies the esbuild configuration files.
        * Similar to the CI/CD attack, this can lead to the injection of malicious code or the introduction of vulnerabilities during the build.

* **High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit esbuild's Dependency Resolution**
    * **Attack Vector: Dependency Confusion Attack**
        * An attacker identifies private dependencies used by the application (often with internal company names).
        * The attacker creates a malicious package with the *same name* as the private dependency and publishes it to a public package registry (like npm).
        * Due to misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in the dependency resolution process, esbuild might mistakenly download and include the attacker's public, malicious package instead of the intended private one during the build.
        * The malicious package's code is then executed during the build process, potentially compromising the application.
