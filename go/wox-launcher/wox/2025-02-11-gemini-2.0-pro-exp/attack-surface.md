# Attack Surface Analysis for wox-launcher/wox

## Attack Surface: [1. Malicious Plugins (Wox's Handling)](./attack_surfaces/1__malicious_plugins__wox's_handling_.md)

*   **Description:**  Wox's execution of code from potentially malicious third-party plugins.  This focuses on *Wox's* role in enabling this, not the plugin itself.
*   **Wox Contribution:** Wox's plugin architecture provides the *mechanism* for loading and executing external code, making it a critical point of vulnerability.  The lack of strong isolation is the core issue.
*   **Example:**  A malicious plugin is installed, and Wox executes it without sufficient sandboxing, allowing the plugin to access the user's files.
*   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, data theft, installation of further malware, credential theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Implement robust plugin sandboxing (e.g., separate processes with minimal privileges).  This is the *primary* mitigation.
        *   Implement a plugin signing system and enforce signature verification.
        *   Implement a permission system, requiring plugins to declare and request specific permissions.  Wox should enforce these permissions.
        *   Provide a clear API for plugins that minimizes the risk of security vulnerabilities (e.g., safe functions for file access, network communication).

## Attack Surface: [2. Command Injection via Queries (Wox's Processing)](./attack_surfaces/2__command_injection_via_queries__wox's_processing_.md)

*   **Description:**  Wox's handling of user-entered queries, specifically the potential for injecting malicious commands if input is not properly sanitized before being passed to system functions or APIs.
*   **Wox Contribution:** Wox's core functionality involves processing user input (queries) and potentially interacting with the operating system or other applications based on that input.  This is where the vulnerability lies.
*   **Example:**  A user enters a query that, due to a flaw in Wox's parsing logic, is interpreted as a system command and executed.  This could happen even *without* a malicious plugin if Wox itself has a vulnerability in how it handles certain characters or commands.
*   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, system compromise, data loss.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for *all* user input processed by Wox.
        *   Use parameterized queries or APIs whenever interacting with the operating system or external applications.  *Never* construct commands by concatenating strings with user input.
        *   Employ a whitelist approach for allowed characters in queries, rejecting anything outside the whitelist.
        *   Thoroughly test and fuzz the query parsing and handling logic.

## Attack Surface: [3. Insecure Inter-Process Communication (IPC)](./attack_surfaces/3__insecure_inter-process_communication__ipc_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the communication mechanism between Wox's main process and any helper processes or plugins (if they run in separate processes).
*   **Wox Contribution:** Wox's architecture and choice of IPC mechanism directly determine the security of this communication.
*   **Example:**  If Wox uses an insecure IPC method (e.g., named pipes without proper authentication), an attacker could potentially inject commands or data into Wox or a plugin.
*   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Use well-established, secure IPC mechanisms (e.g., named pipes with proper access control lists, secure sockets with TLS).
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for *all* IPC communication.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data transmitted via IPC.
        *   Validate all data received via IPC, treating it as untrusted.
        *   Avoid custom-built IPC protocols unless absolutely necessary and rigorously security-reviewed.

## Attack Surface: [4. Insecure Update Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/4__insecure_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:**  Flaws in Wox's update process that could allow an attacker to deliver a malicious update.
*   **Wox Contribution:** Wox's update mechanism is entirely within its control and is a critical security component.
*   **Example:**  An attacker compromises the update server or performs a man-in-the-middle attack, replacing a legitimate Wox update with a compromised version.
*   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, as the attacker can deliver arbitrary code through the update.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Use HTTPS for *all* update downloads.
        *   *Must* verify the digital signature of downloaded updates using a trusted certificate authority.
        *   Implement a secure update mechanism that is resistant to tampering and rollback attacks.
        *   Regularly audit the update process and infrastructure for security vulnerabilities.
