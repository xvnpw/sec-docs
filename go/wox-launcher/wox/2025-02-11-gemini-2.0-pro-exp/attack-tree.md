## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Input Validation Failure [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_input_validation_failure__critical_.md)

*   **1.1.1 Command Injection (1.1.1.1 Bypass input sanitization in query parsing) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts a malicious query that, due to insufficient input sanitization in Wox's core query parsing logic, is interpreted as a system command rather than a search query. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host system.
    *   **Example:**  A query like `!calc; rm -rf /` (if Wox uses a shell command to launch the calculator and doesn't properly escape semicolons) could delete the root directory.  A more realistic example would involve more subtle commands and potentially encoded payloads.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Dependency Vulnerabilities (1.3.1.1 Exploit a known CVE in a Wox dependency) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_dependency_vulnerabilities__1_3_1_1_exploit_a_known_cve_in_a_wox_dependency___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Wox core relies on external libraries. If a vulnerable version of a library is used, and a known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) exists for that vulnerability, an attacker can exploit it to gain control.
    *   **Example:**  If Wox uses an outdated version of a library with a known buffer overflow vulnerability, an attacker could craft a specific input that triggers the overflow and executes arbitrary code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low (if CVE is public) / High (if 0-day)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (if CVE is public) / Expert (if 0-day)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (if CVE is public) / Very Hard (if 0-day)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Wox Plugins [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_wox_plugins__critical_.md)

*   **2.1 Malicious Plugin (Installed by User or Attacker) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **2.1.1 Direct Code Execution (2.1.1.1 Plugin contains malicious code that runs when triggered) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker creates and distributes a Wox plugin that contains malicious code.  When a user installs and triggers this plugin (e.g., by entering a specific query), the malicious code executes.
        *   **Example:** A plugin disguised as a "system optimizer" could actually contain code to install a backdoor or steal data.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (if behavior is obvious) / Hard (if well-hidden)

*   **2.2 Vulnerable Plugin (Legitimate Plugin with Flaws)**
    *   **2.2.1 Input Validation Failure [CRITICAL]**
        *   **2.2.1.1 Command Injection [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Description:** Similar to 1.1.1.1, but the vulnerability exists within a legitimate (but flawed) plugin. The attacker crafts a query that exploits the plugin's poor input handling to execute commands.
            *   **Example:** A plugin that interacts with a web service might be vulnerable to SQL injection if it doesn't properly sanitize user input before sending it to the server.  This could be leveraged to execute commands on the server, and potentially, through further exploits, on the host running Wox.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **2.2.3 Dependency Vulnerabilities (2.2.3.1 Vulnerable version of a library used by the plugin) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  Similar to 1.3.1.1, but the vulnerability exists within a library used by a plugin, rather than Wox core.
        *   **Example:** A plugin uses an outdated image processing library with a known vulnerability that allows arbitrary code execution when processing a specially crafted image file.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low (if CVE is public) / High (if 0-day)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (if CVE is public) / Expert (if 0-day)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (if CVE is public) / Very Hard (if 0-day)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Wox Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_wox_configuration.md)

  * **3.1 Weak Plugin Security Settings [HIGH RISK]**
        * **3.1.1 Plugin allowed to execute arbitrary commands without restrictions. [CRITICAL]**
            * **3.1.1.1 Attacker crafts a query that triggers the vulnerable plugin to execute malicious code. [HIGH RISK]**
                * **Description:** Wox's configuration allows a plugin to execute system commands without any restrictions or sandboxing. An attacker can then use this plugin (either a malicious one they installed or a legitimate one with this capability) to run arbitrary code.
                * **Example:** A plugin designed to run shell scripts is configured to allow any script execution. The attacker uses a query that triggers this plugin to run a malicious script.
                * **Likelihood:** Medium
                * **Impact:** Very High
                * **Effort:** Low
                * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
                * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
