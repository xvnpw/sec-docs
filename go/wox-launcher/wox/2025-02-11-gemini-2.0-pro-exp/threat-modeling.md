# Threat Model Analysis for wox-launcher/wox

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Impersonation](./threats/malicious_plugin_impersonation.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Impersonation

    *   **Description:** An attacker creates a malicious Wox plugin with the same name or identifier as the legitimate application plugin.  The user is tricked into installing the malicious plugin.  The attacker's plugin can intercept user input, steal data, provide false results, or execute code within Wox's context (the user's privileges).  Wox's lack of built-in plugin verification makes this a significant threat.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach: Sensitive user/application data theft.
        *   Code execution: Arbitrary code execution on the user's system.
        *   Application compromise: Manipulation of the integrated application.
        *   Loss of user trust.
    *   **Affected Wox Component:** Plugin loading mechanism (`wox.py` or related plugin management), plugin API. This fundamentally affects how Wox loads and trusts plugins.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Implement a *custom* plugin verification system (e.g., hash checking, out-of-band verification). This is *essential* due to Wox's limitations.
            *   Use a unique, complex plugin identifier.
            *   Provide verifiable installation instructions (checksums, etc.).
        *   **User:**
            *   Only install plugins from *trusted* sources (official website, verified repository).
            *   Be wary of plugins with similar names.

## Threat: [Plugin Code Tampering](./threats/plugin_code_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** Plugin Code Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker with local access (or via another vulnerability) modifies the *installed* Wox plugin's code (e.g., Python files) to inject malicious behavior. This bypasses any initial installation checks.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach: Theft of sensitive data handled by the plugin.
        *   Code execution: Arbitrary code execution with user privileges.
        *   Application compromise.
    *   **Affected Wox Component:** The installed plugin files (e.g., `.py` files in the `Plugins` directory), specifically the code that handles user input and interacts with the application/Wox.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Implement runtime integrity checks within the plugin (e.g., hashing critical code). Limited by Wox, but adds a layer of defense.
        *   **User:**
            *   Maintain a secure system (antivirus, updated software).
            *   Regularly audit installed Wox plugins.

## Threat: [Data Leakage via Wox History/Clipboard](./threats/data_leakage_via_wox_historyclipboard.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Leakage via Wox History/Clipboard

    *   **Description:** The Wox plugin displays sensitive information in Wox's history or copies it to the clipboard. This data is then accessible to other applications, plugins, or attackers. This is a direct consequence of how Wox handles results and clipboard interactions.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach: Exposure of sensitive information.
        *   Privacy violation.
    *   **Affected Wox Component:**
        *   `wox.py` (or core Wox) - history management and clipboard interaction functions.
        *   The plugin's code interacting with Wox's result display and clipboard APIs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Avoid displaying sensitive information directly in Wox results.
            *   Minimize clipboard use for sensitive data; clear it immediately if used.
            *   Sanitize input/output to prevent injection attacks.
        *   **User:**
            *   Be aware of information in Wox's history/clipboard.
            *   Consider disabling Wox's history.
            *   Use a secure clipboard manager.

## Threat: [Elevation of Privilege via Plugin (Exploitation Conduit)](./threats/elevation_of_privilege_via_plugin__exploitation_conduit_.md)

*   **Threat:** Elevation of Privilege via Plugin (Exploitation Conduit)

    *   **Description:** While the plugin runs with *user* privileges, a vulnerability within the plugin allows an attacker to execute code with those *existing* user privileges. The plugin itself doesn't elevate, but it's the *means* of exploitation. This is directly related to how Wox executes plugins.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Code execution: Arbitrary code execution with the user's privileges.
        *   System compromise (depending on user privileges).
    *   **Affected Wox Component:** The plugin's code (any vulnerable part), and how Wox executes that code without sandboxing or privilege separation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Principle of least privilege: Minimize plugin permissions.
            *   Avoid operations requiring elevated privileges.
            *   Sanitize all input; validate all data.
            *   Secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities.
            *   Regular code audits.
        *   **User:**
            *   Run Wox with a standard user account, not an administrator.
            *   Keep the system and software updated.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Plugin Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_plugin_dependencies.md)

* **Threat:** Vulnerable Plugin Dependencies

    * **Description:** The Wox plugin uses third-party libraries that contain security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be exploited, even if the plugin's own code is secure. This is a direct risk because Wox plugins can freely include dependencies.
    * **Impact:**
        *   Code execution: Vulnerabilities in dependencies could lead to arbitrary code execution.
        *   Data breach.
        *   Application compromise.
    * **Affected Wox Component:** The plugin's code and its included dependencies (e.g., Python packages). Wox's plugin architecture allows for the inclusion of these dependencies.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:**
            *   Regularly audit and update all plugin dependencies.
            *   Use dependency management tools.
            *   Use vulnerability scanning tools.
        * **User:**
            *   No direct user mitigation (developer responsibility).
