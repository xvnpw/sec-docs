# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for wox-launcher/wox

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Permission System (Requires Wox Modification)](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_permission_system__requires_wox_modification_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Design a Permission Model:** Define granular permissions that Wox plugins can request (e.g., `filesystem.read:path/to/allowed/dir`, `network.connect:example.com`, `process.execute`).
2.  **Modify Wox Core:**  This is the core of the mitigation.  Modify Wox's source code to:
    *   Intercept system calls made by plugins.
    *   Check if the plugin has the required permission before allowing the call to proceed.
    *   Implement a secure way to store and manage plugin permissions (e.g., a database or configuration file).
3.  **Plugin Manifest:**  Require plugins to declare their required permissions in a structured format (e.g., a JSON or YAML file) within the plugin package.  Wox will read this manifest during plugin installation.
4.  **User Interface (Within Wox):**  Modify Wox's UI to:
    *   Display the requested permissions to the user *before* installation.
    *   Provide clear, understandable descriptions of each permission.
    *   Allow the user to grant or deny individual permissions, or reject the plugin entirely.
    *   Optionally, allow the user to modify permissions after installation.
5.  **Runtime Enforcement:**  Ensure that the permission checks are performed *every time* a plugin attempts a restricted action.  This must be robust and resistant to bypass attempts.
6. **Sandboxing Integration (Optional, Highly Recommended):** If possible, integrate the permission system with a sandboxing technology (e.g., containers, VMs) to provide an additional layer of isolation. This would involve modifying Wox to launch plugins within the sandbox and configuring the sandbox to enforce the defined permissions.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Malicious Plugins:** (Severity: High) - Limits the damage a malicious plugin can inflict by restricting its access to system resources.
*   **Data Leakage Through Plugins:** (Severity: Medium to High) - Prevents plugins from accessing sensitive data they don't explicitly have permission to access.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Plugins:** (Severity: Medium) - Can limit resource consumption (CPU, memory, network) by restricting plugin capabilities.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirectly via Plugins):** (Severity: High) - Significantly reduces the ability of a plugin to exploit system vulnerabilities by limiting its access to privileged operations.

**Impact:**
*   **Malicious Plugins:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., 70-90% reduction).
*   **Data Leakage:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., 60-80% reduction).
*   **DoS:** Risk moderately reduced (e.g., 40-60% reduction).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., 70-90% reduction).

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - Likely Not Implemented)
*   Not implemented. This requires substantial modification of the Wox codebase.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example)
*   Entirely missing. This is a major architectural change to Wox.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Wox Updated (Using Wox's Built-in Features)](./mitigation_strategies/keep_wox_updated__using_wox's_built-in_features_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Access Wox Settings:** Open Wox and navigate to its settings menu (usually accessible via a gear icon or a right-click on the Wox icon in the system tray).
2.  **Enable Automatic Updates:**  Locate the update settings and ensure that the option for automatic updates is enabled.  This is typically a checkbox or a dropdown menu.
3.  **Configure Update Frequency (If Available):**  If Wox allows it, configure how often it checks for updates (e.g., daily, weekly).
4.  **Manual Update Check (Optional, but Recommended):** Even with automatic updates enabled, periodically perform a manual update check within Wox's settings. This ensures you're getting the latest version as soon as possible.
5. **Restart Wox:** After an update, Wox may need to be restarted for the changes to take effect.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exploitation of Wox Core Vulnerabilities:** (Severity: Medium to High) - Addresses security vulnerabilities in the Wox application itself that could be exploited by attackers.

**Impact:**
*   **Wox Core Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., 70-90% reduction, assuming timely updates are applied).

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - Adjust to your project)
*   Wox's automatic update feature is enabled.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - Adjust to your project)
*   Regular manual checks for updates are not consistently performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation within Wox (If Modifying Wox or Building a Plugin)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_within_wox__if_modifying_wox_or_building_a_plugin_.md)

**Description:**
1. **Identify Input Points:** Determine all points where Wox (or your plugin) receives input, including:
    * User queries typed into the Wox search bar.
    * Data received from external sources (e.g., APIs, files).
    * Configuration settings.
2. **Implement Validation Checks:** For each input point, implement checks to ensure that the input conforms to expected formats and constraints. This includes:
    * **Type checking:** Verify that the input is of the correct data type (e.g., string, integer, boolean).
    * **Length restrictions:** Limit the length of input strings to prevent buffer overflows.
    * **Character whitelisting/blacklisting:** Allow only specific characters or disallow known dangerous characters (e.g., to prevent injection attacks).
    * **Format validation:** Ensure that the input matches expected patterns (e.g., email addresses, URLs).
    * **Range checks:** For numeric input, verify that it falls within acceptable ranges.
3. **Sanitization:** If input cannot be strictly validated, sanitize it to remove or escape potentially dangerous characters. This is a fallback to validation, not a replacement.
4. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle invalid input. Avoid displaying detailed error messages to the user that could reveal information about the application's internal workings.
5. **Regular Expression (Regex) Usage (Careful):** Use regular expressions for validation, but be mindful of ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerabilities. Ensure regexes are well-crafted and tested.

**Threats Mitigated:**
* **Exploitation of Wox Core Vulnerabilities (Injection Attacks):** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code or commands into Wox through crafted input.
* **Denial of Service (DoS) via Wox:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents malformed input from causing Wox to crash or become unresponsive.

**Impact:**
* **Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., 80-95% reduction).
* **DoS:** Risk moderately reduced (e.g., 40-60% reduction).

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - Likely Partially Implemented in Wox Core)
* Wox likely has *some* input validation, but it may not be comprehensive or robust against all types of attacks. Plugins likely have varying levels of input validation.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - Depends on Specific Wox Code and Plugins)
* Comprehensive input validation checks at all input points.
* Robust error handling for invalid input.
* Careful review of regular expression usage.
* Thorough testing for injection vulnerabilities.
