Okay, let's create a design document for the Wox launcher project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Wox is a free and open-source launcher for Windows. It aims to provide a fast and efficient way for users to find and launch applications, files, and other resources on their system. It also supports plugins to extend its functionality.

Priorities:

-   User Experience: Provide a seamless and responsive user experience.
-   Extensibility: Allow developers to easily create and integrate plugins.
-   Performance: Minimize resource usage (CPU, memory) and maintain high performance.
-   Stability: Ensure the application is stable and reliable.
-   Community: Foster a community around the project for contributions and support.

Goals:

-   Become a popular alternative to the built-in Windows search and other launcher applications.
-   Provide a platform for developers to create useful extensions.
-   Maintain a high level of user satisfaction.

Business Risks:

-   Loss of user trust due to security vulnerabilities (e.g., arbitrary code execution through plugins).
-   Reputational damage from instability or poor performance.
-   Competition from other launcher applications.
-   Lack of community engagement and contributions.
-   Inability to keep up with changes in the Windows operating system.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

-   security control: The project is open-source, allowing for community review of the codebase. (GitHub repository)
-   security control: Wox uses a plugin architecture, which can potentially isolate plugin failures. (Plugin architecture documentation)
-   security control: Wox is written in C#, a memory-safe language, reducing the risk of memory corruption vulnerabilities.

Accepted Risks:

-   accepted risk: Third-party plugins may introduce security vulnerabilities. The project relies on plugin developers to follow secure coding practices.
-   accepted risk: The application runs with the same privileges as the logged-in user.

Recommended Security Controls:

-   security control: Implement a plugin signing mechanism to verify the authenticity and integrity of plugins.
-   security control: Sandboxing for plugins: Explore options for running plugins in a sandboxed environment to limit their access to the system. Consider using technologies like Windows AppContainers.
-   security control: Regular security audits of the core Wox application.
-   security control: Implement a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
-   security control: Provide clear security guidelines for plugin developers.

Security Requirements:

-   Authentication: Not directly applicable, as Wox runs in the context of the logged-in user.
-   Authorization:
    -   Wox should only access files and resources that the user has permission to access.
    -   Plugins should have limited permissions by default, and users should be able to control plugin permissions.
-   Input Validation:
    -   Wox should properly validate user input to prevent injection attacks.
    -   Plugin input should be carefully validated to prevent vulnerabilities.
-   Cryptography:
    -   If Wox stores sensitive data (e.g., API keys for plugins), it should be encrypted at rest.
    -   Secure communication channels (HTTPS) should be used when interacting with external services.

7.  Build artifacts (the installer) are created.
8.  The artifacts are published as a GitHub Release.

Security Controls in Build Process:

-   security control: Version control (Git) provides an audit trail of code changes.
-   security control: Build automation (GitHub Actions) ensures a consistent and repeatable build process.
-   security control: Unit and integration tests help to identify bugs and vulnerabilities early.
-   security control: Code signing of the installer (recommended) to verify its authenticity.
-   security control: Static analysis security testing (SAST) can be integrated into the build process to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code. (Recommended)
-   security control: Dependency scanning can be used to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. (Recommended)

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

-   Application Launching: The core functionality of Wox is to launch applications quickly and efficiently.
-   File Searching: Users rely on Wox to find files on their system.
-   Plugin Execution: Plugins extend the functionality of Wox and are a key part of the user experience.

Data to Protect:

-   User Queries (Low Sensitivity): Wox processes user queries, which may contain sensitive information (e.g., file paths, search terms).  While not stored permanently, they are transiently in memory.
-   Plugin Data (Variable Sensitivity): Plugins may handle sensitive data, such as API keys or personal information. The sensitivity depends on the specific plugin.
-   Configuration Data (Low-Medium Sensitivity): Wox stores configuration data, which may include user preferences and plugin settings.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

-   What specific web services do the most popular Wox plugins interact with? This will help to assess the risks associated with those plugins.
-   Are there any plans to monetize Wox in the future? This could impact the business risks and security priorities.
-   What is the current process for handling user-reported bugs and security vulnerabilities?
-   What level of logging is currently implemented in Wox?
-   Is there any existing documentation for plugin developers, particularly regarding security best practices?

Assumptions:

-   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a free and open-source tool, with user experience and community engagement being high priorities.
-   SECURITY POSTURE: The project relies heavily on the security of the underlying Windows operating system and the responsibility of plugin developers.
-   DESIGN: The current architecture is relatively simple, with a focus on extensibility through plugins. The use of C# provides some inherent security benefits. The deployment method is assumed to be a standard Windows installer.
