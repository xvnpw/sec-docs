# Threat Model Analysis for wox-launcher/wox

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Installation
*   **Description:** An attacker could trick a user into installing a malicious Wox plugin. This plugin, once installed, could perform actions like stealing credentials, logging keystrokes, installing malware, or gaining persistent access to the user's system. The attacker might distribute the plugin through unofficial channels, forums, or even compromised websites.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability. Sensitive data theft, system compromise, data corruption, system instability.
*   **Wox Component Affected:** Plugin loading mechanism, plugin execution environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **User Education:** Educate users to only install plugins from trusted sources and to be wary of plugins from unknown developers.
    *   **Plugin Sandboxing (Application Level):** If feasible, implement application-level sandboxing or restrictions on plugin capabilities.
    *   **Plugin Whitelisting/Curated Store (Application Level):**  If possible, maintain a curated list or store of approved and vetted plugins.
    *   **Code Review (For Plugin Developers):** Plugin developers should conduct thorough code reviews and security testing of their plugins.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Plugin Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_plugin_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable Plugin Exploitation
*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit security vulnerabilities present in a poorly coded or outdated Wox plugin. This could be achieved through various methods depending on the vulnerability type, such as sending crafted input to the plugin, triggering specific plugin functionalities, or exploiting known vulnerabilities in plugin dependencies. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the Wox process or the application using Wox.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability. System compromise, data breach, denial of service, privilege escalation (potentially).
*   **Wox Component Affected:** Plugin execution environment, specific plugin code.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Plugin Updates:** Encourage users to keep their plugins updated to the latest versions.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning (For Plugin Developers):** Plugin developers should use vulnerability scanning tools to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (For Plugin Developers):** Plugin developers must implement robust input validation and sanitization within their plugin code.
    *   **Security Audits (Application Level):** Periodically audit the security of commonly used or critical plugins.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Wox Input](./threats/command_injection_via_wox_input.md)

*   **Threat:** Command Injection via Wox Input
*   **Description:** If an application using Wox takes user input directly from Wox (e.g., search queries, commands) and executes system commands based on this input without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious commands into the input. Wox's interface allows for command-like input, making it a potential vector for command injection if not handled carefully by the application.
*   **Impact:** Integrity, Availability, Confidentiality (potentially). Arbitrary command execution, system compromise, data manipulation, data exfiltration.
*   **Wox Component Affected:** Wox input processing, application's input handling logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation (Application Level):**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all input received from Wox before using it in any system command execution or sensitive operations.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Application Level):** Run the application and Wox processes with the minimum necessary privileges.
    *   **Avoid Direct Command Execution (Application Level):** If possible, avoid directly executing system commands based on user input.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Wox Input](./threats/path_traversal_via_wox_input.md)

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via Wox Input
*   **Description:** If an application uses file paths or directory paths derived from Wox input without proper validation, an attacker could use path traversal techniques (e.g., using "../") in the input to access files or directories outside of the intended scope. This could allow unauthorized access to sensitive files or directories on the system.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality, Integrity. Unauthorized file access, data leakage, potential data modification.
*   **Wox Component Affected:** Wox input processing, application's file path handling logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Application Level):** Validate and sanitize all file paths received from Wox input.
    *   **Canonicalization (Application Level):** Canonicalize file paths to resolve symbolic links and ".." sequences.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Application Level):** Run the application with minimal file system permissions.
