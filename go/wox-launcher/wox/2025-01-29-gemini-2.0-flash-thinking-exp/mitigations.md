## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Sandboxing and Isolation (Wox-Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_sandboxing_and_isolation__wox-focused_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Investigate Wox Isolation Features:** Thoroughly research the Wox documentation and codebase to identify any built-in mechanisms for plugin isolation. This could include process separation, permission restrictions, or API limitations imposed by Wox on plugins.
    2.  **Leverage Wox Isolation Capabilities:** If Wox provides any isolation features, configure and utilize them to the maximum extent possible. This might involve setting specific configuration options or using Wox APIs in a way that enforces isolation.
    3.  **Request Isolation Features from Wox Project:** If Wox lacks sufficient isolation features, consider contributing to the Wox open-source project by proposing and implementing enhanced plugin sandboxing and isolation mechanisms.
    4.  **Document Wox Isolation Limitations:** Clearly document the limitations of Wox's plugin isolation capabilities for developers and users, highlighting any remaining risks.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Plugin Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Limits the ability of a compromised plugin to gain elevated privileges *within the Wox environment* if Wox enforces isolation.
        *   **Cross-Plugin Interference (Medium Severity):** Prevents malicious or buggy plugins from interfering with other plugins or the core Wox application *if Wox provides process or resource separation*.
        *   **System-Wide Compromise from Plugin (High Severity):** Reduces the impact of a compromised plugin from affecting the entire system *to the extent that Wox's isolation mechanisms are effective*.

    *   **Impact:** Impact is directly tied to the effectiveness of Wox's isolation features (if any).  Potential for High Reduction if Wox offers robust isolation, otherwise limited.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**  Unknown. Requires investigation of Wox codebase and documentation to determine existing isolation features.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Potentially missing if Wox lacks built-in isolation. Implementation would involve modifying Wox core or plugin framework.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Permission Management (Wox-Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_permission_management__wox-focused_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Wox Plugin API and Capabilities:**  Examine the Wox plugin API to understand what system resources and functionalities plugins can access through Wox.
    2.  **Design Wox-Level Permission Control (if feasible):** If Wox's architecture allows, design and implement a permission control system *within Wox itself*. This could involve defining permission levels, requiring plugins to declare permissions, and providing a UI for users to manage plugin permissions *within the Wox application*.
    3.  **Restrict Wox Plugin API Access (if necessary):** If direct permission control within Wox is not feasible, consider modifying the Wox plugin API to restrict access to sensitive system functionalities by default.  Require explicit actions or configurations for plugins to access more privileged APIs.
    4.  **Document Wox Plugin Permissions:** Clearly document the permissions that Wox plugins inherently have and any limitations or controls that are in place.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Exfiltration by Plugins (High Severity):** Prevents plugins from accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data *through Wox APIs* if Wox enforces permission controls.
        *   **Unauthorized System Access by Plugins (Medium Severity):** Limits plugins' ability to perform unauthorized actions on the system *via Wox functionalities* if Wox restricts API access.
        *   **Privacy Violations by Plugins (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of plugins collecting and misusing user data *through Wox interfaces* if Wox manages permissions.

    *   **Impact:** Impact is dependent on Wox's architecture and the feasibility of implementing permission control within Wox. Potential for High Reduction if Wox can be modified to manage permissions effectively.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented. Wox likely does not have a built-in permission management system.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Requires significant development effort to design and implement a permission management system *within the Wox core or plugin framework*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Plugin Update Mechanism (Wox-Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_plugin_update_mechanism__wox-focused_.md)

    3.  **Implement Update Notifications within Wox:** Ensure Wox provides clear notifications to users about available plugin updates and allows them to control the update process *within the Wox UI*.
    4.  **Fallback Mechanism in Wox Updates:** If Wox's update process is prone to errors, implement a robust fallback mechanism *within Wox* to prevent corrupted updates and ensure stability.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks during Plugin Updates (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and modifying plugin updates *downloaded through Wox's mechanism*.
        *   **Tampered Plugin Updates (High Severity):** Ensures that plugin updates *processed by Wox* are authentic and haven't been tampered with.
        *   **Installation of Malicious Updates (High Severity):** Prevents the installation of fake or malicious plugin updates *if Wox implements verification*.

    *   **Impact:** High Reduction for all listed threats if Wox's update mechanism is secured and enhanced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. HTTPS for downloads might be used if configured externally, but signature verification and robust update management within Wox are likely missing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Requires enhancing Wox's update mechanism with signature verification and improved user control.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization for Query Bar Input (Wox-Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_for_query_bar_input__wox-focused_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Input Sanitization in Wox Core:** Modify the Wox core codebase to include robust input sanitization and validation for all user input received through the query bar *before* it is passed to plugins or command execution logic.
    2.  **Wox Input Validation Rules:** Define strict validation rules *within Wox* for query bar input, considering allowed characters, formats, and potential injection vectors.
    3.  **Parameterized Commands in Wox Core:**  Where Wox core directly executes commands based on query bar input, refactor the code to use parameterized commands or prepared statements *within Wox* to prevent command injection.
    4.  **Wox Allowlist for Core Commands:** If Wox core has built-in commands, implement an allowlist of explicitly allowed commands and arguments *within Wox* to restrict execution to safe operations.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Command Injection via Query Bar (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary commands into the system *through the Wox query bar, by sanitizing input within Wox itself*.
        *   **Path Traversal via Query Bar (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers using the query bar to access files or directories outside of intended paths *by validating paths within Wox*.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Input (Low Severity):** Prevents malformed or excessively long input *processed by Wox* from causing crashes or performance issues.

    *   **Impact:** High Reduction for Command Injection, Medium Reduction for Path Traversal, Low Reduction for DoS, all achieved by modifications *within Wox*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Least Privilege Command Execution (Wox-Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/least_privilege_command_execution__wox-focused_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Run Wox Process as Standard User:** Ensure the Wox application itself is configured to run under a standard user account with minimal privileges. This is a configuration step for Wox deployment.
    2.  **Restrict Wox Process Capabilities (OS-Level):** Utilize operating system level security features (like capabilities, AppArmor, SELinux) to further restrict the privileges of the Wox process. This is a deployment and configuration step for Wox.
    3.  **Wox Plugin Privilege Separation:** If Wox architecture allows, implement a mechanism *within Wox* to run plugins with even more restricted privileges than the main Wox process.
    4.  **Avoid SUID/SGID for Wox Binaries:** Ensure that the Wox executable and any related binaries are *not* set with SUID or SGID bits unless absolutely necessary and after rigorous security review. This is a build and deployment consideration for Wox.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Privilege Escalation after Compromise (High Severity):** Limits the damage an attacker can do if they compromise Wox or a plugin, as the compromised process will have limited privileges *due to Wox running with least privilege*.
        *   **System-Wide Impact of Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Reduces the potential for vulnerabilities in Wox or plugins to lead to system-wide compromise *because Wox itself is not running with elevated privileges*.
        *   **Lateral Movement after Compromise (Medium Severity):** Makes it harder for an attacker to move laterally to other parts of the system after compromising Wox *due to limited Wox process privileges*.

    *   **Impact:** High Reduction for Privilege Escalation and System-Wide Impact, Medium Reduction for Lateral Movement, all achieved by configuring and deploying Wox with least privilege principles.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Running as standard user is common, but OS-level capability restrictions and plugin privilege separation within Wox are likely missing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Requires configuration and deployment steps to run Wox as standard user and restrict process capabilities. Plugin privilege separation would require Wox code modifications.

    3.  **Directory Allowlisting in Wox:** Implement a directory allowlisting mechanism *within Wox* to explicitly define allowed directories that Wox and plugins can access.
    4.  **Path Normalization in Wox Core:** Ensure Wox core performs path normalization to resolve symbolic links and remove redundant path components, preventing bypasses of path restrictions.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Path Traversal Attacks (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from accessing files or directories outside of their intended scope *through Wox's path handling*.
        *   **Unauthorized File Access (Medium Severity):** Limits the ability of Wox or plugins to access sensitive files or directories on the system *due to Wox-enforced path restrictions*.
        *   **Data Leakage through File Access (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of sensitive data being leaked through unauthorized file access *controlled by Wox's path management*.

    *   **Impact:** Medium Reduction for all listed threats, achieved by modifying Wox core to handle paths securely.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Some basic path handling might exist, but comprehensive sanitization, normalization, and directory allowlisting are likely not fully implemented *within Wox core*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Requires code modifications to Wox core to implement robust path sanitization, validation, normalization, and directory allowlisting.
