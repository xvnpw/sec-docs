# Attack Surface Analysis for wox-launcher/wox

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Search Queries Leading to Unintended Execution](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_search_queries_leading_to_unintended_execution.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts a search query that, when processed by Wox, triggers unintended actions or commands, potentially within the application or the underlying system.
    * **How Wox Contributes:** Wox acts as the primary interface for user input that triggers actions. Its interpretation and handling of these queries are central to this attack surface.
    * **Example:** A user types a search query that leverages a Wox feature or plugin to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
    * **Impact:**  Potentially arbitrary command execution on the user's system, data loss, system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-provided search queries *before* they are processed by Wox or used to trigger actions. Avoid directly executing commands based on Wox output without careful validation.
        * **Users:** Be cautious about the source of Wox plugins and the commands they might execute based on search queries. Review plugin permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Wox Plugins](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_wox_plugins.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit security flaws within Wox plugins to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code within the context of the Wox process.
    * **How Wox Contributes:** Wox's plugin architecture is the direct mechanism through which these third-party components are integrated and executed.
    * **Example:** A vulnerable plugin could be tricked into executing arbitrary code by sending it a specially crafted search query or by exploiting an API vulnerability in the plugin itself.
    * **Impact:**  Code execution within the context of the Wox process, potentially leading to access to user data, system compromise, or further attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  Carefully vet and select Wox plugins from trusted sources. Implement a mechanism to update plugins regularly. Consider sandboxing or isolating plugins to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
        * **Users:** Only install plugins from trusted sources. Keep plugins updated to the latest versions. Be aware of the permissions requested by plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Wox Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_wox_configuration_files.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gains write access to Wox's configuration files and modifies them to alter its behavior for malicious purposes.
    * **How Wox Contributes:** Wox relies directly on these configuration files to define its settings, available actions, and potentially loaded plugins.
    * **Example:** An attacker could modify the configuration to redirect specific search queries to execute malicious scripts or add malicious plugins that are then loaded by Wox.
    * **Impact:**  Redirection of actions, execution of arbitrary commands via Wox, installation of malicious plugins, information disclosure.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Ensure that Wox's configuration files are stored in secure locations with appropriate file system permissions, preventing unauthorized write access. Avoid storing sensitive information in plain text within configuration files.
        * **Users:** Ensure your user account has appropriate permissions and that unauthorized users do not have access to your user profile where Wox configuration files might be stored.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation through Wox (If Running with Elevated Privileges)](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation_through_wox__if_running_with_elevated_privileges_.md)

* **Description:** If Wox itself runs with elevated privileges, vulnerabilities within Wox or its plugins could be leveraged to gain unauthorized system access with those elevated privileges.
    * **How Wox Contributes:** Wox's execution context and the privileges it operates under directly determine the potential impact of vulnerabilities within it.
    * **Example:** A command injection vulnerability in Wox, when running with admin privileges, could allow an attacker to execute commands with admin rights.
    * **Impact:**  Full system compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  Adhere to the principle of least privilege. Run Wox with the minimum necessary privileges. Isolate Wox processes if possible.
        * **Users:** Be cautious about running applications or components with elevated privileges unless absolutely necessary.
