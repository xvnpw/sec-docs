# Threat Model Analysis for wox-launcher/wox

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

* **Description:** An attacker convinces a user to install a malicious Wox plugin from an untrusted source. The attacker leverages the plugin system to execute arbitrary code within the Wox process or with the user's privileges, steal sensitive data handled by Wox or accessible through it, monitor user activity within Wox, or perform other malicious actions directly through the plugin's capabilities.
* **Impact:** Full system compromise, data theft (credentials, personal files used with Wox), installation of malware (potentially through plugin execution), privacy violation related to Wox usage.
* **Affected Wox Component:** Plugin System (plugin loading, execution environment, plugin API).
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **User Education:** Emphasize the risks of installing plugins from untrusted sources.
    * **Plugin Sandboxing (Future Enhancement):** Implement a robust sandboxing mechanism for plugins to restrict their access to system resources and Wox internals.
    * **Plugin Verification/Signing (Future Enhancement):** Introduce a system for verifying the authenticity and integrity of plugins.
    * **Clear Plugin Permissions:** Clearly display the permissions requested by a plugin before installation.
    * **Regularly Review Installed Plugins:** Encourage users to periodically review and remove unnecessary or suspicious plugins.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Wox Core](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_wox_core.md)

* **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a security vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, injection flaw) within the core Wox application code. This exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the Wox process, potentially allowing the attacker to gain control of the application and the user's system.
* **Impact:** Full system compromise, denial of service of Wox, data breaches involving data handled by Wox, privilege escalation within the Wox process.
* **Affected Wox Component:** Various core modules (depending on the specific vulnerability, e.g., input parsing, rendering, update mechanism, core search functionality).
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Wox codebase.
    * **Secure Coding Practices:** Adhere to secure coding practices during development to minimize vulnerabilities.
    * **Dependency Management:** Keep all third-party libraries and dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * **Address Reported Vulnerabilities Promptly:** Actively monitor for and promptly address reported security vulnerabilities.
    * **Automatic Updates:** Implement a robust and secure automatic update mechanism to ensure users are running the latest version with security fixes.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Malicious Wox Queries](./threats/command_injection_via_malicious_wox_queries.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious Wox query that, when processed by a vulnerable plugin or the core Wox functionality (if it directly executes commands based on user input without proper sanitization), allows the execution of arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges of the user running Wox.
* **Impact:** System compromise, data manipulation accessible to the user, unauthorized access to system resources, execution of malicious scripts or programs.
* **Affected Wox Component:** Input processing within the core or specific plugins, potentially the command execution module (if present and vulnerable).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for all user-provided input, especially before executing any system commands.
    * **Avoid Direct Command Execution:** Minimize or avoid directly executing operating system commands based on user input. If necessary, use parameterized commands or safer alternatives.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure Wox and its plugins run with the minimum necessary privileges.
    * **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential command injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Wox Queries or Plugins](./threats/path_traversal_via_wox_queries_or_plugins.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts a Wox query or exploits a vulnerability in a plugin that allows them to access files and directories outside of the intended scope accessible by the Wox process. This could involve manipulating file paths to read sensitive configuration files, system files, or user data that Wox has access to.
* **Impact:** Information disclosure of files accessible to the Wox process, potential for further exploitation based on revealed information.
* **Affected Wox Component:** File access mechanisms within the core or specific plugins, input processing related to file paths.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict Input Validation for File Paths:** Implement robust validation and sanitization for any user-provided input used in file path construction within Wox or its plugins.
    * **Restrict File System Access:** Limit the file system access of Wox and its plugins to only the necessary directories.
    * **Avoid Constructing Paths from User Input:** Avoid directly constructing file paths from user input within Wox. Use whitelisting or predefined paths instead.

## Threat: [Insecure Update Mechanism](./threats/insecure_update_mechanism.md)

* **Description:** An attacker intercepts the Wox update process (e.g., through a man-in-the-middle attack) and injects a malicious update containing malware or backdoors that will be executed with the user's privileges when Wox is updated.
* **Impact:** System compromise, installation of malware, long-term persistence of attackers through a compromised Wox installation.
* **Affected Wox Component:** Update mechanism, communication with update servers.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **HTTPS for Updates:** Ensure all communication with update servers is done over HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.
    * **Code Signing:** Digitally sign Wox updates to verify their authenticity and integrity.
    * **Public Key Pinning (Future Enhancement):** Implement public key pinning to further secure communication with update servers.
    * **Automatic Update Verification:** Verify the signature of downloaded updates before installation.
