# Attack Surface Analysis for wox-launcher/wox

## Attack Surface: [Execution of arbitrary code through malicious plugins.](./attack_surfaces/execution_of_arbitrary_code_through_malicious_plugins.md)

*   **How Wox Contributes:** Wox's plugin architecture allows users to install third-party plugins, which can execute code within the Wox process.
*   **Example:** A user installs a plugin advertised as a system utility, but it contains code that exfiltrates sensitive data or installs malware.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, malware infection.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement a plugin sandboxing mechanism to restrict plugin access to system resources. Provide clear guidelines and security requirements for plugin developers. Implement a plugin signing and verification process.
    *   **Users:** Only install plugins from trusted sources. Review plugin permissions and capabilities before installation. Keep Wox and plugins updated.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of vulnerabilities within plugins.](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_within_plugins.md)

*   **How Wox Contributes:** Wox relies on the security of its plugin ecosystem. Vulnerabilities in individual plugins can be exploited by attackers.
*   **Example:** A popular plugin has a vulnerability that allows remote code execution when a specific search query is used.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially the same as malicious plugins, ranging from data theft to system compromise, depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Encourage plugin developers to follow secure coding practices and conduct security audits. Provide a mechanism for reporting and patching plugin vulnerabilities. Implement automatic plugin updates.
    *   **Users:** Keep plugins updated. Be cautious about installing plugins that are no longer maintained or have known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Command injection through search results or plugin actions.](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_through_search_results_or_plugin_actions.md)

*   **How Wox Contributes:** If Wox or its plugins directly execute commands based on user input from search queries or plugin actions without proper sanitization, it can lead to command injection.
*   **Example:** A plugin allows users to execute system commands via a search keyword. An attacker crafts a malicious search query to execute arbitrary commands on the user's system.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Never directly execute commands based on unsanitized user input. Use secure APIs and libraries for system interactions. Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data.
    *   **Users:** Be cautious about plugins that offer direct command execution functionality.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-middle attacks during Wox or plugin updates.](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle_attacks_during_wox_or_plugin_updates.md)

*   **How Wox Contributes:** If Wox or its plugins use insecure update mechanisms (e.g., HTTP without proper certificate validation), attackers can intercept and modify update packages.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts an update request for Wox and injects malicious code into the update package, which is then installed by the user.
*   **Impact:** Installation of malware, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement secure update mechanisms using HTTPS with proper certificate validation. Sign update packages to ensure integrity.
    *   **Users:** Ensure Wox and plugins are configured to use secure update channels. Be wary of update prompts that seem suspicious.
