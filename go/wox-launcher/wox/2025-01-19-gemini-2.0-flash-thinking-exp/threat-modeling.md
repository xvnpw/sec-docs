# Threat Model Analysis for wox-launcher/wox

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation - Arbitrary Code Execution](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation_-_arbitrary_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker could trick a user into installing a malicious Wox plugin. Upon installation and execution, this plugin could execute arbitrary code on the user's system with the privileges of the Wox process. This could involve stealing sensitive data, installing malware, or gaining complete control over the user's machine.

**Impact:** Critical - Full system compromise, data breach, malware infection.

**Affected Component:** Wox Plugin System, specifically the plugin execution environment.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developers:** Implement a robust plugin verification and signing mechanism within Wox. Provide clear warnings to users about installing third-party plugins. Consider sandboxing plugin execution.
*   **Users:** Only install plugins from trusted sources. Carefully review plugin permissions and descriptions before installation. Regularly update Wox and installed plugins.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Plugin Exploitation - Data Access/Code Execution](./threats/vulnerable_plugin_exploitation_-_data_accesscode_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit a security vulnerability within a seemingly legitimate Wox plugin. This could allow them to access sensitive data handled by the plugin or, in more severe cases, execute arbitrary code on the user's system through the plugin's vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** High - Data breach, potential system compromise depending on the vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** Specific Wox Plugins containing vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developers:** Encourage plugin developers to follow secure coding practices and conduct security audits. Provide mechanisms for reporting and patching plugin vulnerabilities.
*   **Users:** Keep installed plugins up-to-date. Be cautious about installing plugins from unknown or unverified developers. Monitor plugin activity if possible.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Wox Search Bar](./threats/command_injection_via_wox_search_bar.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious input string that, when entered into the Wox search bar, is not properly sanitized by Wox or a plugin. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the Wox process. For example, an attacker might try to execute commands to access files, modify system settings, or launch other applications.

**Impact:** High - Potential system compromise, data manipulation, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Wox Core Search Functionality, potentially affected plugins handling search queries.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user input in Wox and its core functionalities. Avoid directly executing shell commands based on user input. Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives.
*   **Users:** Be cautious about copying and pasting commands directly into the Wox search bar from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [Insecure Update Mechanism - Man-in-the-Middle Attack](./threats/insecure_update_mechanism_-_man-in-the-middle_attack.md)

**Description:** If Wox's update mechanism is not secure, an attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack during the update process. This could allow them to intercept the update download and replace it with a malicious version of Wox, potentially compromising the user's system upon installation.

**Impact:** High - Installation of malware or compromised software.

**Affected Component:** Wox Update Mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developers:** Use HTTPS for update downloads. Implement code signing to verify the integrity and authenticity of updates.
*   **Users:** Ensure a secure network connection when updating Wox.
