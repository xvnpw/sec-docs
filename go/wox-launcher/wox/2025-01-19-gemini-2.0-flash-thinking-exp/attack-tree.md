## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

This node is critical because Wox's plugin architecture introduces a significant attack surface. Plugins are often developed by third parties and may contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited to compromise the application or the user's system. Successful exploitation at this node can lead to arbitrary code execution, data access, and other severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Install Malicious Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__install_malicious_plugin.md)

**Social Engineering the User:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker tricks the user into installing a malicious plugin from an untrusted source. This could involve:
        *   Creating a fake plugin with enticing functionality that actually contains malware.
        *   Impersonating a legitimate plugin developer or organization.
        *   Using phishing techniques to direct users to malicious download links.
        *   Exploiting user trust or lack of technical knowledge.
    *   **Impact:**  Installation of a malicious plugin can grant the attacker full control over Wox's functionality and potentially the user's system, depending on the plugin's permissions.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Educate users about the risks of installing plugins from untrusted sources.
        *   Implement a plugin verification or signing mechanism.
        *   Provide a secure and official plugin marketplace.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerability in an Existing Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerability_in_an_existing_plugin.md)

**Identify a Vulnerable Plugin:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker researches publicly known vulnerabilities in popular Wox plugins or actively searches for new vulnerabilities through techniques like code analysis or fuzzing.
    *   **Impact:** Identifying a vulnerable plugin provides the attacker with a potential entry point to exploit.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Maintain an inventory of installed plugins.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories for known plugin vulnerabilities.
        *   Encourage users to keep plugins updated.
*   **Trigger the Vulnerability:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts specific inputs or interacts with the vulnerable plugin in a way that triggers the flaw. This could involve:
        *   **Craft a specific search query that triggers the vulnerability:**  Sending a specially crafted search query to Wox that is processed by the vulnerable plugin, leading to code execution or other malicious actions.
        *   **Interact with the plugin in a way that exploits the flaw:**  Using the plugin's features or interfaces in an unexpected way to trigger a buffer overflow, injection vulnerability, or other flaw.
        *   **If the plugin has network access, trigger the vulnerability remotely:**  Exploiting a network-facing vulnerability in the plugin to compromise the system remotely.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, denial of service, or other malicious outcomes, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization in plugins.
        *   Follow secure coding practices during plugin development.
        *   Conduct security audits and penetration testing of plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Command Injection via Search Query](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_command_injection_via_search_query.md)

**Identify a Wox Feature that Executes Commands:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker identifies a core Wox feature or a plugin that allows the execution of shell commands based on user input provided in the search query. This could be an intentional feature or a vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  The presence of such a feature, if not properly secured, creates a direct pathway for command injection attacks.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Minimize or eliminate features that directly execute shell commands based on user input.
        *   If such features are necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization.
        *   Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to system calls.
*   **Craft a Malicious Search Query:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a search query containing shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `&`, `|`, `$()`) or other techniques to inject malicious commands that will be executed by the vulnerable feature.
    *   **Impact:** Successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the user's system with the privileges of the Wox process, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Sanitize user input to remove or escape shell metacharacters.
        *   Use a whitelist approach for allowed characters in search queries.
        *   Run Wox with the least necessary privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Insecure Update Mechanism (Wox or Plugins)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_insecure_update_mechanism__wox_or_plugins_.md)

**Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on Update Process:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker intercepts the communication between Wox (or a plugin) and the update server. This can be achieved by compromising the user's network or using techniques like ARP spoofing or DNS poisoning. Once intercepted, the attacker serves a malicious update instead of the legitimate one.
    *   **Impact:**  The user installs a compromised version of Wox or a plugin containing malware, backdoors, or other malicious code, granting the attacker persistent access or control.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use HTTPS for all update communication.
        *   Implement certificate pinning to prevent MitM attacks.
        *   Ensure the update server infrastructure is secure.
*   **Exploit Vulnerability in Update Verification:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits a weakness in how Wox or its plugins verify the integrity of updates. This could involve:
        *   Weak or missing cryptographic signature checks.
        *   Using insecure hashing algorithms.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the update client itself.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can provide a malicious update that appears legitimate, leading to the installation of malware or backdoors.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement strong cryptographic signature verification for all updates.
        *   Use secure hashing algorithms.
        *   Regularly audit the update mechanism for vulnerabilities.
