# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for wox-launcher/wox

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Plugin Sandboxing for Wox Plugins](./mitigation_strategies/implement_plugin_sandboxing_for_wox_plugins.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Wox Plugin Execution:** Investigate how Wox currently executes plugins. Determine if plugins run within the main Wox process or in isolated processes.
    2.  **Integrate Sandboxing Technology:** Choose a suitable sandboxing technology compatible with Wox's architecture and target operating systems (e.g., OS-level sandboxing, containerization).
    3.  **Define Wox Plugin Sandbox Policies:**  Establish restrictive policies for plugin sandboxes, limiting access to:
        *   File system: Restrict access to only necessary directories, preventing plugins from accessing sensitive user data or system files outside designated plugin data folders.
        *   Network: Control network access, potentially allowing only outbound connections to specific domains or disabling network access by default.
        *   System Calls: Limit access to potentially dangerous system calls.
        *   Inter-Process Communication (IPC): Restrict IPC capabilities to prevent plugins from interfering with other processes or Wox core functionalities.
    4.  **Enforce Sandbox at Wox Plugin Load Time:** Modify Wox's plugin loading mechanism to automatically apply the defined sandbox policies when each plugin is loaded and executed.
    5.  **Test Wox Plugin Functionality within Sandbox:** Thoroughly test existing and new Wox plugins to ensure they function correctly within the enforced sandbox environment and that the restrictions do not break legitimate plugin features.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Wox Plugin Execution (High Severity):** Prevents malicious plugins from performing harmful actions on the user's system, even if vulnerabilities exist in the plugin code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Provide Clear Warnings and Permissions Management for Wox Plugins](./mitigation_strategies/provide_clear_warnings_and_permissions_management_for_wox_plugins.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Wox Plugin Permission Declaration System:** Design a system for Wox plugin developers to declare the permissions their plugins require. This could be a manifest file within the plugin package or a standardized declaration format. Permissions could include:
        *   Network access (internet, local network).
        *   File system access (read, write, specific directories).
        *   Access to specific Wox APIs or functionalities.
        *   System-level access (e.g., clipboard, system settings).
    2.  **User Interface to Display Wox Plugin Permissions:** Enhance the Wox user interface to display the declared permissions of a plugin to the user *before* installation or enabling. Present these permissions in a clear and understandable manner.
    3.  **Warnings for Unverified or High-Permission Wox Plugins:** Implement prominent warnings in the Wox UI for:
        *   Plugins that are not signature-verified.
        *   Plugins requesting potentially sensitive permissions (e.g., network access, write access to user documents).
    4.  **(Optional) Granular Wox Plugin Permission Control:** If technically feasible within Wox's architecture, consider allowing users to granularly control permissions for individual plugins after installation. This could involve toggling specific permissions on or off through a plugin management interface.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Uninformed User Consent to Risky Wox Plugins (Medium Severity):** Increases user awareness of the permissions requested by plugins, enabling more informed decisions about plugin installation and usage.
    *   **Accidental Installation of Over-Permissive Wox Plugins (Medium Severity):** Reduces the likelihood of users unknowingly installing plugins that request excessive permissions beyond their intended functionality.
    *   **Social Engineering Attacks via Wox Plugins (Low to Medium Severity):** Makes it harder for attackers to trick users into installing malicious plugins by clearly highlighting the permissions requested, making suspicious requests more apparent.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Uninformed User Consent to Risky Wox Plugins:** Medium Reduction
    *   **Accidental Installation of Over-Permissive Wox Plugins:** Medium Reduction
    *   **Social Engineering Attacks via Wox Plugins:** Low to Medium Reduction

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal system for Wox plugin permission declaration by developers.
    *   User interface elements within Wox to display plugin permissions and associated warnings.
    *   (Optional) Granular permission control functionality for Wox plugins.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Audit and Update Wox Plugin API](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_audit_and_update_wox_plugin_api.md)

*   **Description:**

    *   **Zero-Day Exploits in Wox Plugin API (Medium Severity):** Proactive security audits help identify and remediate vulnerabilities in the Wox API before they can be exploited in zero-day attacks targeting Wox users through plugins.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Wox Plugin API Exploitation:** High Reduction
    *   **Vulnerabilities Introduced by Wox API Design Flaws:** Medium Reduction
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits in Wox Plugin API:** Medium Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely **Partially Implemented**.  Security considerations are likely part of general software development practices for Wox, but a formal, dedicated security review process and publicly documented security guidelines specifically for the Wox plugin API might be missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal security review process for Wox plugin API design and updates.
    *   Regular, dedicated security audits of the Wox plugin API.
    *   Publicly accessible security guidelines and best practices for Wox plugin developers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Sanitization and Validation in Wox Core](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_sanitization_and_validation_in_wox_core.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Wox Input Points:**  Map all locations within the Wox core application where user input is received and processed. This includes:
        *   The main search bar input.
        *   Command prefixes and custom command inputs.
        *   Input fields within Wox settings or configuration UI.
        *   Input passed to plugins through the Wox API.
    2.  **Define Wox Input Validation Rules:** For each input point in Wox, define strict validation rules based on the expected input type, format, character set, and length. Prioritize using allow-lists (defining what is permitted) over deny-lists (defining what is prohibited).
    3.  **Implement Input Sanitization in Wox Core:**  Sanitize all user input received by Wox to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or sequences *before* the input is processed further. This should be applied consistently across all input points and may involve:
        *   Encoding special characters (e.g., HTML encoding, URL encoding, shell escaping).
        *   Removing or replacing characters outside the allowed character set.
        *   Using input validation and sanitization libraries appropriate for the programming languages used in Wox.
    4.  **Apply Validation at the Earliest Stage in Wox Input Processing:** Implement input validation and sanitization as early as possible in the Wox input processing pipeline, immediately after user input is received.
    5.  **Robust Error Handling for Invalid Wox Input:** Implement robust error handling within Wox for cases where user input fails validation. Reject invalid input, log the attempt (for security monitoring), and provide informative error messages to the user without revealing sensitive system information or internal Wox details.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection in Wox (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious commands into the system through user input processed by Wox, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Path Traversal via Wox Input (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers manipulating file paths within user input to access or manipulate files outside of intended Wox functionalities.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Wox UI (Medium Severity):** If Wox has any web-based UI components or displays user-provided content, input sanitization can prevent XSS attacks by properly escaping user input before rendering it in the UI.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) attacks targeting Wox via Input (Low to Medium Severity):** Input validation can help prevent malformed or excessively long input from crashing Wox or consuming excessive system resources, mitigating certain DoS attack vectors.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection in Wox:** High Reduction
    *   **Path Traversal via Wox Input:** Medium Reduction
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Wox UI:** Medium Reduction
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) attacks targeting Wox via Input:** Low to Medium Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely **Partially Implemented**. Some level of basic input validation might be present in Wox, but comprehensive and strict sanitization and validation across *all* input points, especially those interacting with command execution or plugins, is likely needed. Review Wox's input processing code, particularly around search queries, command handling, and plugin interactions.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal definition of input validation rules for all Wox input points.
    *   Consistent and robust input sanitization implementation throughout the Wox codebase.
    *   Centralized input validation and sanitization functions or libraries within Wox for code reusability and consistency.
    *   Security logging of invalid input attempts for monitoring and incident response.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterization of Commands and Application Launches in Wox](./mitigation_strategies/parameterization_of_commands_and_application_launches_in_wox.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Wox Command/Application Launch Code:** Locate all code sections within Wox where commands are executed or applications are launched based on user input or plugin actions.
    2.  **Implement Parameterized Execution in Wox:** Replace instances of direct string concatenation of user input into command strings with parameterized execution mechanisms provided by the operating system or programming language used in Wox. Examples include:
        *   Using parameterized process creation APIs (e.g., `subprocess.Popen` in Python with argument lists, `CreateProcess` in Windows with argument arrays) to pass command arguments as separate parameters instead of a single command string.
        *   If Wox interacts with databases (less likely for a launcher, but possible for plugin features), use prepared statements for database queries to separate SQL query structure from user-provided data.
    3.  **Avoid Shell Expansion in Wox Command Execution:** When executing commands in Wox, strictly avoid using shell expansion features (e.g., `eval`, `system` in some languages) that can interpret user input as shell commands. Use direct execution APIs that bypass shell interpretation.
    4.  **Escape Shell Metacharacters (If Parameterization is Not Fully Possible in Wox):** In situations where parameterization is technically challenging or not fully feasible within Wox's architecture, carefully and correctly escape shell metacharacters in user input *before* including it in command strings. However, parameterization should be the primary and preferred approach.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection in Wox (High Severity):** Significantly reduces the risk of command injection vulnerabilities in Wox by preventing user input from being directly interpreted as commands by the underlying shell.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution via Wox Command Injection (High Severity):** Minimizes the possibility of attackers achieving arbitrary code execution on the user's system through command injection vulnerabilities in Wox.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection in Wox:** High Reduction
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution via Wox Command Injection:** High Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely **Partially Implemented or Missing**. Developers might be using some level of parameterization in certain parts of Wox's command execution logic, but a consistent and comprehensive approach across all command and application launch points is likely needed. Review Wox's code related to process creation and command execution.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic review and refactoring of Wox's command execution code to consistently use parameterization.
    *   Elimination of shell expansion functions from Wox's command execution paths where possible.
    *   Consistent application of parameterized APIs for process creation throughout Wox.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Command Whitelisting in Wox (If Feasible)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_command_whitelisting_in_wox__if_feasible_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Wox's Legitimate Command Execution Needs:**  Thoroughly analyze the core functionalities of Wox and its plugins to determine the *specific* commands and applications that Wox *legitimately needs* to execute.
    2.  **Create a Restrictive Wox Command Whitelist:** Develop a whitelist of allowed commands and application paths that Wox is permitted to execute. This whitelist should be as narrow and restrictive as possible, only including commands absolutely necessary for Wox's intended functionality.
    3.  **Implement Whitelist Enforcement in Wox Core:** Modify Wox's command execution logic to check *every* command execution request against the defined whitelist. Only allow execution of commands that are explicitly present in the whitelist. Reject any command execution requests that are not on the whitelist and log the attempted execution (for security monitoring).
    4.  **Securely Manage and Update Wox Command Whitelist:** Implement a secure mechanism to manage and update the Wox command whitelist. Access to modify the whitelist should be restricted to authorized Wox developers or administrators. Regularly review and update the whitelist to ensure it remains accurate, up-to-date, and as restrictive as possible.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection in Wox (High Severity):** Provides a strong defense-in-depth against command injection attacks in Wox by preventing the execution of *any* commands that are not explicitly authorized, even if other input validation or parameterization measures are bypassed.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution via Wox Command Injection (High Severity):** Significantly reduces the risk of arbitrary code execution through command injection vulnerabilities in Wox, as only whitelisted commands can be executed.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection in Wox:** High Reduction
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution via Wox Command Injection:** High Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely **Missing**. Command whitelisting is a more advanced security measure and is not commonly implemented in general-purpose launcher applications like Wox due to the complexity of maintaining a comprehensive and accurate whitelist and potentially limiting legitimate user functionalities.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Analysis of Wox's command execution requirements to build a whitelist.
    *   Creation and secure storage of a Wox command whitelist.
    *   Whitelist enforcement logic integrated into Wox's command execution paths.
    *   Secure mechanism for updating and managing the Wox command whitelist.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS for Wox Update Channel](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_https_for_wox_update_channel.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Wox for HTTPS Update Communication:** Ensure that Wox is *strictly configured* to use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) for *all* communication related to its update mechanism. This includes:
        *   Checking for new Wox updates from the update server.
        *   Downloading Wox update packages.
        *   Any communication with the update server for version information or update metadata.
    2.  **Implement SSL/TLS Certificate Verification in Wox:** Ensure that Wox's update client *properly and rigorously verifies* the SSL/TLS certificates presented by the Wox update server. This verification should include:
        *   Validating the certificate chain of trust.
        *   Checking for certificate revocation.
        *   Verifying the hostname in the certificate matches the update server domain.
    3.  **Disable Insecure HTTP Fallback for Wox Updates:** *Completely disable* any fallback mechanism in Wox that would allow update communication to fall back to insecure HTTP if HTTPS is unavailable or fails. Wox updates should *only* be allowed over HTTPS.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Wox Updates (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting Wox update communication in transit and injecting malicious updates by exploiting insecure HTTP connections.
    *   **Malicious Wox Update Injection via MitM (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers successfully replacing legitimate Wox updates with malicious ones during a Man-in-the-Middle attack on the update channel.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Wox Updates:** High Reduction
    *   **Malicious Wox Update Injection via MitM:** High Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely **Implemented**. Using HTTPS for update communication is a standard and essential security practice for software applications. It is highly probable that Wox already uses HTTPS for its update channel. However, it's crucial to *verify* this implementation and ensure proper SSL/TLS certificate verification is in place within Wox.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   If Wox currently uses HTTP for updates or has an insecure HTTP fallback, this needs to be immediately rectified to enforce HTTPS-only update communication.
    *   Verification of robust SSL/TLS certificate validation implementation within Wox's update client.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Cryptographic Verification of Wox Updates](./mitigation_strategies/cryptographic_verification_of_wox_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Wox Update Package Signing:** Establish a robust system to digitally sign Wox update packages *before* they are distributed to users. This involves:
        *   Generating a strong code signing key pair specifically for Wox updates (private key for signing, public key for verification).
        *   Using the private key to digitally sign *each* Wox update package after it is built and before distribution.
        *   Implementing secure key management practices to protect the private signing key from unauthorized access or compromise.
    2.  **Integrate Signature Verification into Wox Update Client:** Modify the Wox application's update client to:
        *   Download the Wox update package from the update server (over HTTPS, as per the previous mitigation).
        *   *Cryptographically verify* the digital signature of the downloaded update package using the *embedded public key*.
        *   *Only apply* the Wox update if the signature verification is successful and valid.
        *   *Reject and discard* update packages with invalid, missing, or untrusted signatures.
    3.  **Securely Embed Wox Update Public Key:**  Embed the public key used for Wox update signature verification *securely within the Wox application itself*. This public key should be:
        *   Hardcoded into the Wox application binary during the build process.
        *   Protected from tampering or modification within the Wox application files.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Wox Update Injection (High Severity):** Effectively prevents the installation of modified or malicious Wox update packages, even if an attacker were to compromise the update channel or perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack. Cryptographic verification ensures update integrity and authenticity.
    *   **Wox Update Tampering (Medium Severity):** Detects if a legitimate Wox update package has been tampered with or corrupted after it was signed, ensuring that only original, untampered updates are installed.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Wox Update Injection:** High Reduction
    *   **Wox Update Tampering:** Medium Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely **Missing**. Cryptographic verification of updates is a critical security feature, but it is not always implemented in all software applications, especially in smaller open-source projects. It is important to *verify* if Wox currently implements update signature verification and, if not, prioritize its implementation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Wox update package signing infrastructure and processes.
    *   Signature verification logic integrated into the Wox update client.
    *   Secure embedding of the Wox update public key within the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rollback Mechanism for Wox Updates](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rollback_mechanism_for_wox_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Wox Installation Backup Before Update:** Before applying a Wox update, implement a mechanism to automatically create a *backup* of the currently installed Wox application. This backup should include:
        *   Wox program files and executables.
        *   Wox configuration files.
        *   Potentially user data or plugin data directories, depending on the update process.
    2.  **Develop Wox Update Rollback Functionality:** Create a robust rollback mechanism within Wox that allows users (or the system automatically in case of update failure) to revert Wox to the *previous version* using the created backup. This rollback functionality should be:
        *   Accessible through a user interface option (e.g., in settings or a recovery menu).
        *   Automated to trigger in case of a failed update installation or if Wox detects critical errors after an update.
    3.  **Ensure Secure Wox Update Rollback Process:**  Design the rollback process itself to be secure and resistant to exploitation. The rollback mechanism should:
        *   Properly restore the backed-up files and configuration.
        *   Not introduce new vulnerabilities during the rollback process.
        *   Ideally, verify the integrity of the backup before performing the rollback.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Failed Wox Updates Causing Instability or Unusability (Medium Severity):** Allows users to easily recover from broken or incomplete Wox updates that might render the application unstable or unusable.
    *   **Malicious Wox Updates Causing Harm (Medium Severity):** Provides a crucial safety net in case a malicious Wox update is accidentally installed (despite other security measures). A rollback allows users to quickly revert to a clean, previous version before significant harm can be done.
    *   **Accidental Issues Introduced by Legitimate Wox Updates (Low to Medium Severity):** Offers a recovery option for users who experience unexpected problems or regressions after installing a legitimate Wox update, allowing them to revert to a working state.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Failed Wox Updates Causing Instability or Unusability:** Medium Reduction
    *   **Malicious Wox Updates Causing Harm:** Medium Reduction
    *   **Accidental Issues Introduced by Legitimate Wox Updates:** Low to Medium Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely **Missing**. Rollback mechanisms are not always standard features in application update systems, especially for smaller projects like Wox. It's important to check if Wox has any rollback capabilities and, if not, consider adding this feature for improved update resilience and security.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Wox installation backup mechanism implemented before updates.
    *   Wox update rollback functionality within the application.
    *   User interface option or automated trigger for initiating Wox update rollback.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Default Configuration for Wox](./mitigation_strategies/secure_default_configuration_for_wox.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Conduct Security Review of Wox Default Configuration:** Perform a thorough security review of *all* default configuration settings in Wox.
    2.  **Minimize Default Features and Permissions in Wox:**  Disable any non-essential features or functionalities in Wox by default that could increase the attack surface or introduce unnecessary security risks. For example, if certain plugin features or advanced settings are not core to basic Wox functionality, consider disabling them by default and allowing users to enable them if needed.
    3.  **Restrict Default Permissions in Wox Configuration:** Ensure that default permissions settings within Wox (related to file access, plugin capabilities, etc.) are as restrictive as possible, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
    4.  **Disable Debugging/Development Features in Wox Production Defaults:**  Verify that any debugging features, development-related settings, or verbose logging options are *disabled by default* in production builds of Wox. These features can sometimes expose sensitive information or create security vulnerabilities if left enabled in production.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Unnecessary Wox Features (Medium Severity):** Reduces the overall attack surface of Wox by disabling features that are not essential for most users and could potentially contain vulnerabilities or be misused.
    *   **Accidental Wox Misconfiguration Leading to Vulnerabilities (Low Severity):** Provides a more secure baseline configuration for Wox out-of-the-box, reducing the risk of users accidentally misconfiguring Wox in a way that introduces security weaknesses.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Unnecessary Wox Features:** Medium Reduction
    *   **Accidental Wox Misconfiguration Leading to Vulnerabilities:** Low Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely **Partially Implemented**. Wox developers likely aim for reasonable defaults, but a *dedicated security-focused review* of all default configurations to minimize attack surface and maximize security might be missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal, documented security review process specifically for Wox default configuration settings.
    *   Clear documentation outlining secure default configuration practices for Wox development.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation for Wox Configuration Settings](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_for_wox_configuration_settings.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Wox Configuration Input Points:**  Identify *all* methods and locations where users can configure Wox settings. This includes:
        *   Wox configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML, INI files).
        *   Command-line arguments passed to Wox.
        *   Settings UI within the Wox application itself.
        *   Environment variables that affect Wox behavior.
    2.  **Define Validation Rules for Wox Configuration Settings:** For *each* configurable setting in Wox, define strict validation rules based on the expected data type, format, allowed values, and ranges.
    3.  **Implement Wox Configuration Input Validation:**  Implement robust input validation within Wox to validate configuration settings *whenever* they are loaded or modified, regardless of the input method. Reject invalid configuration settings and:
        *   Log the invalid configuration attempt (for security monitoring).
        *   Provide informative error messages to the user indicating *what* configuration setting is invalid and *why*, without revealing sensitive internal Wox details.
        *   Prevent Wox from starting or applying the invalid configuration until corrected.
    4.  **Use Secure Configuration File Parsing in Wox:** If Wox uses configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML, INI), ensure that Wox uses *secure parsing libraries* that are known to be resistant to injection vulnerabilities and other parsing-related security issues.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Configuration Injection Vulnerabilities in Wox (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code, commands, or unintended settings into Wox through manipulated configuration settings.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) attacks targeting Wox via Malformed Configuration (Low to Medium Severity):** Validation can prevent malformed or invalid configuration settings from causing Wox to crash, hang, or become unstable, mitigating certain DoS attack vectors.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Configuration Injection Vulnerabilities in Wox:** Medium Reduction
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) attacks targeting Wox via Malformed Configuration:** Low to Medium Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely **Partially Implemented**. Some basic validation might be present for certain critical Wox configuration settings, but comprehensive validation across *all* configurable settings and secure configuration file parsing practices might be missing. Review Wox's configuration loading and parsing code.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal definition of validation rules for all Wox configuration settings.
    *   Consistent and robust configuration input validation implementation throughout Wox.
    *   Use of secure configuration file parsing libraries in Wox.
    *   Security logging of invalid configuration attempts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to Wox Configuration Files](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to_wox_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Wox Configuration File Locations:**  Determine the *exact locations* of all Wox configuration files on different operating systems where Wox is intended to run.
    2.  **Set Restrictive File System Permissions for Wox Configuration Files:** Configure file system permissions on Wox configuration files to *strictly limit access* to only authorized users and processes. Typically, this means:
        *   **Read access:**  Grant read access *only* to the user account under which Wox is running and to administrative accounts.
        *   **Write access:** Grant write access *only* to the user account under which Wox is running and to administrative accounts (or even more restrictively, only to administrative accounts if configuration changes are intended to be admin-only).
        *   *Remove* read and write access for other users and groups on the system.
    3.  **Avoid Storing Sensitive Data in Plain Text in Wox Configuration:**  *Avoid storing sensitive data* (passwords, API keys, secrets, etc.) in plain text within Wox configuration files. If sensitive data *must* be stored in configuration, use robust encryption or secure storage mechanisms (e.g., operating system credential management, encrypted configuration files) to protect this data from unauthorized access.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Wox Configuration Modification (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users or malicious processes from modifying Wox configuration settings to compromise Wox's security, functionality, or user experience.
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Wox Configuration Files (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of sensitive information stored in Wox configuration files being exposed to unauthorized users or attackers who gain access to the file system.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Wox Configuration Modification:** Medium Reduction
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Wox Configuration Files:** Medium Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely **Partially Implemented**. Operating system default file permissions might provide *some* level of protection, but *explicit configuration* of restrictive permissions specifically for Wox configuration files and secure handling of sensitive data in configuration are likely missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit configuration of restrictive file system permissions for *all* Wox configuration files across different operating systems.
    *   Implementation of secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data within Wox configuration (e.g., encryption, credential management integration).
    *   Documentation and clear guidance for Wox users and administrators on how to properly secure Wox configuration files and sensitive data.
