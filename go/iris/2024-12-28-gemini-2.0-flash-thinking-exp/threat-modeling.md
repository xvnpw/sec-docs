### High and Critical Iris Specific Threats

Here's a list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Iris web framework:

*   **Threat:** Incorrect Route Definition Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker might craft specific URLs that, due to overly broad or poorly defined route patterns in the Iris application, match unintended routes. This could allow them to access functionalities or data they are not authorized to access. For example, a route like `/admin/{param:path}` might allow access to `/admin/users` or even `/admin/config/sensitive.json` if not properly handled.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, circumvention of access controls, potential for privilege escalation if administrative routes are exposed.
    *   **Affected Iris Component:** `iris.New().Get(...)`, `iris.New().Post(...)`, `iris.Party(...)` (routing functions and group definitions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use specific and restrictive route patterns.
        *   Avoid overly broad wildcards or regular expressions in route definitions.
        *   Thoroughly test all route definitions to ensure they behave as expected.
        *   Implement proper authorization checks within route handlers.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via Route Parameters
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate route parameters intended for file access (e.g., `/files/{filepath}`) by injecting path traversal sequences like `../` to access files outside the intended directory. The Iris application might use `ctx.Params().Get("filepath")` directly to construct file paths without proper sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files on the server, potential for remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities (e.g., writing to arbitrary locations).
    *   **Affected Iris Component:** `Context.Params()`, `Context.SendFile()`, `Context.ServeFile()` (request parameter handling and file serving functions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user-supplied input directly in file paths.
        *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of path parameters.
        *   Use whitelisting of allowed file paths or names.
        *   Utilize Iris's secure file serving functionalities and ensure the base directory is correctly configured.

*   **Threat:** Middleware Misconfiguration Leading to Security Bypass
    *   **Description:** An attacker might exploit an incorrect ordering or configuration of middleware. For instance, if an authentication middleware is placed after a middleware that serves static files, an attacker could bypass authentication by directly requesting static assets.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, privilege escalation, circumvention of security controls.
    *   **Affected Iris Component:** `app.Use(...)`, `app.UseRouter(...)` (middleware registration and ordering).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring middleware.
        *   Ensure that security middleware (authentication, authorization, etc.) is executed before any request handlers or other potentially vulnerable middleware.
        *   Thoroughly test middleware configurations and their interactions.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
    *   **Description:** If the Iris application uses a template engine and user-supplied data is directly embedded into templates without proper escaping, an attacker could inject malicious code into the input. When the template is rendered, this code is executed on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, server compromise.
    *   **Affected Iris Component:** Integration with template engines (e.g., `html/template`, `amber`), `Context.View()` (template rendering).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a template engine that provides automatic escaping by default.
        *   Sanitize user input before rendering it in templates.
        *   Avoid constructing templates dynamically from user input.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful SSTI.

*   **Threat:** WebSocket Authentication and Authorization Bypass
    *   **Description:** If WebSocket connections are not properly authenticated and authorized, unauthorized users might be able to connect and interact with the application's WebSocket functionalities. This could allow them to access real-time data or perform actions they are not permitted to.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to real-time data and functionality, potential for data manipulation or abuse of WebSocket features.
    *   **Affected Iris Component:** Iris's WebSocket handling (`websocket.New(...)`, custom authentication/authorization logic within WebSocket handlers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication mechanisms for WebSocket connections (e.g., using tokens or cookies established during the initial HTTP handshake).
        *   Verify user identity before allowing access to specific WebSocket channels or functionalities.
        *   Implement authorization checks to ensure users can only perform actions they are allowed to.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal in Static File Serving
    *   **Description:** If the Iris application serves static files and the configuration is not secure, an attacker could potentially use path traversal techniques in the URL (e.g., `/static/../../sensitive.conf`) to access files outside the designated static directory.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files on the server.
    *   **Affected Iris Component:** `iris.Application.HandleDir()`, `Context.ServeFile()` (static file serving functionalities).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure the static file serving directory using `iris.Application.HandleDir()`.
        *   Avoid using user-supplied input directly in file paths for static file serving.
        *   Ensure the base directory for static files is set correctly and restricts access to sensitive areas.

*   **Threat:** Lack of Built-in CSRF Protection
    *   **Description:** Iris does not provide built-in Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. If developers do not implement CSRF protection manually, an attacker could potentially trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions on the application by crafting malicious requests.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of legitimate users, potential for data modification or financial loss.
    *   **Affected Iris Component:** Lack of a built-in CSRF protection module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement CSRF protection using middleware or custom logic.
        *   Utilize techniques like synchronizer tokens (double-submit cookies or session-based tokens).
        *   Set the `SameSite` attribute for cookies to `Strict` or `Lax`.
