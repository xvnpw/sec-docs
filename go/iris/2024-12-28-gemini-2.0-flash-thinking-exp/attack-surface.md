Here's the updated list of high and critical attack surfaces directly involving Iris:

*   **Attack Surface:** Route Parameter Injection
    *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate route parameters to access unintended resources or trigger errors.
    *   **How Iris Contributes:** Iris's routing mechanism defines how parameters are extracted from URLs. Lack of validation in route handlers directly exposes this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A route `/items/{id:uint}` without proper validation could allow requests like `/items/-1` or `/items/abc`, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, application crashes, potential for further exploitation if parameters are used in backend logic without sanitization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Utilize Iris's Route Parameter Constraints:** Employ built-in constraints like `:uint`, `:string`, `:uuid` to enforce basic type validation directly in the route definition.
        *   **Implement Explicit Validation in Handlers:**  Within route handlers, explicitly validate the format and range of route parameters before using them.
        *   **Sanitize Input:** Sanitize route parameters to remove or escape potentially harmful characters before using them in database queries or other operations.

*   **Attack Surface:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template directives, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **How Iris Contributes:** If Iris's built-in template engine (or a custom one integrated with Iris) renders user-controlled data without proper escaping, it creates a direct pathway for SSTI.
    *   **Example:** Using `ctx.ViewData("name", userInput)` and then rendering `{{ .name }}` in a template without proper escaping could allow an attacker to inject template code within `userInput`.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Rendering User-Controlled Data Directly in Templates:**  Treat user input as untrusted and avoid directly embedding it into template directives.
        *   **Utilize Contextual Output Escaping:**  Ensure the template engine's escaping mechanisms are correctly configured and used to escape output based on the context (HTML, JavaScript, etc.).
        *   **Consider Logic-Less Templates:** Opt for template engines that minimize the ability to embed complex logic, reducing the attack surface for SSTI.

*   **Attack Surface:** Middleware Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Security flaws within custom or third-party middleware can compromise the application.
    *   **How Iris Contributes:** Iris's middleware system allows intercepting and modifying requests and responses. Vulnerabilities in middleware directly impact the request processing pipeline within the Iris application.
    *   **Example:** A custom authentication middleware with a flaw could allow bypassing authentication checks. A logging middleware might inadvertently log sensitive information from requests.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, information disclosure, potential for further exploitation depending on the middleware's function.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability and middleware function)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thoroughly Review Custom Middleware Code:**  Conduct security audits of any custom middleware developed for the Iris application.
        *   **Use Reputable and Well-Maintained Middleware:**  Prefer using established and actively maintained third-party middleware. Check for known vulnerabilities and keep them updated.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Middleware:** Ensure middleware has only the necessary permissions and access to data.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure File Serving
    *   **Description:** Improper configuration allows access to files outside the intended static file directories (path traversal).
    *   **How Iris Contributes:** Iris's `StaticWeb` and related functions are used to serve static files. Misconfiguration or lack of proper path sanitization when using these functions can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:**  If `app.HandleDir("/static", "./public")` is used, but the application logic allows user input to influence the path within `./public`, an attacker might access files outside this directory using paths like `/static/../../sensitive.conf`.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive configuration files, source code, or other confidential data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Static File Directories:** Carefully define the directories from which Iris serves static files and avoid serving the entire application root.
        *   **Avoid User-Controlled Paths in File Serving:** Do not allow user input to directly determine the file path being served.
        *   **Canonicalization:** If user input is involved in determining the file path (which should be avoided if possible), canonicalize the path to resolve symbolic links and relative paths before accessing files.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Session Management
    *   **Description:** Weaknesses in session handling can lead to unauthorized access through session hijacking or fixation.
    *   **How Iris Contributes:** Iris provides built-in session management. Using default configurations without security considerations or implementing custom session handling insecurely introduces this risk.
    *   **Example:** Using default cookie names without the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags, or using a weak session ID generation mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, allowing an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configure Secure Session Options:** Ensure session cookies are configured with the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags.
        *   **Generate Strong Session IDs:** Use cryptographically secure random number generators for session IDs.
        *   **Implement Session Timeout and Inactivity Logout:**  Force users to re-authenticate after a period of inactivity.
        *   **Consider Secure Session Storage:** Choose a secure storage mechanism for session data if using server-side storage.
        *   **Rotate Session IDs:** Periodically regenerate session IDs to mitigate the impact of session compromise.
