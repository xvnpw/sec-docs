# Attack Surface Analysis for go-kratos/kratos

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured HTTP/gRPC Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_httpgrpc_endpoints.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Unsecured HTTP/gRPC Endpoints
    *   **Description:** Kratos applications expose HTTP and gRPC endpoints for communication. If these endpoints are not properly secured with authentication and authorization, they can be accessed by unauthorized users or attackers.
    *   **How Kratos Contributes:** Kratos provides the framework for defining and exposing these endpoints. Developers are responsible for implementing the necessary security measures. Default configurations might not enforce authentication.
    *   **Example:** A `/admin/users` endpoint is exposed without requiring any authentication, allowing anyone to list or modify user data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities, manipulation of application state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication middleware or interceptors for all sensitive endpoints.
        *   Enforce authorization checks to ensure users only access resources they are permitted to.
        *   Avoid exposing internal or debugging endpoints in production environments.
        *   Use HTTPS to encrypt communication and protect against eavesdropping.

## Attack Surface: [Service Registry Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/service_registry_poisoning.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Service Registry Poisoning
    *   **Description:** If the service registry (e.g., Consul, Etcd) used by Kratos is not properly secured, attackers can register malicious service instances.
    *   **How Kratos Contributes:** Kratos relies on a service registry for service discovery. If the registry is compromised, Kratos applications can be directed to malicious services.
    *   **Example:** An attacker registers a malicious service instance with the same name as a legitimate backend service. When another service attempts to communicate with the legitimate service, it is instead routed to the attacker's instance.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception, denial of service, potential compromise of other services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing and modifying the service registry.
        *   Use secure communication channels (e.g., TLS) between Kratos applications and the service registry.
        *   Regularly monitor the service registry for unexpected or unauthorized registrations.
        *   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service communication to verify the identity of communicating services.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Exposure and Injection](./attack_surfaces/configuration_exposure_and_injection.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Configuration Exposure and Injection
    *   **Description:** Kratos uses a configuration management system. If configuration sources are not secured or if the system allows for injection of malicious configurations, it can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Kratos Contributes:** Kratos's configuration component handles loading and managing application settings. If the underlying sources or update mechanisms are flawed, it introduces risk.
    *   **Example:** Database credentials or API keys are stored in plain text in a configuration file accessible to unauthorized individuals. An attacker could also potentially inject malicious configuration values to redirect traffic or disable security features.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, modification of application behavior, potential for remote code execution (depending on how configuration is used).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store sensitive configuration data securely (e.g., using encrypted storage, secrets management tools).
        *   Restrict access to configuration sources to authorized personnel and systems.
        *   Implement validation and sanitization of configuration values before they are used by the application.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in environment variables if possible, opting for more secure secret management solutions.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware/Interceptors](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_middlewareinterceptors.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware/Interceptors
    *   **Description:** Developers often create custom middleware or gRPC interceptors in Kratos applications. Vulnerabilities in this custom code can introduce significant security risks.
    *   **How Kratos Contributes:** Kratos provides the framework for implementing and integrating custom middleware and interceptors. The security of these components is the responsibility of the developer.
    *   **Example:** A custom authentication middleware has a flaw that allows bypassing authentication checks under certain conditions. A custom logging interceptor might inadvertently log sensitive request data.
    *   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization failures, information leakage, potential for arbitrary code execution depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom middleware and interceptors.
        *   Thoroughly test custom middleware and interceptors for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Conduct code reviews of custom security-related components.
        *   Leverage existing, well-vetted middleware and interceptor libraries where possible.
