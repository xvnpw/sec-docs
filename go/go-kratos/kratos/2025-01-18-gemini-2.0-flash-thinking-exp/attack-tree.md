## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Configuration Data -> Gain Unauthorized Access](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_configuration_data_-_gain_unauthorized_access.md)

* **Expose Sensitive Configuration Data [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit insecure storage or access controls on configuration files used by Kratos. This could involve accessing files stored in version control, exposed through insecure endpoints, or lacking proper permissions.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Successful exploitation leads to the disclosure of sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and other secrets.
    * **Why High-Risk:** This path is high-risk due to the relatively high likelihood of misconfiguration and the immediate critical impact of exposing sensitive credentials, which can be directly used to compromise the application and its underlying resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization Middleware -> Gain Unauthorized Access](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization_middleware_-_gain_unauthorized_access.md)

* **Bypass Authentication/Authorization Middleware [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and exploit flaws in custom authentication or authorization middleware implemented within the Kratos framework. This could involve logic errors, improper handling of authentication tokens, or vulnerabilities in the middleware's design.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Successful exploitation allows attackers to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access to protected resources and functionalities.
    * **Why High-Risk:** This path is high-risk because it directly circumvents security measures intended to protect the application. The impact is critical as it grants unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Poison Service Registry -> Gain Unauthorized Access](./attack_tree_paths/poison_service_registry_-_gain_unauthorized_access.md)

* **Poison Service Registry [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the service discovery mechanism used by Kratos (e.g., Consul, etcd). This involves registering malicious service endpoints in the registry. When the application attempts to discover and communicate with a legitimate service, it is instead directed to the attacker's malicious endpoint.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Successful exploitation allows attackers to intercept communication, manipulate data, and potentially gain control over application components.
    * **Why High-Risk:** This path is high-risk because it can lead to widespread compromise by affecting multiple interactions between services. The impact is critical as it undermines the trust and integrity of inter-service communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Requests -> Disrupt Application Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_requests_-_disrupt_application_functionality.md)

* **Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Requests:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers send a large volume of crafted requests to Kratos endpoints. These requests are designed to consume excessive server resources such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth, leading to a denial of service.
    * **Impact:** Significant. Successful exploitation results in the application becoming unavailable or experiencing severe performance degradation, impacting legitimate users.
    * **Why High-Risk:** This path is high-risk due to the high likelihood of occurrence (common web application vulnerability) and the significant impact of rendering the application unusable. The effort required for attackers is often low, making it an attractive attack vector.
