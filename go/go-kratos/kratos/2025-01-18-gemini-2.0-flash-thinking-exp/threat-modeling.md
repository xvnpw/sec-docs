# Threat Model Analysis for go-kratos/kratos

## Threat: [Insecure Default Inter-Service Authentication/Authorization](./threats/insecure_default_inter-service_authenticationauthorization.md)

*   **Description:** Kratos applications rely on default or weak authentication/authorization mechanisms for communication between services *as provided or easily configured within the Kratos framework*. Attackers could potentially impersonate services or gain unauthorized access to internal APIs due to insecure defaults or lack of guidance for secure configuration within Kratos.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to manipulate internal application state, potential for privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:** Inter-service communication mechanisms (gRPC interceptors, HTTP middleware) provided by Kratos, default security configurations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid relying on default authentication/authorization configurations provided by Kratos.
    *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms like mutual TLS (mTLS) for inter-service communication, leveraging Kratos' integration points for such mechanisms.
    *   Enforce robust authorization policies within Kratos' middleware or interceptor framework to control access to internal APIs.

## Threat: [Lack of Mutual TLS (mTLS) Enforcement](./threats/lack_of_mutual_tls__mtls__enforcement.md)

*   **Description:** mTLS is not properly configured or enforced for inter-service communication *within a Kratos application*, potentially due to misconfiguration or lack of awareness of Kratos' mTLS capabilities. This allows attackers to potentially eavesdrop on or tamper with communication between services.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches due to eavesdropping, manipulation of data in transit, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Inter-service communication mechanisms (gRPC transport security, HTTP TLS configuration) as implemented and configured within Kratos.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable and enforce mTLS for all inter-service communication using Kratos' configuration options for gRPC and HTTP servers.
    *   Properly manage and rotate certificates used for mTLS, ensuring Kratos services are configured to use them correctly.
    *   Ensure that Kratos services are configured to only accept connections with valid client certificates.

## Threat: [Request Smuggling/Spoofing via Kratos' Proxying](./threats/request_smugglingspoofing_via_kratos'_proxying.md)

*   **Description:** If Kratos is used as a gateway or proxy, vulnerabilities in *Kratos'* handling of requests could allow attackers to smuggle requests to internal services, bypassing security checks implemented in other middleware, or spoof the origin of requests to internal services.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal services, potential for executing actions with the privileges of other services, bypassing security controls.
*   **Affected Component:** Reverse proxy functionality within Kratos, request routing and handling logic within Kratos' gateway implementation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Kratos' proxying logic is robust and correctly handles HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 request boundaries.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all incoming requests *at the Kratos gateway level*.
    *   Avoid relying solely on the Kratos proxy for security and implement defense-in-depth measures in backend services.

## Threat: [Bypass of Security Middleware](./threats/bypass_of_security_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** Configuration errors or vulnerabilities in *Kratos'* middleware execution pipeline could allow attackers to bypass security-related middleware, such as authentication or authorization checks implemented using Kratos' middleware features.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, bypassing security controls intended to prevent malicious activity.
*   **Affected Component:** Middleware execution pipeline within Kratos.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully configure the middleware execution order within Kratos to ensure security middleware is always executed.
    *   Regularly review and test the middleware configuration in Kratos.
    *   Avoid conditional logic within Kratos' middleware configuration that could lead to bypassing security middleware.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Configuration Secrets](./threats/insecure_storage_of_configuration_secrets.md)

*   **Description:** Kratos applications store sensitive configuration data (e.g., API keys, database credentials) in plain text or easily reversible formats *within Kratos' configuration files or through environment variables accessed by Kratos*.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, allowing attackers to compromise other systems or data.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration management mechanisms within Kratos, how Kratos accesses and utilizes configuration data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize Kratos' integration capabilities with secure secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault or environment variable encryption.
    *   Avoid storing secrets directly in Kratos' configuration files or as plain environment variables.
    *   Encrypt sensitive configuration data at rest, especially if using file-based configuration with Kratos.

## Threat: [Configuration Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/configuration_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If configuration values processed by Kratos are not properly sanitized or validated, attackers might be able to inject malicious code or commands through configuration parameters, potentially leading to remote code execution *within the Kratos application*.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, compromise of the application server.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration loading and processing mechanisms within Kratos.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize all configuration inputs processed by Kratos.
    *   Avoid using configuration values directly in code execution paths within Kratos components or application logic.
    *   Implement the principle of least privilege for configuration settings within Kratos.
