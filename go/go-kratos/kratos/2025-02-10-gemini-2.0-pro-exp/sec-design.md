Okay, let's create a design document for the Kratos project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Kratos is a Go framework for building cloud-native microservices.  It aims to simplify the development of robust, scalable, and maintainable applications.  Given its open-source nature and focus on microservices, the following business priorities and risks are apparent:

Priorities:

*   Rapid Development: Enable developers to quickly build and deploy new services.
*   Scalability: Support applications that can handle a large number of users and requests.
*   Reliability: Ensure services are resilient to failures.
*   Maintainability: Make it easy to update and maintain services over time.
*   Community Adoption:  Grow a strong community around the framework to ensure its long-term viability and support.
*   Reduced Operational Overhead: Simplify deployment and management of microservices.

Business Risks:

*   Security Vulnerabilities:  Vulnerabilities in the framework could be exploited to compromise applications built using it. This is the *most critical risk*, as it directly impacts the security of all systems built with Kratos.
*   Supply Chain Attacks:  Compromised dependencies could introduce vulnerabilities into the framework.
*   Lack of Adoption: If the framework doesn't gain sufficient traction, it may become difficult to maintain and support.
*   Complexity:  Microservices architectures can be complex to manage, potentially leading to operational issues.
*   Inconsistent Implementations:  If developers don't follow best practices when using the framework, it could lead to inconsistent and potentially insecure applications.
*   Data Breaches:  Applications built with Kratos may handle sensitive data, making them targets for data breaches.
*   Compliance Violations: Applications may need to comply with various regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), and the framework should facilitate this.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Dependency Management: Kratos uses Go modules for dependency management, allowing for version pinning and checksum verification (go.mod and go.sum files).
*   security control: Code Linting: The project uses linters (as seen in the Makefile and CI workflows) to enforce code style and identify potential issues.
*   security control: Testing: The project includes unit and integration tests (evident from the directory structure and CI workflows).
*   security control: CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions are used for continuous integration and continuous delivery, automating builds, tests, and deployments.
*   security control: Documentation: The project provides documentation on its website and within the repository, including security considerations.
*   security control: Community Support: An active community can help identify and address security issues.
*   security control: Transport Layer Security: Kratos supports secure communication via TLS, as indicated in documentation and examples.
*   security control: Error Handling: The framework provides mechanisms for consistent error handling, reducing the risk of information leakage.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The framework itself is under continuous development, and new vulnerabilities may be discovered.
*   accepted risk: Developers using the framework may introduce security vulnerabilities in their own code.
*   accepted risk: Third-party dependencies may introduce vulnerabilities, even with dependency management.
*   accepted risk: The framework relies on the underlying security of the Go runtime and operating system.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for vulnerabilities in the framework's code.
*   Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Perform regular DAST scans on deployed instances of applications built with Kratos to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
*   Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Use SCA tools to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
*   Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits of the framework's codebase and infrastructure.
*   Fuzz Testing: Implement fuzz testing to identify unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
*   Threat Modeling: Perform regular threat modeling exercises to identify and mitigate potential security threats.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The framework should provide mechanisms for implementing secure authentication, such as supporting standard protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be considered.
    *   Secure storage of credentials (e.g., hashing and salting passwords) is crucial.
*   Authorization:
    *   The framework should support role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) to restrict access to resources.
    *   Fine-grained authorization policies should be configurable.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All input from external sources (e.g., user requests, API calls) must be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    *   The framework should provide utilities or guidance for implementing input validation.
*   Cryptography:
    *   The framework should use strong cryptographic algorithms and libraries for secure communication (TLS) and data protection.
    *   Key management should be handled securely.
    *   Support for data encryption at rest should be considered.

*   Secrets Management:  Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) should be stored securely and not hardcoded in the repository.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   User Authentication and Authorization: Ensuring only authorized users can access the application and its resources.
*   Data Processing: Handling user data securely and correctly.
*   Service Availability: Maintaining the availability of the application.
*   Inter-service Communication: Secure communication between microservices.

Data Sensitivity:

*   The Kratos framework itself does not inherently handle specific data. The sensitivity of data depends entirely on the applications built *using* Kratos.
*   Applications built with Kratos *could* handle:
    *   Personally Identifiable Information (PII):  High sensitivity.
    *   Financial Data: High sensitivity.
    *   Health Data: High sensitivity (subject to HIPAA or similar regulations).
    *   Authentication Credentials:  Extremely high sensitivity.
    *   Application-Specific Data:  Sensitivity varies depending on the application.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific types of applications are intended to be built with Kratos (e.g., e-commerce, healthcare, finance)? This will significantly impact the data sensitivity and security requirements.
*   What are the target deployment environments (e.g., specific cloud providers, on-premise)?
*   What are the specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)?
*   What level of security expertise is available within the development teams using Kratos?
*   Are there any existing security tools or infrastructure that should be integrated with?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: It is assumed that the primary goal is to create a secure and reliable framework for building microservices, prioritizing security alongside rapid development and scalability.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: It is assumed that developers using Kratos have a basic understanding of security principles, but may not be security experts. The framework should provide guidance and tools to help them build secure applications.
*   DESIGN: It is assumed that Kubernetes will be the primary deployment environment for applications built with Kratos. The design reflects this assumption. It is also assumed that applications will follow a typical microservices architecture.
