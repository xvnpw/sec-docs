## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Kratos Configuration/Dependency -> Leak Secrets (e.g., API keys) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_kratos_configurationdependency_-_leak_secrets__e_g___api_keys___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains access to sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, or other secrets, that are improperly stored within the application's configuration files or source code. This is a classic and unfortunately very common vulnerability.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common mistake)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete compromise, potential access to external services)
*   **Effort:** Very Low (If secrets are exposed in easily accessible locations)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (If secrets are found in logs, source code repositories, or exposed configuration files)
*   **Attack Steps:**
    1.  Identify potential locations of configuration files (e.g., through source code analysis, directory listing vulnerabilities, or default file paths).
    2.  Access the configuration files.
    3.  Extract the secrets.
    4.  Use the secrets to access protected resources or external services.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Never** store secrets directly in configuration files or source code.
    *   Use environment variables.
    *   Employ a dedicated secrets management service (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager).
    *   Implement strict access controls on configuration files.
    *   Regularly scan source code and configuration files for exposed secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Kratos Configuration/Dependency -> Dependency Vuln. (e.g., outdated lib with CVE) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_kratos_configurationdependency_-_dependency_vuln___e_g___outdated_lib_with_cve___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a dependency used by the Kratos framework or the application itself. This could be a vulnerability in a third-party library, a Kratos component, or even the Go standard library.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Dependencies are constantly being updated, and new vulnerabilities are frequently discovered)
*   **Impact:** Variable (Depends on the specific vulnerability; could range from Low to Very High, including RCE)
*   **Effort:** Variable (Depends on the vulnerability; could be Low if a public exploit is available, or High if it requires significant reverse engineering)
*   **Skill Level:** Variable (Depends on the vulnerability; could be Novice if a public exploit is available, or Expert if it requires significant reverse engineering)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires vulnerability scanning and staying up-to-date with security advisories)
*   **Attack Steps:**
    1.  Identify the dependencies used by the application (e.g., using `go list -m all`).
    2.  Identify known vulnerabilities in those dependencies (e.g., using a vulnerability scanner like Snyk, Dependabot, or by monitoring CVE databases).
    3.  If a suitable vulnerability is found, develop or obtain an exploit.
    4.  Execute the exploit against the application.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Regularly update all dependencies to the latest versions.
    *   Use a dependency scanning tool to automatically identify known vulnerabilities.
    *   Establish a process for quickly patching vulnerable dependencies, especially those with publicly available exploits.
    *   Consider using a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Kratos Configuration/Dependency -> Misconfigured Registry -> Service Discovery Fail (Leads to DoS/Spoofing) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_kratos_configurationdependency_-_misconfigured_registry_-_service_discovery_fail__leads_to_d_186848e5.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits a misconfiguration in the service registry (e.g., Consul, etcd, Kubernetes) used by Kratos. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) if services cannot be discovered, or to a spoofing attack if the attacker can register a malicious service that impersonates a legitimate one.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Assuming *some* registry security is in place)
*   **Impact:** High (DoS or the ability to intercept/modify traffic to legitimate services)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires gaining access to and manipulating the service registry)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring the service registry for unauthorized changes and unusual activity)
*   **Attack Steps:**
    1.  Identify the service registry used by the application.
    2.  Gain access to the registry (e.g., through exposed API endpoints, weak credentials, or vulnerabilities in the registry itself).
    3.  For DoS: Deregister legitimate services or flood the registry with bogus entries.
    4.  For Spoofing: Register a malicious service with the same name as a legitimate service, potentially redirecting traffic to the attacker's control.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Secure the service registry using strong authentication and authorization.
    *   Restrict network access to the registry.
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for unauthorized changes to the registry.
    *   Use TLS for communication with the registry.
    *   Regularly audit the registry configuration.
    *   Implement health checks for registered services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Kratos Middleware -> AuthN Bypass (Custom) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_kratos_middleware_-_authn_bypass__custom___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker bypasses the application's custom authentication logic, gaining unauthorized access without valid credentials. This often involves exploiting flaws in the custom implementation.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Higher risk due to potential implementation errors in custom code)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Full unauthorized access to the application)
*   **Effort:** Low (If vulnerabilities exist in the custom logic)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires code review, security testing, and analyzing authentication logs)
*   **Attack Steps:**
    1.  Analyze the custom authentication logic (through source code review, reverse engineering, or black-box testing).
    2.  Identify vulnerabilities in the implementation (e.g., improper input validation, flawed session management, weak cryptography).
    3.  Craft an exploit to bypass the authentication mechanism (e.g., injecting malicious input, forging tokens, manipulating session data).
    4.  Use the exploit to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Whenever possible, use Kratos' built-in authentication mechanisms (JWT, OIDC) instead of custom implementations.
    *   If custom authentication is necessary, follow security best practices rigorously:
        *   Use strong, well-vetted cryptographic libraries.
        *   Implement robust input validation.
        *   Securely manage sessions.
        *   Protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).
    *   Thoroughly review and test the custom authentication logic, including penetration testing and fuzzing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Kratos Middleware -> AuthZ Bypass (Custom) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_kratos_middleware_-_authz_bypass__custom___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker bypasses the application's custom authorization logic, gaining access to resources or functionality they should not be authorized to use. This often involves exploiting flaws in the custom implementation.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Higher risk due to potential implementation errors in custom code)
*   **Impact:** High (Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality)
*   **Effort:** Low (If vulnerabilities exist in the custom logic)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires code review, security testing, and analyzing authorization logs)
*   **Attack Steps:**
    1.  Analyze the custom authorization logic.
    2.  Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., improper access control checks, flawed role-based access control implementation).
    3.  Craft an exploit to bypass the authorization checks (e.g., manipulating input parameters, forging requests).
    4.  Use the exploit to gain unauthorized access to resources or functionality.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Whenever possible, use Kratos' built-in authorization mechanisms (RBAC, Casbin) instead of custom implementations.
    *   If custom authorization is necessary, follow security best practices:
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege.
        *   Enforce authorization checks at every relevant point in the application.
        *   Validate all user input.
        *   Protect against common web vulnerabilities.
    *   Thoroughly review and test the custom authorization logic.
