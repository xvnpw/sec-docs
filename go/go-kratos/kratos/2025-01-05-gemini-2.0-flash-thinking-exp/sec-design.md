* **External Actors:** Represent entities interacting with the Kratos application, including external clients and other microservices.
* **Presentation Layer:** Handles incoming requests via gRPC and HTTP, responsible for serialization, deserialization, and protocol-specific concerns.
* **Application Layer:** Contains the application's core logic, orchestrating business processes and interacting with the domain and infrastructure layers.
* **Domain Layer:** Represents the core business concepts and rules, independent of any specific framework or technology.
* **Infrastructure Layer:** Provides abstractions for interacting with external systems, databases, and cross-cutting concerns like middleware, metrics, tracing, and logging.
* **External Infrastructure Services:** External dependencies required by the Kratos application for service discovery, configuration, monitoring, tracing, logging, and data persistence.

## 4. Detailed Component Design

This section provides a more granular description of the key components within a typical Kratos application instance, highlighting their responsibilities and potential security considerations:

* **gRPC Server:**
    - **Responsibility:**  Handles incoming gRPC requests, manages request lifecycle, and dispatches requests to service implementations.
    - **Security Considerations:** Vulnerable to gRPC-specific attacks if not configured correctly (e.g., denial-of-service through resource exhaustion, insecure metadata handling). Requires secure TLS configuration.
* **HTTP Server:**
    - **Responsibility:** Handles incoming HTTP requests, supports various HTTP methods, and routes requests to appropriate handlers.
    - **Security Considerations:** Subject to standard web application vulnerabilities (e.g., cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), injection attacks). Requires careful handling of headers and request parameters.
* **Middleware Pipeline:**
    - **Responsibility:** Executes a chain of interceptors for requests and responses, handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, authorization, logging, tracing, metrics collection, request validation, and error handling.
    - **Security Considerations:** The order of middleware execution is crucial. Misconfigured middleware can introduce vulnerabilities or bypass security checks. Vulnerable middleware components can be exploited.
* **Service Logic:**
    - **Responsibility:** Implements the specific business logic for each defined service endpoint, orchestrating interactions between the business logic and data access layers.
    - **Security Considerations:**  Potential for business logic flaws that could be exploited. Requires careful input validation and secure data handling.
* **Business Logic:**
    - **Responsibility:** Contains the core application logic and business rules, independent of the presentation or infrastructure layers.
    - **Security Considerations:**  Vulnerable to design flaws that could lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
* **Domain Entities:**
    - **Responsibility:** Represent the core data structures and concepts of the application domain.
    - **Security Considerations:**  Properly defining and protecting domain entities is crucial for data integrity and confidentiality.
* **Domain Services:**
    - **Responsibility:** Encapsulate business logic that operates on domain entities, often involving multiple entities or complex operations.
    - **Security Considerations:**  Requires careful authorization checks to ensure only authorized operations are performed on domain entities.
* **Data Access (Repositories):**
    - **Responsibility:** Provides an abstraction layer for interacting with data sources (databases, caches, etc.), encapsulating data access logic and preventing direct database access from other layers.
    - **Security Considerations:**  Vulnerable to injection attacks if not implemented securely (e.g., SQL injection). Requires secure connection management and proper handling of database credentials.
* **Third-party Integrations:**
    - **Responsibility:** Handles interactions with external services and APIs.
    - **Security Considerations:**  Requires secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for external services. Sensitive data exchanged with third-party services must be protected. Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries can be a risk.
* **Metrics & Tracing SDK:**
    - **Responsibility:** Instruments the application to collect performance metrics and distributed tracing information.
    - **Security Considerations:**  Ensure sensitive data is not inadvertently included in metrics or traces. Secure communication with monitoring and tracing backends is essential.
* **Logging SDK:**
    - **Responsibility:**  Provides a mechanism for logging application events and errors.
    - **Security Considerations:**  Avoid logging sensitive information. Secure storage and access control for log data are crucial.
* **Service Discovery Client:**
    - **Responsibility:** Interacts with the service registry to register the application instance and discover other available services.
    - **Security Considerations:**  Secure communication with the service registry is vital to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized service registration.
* **Configuration Client:**
    - **Responsibility:** Fetches configuration parameters from the configuration server.
    - **Security Considerations:**  Secure retrieval and storage of configuration data, especially sensitive information like API keys and database credentials.
* **Database:**
    - **Responsibility:**  Persists application data.
    - **Security Considerations:**  Requires strong authentication and authorization, encryption at rest and in transit, and regular security patching.

## 5. Data Flow

A more detailed request flow within a Kratos application instance can be described as follows, highlighting the data transformations and potential security checkpoints:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ExternalActor as Client
    participant PresentationLayer as "Presentation\n(gRPC/HTTP Server)"
    participant MiddlewarePipeline as "Middleware\nPipeline"
    participant ApplicationLayer as "Application\n(Service Logic)"
    participant DomainLayer as "Domain\n(Business Logic)"
    participant InfrastructureLayer as "Infrastructure\n(Data Access)"
    participant Database

    Client->>PresentationLayer: Incoming Request (gRPC/HTTP)
    PresentationLayer->>MiddlewarePipeline: Request Received
    loop Middleware Execution
        MiddlewarePipeline->>MiddlewarePipeline: Apply Middleware (e.g., AuthN, AuthZ, Validation, Logging)
    end
    MiddlewarePipeline->>ApplicationLayer: Route to Service Handler
    ApplicationLayer->>DomainLayer: Invoke Business Logic
    DomainLayer->>InfrastructureLayer: Request Data Operation
    InfrastructureLayer->>Database: Execute Query/Command
    Database-->>InfrastructureLayer: Data Response
    InfrastructureLayer-->>DomainLayer: Return Data
    DomainLayer-->>ApplicationLayer: Return Result
    ApplicationLayer->>MiddlewarePipeline: Response Ready
    loop Middleware Execution
        MiddlewarePipeline->>MiddlewarePipeline: Apply Middleware (e.g., Logging, Metrics)
    end
    MiddlewarePipeline->>PresentationLayer: Send Response
    PresentationLayer-->>Client: Response (gRPC/HTTP)
```

* **Client initiates a request:** An external actor sends a request to the Kratos application via gRPC or HTTP.
* **Presentation Layer receives the request:** The gRPC or HTTP server receives the incoming request and handles protocol-specific aspects.
* **Middleware Pipeline processing:** The request passes through the configured middleware pipeline, where various security checks and transformations can occur (e.g., authentication, authorization, input validation, logging).
* **Request routing:** The appropriate service handler in the Application Layer is determined based on the request.
* **Application Layer logic:** The Service Logic orchestrates the execution of the Business Logic in the Domain Layer.
* **Domain Layer processing:** The Business Logic performs the core application logic, potentially interacting with Domain Entities and Services.
* **Infrastructure Layer interaction:** The Domain Layer interacts with the Infrastructure Layer (specifically Repositories) to perform data access operations.
* **Database interaction:** The Data Access Layer executes queries or commands against the database.
* **Response flow:** The data flows back through the layers, with middleware potentially processing the response before it's sent back to the client.

## 6. Security Considerations (For Threat Modeling) - Enhanced

This section provides a more detailed breakdown of security considerations, categorized for clarity during threat modeling:

* **Authentication and Authorization:**
