## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit gRPC Service Vulnerabilities -> gRPC Metadata Manipulation -> Inject malicious metadata to bypass authentication/authorization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_grpc_service_vulnerabilities_-_grpc_metadata_manipulation_-_inject_malicious_metadata_to_byp_06b855bf.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in how gRPC services handle metadata. By crafting malicious metadata, they aim to bypass authentication or authorization checks, gaining unauthorized access to protected resources or functionalities.
    - Likelihood: Medium (if metadata is trusted).
    - Impact: Critical.
    - Effort: Medium.
    - Skill Level: Medium.
    - Detection Difficulty: Difficult.

## Attack Tree Path: [gRPC Reflection Abuse (if enabled) -> Construct and send arbitrary gRPC requests](./attack_tree_paths/grpc_reflection_abuse__if_enabled__-_construct_and_send_arbitrary_grpc_requests.md)

- Attack Vector: If gRPC reflection is enabled in production, attackers can discover the service's methods and parameters. This knowledge allows them to construct and send arbitrary gRPC requests, potentially bypassing intended access controls and exploiting internal functionalities.
    - Likelihood: High (if reflection enabled).
    - Impact: Critical.
    - Effort: Medium.
    - Skill Level: Medium.
    - Detection Difficulty: Difficult.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Kratos Middleware Misconfigurations or Vulnerabilities -> Authentication/Authorization Bypass -> Exploit weaknesses in custom authentication/authorization middleware](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_kratos_middleware_misconfigurations_or_vulnerabilities_-_authenticationauthorization_bypass__e0f0e2b6.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers identify and exploit flaws or weaknesses in custom-built authentication or authorization middleware within the Kratos application. This could involve logic errors, insecure coding practices, or improper handling of authentication tokens.
    - Likelihood: Medium (depends on implementation quality).
    - Impact: Critical.
    - Effort: Medium.
    - Skill Level: Medium.
    - Detection Difficulty: Difficult.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Kratos Middleware Misconfigurations or Vulnerabilities -> Authentication/Authorization Bypass -> Exploit misconfigurations in standard Kratos middleware (e.g., incorrect JWT validation)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_kratos_middleware_misconfigurations_or_vulnerabilities_-_authenticationauthorization_bypass__b54e4143.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers exploit common misconfigurations in standard Kratos middleware, such as incorrect JWT validation. This could involve weaknesses in how JWTs are verified, allowing attackers to forge or manipulate tokens to gain unauthorized access.
    - Likelihood: Medium (common misconfiguration).
    - Impact: Critical.
    - Effort: Low.
    - Skill Level: Low.
    - Detection Difficulty: Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Kratos Configuration Management -> Access Exposed Configuration Files -> Gain access to configuration files containing sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_kratos_configuration_management_-_access_exposed_configuration_files_-_gain_access_to_configur_fa91f53f.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers gain unauthorized access to configuration files that contain sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or other secrets. This access could be due to insecure file permissions, misconfigured web servers, or other vulnerabilities.
    - Likelihood: Medium (depends on file system permissions and deployment practices).
    - Impact: Critical.
    - Effort: Low.
    - Skill Level: Low.
    - Detection Difficulty: Easy (if proper monitoring is in place).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies Introduced by Kratos -> Vulnerable gRPC Libraries -> Exploit known vulnerabilities in the specific gRPC implementation used by Kratos](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_introduced_by_kratos_-_vulnerable_grpc_libraries_-_exploit_known_vulnerabilitie_d8233c73.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers exploit known security vulnerabilities present in the specific version of the gRPC library used by the Kratos application. This could lead to remote code execution or other severe consequences.
    - Likelihood: Low to Medium (depends on library age and patching).
    - Impact: Critical (potential for RCE).
    - Effort: Medium.
    - Skill Level: Medium to High (depending on the vulnerability).
    - Detection Difficulty: Difficult.

## Attack Tree Path: [gRPC Metadata Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/grpc_metadata_manipulation.md)

- Attack Description:  Manipulating gRPC metadata to bypass security checks or trigger unintended behavior.
    - Impact: Critical (potential for full authentication bypass).

## Attack Tree Path: [gRPC Reflection Abuse (if enabled)](./attack_tree_paths/grpc_reflection_abuse__if_enabled_.md)

- Attack Description: Using gRPC reflection (if enabled in production) to discover service details and craft arbitrary requests.
    - Impact: Critical (allows for deep understanding and exploitation of the API).

## Attack Tree Path: [Poison Service Registry](./attack_tree_paths/poison_service_registry.md)

- Attack Description: Injecting malicious service endpoint information into the service discovery registry.
    - Impact: Critical (can redirect traffic to attacker-controlled services).

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/authenticationauthorization_bypass.md)

- Attack Description: Successfully circumventing the application's authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - Impact: Critical (grants unauthorized access to protected resources).

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Exposed Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/access_exposed_configuration_files.md)

- Attack Description: Gaining unauthorized access to configuration files containing sensitive secrets.
    - Impact: Critical (exposure of credentials can lead to widespread compromise).

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable gRPC Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_grpc_libraries.md)

- Attack Description: Exploiting known security flaws in the gRPC library.
    - Impact: Critical (potential for remote code execution).

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Protocol Buffer Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_protocol_buffer_libraries.md)

- Attack Description: Exploiting known security flaws in the protocol buffer library.
    - Impact: High (potential for DoS or code execution).
