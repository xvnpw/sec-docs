# Threat Model Analysis for go-kratos/kratos

## Threat: [Service Impersonation](./threats/service_impersonation.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious service, potentially leveraging vulnerabilities in Kratos's service discovery integration or lack of enforced authentication, falsely identifies itself as a legitimate service within the Kratos ecosystem. Other Kratos services, relying on the framework's service discovery mechanisms, are then routed to the attacker's service. The attacker can intercept requests, steal data, or send malicious responses.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, manipulation of business logic, denial of service by disrupting legitimate service interactions, and potential compromise of other services that trust the impersonated service.
    *   **Affected Kratos Component:** Service Discovery (`registry` package, potential weaknesses in default implementations or developer misconfigurations when using integrations like etcd/Consul), potentially gRPC client-side load balancing if it doesn't perform sufficient verification beyond the registry data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization mechanisms between Kratos services using gRPC interceptors provided by the framework or custom implementations.
        *   If using external service discovery, ensure its security is robust and that Kratos services are configured to securely interact with it.
        *   Implement mechanisms within Kratos services to verify the identity of other services they communicate with (e.g., using mTLS with certificate validation within gRPC).
        *   Regularly audit and monitor service registrations and communication patterns within the Kratos application.

## Threat: [Insecure Inter-Service Communication Eavesdropping](./threats/insecure_inter-service_communication_eavesdropping.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between Kratos services, facilitated by the framework's gRPC integration, is not properly encrypted. An attacker intercepting network traffic can eavesdrop on the data being exchanged, revealing sensitive information. This is a direct consequence of not configuring the gRPC transport layer securely within Kratos.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential data breaches, exposure of sensitive credentials leading to further compromise, and potential violation of data privacy regulations.
    *   **Affected Kratos Component:** gRPC transport layer configuration within Kratos services (how `transport.ServerOption` and `transport.DialOption` are used, specifically related to TLS configuration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS (Transport Layer Security) for all inter-service communication by properly configuring gRPC server and client options within Kratos.
        *   Ensure `grpc.WithTransportCredentials` is used with secure credentials (e.g., `credentials.NewTLS`).
        *   Regularly review and update TLS certificates used by Kratos services.
        *   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication and encryption, configuring the appropriate gRPC credentials within Kratos.

## Threat: [gRPC Metadata Manipulation](./threats/grpc_metadata_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts or manipulates gRPC metadata exchanged between Kratos services. This metadata, handled by Kratos's gRPC interceptor system, can contain authentication tokens, tracing information, or routing hints. Exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in custom interceptors or the framework's default handling could allow attackers to bypass authorization, impersonate users, or redirect requests.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, privilege escalation within the Kratos application, data breaches, and disruption of service functionality.
    *   **Affected Kratos Component:** gRPC interceptors (`middleware` package, specifically `UnaryServerInterceptor` and `StreamServerInterceptor`), potentially custom interceptor implementations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust validation and sanitization of gRPC metadata within Kratos interceptors.
        *   Sign and verify sensitive metadata to prevent tampering, potentially using cryptographic libraries within custom interceptors.
        *   Use secure and authenticated channels for metadata exchange (implicitly provided by properly configured TLS).
        *   Carefully review and validate metadata received from other services within interceptor logic.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in easily manipulable metadata fields.

## Threat: [Vulnerable or Misconfigured Middleware](./threats/vulnerable_or_misconfigured_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** Custom middleware developed for Kratos services, or misconfigurations in the middleware chain, introduce security vulnerabilities. This directly impacts the request processing pipeline within Kratos services.
    *   **Impact:** Various security vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the flaw in the middleware, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service within the Kratos application.
    *   **Affected Kratos Component:** `middleware` package, custom middleware implementations used within Kratos services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test all custom middleware developed for Kratos for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing middleware components within the Kratos framework.
        *   Carefully configure the order and logic of the middleware chain to avoid security bypasses.
        *   Implement security scanning and static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in custom middleware used within Kratos.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive configuration data required by Kratos services, such as database credentials or API keys, is stored insecurely. This could involve hardcoding secrets in the code managed by Kratos, storing them in unencrypted configuration files loaded by Kratos, or exposing them through logging configured within Kratos.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the affected Kratos service and potentially other related systems. Attackers can gain unauthorized access to databases, external APIs, or other sensitive resources.
    *   **Affected Kratos Component:** Configuration management within Kratos services (how configuration is loaded and accessed, potentially involving libraries used by Kratos for configuration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize secure secret management solutions and integrate them with Kratos (e.g., using environment variable injection or dedicated secret management libraries).
        *   Avoid hardcoding secrets in the application code managed by Kratos.
        *   Store configuration data securely, encrypting sensitive values at rest, especially when using configuration files loaded by Kratos.
        *   Sanitize logs generated by Kratos services to prevent the accidental exposure of sensitive information.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on Kratos CLI Tooling](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_kratos_cli_tooling.md)

*   **Description:** The Kratos CLI tool itself, provided by the Kratos project, or its dependencies are compromised, injecting malicious code. When developers use the compromised CLI to interact with their Kratos projects, their development environments could be compromised, potentially leading to the introduction of vulnerabilities into the application being built.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of developer machines, introduction of backdoors or other malicious code into Kratos applications, and potential downstream supply chain attacks.
    *   **Affected Kratos Component:** `kratos` CLI tool and its dependencies managed by the Kratos project.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Download the Kratos CLI from the official GitHub releases and verify its integrity (e.g., using checksums provided by the Kratos project).
        *   Keep the Kratos CLI and its dependencies up-to-date.
        *   Be cautious about installing unofficial or modified versions of the Kratos CLI.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the CLI's dependencies.
