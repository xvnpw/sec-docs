# Attack Surface Analysis for go-kratos/kratos

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default CORS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_cors_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings dictate which origins are allowed to make requests to the application.
    *   **How Kratos Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If not explicitly configured, Kratos might have overly permissive default CORS settings or developers might not configure it correctly when setting up HTTP servers within Kratos.
    *   **Example:** A malicious website hosted on an attacker's domain is able to make requests to the Kratos application due to a wildcard (`*`) in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, potentially leading to data exfiltration or unauthorized actions.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities become more exploitable, potential data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Explicitly configure CORS with a whitelist of allowed origins within the Kratos HTTP server configuration.
        *   Avoid using wildcards (`*`) for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in production.
        *   Carefully consider the necessary allowed methods and headers when configuring CORS in Kratos.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Service Registry Communication](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_service_registry_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Kratos applications often rely on service registries (like etcd, Consul, Nacos) for service discovery.
    *   **How Kratos Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Kratos integrates with these registries, and if the communication between the Kratos application and the registry is not secured (e.g., using plain HTTP instead of HTTPS, no authentication), it introduces a risk. Kratos's service discovery clients need to be configured to use secure connections.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts communication between the Kratos application and the service registry and is able to read sensitive information about registered services or even manipulate the registry by adding or removing services, impacting service discovery within the Kratos application.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, potential redirection of traffic to malicious services, information disclosure about the application's architecture.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable authentication and authorization for access to the service registry, configuring Kratos's service discovery client with the necessary credentials.
        *   Use secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS) for communication between the Kratos application and the registry, ensuring Kratos's client is configured to use HTTPS/TLS.
        *   Restrict network access to the service registry to only authorized components.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Remote Configuration Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_remote_configuration_management.md)

*   **Description:** If Kratos is configured to fetch configuration from remote sources, the security of these sources is critical.
    *   **How Kratos Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Kratos provides mechanisms for integrating with remote configuration sources. If these integrations are not configured to use secure protocols (like HTTPS) or if the remote sources themselves are not secured, it introduces a risk directly tied to Kratos's configuration management features.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the remote configuration repository and modifies application settings that are then loaded by the Kratos application, potentially disabling security features or redirecting traffic.
    *   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the remote configuration sources with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   Configure Kratos to use encrypted communication channels (e.g., HTTPS) for fetching configurations.
        *   Implement version control and auditing for configuration changes.
        *   Consider using secrets management solutions for sensitive configuration data accessed through Kratos's configuration mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Kratos Middleware Implementations (Specifically impacting Kratos's request handling)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_kratos_middleware_implementations__specifically_impacting_kratos's_request_handli_796d5170.md)

*   **Description:** Custom middleware or interceptors developed for Kratos applications might contain security vulnerabilities that directly impact how Kratos handles incoming requests or outgoing responses.
    *   **How Kratos Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Kratos provides the framework and interfaces for building and integrating middleware. Vulnerabilities in these custom components that manipulate the request/response flow within Kratos are directly relevant.
    *   **Example:** A custom authentication middleware integrated into the Kratos pipeline has a flaw that allows bypassing authentication checks, granting unauthorized access to resources handled by Kratos.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, potential compromise of the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom middleware within the Kratos framework.
        *   Conduct thorough security reviews and testing of custom middleware integrated into the Kratos request processing pipeline.
        *   Leverage well-vetted and community-tested middleware components where possible within the Kratos ecosystem.
