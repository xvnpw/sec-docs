# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for go-kratos/kratos

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Service-to-Service Authentication and Authorization using Kratos Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/implement_service-to-service_authentication_and_authorization_using_kratos_middleware.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Kratos Middleware for Authentication/Authorization:** Select or develop a Kratos middleware component (for gRPC or HTTP) to handle authentication and authorization. Kratos provides flexibility to integrate various mechanisms. Examples include JWT validation middleware or custom middleware for API key verification.
    2.  **Configure Middleware in Kratos Services:**  In your Kratos service's `server` configuration (for gRPC or HTTP), register the chosen authentication/authorization middleware. This middleware will intercept incoming requests.
    3.  **Implement Token/Key Verification Logic in Middleware:** Within the middleware, implement the logic to verify authentication tokens (e.g., JWT signature verification, API key lookup) extracted from request headers or metadata.
    4.  **Implement Authorization Logic in Middleware or Service Handlers:**  Optionally, within the middleware, or in the service's handler functions, implement authorization logic to check if the authenticated service has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource or operation. This can involve role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).
    5.  **Utilize Kratos Context for Passing Authentication Information:**  Leverage the Kratos context to pass authentication and authorization information from the middleware to the service handlers. This allows handlers to access the identity of the calling service and make authorization decisions.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Internal APIs (High Severity):**  Without proper authentication and authorization, any service within the network, even compromised ones, could access internal APIs of other services.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):**  Lack of granular authorization can lead to services performing actions beyond their intended scope, resulting in privilege escalation.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):**  If one service is compromised, absent service-to-service authorization facilitates lateral movement to other services.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Internal APIs:** Significant risk reduction. Kratos middleware enforces authentication and authorization at the application layer, preventing unauthorized access even if network security is bypassed.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Moderate risk reduction. Middleware-based authorization can implement fine-grained policies, limiting service actions and mitigating privilege escalation.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Moderate risk reduction. Authorization checks at each service boundary, enforced by Kratos middleware, make lateral movement more difficult.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Basic API key authentication middleware is used for some internal HTTP APIs in certain services. JWT-based middleware for gRPC and comprehensive authorization policies are missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **JWT Authentication Middleware for gRPC:** Develop and implement a Kratos gRPC middleware for JWT-based authentication.
    *   **Centralized Authorization Logic (Optional, using Middleware):**  Design middleware to integrate with a centralized authorization service (if desired) or implement authorization logic directly within the middleware.
    *   **Consistent Middleware Application:** Ensure the authentication/authorization middleware is consistently applied to all relevant Kratos services and API endpoints (both gRPC and HTTP).
    *   **Context-based Authorization in Handlers:**  Refactor service handlers to leverage the Kratos context to access authentication information and perform context-aware authorization checks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting and Request Throttling using Kratos Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_and_request_throttling_using_kratos_middleware.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Kratos Rate Limiting Middleware:** Select or develop a Kratos middleware component (for gRPC or HTTP) for rate limiting and request throttling. Kratos middleware can easily integrate with rate limiting libraries or services.
    2.  **Configure Middleware in API Gateway (or Services):** Register the rate limiting middleware in the Kratos API Gateway service (or individual backend services if needed).
    3.  **Define Rate Limit Policies in Middleware Configuration:** Configure the middleware with rate limit policies. These policies can be based on various criteria such as:
        *   Requests per second/minute/hour.
        *   Requests per IP address.
        *   Requests per user ID (if authenticated).
    4.  **Customize Rate Limiting Logic (Optional):**  Customize the middleware logic to handle rate limit violations. This might involve returning specific HTTP status codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests), logging rate limit events, or implementing more sophisticated backoff strategies.
    5.  **Utilize Kratos Context for Rate Limiting Keys (Optional):**  If rate limiting is based on user ID or other dynamic criteria, use the Kratos context to extract this information and use it as keys for rate limiting.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity):** Without rate limiting, the application is vulnerable to DoS attacks where attackers flood the service with requests, overwhelming resources and causing service unavailability.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting can slow down brute-force attacks against authentication endpoints or other sensitive APIs by limiting the number of login attempts or requests from a single source.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**  Uncontrolled request volume can lead to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, database connections) even from legitimate users or misbehaving clients.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** Significant risk reduction. Rate limiting effectively mitigates many types of DoS attacks by limiting the rate of incoming requests, preventing resource exhaustion.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Moderate risk reduction. Rate limiting makes brute-force attacks slower and less effective, increasing the time and resources required for successful attacks.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Moderate risk reduction. Rate limiting helps protect backend services from being overwhelmed by excessive request volume, ensuring stability and availability.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Basic rate limiting middleware is used in the API Gateway for some public endpoints, but policies are not finely tuned, and rate limiting is not consistently applied across all services or internal APIs.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Comprehensive Rate Limiting Middleware for API Gateway:** Implement robust rate limiting middleware in the API Gateway with configurable policies based on various criteria (IP, user, API endpoint).
    *   **Rate Limiting for Internal Services (Optional):** Consider implementing rate limiting for critical internal services to protect them from overload or abuse from other internal services.
    *   **Dynamic Rate Limit Configuration (Optional):** Explore dynamic rate limit configuration that can be adjusted based on real-time traffic patterns or service load.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting for Rate Limiting:**  Integrate rate limiting middleware with monitoring and alerting systems to track rate limit events and detect potential attacks or misconfigurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Kratos Logging for Security Monitoring](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_kratos_logging_for_security_monitoring.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Kratos Logger for Structured Logging:** Configure the Kratos logger to output logs in a structured format (e.g., JSON). This makes logs easier to parse, search, and analyze for security events.
    2.  **Log Security-Relevant Events in Kratos Middleware and Services:**  Within Kratos middleware (authentication, authorization, rate limiting) and service handlers, log security-relevant events. Examples include:
        *   Authentication attempts (success and failure).
        *   Authorization failures (denied access).
        *   Rate limit violations.
        *   Input validation errors.
        *   Suspicious activity detected.
    3.  **Include Contextual Information in Logs:**  Ensure logs include contextual information relevant for security analysis, such as:
        *   Timestamp.
        *   Service name and instance ID.
        *   Request ID (for tracing).
        *   User ID or service ID (if authenticated).
        *   Source IP address.
        *   Error details.
    4.  **Integrate Kratos Logger with Centralized Logging System:** Configure the Kratos logger to send logs to a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, Grafana Loki).
    5.  **Set up Security Monitoring and Alerting based on Logs:**  Configure the centralized logging system to monitor logs for security-related patterns and trigger alerts for suspicious events.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Delayed Incident Detection and Response (Medium Severity):**  Without proper logging and monitoring, security incidents might go undetected for extended periods, allowing attackers to further compromise the system.
    *   **Insufficient Forensic Information (Medium Severity):**  Lack of detailed security logs hinders incident investigation and forensic analysis, making it difficult to understand the scope and impact of security breaches.
    *   **Inability to Detect Anomalies and Suspicious Behavior (Medium Severity):**  Without centralized logging and monitoring, it's challenging to detect anomalous activity or suspicious patterns that could indicate security threats.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Delayed Incident Detection and Response:** Moderate risk reduction. Kratos logging, when integrated with a centralized system, enables faster detection of security incidents, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers.
    *   **Insufficient Forensic Information:** Moderate risk reduction. Detailed security logs provide valuable forensic information for incident investigation and post-mortem analysis.
    *   **Inability to Detect Anomalies and Suspicious Behavior:** Moderate risk reduction. Centralized logging and monitoring facilitate anomaly detection and proactive identification of potential security threats.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Kratos logging is used for general application logging, but structured logging is not consistently enforced, and security-specific events are not always logged in detail. Integration with a centralized logging system exists, but security monitoring and alerting are basic.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Enforce Structured Logging in Kratos:**  Configure Kratos logger globally to enforce structured logging (e.g., JSON) across all services.
    *   **Comprehensive Security Event Logging:**  Enhance Kratos middleware and service handlers to log all relevant security events with sufficient detail and contextual information.
    *   **Security Monitoring Dashboards and Alerts:**  Develop security monitoring dashboards in the centralized logging system to visualize security events and set up alerts for critical security indicators.
    *   **Log Retention and Archival Policies:**  Establish appropriate log retention and archival policies to ensure security logs are available for investigation and compliance purposes.
