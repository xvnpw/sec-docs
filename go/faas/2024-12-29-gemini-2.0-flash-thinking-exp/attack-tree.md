**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Gateway Vulnerabilities**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in the OpenFaaS Gateway, which acts as the entry point for function invocations.
*   **Underlying Weaknesses:**
    *   **Authentication/Authorization Flaws:**  Lack of proper authentication or authorization checks allows attackers to bypass security and invoke functions without valid credentials or permissions.
    *   **Input Validation Issues:**  Insufficient sanitization or validation of input to the gateway can lead to vulnerabilities like path traversal or command injection, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the gateway itself or during function invocation.
    *   **Insecure Configuration:** Misconfigurations in the gateway setup, such as overly permissive network policies or exposed management interfaces, can provide attackers with unauthorized access.
    *   **Software Vulnerabilities:**  Unpatched or zero-day vulnerabilities in the gateway software can be exploited to gain control.

**High-Risk Path: Compromise Function Deployment Process**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to inject malicious code into the function images or deploy malicious functions directly into the OpenFaaS environment.
*   **Underlying Weaknesses:**
    *   **Compromised CI/CD Pipeline:**  If the CI/CD pipeline used to build and deploy functions is compromised, attackers can inject malicious code into the function images during the build process.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Attackers can introduce vulnerabilities by compromising base images or dependencies used in the function images.
    *   **Lack of Access Control on Deployment:** Insufficient access controls on the function deployment mechanism allow unauthorized users to deploy malicious functions directly.
    *   **Compromised Function Store/Registry:** If the function image registry is compromised, attackers can replace legitimate function images with malicious ones.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Secrets Management**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the mechanisms used to store and manage sensitive information (secrets) used by the functions.
*   **Underlying Weaknesses:**
    *   **Insecure Storage:** Secrets might be stored in plain text or weakly encrypted formats, making them vulnerable to retrieval by attackers who gain access to the storage location.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Secrets Management System:**  The secrets management system itself might have vulnerabilities that allow attackers to bypass access controls and retrieve secrets.

**Critical Node: Compromise OpenFaaS Application**

*   **Attack Vector:** This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker, achieved through successful exploitation of one or more vulnerabilities within the OpenFaaS ecosystem.
*   **Underlying Weaknesses:**  This node is a culmination of all the weaknesses in the underlying components and processes of OpenFaaS.

**Critical Node: Exploit Authentication/Authorization Bypass**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers bypass the security mechanisms intended to verify the identity and permissions of users or services attempting to access the gateway.
*   **Underlying Weaknesses:** Flaws in the authentication logic, weak password policies, or missing authorization checks.

**Critical Node: Exploit Insecure Gateway Configuration**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage misconfigurations in the gateway setup to gain unauthorized access or control.
*   **Underlying Weaknesses:**  Overly permissive network rules, exposed management ports, default credentials, or insecure TLS/SSL settings.

**Critical Node: Exploit Known Gateway Software Vulnerabilities**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the specific version of the OpenFaaS gateway being used.
*   **Underlying Weaknesses:**  Unpatched software, lack of timely updates, or the presence of zero-day vulnerabilities.

**Critical Node: Inject Malicious Code into Function Image**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers insert malicious code into the function image, which will then be executed whenever the function is invoked.
*   **Underlying Weaknesses:** Compromised CI/CD pipeline, vulnerable dependencies, or lack of image integrity checks.

**Critical Node: Compromise CI/CD Pipeline**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain control over the automated process used to build and deploy functions.
*   **Underlying Weaknesses:** Weak authentication to the CI/CD system, insecure storage of credentials, or vulnerabilities in the CI/CD software itself.

**Critical Node: Deploy Malicious Function Directly**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers bypass the standard deployment process and directly deploy a function containing malicious code.
*   **Underlying Weaknesses:** Lack of access controls on the deployment API or command-line interface.

**Critical Node: Tamper with Function Store/Registry**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the function image registry and modify or replace legitimate function images.
*   **Underlying Weaknesses:** Weak authentication to the registry, vulnerabilities in the registry software, or insecure storage of registry credentials.

**Critical Node: Exploit Container Runtime Vulnerabilities**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd) to escape the container sandbox and potentially compromise the host system.
*   **Underlying Weaknesses:** Unpatched container runtime software or misconfigurations in the container runtime environment.

**Critical Node: Retrieve Secrets from Insecure Storage**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain access to locations where secrets are stored insecurely and retrieve sensitive information.
*   **Underlying Weaknesses:** Storing secrets in plain text in configuration files, environment variables, or code repositories.

**Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Secrets Management System**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit security flaws in the dedicated system used to manage and store secrets.
*   **Underlying Weaknesses:** Unpatched secrets management software, weak access controls, or insecure API endpoints.
