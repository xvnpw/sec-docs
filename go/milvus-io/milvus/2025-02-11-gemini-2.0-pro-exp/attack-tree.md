## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate Data](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_data.md)

*   **Critical Node: Unauthorized Access to Data [CN]**
    *   Description: The attacker gains direct access to the vector data stored in Milvus without proper authorization. This is the primary target for data exfiltration.
    *   Impact: Very High - Loss of sensitive data, potential regulatory violations, reputational damage.

*   **High-Risk Path: Unauthorized Access to Data -> Weak Credentials [HR]**
    *   Description: The attacker uses weak, easily guessable, or compromised passwords to gain access to Milvus accounts with data access privileges.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Mitigation:
        *   Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, regular changes).
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        *   Monitor login attempts for suspicious activity (e.g., multiple failed logins).

*   **High-Risk Path: Unauthorized Access to Data -> Default Credentials [HR]**
    *   Description: The attacker uses default credentials that were not changed after the initial Milvus installation.
    *   Likelihood: Low (assuming basic security practices are followed)
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Very Low
    *   Skill Level: Very Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low
    *   Mitigation:
        *   Mandatory change of default credentials upon installation.
        *   Automated checks for default credentials during deployment.

*   **High-Risk Path: Unauthorized Access to Data -> Exploit Known Milvus CVEs -> Unpatched Milvus Version [HR]**
    *   Description: The attacker exploits a publicly known vulnerability (CVE) in an unpatched version of Milvus to gain unauthorized access to data.
    *   Likelihood: Medium (depends on patch management practices)
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Mitigation:
        *   Establish a robust vulnerability management program.
        *   Regularly update Milvus to the latest stable version.
        *   Subscribe to Milvus security advisories.
        *   Use vulnerability scanners to identify unpatched systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Service](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_service.md)

*   **High-Risk Path: Disrupt Service -> DDoS [HR]**
    *   Description: The attacker overwhelms the Milvus service with a large volume of requests, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   Likelihood: High
    *   Impact: Medium
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low
    *   Mitigation:
        *   Implement rate limiting.
        *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with DDoS protection capabilities.
        *   Deploy Milvus behind a load balancer.
        *   Consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to distribute traffic.

*   **High-Risk Path: Disrupt Service -> Resource Exhaustion -> High Query Load [HR]**
    *   Description: The attacker sends a large number of complex or resource-intensive queries to Milvus, consuming excessive CPU, memory, or disk resources, leading to service degradation or unavailability.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Medium
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Mitigation:
        *   Implement query quotas and resource limits.
        *   Monitor resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.
        *   Optimize queries for performance.
        *   Implement query timeouts.
        *   Consider using a query analysis tool to identify and block malicious queries.
