## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Milvus](./mitigation_strategies/strict_role-based_access_control__rbac__within_milvus.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Milvus

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Roles:** Define distinct roles based on user responsibilities within Milvus (e.g., `data_ingestor`, `query_user`, `admin`, `read_only_analyst`).
    2.  **Define Permissions:** For each role, meticulously list the *minimum* required Milvus operations using Milvus's RBAC system.  Map operations to specific permissions (e.g., `CreateCollection`, `Insert`, `Search`, `DropCollection`, `DescribeCollection`, `LoadCollection`, `ReleaseCollection`). *Crucially*, limit access to specific collections or even partitions where possible.
    3.  **Create Users and Assign Roles:** Create Milvus users and assign them to the pre-defined roles using Milvus's user management commands.  *Never* use default credentials.
    4.  **Regular Audit:** At least quarterly, review all roles, permissions, and user assignments within Milvus. Remove any unnecessary privileges or inactive users.
    5.  **Enable Authentication:** Ensure that authentication is enabled in the Milvus configuration (`common.security.authorizationEnabled: true`).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Milvus Components:** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents unauthorized users from directly interacting with Milvus components.
    *   **Data Exfiltration via Malicious Queries (within Milvus's capabilities):** (Severity: High) - Limits the scope of data accessible even if a user gains unauthorized access.
    *   **Insider Threat (Malicious User with Milvus Credentials):** (Severity: High) - Restricts the actions a malicious insider can perform within Milvus.
    *   **Accidental Data Modification/Deletion (within Milvus):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents users from accidentally deleting or modifying data they shouldn't have access to.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (from Critical to Low/Negligible).
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Medium/Low).
    *   **Insider Threat:** Risk reduced (from High to Medium).
    *   **Accidental Modification:** Risk significantly reduced (from Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented (Hypothetical Example):**
    *   Basic roles (`admin`, `read-only`) are defined in `milvus.yaml`.
    *   Authentication is enabled.
    *   Users are created and assigned to these roles.

*   **Missing Implementation (Hypothetical Example):**
    *   Granular permissions are not fully utilized. Roles have broad access.
    *   No regular audit process is documented or followed.
    *   Roles are not defined for specific tasks like data ingestion, with fine-grained collection/partition access.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Quotas and Limits (within Milvus Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_quotas_and_limits__within_milvus_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Resource Quotas and Limits (within Milvus Configuration)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Baseline Usage:** Observe Milvus's resource consumption (CPU, memory, connections) under normal operating conditions using Milvus's monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana).
    2.  **Set Limits:** Configure Milvus's resource limits directly in `milvus.yaml`. This includes:
        *   `queryNode.resource.maxMemory`: Maximum memory a query node can use.
        *   `dataNode.resource.maxMemory`: Maximum memory a data node can use.
        *   `indexNode.resource.maxMemory`: Maximum memory an index node can use.
        *   `proxy.maxConnections`: Maximum number of client connections.
        *   `common.retentionDuration`: How long to keep deleted data before purging.
    3.  **Alerting (via Milvus Monitoring):** Configure alerts within Milvus's monitoring system (Prometheus, Grafana) to trigger when resource usage approaches the defined limits.
    4.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review and adjust the limits based on observed usage and performance, directly within the Milvus configuration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (targeting Milvus directly):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents a single client or query from consuming all available Milvus resources.
    *   **System Instability (within Milvus):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents resource exhaustion from causing Milvus components to crash.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).
    *   **System Instability:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented (Hypothetical Example):**
    *   Default resource limits are set in `milvus.yaml`.

*   **Missing Implementation (Hypothetical Example):**
    *   Limits are not tuned to the specific workload.
    *   Alerting within Milvus's monitoring is not fully configured for resource usage.
    *   No regular review of resource limits within the Milvus configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Auditing and Monitoring (using Milvus's built-in features)](./mitigation_strategies/auditing_and_monitoring__using_milvus's_built-in_features_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Auditing and Monitoring (using Milvus's built-in features)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Audit Logging:** Configure Milvus to enable its built-in audit logging feature.  This involves setting specific parameters in `milvus.yaml` (refer to the Milvus documentation for the exact settings, as they may change between versions).
    2.  **Log Destination (within Milvus config):** If Milvus supports configuring a specific log destination *within its configuration*, set this to a secure location.  If not, this becomes an infrastructure-level concern.
    3.  **Log Rotation and Retention (within Milvus config):** If Milvus offers built-in log rotation and retention settings, configure these appropriately within `milvus.yaml`.
    4. **Alerting (via Milvus Monitoring):** Configure alerts within Milvus's monitoring system (Prometheus, Grafana) based on specific audit log events, if the monitoring system supports this directly.
    5.  **Regular Review (of Milvus-generated logs):** Regularly review the audit logs generated *directly by Milvus* to identify suspicious activity.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Insider Threat (Malicious or Negligent User with Milvus Credentials):** (Severity: High) - Provides a record of user actions within Milvus.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (detectable within Milvus):** (Severity: High) - Can help detect unauthorized data access.
    *   **Unauthorized Access Attempts (to Milvus):** (Severity: Medium) - Logs failed login attempts.
    *   **Security Incident Investigation (related to Milvus):** (Severity: All) - Provides evidence for investigating Milvus-specific incidents.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Insider Threat:** Risk detection improved.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk detection improved.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk detection improved.
    *   **Incident Investigation:** Improves investigation capabilities for Milvus-related issues.

*   **Currently Implemented (Hypothetical Example):**
    *   Basic Milvus logs are enabled, but not audit logs.

*   **Missing Implementation (Hypothetical Example):**
    *   Audit logging is not enabled within Milvus.
    *   Alerting within Milvus's monitoring is not configured for audit log events.
    *   No regular review process for Milvus-generated audit logs.
