# Attack Surface Analysis for milvus-io/milvus

## Attack Surface: [gRPC Endpoint Exposure](./attack_surfaces/grpc_endpoint_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Milvus's core functionality relies on exposed gRPC endpoints for internal component communication and external client access.  These endpoints are fundamental to Milvus's operation.
*   **Milvus Contribution:** Milvus *creates and exposes* these gRPC endpoints as part of its architecture.  The design of Milvus necessitates this exposure.
*   **Example:** An attacker directly connects to a Milvus query node's gRPC port (bypassing any application-level security) and attempts to execute unauthorized queries or inject malicious data, exploiting a lack of authentication or a vulnerability in Milvus's gRPC handling.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, denial of service, potential remote code execution (if vulnerabilities exist in Milvus's gRPC implementation).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on authentication/authorization configuration and the presence of unpatched vulnerabilities).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Use firewalls and network policies (e.g., Kubernetes NetworkPolicies) to *strictly* limit access to Milvus gRPC endpoints. Only allow connections from authorized clients and other Milvus components *within the cluster*.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Enforce strong authentication (e.g., mutual TLS, JWT) and fine-grained authorization (RBAC) on *all* Milvus gRPC endpoints.  This is a *Milvus configuration* task.
    *   **TLS Encryption:** Use TLS to encrypt *all* gRPC communication, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. This is configured *within Milvus*.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Milvus itself (and its embedded gRPC library) updated to the latest versions to patch any security vulnerabilities. This is crucial for mitigating vulnerabilities *within Milvus's code*.
    *   **Service Mesh (Optional but Recommended):** Consider using a service mesh like Istio or Linkerd for advanced traffic management, security (including mTLS and authorization policies), and observability of gRPC communication *specifically for Milvus*.

## Attack Surface: [Metadata Store Compromise](./attack_surfaces/metadata_store_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Milvus *depends entirely* on the integrity and availability of its metadata store (etcd, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) for managing all information about collections, partitions, segments, and access control.
*   **Milvus Contribution:** Milvus *writes to and reads from* this metadata store constantly.  The correctness of Milvus's operation is directly tied to the data in this store.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises the etcd cluster used by Milvus and modifies metadata to point to malicious data files, disable authentication, or grant themselves administrator privileges *within Milvus*.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, denial of service, unauthorized data access, complete system compromise *of Milvus*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure the Metadata Store:** Apply standard database security best practices to the chosen metadata store. This is *essential* for Milvus's security.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the metadata store on a separate network segment with *extremely* restricted access, allowing connections *only from Milvus components*.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Enforce strong authentication and authorization for access to the metadata store, *specifically limiting Milvus's access* to the minimum required.
    *   **Encryption:** Use encryption at rest and in transit for the metadata store. This protects the data *used by Milvus*.
    *   **Regular Backups:** Implement regular, secure backups of the metadata store to enable recovery from compromise or data loss. This is crucial for *Milvus data recovery*.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor the metadata store for suspicious activity and unauthorized access attempts, *specifically looking for changes that could affect Milvus*.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** Milvus uses serialization and deserialization for internal data transfer and when interacting with data stored in object storage. This is *intrinsic to Milvus's data handling*.
*   **Milvus Contribution:** Milvus's *own code* performs the serialization and deserialization. Vulnerabilities here are *within Milvus itself*.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized *by Milvus*, executes arbitrary code on a Milvus server component.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete system compromise *of Milvus nodes*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Serialization Library:** This is primarily the responsibility of the Milvus developers, but users should ensure they are using a Milvus version with a secure serialization library.
    *   **Input Validation:** Milvus (and any application interacting with it) should validate all data *before* deserialization. This is a shared responsibility.
    *   **Type Whitelisting:** If possible (and supported by Milvus and the serialization library), use type whitelisting to restrict the types of objects that can be deserialized *by Milvus*.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Milvus itself updated to the latest versions to patch any known deserialization vulnerabilities *within Milvus's code*. This is the *most important* mitigation for users.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS) - Milvus Specific Aspects](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__dos__-_milvus_specific_aspects.md)

*   **Description:** Milvus's architecture, with its distributed components and query processing logic, is susceptible to resource exhaustion attacks.
*   **Milvus Contribution:** The *design and implementation of Milvus* determine its resource consumption patterns and vulnerability to DoS.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a flood of complex search queries specifically crafted to exploit inefficiencies in *Milvus's query engine*, overwhelming query nodes and causing a denial of service. Or, an attacker creates a very large number of collections/partitions, exhausting *Milvus's internal metadata management* resources.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (availability loss) *of Milvus*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API requests *to Milvus*. This can be done at the network level or within a proxy in front of Milvus.
    *   **Resource Quotas:** Set resource limits (CPU, memory, connections) on *Milvus components* (using Kubernetes resource limits, for example). This is a *Milvus deployment* configuration.
    *   **Query Complexity Limits:** Limit the complexity of search queries accepted *by Milvus* (e.g., maximum number of results, maximum search radius, limits on filtering expressions). This is a *Milvus configuration* and application-level concern.
    *   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Monitor *Milvus's* resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network bandwidth, connection counts) and configure alerts for high resource consumption *specific to Milvus components*.
    *   **Scalability:** Design the *Milvus deployment* to be scalable, allowing it to handle increased load by adding more resources (e.g., more query nodes, more worker nodes). This is a deployment and architecture consideration.
    *   **Load Testing:** Regularly perform load testing *specifically against Milvus* to identify performance bottlenecks and resource limits *within Milvus*.
