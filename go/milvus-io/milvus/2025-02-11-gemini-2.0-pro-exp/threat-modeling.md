## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via Weak Authentication (Direct Milvus)](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_weak_authentication__direct_milvus_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Access via Weak Authentication (Direct Milvus)

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive vector data and metadata stored within Milvus by exploiting weak or default credentials, or a misconfigured authentication system *within Milvus itself*. The attacker directly interacts with the Milvus API using compromised credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of data confidentiality. Attackers can read, copy, or exfiltrate all data stored in Milvus. This could lead to privacy violations, intellectual property theft, or reputational damage.
    *   **Milvus Component Affected:**
        *   `Proxy`: The entry point for client connections, responsible for authentication.
        *   `RootCoord`: Manages user and role information (if RBAC is enabled).
        *   `Milvus Server` (general): Authentication logic throughout the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce Strong Authentication:** Mandate strong, unique passwords for all Milvus users. Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) if supported by the Milvus version or through an external authentication proxy.
        *   **Disable Default Accounts:** Change or disable any default accounts and passwords immediately after Milvus installation.
        *   **Implement RBAC:** Utilize Milvus's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) features (if available in your version) to grant granular permissions to users and applications, limiting access based on the principle of least privilege.
        *   **Regular Password Audits:** Periodically audit user passwords and enforce password complexity policies.
        *   **Integrate with Identity Provider:** Integrate Milvus with a centralized identity provider (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, OAuth 2.0) for centralized user management and authentication, if supported.

## Threat: [Network Exposure and Direct Attack (Direct Milvus)](./threats/network_exposure_and_direct_attack__direct_milvus_.md)

*   **Threat:** Network Exposure and Direct Attack (Direct Milvus)

    *   **Description:** An attacker directly connects to the Milvus service because the Milvus *network ports* are exposed to the internet or a less-trusted network without proper network segmentation. The attacker bypasses any application-level security controls and interacts directly with the Milvus API, exploiting any weaknesses in the exposed service.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for complete data compromise (read, write, delete) and denial of service. The attacker could exploit any vulnerabilities in the Milvus server directly, without needing to compromise the application layer.
    *   **Milvus Component Affected:**
        *   `Proxy`: The exposed network endpoint.
        *   All Milvus components accessible via the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Milvus within a private network or VPC. Use firewalls (e.g., security groups in cloud environments) and network policies (e.g., Kubernetes NetworkPolicies) to *strictly* limit access to only authorized clients and networks.
        *   **VPN or Private Link:** Use a VPN or private link (e.g., AWS PrivateLink) to establish secure connections to Milvus from client applications, avoiding public internet exposure.
        *   **Never Expose Directly:** Absolutely avoid exposing Milvus *ports* directly to the public internet.
        *   **Ingress Controller (Kubernetes):** If deploying in Kubernetes, use an Ingress controller with proper TLS termination and *strict* access control rules, ensuring only authorized traffic reaches the Milvus service.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Milvus Server Vulnerabilities (Direct Milvus)](./threats/exploitation_of_milvus_server_vulnerabilities__direct_milvus_.md)
