        print("\nDetailed Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations:")
        print("-" * 30)

        print("\n1. Implement strict access control for data deletion operations within Milvus:")
        print("   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement a granular RBAC system within Milvus. Define specific roles with limited privileges, ensuring that only authorized personnel and applications have the 'delete' permission.")
        print("   - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users and applications only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Avoid assigning broad administrative privileges unnecessarily.")
        print("   - **Authentication Mechanisms:** Enforce strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), for users with delete privileges.")
        print("   - **API Key Management:** If applications interact with Milvus via API keys, implement robust key management practices, including secure generation, storage, and rotation.")
        print("   - **Regular Access Reviews:** Periodically review user roles and permissions to ensure they are still appropriate and necessary. Revoke access for users who no longer require delete privileges.")

        print("\n2. Implement soft deletion mechanisms *within Milvus if supported* or at the application level:")
        print("   - **Milvus Native Soft Delete (if available):** Explore and utilize any built-in soft deletion features provided by Milvus. This typically involves marking data as deleted without immediate physical removal.")
        print("   - **Application-Level Soft Delete:** If Milvus doesn't offer native soft deletion, implement it at the application level. This could involve adding a 'deleted' flag to the data records or maintaining a separate index of deleted data.")
        print("   - **Audit Logging for Soft Deletes:** Ensure that soft delete operations are also logged for auditing purposes.")
        print("   - **Data Retention Policies for Soft Deleted Data:** Define clear policies for how long soft-deleted data should be retained before permanent deletion.")

        print("\n3. Regularly back up Milvus data:")
        print("   - **Automated Backups:** Implement automated, scheduled backups of the entire Milvus data store, including both vector data and metadata.")
        print("   - **Backup Frequency:** Determine the appropriate backup frequency based on the rate of data change and the acceptable level of data loss. More frequent backups minimize potential data loss.")
        print("   - **Backup Storage:** Store backups in a secure, separate location from the primary Milvus instance. Consider offsite and cloud-based storage options for redundancy.")
        print("   - **Backup Encryption:** Encrypt backups at rest and in transit to protect sensitive data.")
        print("   - **Regular Backup Testing:**  Regularly test the backup and recovery process to ensure its effectiveness and identify any potential issues. Document the recovery procedures thoroughly.")

        print("\n4. Monitor delete operations for unusual patterns:")
        print("   - **Centralized Logging:** Implement centralized logging for all Milvus operations, including delete requests, user activity, and system events.")
        print("   - **Alerting and Anomaly Detection:** Configure alerts for unusual delete activity, such as a large number of deletions in a short period, deletions by unauthorized users, or deletions of critical data segments.")
        print("   - **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate Milvus logs with a SIEM system for advanced threat detection and correlation of events.")
        print("   - **Audit Trails:** Maintain detailed audit trails of all delete operations, including the user, timestamp, and the data affected.")
        print("   - **Regular Log Review:** Establish a process for regularly reviewing Milvus logs for suspicious activity.")

        print("\nAdditional Security Measures to Consider:")
        print("-" * 30)
        print("   - **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user inputs that could influence delete operations to prevent injection attacks.")
        print("   - **Secure Configuration Management:**  Harden the Milvus server configuration by disabling unnecessary features and services.")
        print("   - **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Milvus server within a secure network segment with restricted access.")
        print("   - **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in the Milvus deployment and the application's interaction with it.")
        print("   - **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regularly scan the Milvus server and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities and apply security patches promptly.")
        print("   - **Security Awareness Training:**  Educate developers, administrators, and users about the risks of data deletion and best practices for preventing it.")
        print("   - **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop a comprehensive incident response plan to address data deletion incidents effectively, including steps for identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.")
