# Attack Surface Analysis for milvus-io/milvus

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Missing gRPC API Authentication and Authorization](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_missing_grpc_api_authentication_and_authorization.md)

**Description:**  The Milvus gRPC API lacks robust authentication or authorization mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access to data and operations.

**How Milvus Contributes:** Milvus exposes its core functionality through this API, and if access controls are weak, the entire system is vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the Milvus instance without providing valid credentials or bypasses role-based access controls to delete collections or access sensitive vector data.

**Impact:** Complete data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, and potential compromise of the application using Milvus.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication:  Utilize Milvus's built-in authentication features (if available and robust) or integrate with external authentication providers (e.g., OAuth 2.0).
* Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):  Define granular roles and permissions to restrict access to specific API endpoints and data based on user roles.
* Secure credential management:  Avoid hardcoding credentials and use secure storage mechanisms like secrets management tools.
* Regularly audit access logs: Monitor API access for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient gRPC API Input Validation](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_grpc_api_input_validation.md)

**Description:** The Milvus gRPC API does not adequately validate user-provided input, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

**How Milvus Contributes:** Milvus relies on the API to receive data for insertion, querying, and management, making it a primary entry point for malicious input.

**Example:** An attacker sends a specially crafted query with excessively long strings or malformed data that causes a buffer overflow, denial of service, or potentially allows for remote code execution on the Milvus server.

**Impact:** Denial of service, potential for remote code execution, data corruption, and unexpected behavior.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation:  Validate all data received through the gRPC API against expected formats, lengths, and data types.
* Sanitize input:  Remove or escape potentially harmful characters from user input before processing it.
* Use prepared statements or parameterized queries:  Prevent injection attacks when constructing database queries (if applicable internally within Milvus).
* Implement rate limiting:  Prevent attackers from overwhelming the API with malicious requests.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Inter-node Communication in Distributed Deployments](./attack_surfaces/insecure_inter-node_communication_in_distributed_deployments.md)

**Description:** In a distributed Milvus deployment, communication between different Milvus nodes might not be properly secured, allowing for interception or manipulation of data.

**How Milvus Contributes:**  Milvus's distributed architecture necessitates communication between its components.

**Example:** An attacker on the same network as the Milvus cluster intercepts communication between two nodes and gains access to sensitive data being exchanged or injects malicious commands.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, and potential compromise of the entire Milvus cluster.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable TLS encryption for inter-node communication:  Encrypt all communication channels between Milvus nodes.
* Implement mutual authentication:  Ensure that each node authenticates the identity of other communicating nodes.
* Isolate the Milvus network:**  Deploy Milvus within a secure network segment with restricted access.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Metadata Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_metadata_manipulation.md)

**Description:**  Lack of proper authorization controls allows unauthorized users to modify or delete Milvus metadata (e.g., collection schemas, partition information).

**How Milvus Contributes:** Milvus manages critical metadata that defines the structure and organization of vector data.

**Example:** An attacker with insufficient privileges deletes a critical collection, leading to permanent data loss or disruption of the application.

**Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, and disruption of application functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strict authorization for metadata operations:  Restrict access to metadata management functions based on user roles and permissions.
* Implement auditing for metadata changes:  Track all modifications to Milvus metadata for accountability and detection of malicious activity.
