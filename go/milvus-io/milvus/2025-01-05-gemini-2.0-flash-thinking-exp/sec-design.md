### 5.2. Component Interactions

The following list details the interactions between key components, highlighting the protocols and data exchanged:

*   Clients communicate with the **Proxy** via gRPC or REST APIs, sending requests for data manipulation (insert, delete), search, and data definition operations.
*   The **Proxy** authenticates clients against a configured authentication mechanism (e.g., username/password, API keys).
*   The **Proxy** authorizes requests based on Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies defined within Milvus metadata.
*   For DDL operations, the **Proxy** forwards requests to the **RootCoord** via gRPC.
*   For data insertion, the **Proxy** forwards requests to the **DataCoord** via gRPC, which coordinates data distribution to **Data Nodes**.
*   For vector search, the **Proxy** forwards requests to the **QueryCoord** via gRPC.
*   The **QueryCoord** plans the query and distributes sub-queries to relevant **Query Nodes** via gRPC.
*   **DataCoord** instructs **Data Nodes** to ingest data and flush to **Object Storage** via gRPC.
*   **IndexCoord** assigns index building tasks to **Index Nodes** via gRPC.
*   **Data Nodes** persist vector data to **Object Storage** using storage-specific APIs (e.g., AWS SDK for S3).
*   **Index Nodes** build indexes and store them in **Object Storage** using storage-specific APIs.
*   All coordinator nodes persist and retrieve metadata from the **Meta Store** (etcd) using its client API.
*   Components communicate asynchronously via the **Message Queue** (Kafka/Pulsar) for events like segment sealing and index building completion.
*   All components send log data to the **Log Broker** via standard logging protocols.

## 6. Data Flow

This section details the data flow for key operations, emphasizing the movement and transformation of data.

### 6.1. Data Insertion Flow

1. A client sends an insert request containing vector data and associated metadata to the **Proxy** via gRPC.
2. The **Proxy** authenticates and authorizes the request.
3. The **Proxy** forwards the request to the **DataCoord**.
4. The **DataCoord** determines the target **Data Node(s)** based on load balancing and collection partitioning strategy.
5. The **DataCoord** sends an instruction to the target **Data Node(s)** via gRPC, including the vector data and metadata.
6. The **Data Node(s)** write the vector data to in-memory buffers (MemTable).
7. Periodically, or upon reaching a threshold, the **Data Node(s)** flush the MemTable data to **Object Storage** as immutable data files (SSTables).
8. The **Data Node(s)** update metadata in the **Meta Store** about the new data segments.
9. Optionally, the **IndexCoord** is notified about the new segment and may schedule index building on an **Index Node**.

### 6.2. Vector Search Flow

1. A client sends a search request containing query vectors, search parameters (e.g., `nprobe`), and collection name to the **Proxy** via gRPC.
2. The **Proxy** authenticates and authorizes the request.
3. The **Proxy** forwards the request to the **QueryCoord**.
4. The **QueryCoord** analyzes the request and determines the relevant data segments and indexes based on metadata.
5. The **QueryCoord** identifies available and healthy **Query Nodes**.
6. The **QueryCoord** plans the query execution and distributes sub-queries to selected **Query Nodes** via gRPC, specifying the segments and indexes to search.
7. The **Query Node(s)** load necessary data and indexes from **Object Storage** into their local cache.
8. The **Query Node(s)** perform the similarity search using the specified algorithm and parameters.
9. The **Query Node(s)** return the intermediate search results (top-k vectors) to the **QueryCoord**.
10. The **QueryCoord** aggregates the results from all **Query Nodes** and performs a final ranking.
11. The **QueryCoord** returns the final search results to the **Proxy**.
12. The **Proxy** sends the results back to the client.

## 7. Security Considerations

This section expands on the preliminary security considerations, providing more specific details relevant for threat modeling.

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   The **Proxy** is the primary enforcement point for authentication (verifying user identity) and authorization (verifying user permissions).
    *   Milvus supports RBAC, allowing granular control over access to collections and operations.
    *   Threats: Unauthorized access to data, privilege escalation.
    *   Mitigation: Strong authentication mechanisms, regularly reviewed and updated RBAC policies.
*   **Network Security:**
    *   Communication between components should be secured using TLS/SSL encryption to protect data in transit.
    *   Network segmentation should be implemented to isolate different parts of the system (e.g., separating client-facing components from internal components).
    *   Threats: Man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, unauthorized access to internal services.
    *   Mitigation: Enforce TLS for all internal and external communication, firewall rules, network policies.
*   **Data Encryption:**
    *   Data at rest in **Object Storage** should be encrypted using server-side or client-side encryption.
    *   Consider encrypting data in transit between **Data Nodes** and **Object Storage**.
    *   Threats: Unauthorized access to persistent data.
    *   Mitigation: Enable encryption at rest for object storage, explore encryption for internal data transfer.
*   **Access Control to Metadata Store:**
    *   Access to the **Meta Store** (etcd) should be strictly controlled, as it contains sensitive configuration and metadata.
    *   Implement authentication and authorization for etcd access.
    *   Threats: Data corruption, unauthorized configuration changes, information disclosure.
    *   Mitigation: Secure etcd deployment, restrict access to authorized components only.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   The **Proxy** and other components processing client input must perform thorough input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
    *   Threats: Data manipulation, system compromise.
    *   Mitigation: Implement robust input validation and sanitization.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
    *   Threats: Exploitation of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    *   Mitigation: Use dependency scanning tools, maintain an up-to-date dependency list.
*   **Logging and Auditing:**
    *   Comprehensive logging and auditing of all security-relevant events (e.g., authentication attempts, authorization decisions, data access) are crucial for security monitoring and incident response.
    *   Threats: Undetected security breaches, difficulty in forensic analysis.
    *   Mitigation: Configure detailed logging, centralize logs in the **Log Broker**, implement alerting for suspicious activity.
*   **Secrets Management:**
    *   Securely manage sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and encryption keys using a dedicated secrets management solution.
    *   Threats: Exposure of sensitive credentials leading to unauthorized access.
    *   Mitigation: Use a secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault), avoid storing secrets in code or configuration files.
*   **Resource Management:**
    *   Implement resource limits and quotas to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
    *   Threats: Service unavailability due to resource exhaustion.
    *   Mitigation: Configure resource limits (CPU, memory), implement rate limiting.

## 8. Deployment Considerations

The chosen deployment model significantly impacts the security posture of Milvus.

*   **Standalone:** Simplest deployment, but security relies heavily on the host operating system's security. Not recommended for production environments with sensitive data.
*   **Distributed (Kubernetes):** Offers better scalability and resilience. Security considerations include securing the Kubernetes cluster itself (RBAC, network policies, secrets management).
*   **Cloud-managed Services:** Security responsibilities are shared with the cloud provider. Understand the provider's security measures and your own responsibilities within the shared responsibility model.
