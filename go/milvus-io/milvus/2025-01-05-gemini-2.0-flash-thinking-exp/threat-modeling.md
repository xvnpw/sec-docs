# Threat Model Analysis for milvus-io/milvus

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Vector Data](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_vector_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the vector embeddings stored within Milvus. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in Milvus's access control, gaining access through compromised credentials used *within Milvus*, or by directly accessing the underlying storage *as configured by Milvus*.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information represented by the vector embeddings. This could reveal patterns, relationships, or personally identifiable information depending on the data encoded in the vectors. It could also lead to the misuse of the data for malicious purposes.

**Affected Component:** Milvus Server - Access Control Module, potentially also the underlying Storage (Object Storage, Metadata Store) *as managed by Milvus*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable and properly configure Milvus's authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to Milvus users and collections.
* Secure the underlying storage used by Milvus with appropriate access controls and encryption *configured within Milvus or its deployment environment*.
* Regularly review and audit access permissions within Milvus.
* Use strong, unique passwords for Milvus users and service accounts.

## Threat: [Data Tampering/Modification](./threats/data_tamperingmodification.md)

**Description:** An attacker modifies or corrupts the vector data stored in Milvus. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in Milvus's data modification processes or by gaining unauthorized write access *to Milvus*.

**Impact:**  Leads to inaccurate search results, biased outcomes, and potentially unreliable application behavior. If the vectors represent critical information, manipulation can have significant negative consequences.

**Affected Component:** Milvus Server - Write Path, Data Management Module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust authentication and authorization within Milvus to control who can modify data.
* Consider implementing data integrity checks (e.g., checksums) on the vector data *within Milvus or at the application level*.
* Regularly back up Milvus data to enable recovery from data corruption.
* Monitor write operations to Milvus for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Data Deletion](./threats/data_deletion.md)

**Description:** An attacker intentionally deletes vector data from Milvus, either through exploiting vulnerabilities in deletion processes *within Milvus* or by gaining unauthorized delete privileges *in Milvus*.

**Impact:** Loss of valuable data, potentially rendering the application's vector search functionality unusable or significantly impaired. Recovery might be difficult or impossible without proper backups.

**Affected Component:** Milvus Server - Delete Path, Data Management Module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access control for data deletion operations within Milvus.
* Implement soft deletion mechanisms *within Milvus if supported* or at the application level.
* Regularly back up Milvus data.
* Monitor delete operations for unusual patterns.

## Threat: [Exploiting Milvus API Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_milvus_api_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Milvus API (gRPC or REST) to execute unauthorized commands, access sensitive information *within Milvus*, or cause a denial of service *to Milvus*. This could involve injection attacks or exploiting flaws in API logic.

**Impact:**  Potential for data breaches *from Milvus*, unauthorized access *to Milvus functionalities*, remote code execution on the Milvus server, or service disruption *of Milvus*.

**Affected Component:** Milvus Server - API Gateway, gRPC/REST Handlers.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Milvus updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Implement input validation and sanitization on all data received through the Milvus API.
* Follow secure coding practices when developing applications that interact with the Milvus API.
* Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect the Milvus API endpoints.

## Threat: [Insecure Milvus Configuration](./threats/insecure_milvus_configuration.md)

**Description:** Milvus is deployed with insecure configurations *within its own settings*, such as default passwords, open ports without proper firewalling *at the Milvus level*, or disabled security features *within Milvus*.

**Impact:**  Increases the attack surface and makes it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access or exploit vulnerabilities *within Milvus*.

**Affected Component:** Milvus Server - Configuration Files, Deployment Scripts.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow Milvus's security best practices for configuration and deployment.
* Change default passwords for administrative accounts *within Milvus*.
* Configure firewalls to restrict access to Milvus ports.
* Enable authentication and authorization *within Milvus*.
* Secure communication channels (e.g., using TLS) *for Milvus communication*.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Milvus relies on third-party libraries and components that may contain known security vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in these dependencies could compromise the Milvus instance or the underlying system.

**Affected Component:** Milvus Server - Dependencies (listed in requirements files, build configurations).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly scan Milvus dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
* Keep Milvus and its dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
* Follow secure software supply chain practices.
