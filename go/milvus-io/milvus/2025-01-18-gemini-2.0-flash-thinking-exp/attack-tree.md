## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Milvus Data Manipulation Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_milvus_data_manipulation_vulnerabilities.md)

**1. Exploit Milvus Data Manipulation Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Modification [HIGH_RISK]:**
    *   **Exploit Missing Authorization Checks on Data Updates [HIGH_RISK] [CRITICAL]:**
        *   Attack Vector: The application fails to properly verify if the user or process attempting to modify data in Milvus has the necessary permissions.
        *   Impact: Attackers can alter sensitive data, leading to incorrect application behavior, data corruption, or the insertion of malicious content.
    *   **Exploit Injection Vulnerabilities in Data Input (e.g., if application passes unsanitized input to Milvus queries) [HIGH_RISK]:**
        *   Attack Vector: The application constructs Milvus queries by directly embedding user-provided input without proper sanitization or parameterization.
        *   Impact: Attackers can inject malicious commands into the Milvus query, potentially modifying data, retrieving unauthorized information, or even causing denial of service.

*   **Unauthorized Data Retrieval [HIGH_RISK]:**
    *   **Exploit Missing Authorization Checks on Data Retrieval [HIGH_RISK] [CRITICAL]:**
        *   Attack Vector: The application does not adequately verify if the user or process requesting data from Milvus is authorized to access it.
        *   Impact: Attackers can gain access to sensitive information stored in Milvus, leading to data breaches and privacy violations.
    *   **Exploit Injection Vulnerabilities in Query Construction [HIGH_RISK]:**
        *   Attack Vector: Similar to data modification, the application constructs Milvus queries using unsanitized user input.
        *   Impact: Attackers can manipulate the query to retrieve data they are not authorized to see, potentially exposing sensitive information.

*   **Data Deletion or Corruption [HIGH_RISK]:**
    *   **Exploit Missing Authorization Checks on Data Deletion [HIGH_RISK] [CRITICAL]:**
        *   Attack Vector: The application lacks proper authorization checks for data deletion operations in Milvus.
        *   Impact: Attackers can delete critical data, leading to application malfunction, data loss, and business disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Milvus API and Communication Vulnerabilities [HIGH_RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_milvus_api_and_communication_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

**2. Exploit Milvus API and Communication Vulnerabilities [HIGH_RISK PATH]:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Milvus API [HIGH_RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Exploit Weak or Default Authentication Credentials (if applicable) [HIGH_RISK] [CRITICAL]:**
        *   Attack Vector: Milvus is deployed with default or easily guessable credentials that are not changed.
        *   Impact: Attackers can gain full administrative access to Milvus, allowing them to manipulate data, configurations, and potentially compromise the entire application.
    *   **Exploit Missing or Weak Authorization Mechanisms for API Calls [HIGH_RISK]:**
        *   Attack Vector: Even with authentication, Milvus or the application's interaction with Milvus lacks proper authorization checks for specific API calls.
        *   Impact: Attackers can perform actions they are not supposed to, such as modifying data, deleting collections, or altering configurations.
    *   **Exploit Network Vulnerabilities to Intercept or Tamper with API Communication [HIGH_RISK]:**
        *   Attack Vector: Communication between the application and Milvus is not properly secured (e.g., using TLS/SSL).
        *   Impact: Attackers can intercept API requests and responses, potentially stealing credentials, modifying data in transit, or replaying requests for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Milvus Configuration Vulnerabilities [HIGH_RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_milvus_configuration_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

**3. Exploit Milvus Configuration Vulnerabilities [HIGH_RISK PATH]:**

*   **Insecure Default Configurations [HIGH_RISK]:**
    *   **Exploit Default Ports or Credentials [HIGH_RISK] [CRITICAL]:**
        *   Attack Vector: Milvus is running on default ports or with default credentials that are publicly known.
        *   Impact: Attackers can easily discover and access Milvus without proper authentication, leading to full compromise.
    *   **Exploit Insecure Access Control Settings [HIGH_RISK]:**
        *   Attack Vector: Milvus's access control mechanisms are not properly configured, allowing unauthorized access from the network or specific users/processes.
        *   Impact: Attackers can gain access to Milvus data and operations, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Milvus Dependencies Vulnerabilities [HIGH_RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_milvus_dependencies_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

**4. Exploit Milvus Dependencies Vulnerabilities [HIGH_RISK PATH]:**

*   **Exploit Identified Vulnerabilities [HIGH_RISK]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Milvus relies on third-party libraries or components that have known security vulnerabilities.
    *   Impact: Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service on the Milvus instance, indirectly impacting the application.
