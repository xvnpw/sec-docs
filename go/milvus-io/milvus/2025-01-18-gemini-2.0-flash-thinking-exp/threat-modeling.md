# Threat Model Analysis for milvus-io/milvus

## Threat: [Unauthorized Vector Data Access](./threats/unauthorized_vector_data_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might attempt to bypass Milvus's access controls or exploit vulnerabilities *within Milvus* to directly access and read vector embeddings and associated metadata stored within Milvus. This could involve exploiting weaknesses in Milvus's authentication, authorization, or the underlying storage mechanisms *managed by Milvus*.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential vector data could be exposed, potentially revealing sensitive information depending on the nature of the embeddings. This could lead to privacy violations, intellectual property theft, or the ability to reverse-engineer the data represented by the vectors.
    *   **Affected Component:** Data Node (storage layer), Object Storage Interface, RootCoord (for metadata access control).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization using Milvus's role-based access control (RBAC).
        *   Secure the underlying storage layer *as configured and managed by Milvus* with appropriate access controls and encryption.
        *   Regularly review and update Milvus access policies.

## Threat: [Malicious Vector Data Injection/Tampering](./threats/malicious_vector_data_injectiontampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to inject malicious or manipulated vector data *directly into Milvus*. This could be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in Milvus's data ingestion process or by compromising components that feed data *directly into Milvus*. Tampering with existing data could also be attempted by exploiting write access vulnerabilities *within Milvus*.
    *   **Impact:**  Injected or tampered data could lead to incorrect or biased search results, impacting the application's functionality and potentially leading to incorrect decisions or actions based on the data. It could also be used to poison the dataset for future analysis.
    *   **Affected Component:** Data Node (write path), Index Node, Proxy Node (data ingestion API).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on data *before ingesting it into Milvus*.
        *   Enforce proper authorization for data ingestion operations *within Milvus*.
        *   Consider using data integrity checks (e.g., checksums) to detect tampering *within Milvus*.
        *   Implement audit logging for data ingestion and modification activities *within Milvus*.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Query Overload](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_query_overload.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could send a large volume of computationally expensive or malformed queries *directly to Milvus*, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network) and causing it to become unresponsive or crash.
    *   **Impact:** The application relying on Milvus would become unavailable, disrupting services and potentially causing financial or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Query Node, Index Node, Proxy Node (query handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on incoming queries *to Milvus*.
        *   Configure resource limits for Milvus components.
        *   Optimize query performance through proper indexing and data partitioning *within Milvus*.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for resource utilization *of Milvus*.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass or Weak Authentication](./threats/authentication_bypass_or_weak_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities *in Milvus's authentication mechanisms* to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access *to Milvus*. This could involve exploiting default credentials, weak password policies *within Milvus*, or flaws in the authentication protocol *used by Milvus*.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker could gain full control over the Milvus instance, allowing them to read, modify, or delete data, and potentially disrupt services.
    *   **Affected Component:** RootCoord (authentication module), Proxy Node (authentication enforcement).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for Milvus users.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) if supported by the deployment environment *for Milvus access*.
        *   Regularly review and update user permissions *within Milvus*.
        *   Disable or change default credentials immediately after installation *of Milvus*.

## Threat: [Authorization Flaws Leading to Privilege Escalation](./threats/authorization_flaws_leading_to_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with limited privileges could exploit flaws *in Milvus's authorization mechanisms* to gain access to resources or perform actions they are not authorized for *within Milvus*.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive data or perform administrative actions, potentially compromising the integrity and availability of the Milvus instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** RootCoord (authorization module), Proxy Node (authorization enforcement).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC) and assign least privilege to users and applications *interacting with Milvus*.
        *   Regularly review and audit user permissions and roles *within Milvus*.
        *   Ensure proper enforcement of authorization policies across all Milvus components.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Milvus Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_milvus_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Milvus relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the Milvus instance.
    *   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from denial of service to remote code execution on the Milvus server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various Milvus components depending on the affected dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly scan Milvus dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
        *   Keep Milvus and its dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
