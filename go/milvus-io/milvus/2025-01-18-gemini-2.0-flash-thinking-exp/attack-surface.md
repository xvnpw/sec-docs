# Attack Surface Analysis for milvus-io/milvus

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted gRPC Communication](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_grpc_communication.md)

**Description:** Data transmitted between the application and Milvus over gRPC is not encrypted.

**How Milvus Contributes:** Milvus uses gRPC as its primary communication protocol. If TLS is not explicitly configured, the connection defaults to unencrypted.

**Example:** An attacker on the same network intercepts vector embeddings and query data being sent between the application and Milvus.

**Impact:** Confidential data (vector embeddings, potentially sensitive metadata) is exposed, leading to potential data breaches or reverse engineering of the application's logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable TLS for gRPC: Configure Milvus and the client application to use TLS encryption for all gRPC communication.
*   Network Segmentation: Isolate the network where Milvus and the application reside to limit potential eavesdropping.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Missing gRPC Authentication/Authorization](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_missing_grpc_authenticationauthorization.md)

**Description:**  Milvus's gRPC interface lacks proper authentication or authorization mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access.

**How Milvus Contributes:**  If authentication is not enabled or is weakly configured, any entity that can reach the gRPC port can interact with Milvus.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the Milvus gRPC port and can create, delete, or query collections without proper credentials.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, manipulation, or deletion, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or compromised application functionality.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable Milvus Authentication: Configure and enforce authentication mechanisms provided by Milvus (e.g., username/password).
*   Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Utilize Milvus's RBAC features to define granular permissions for different users and applications.
*   Secure Credential Management: Store and manage Milvus credentials securely, avoiding hardcoding or storing them in easily accessible locations.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Milvus Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_milvus_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Milvus relies on various third-party libraries and components that may contain security vulnerabilities.

**How Milvus Contributes:**  By incorporating these dependencies, Milvus inherits their potential vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A known vulnerability in the gRPC library used by Milvus is exploited to gain remote code execution on the Milvus server.

**Impact:**  Compromise of the Milvus server, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or lateral movement within the infrastructure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly Scan Dependencies: Implement automated tools to scan Milvus's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   Keep Dependencies Updated:  Maintain Milvus and its dependencies at the latest stable versions to patch known security flaws.
*   Vulnerability Management Process: Establish a process for identifying, assessing, and remediating vulnerabilities in Milvus and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration of Metadata Store](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_of_metadata_store.md)

**Description:** Milvus relies on an external metadata store (e.g., etcd, MySQL). If this store is insecurely configured, it can compromise Milvus.

**How Milvus Contributes:** Milvus's functionality is dependent on the integrity and availability of the metadata store.

**Example:** The metadata store has default credentials or is accessible without authentication, allowing an attacker to manipulate Milvus's metadata.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access to Milvus configurations, and potential service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure Metadata Store: Follow security best practices for the chosen metadata store, including strong authentication, authorization, and encryption.
*   Restrict Access: Limit network access to the metadata store to only authorized Milvus components.
*   Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits of the metadata store configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Object Storage Vulnerabilities (Directly impacting Milvus)](./attack_surfaces/object_storage_vulnerabilities__directly_impacting_milvus_.md)

**Description:** Milvus often uses object storage (e.g., S3, MinIO) to store vector data. Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the object storage *directly accessible or managed by Milvus* can impact Milvus.

**How Milvus Contributes:** Milvus's data persistence relies on the security of the object storage it interacts with. Weaknesses in how Milvus authenticates or authorizes access to this storage are relevant here.

**Example:** Milvus's configuration uses weak or default credentials to access the object storage, allowing an attacker to manipulate or delete vector data.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, and potential denial of service if storage resources are compromised.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement Strong Access Controls: Configure object storage buckets with strict access policies, granting access only to authorized Milvus components using secure authentication methods.
*   Secure Milvus Object Storage Credentials:  Manage and store credentials used by Milvus to access object storage securely (e.g., using secrets management tools).
*   Regular Security Audits: Review object storage configurations and access policies relevant to Milvus.
