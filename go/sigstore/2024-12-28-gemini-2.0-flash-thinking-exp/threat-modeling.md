*   **Threat:** Fulcio Compromise Leading to Malicious Certificate Issuance
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Fulcio Certificate Authority. They could then issue valid signing certificates for arbitrary identities or their own malicious identities. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in Fulcio's software, compromising its infrastructure, or social engineering its operators.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can sign malicious artifacts (e.g., container images, software packages) that would be considered trusted by applications relying on Sigstore verification. This could lead to the deployment of compromised software, data breaches, or system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Fulcio (Certificate Authority)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Rely on the security best practices and infrastructure security of the Fulcio instance being used (if not self-hosted).
        *   If self-hosting Fulcio, implement robust security measures including strong access controls, regular security audits, vulnerability scanning, and secure key management practices.
        *   Monitor Fulcio logs for suspicious certificate issuance activity.
        *   Consider certificate revocation mechanisms, although this is complex with Fulcio's ephemeral certificates.

*   **Threat:** Rekor Compromise Leading to Log Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Rekor transparency log. They could then:
        *   **Remove legitimate entries:** Making it appear as though a valid signature doesn't exist for a legitimate artifact.
        *   **Insert fraudulent entries:** Associating malicious artifacts with legitimate identities or creating false provenance information.
        *   **Modify existing entries:** Altering the details of a signature, such as the signer identity or the artifact digest.
    *   **Impact:** The integrity of the transparency log is compromised, undermining the trust in Sigstore's verification process. Attackers could make malicious artifacts appear legitimate or make legitimate artifacts appear unsigned.
    *   **Affected Component:** Rekor (Transparency Log)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Rely on the security best practices and infrastructure security of the Rekor instance being used (if not self-hosted).
        *   If self-hosting Rekor, implement robust security measures including strong access controls, regular security audits, and data integrity checks.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for any unauthorized modifications or deletions in the Rekor log.
        *   Consider using multiple independent Rekor instances for redundancy and increased trust.

*   **Threat:** Compromise of the OIDC Provider Used by Sigstore
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider that Sigstore relies on for identity verification during signing. This could involve gaining access to the provider's infrastructure, exploiting vulnerabilities, or compromising user accounts.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could obtain valid OIDC tokens for legitimate identities. They could then use these tokens to sign malicious artifacts, which would be considered valid by applications relying on Sigstore.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Interaction between Sigstore (specifically Cosign or similar signing tools) and the configured OIDC Provider.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Choose a reputable and secure OIDC provider.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization measures for the OIDC provider.
        *   Enable multi-factor authentication for user accounts on the OIDC provider.
        *   Regularly review the security posture and audit logs of the OIDC provider.
        *   Implement strict access controls for applications and services that can request OIDC tokens.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Sigstore Client Libraries (e.g., Cosign)
    *   **Description:**  Sigstore client libraries like Cosign might contain security vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities if the application's build or deployment pipeline uses an outdated or vulnerable version of the library. This could allow them to bypass signing or verification processes, manipulate signatures, or gain access to signing keys (if used).
    *   **Impact:** The integrity of the signing and verification process is compromised. Attackers could inject malicious artifacts into the pipeline or prevent legitimate artifacts from being signed or verified.
    *   **Affected Component:** Sigstore client libraries (e.g., Cosign, Go libraries).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Sigstore client libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Regularly review the security advisories for the libraries being used.
        *   Implement dependency management practices to track and update library versions.
        *   Perform security scanning on the build and deployment environment to identify vulnerable dependencies.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Signing Credentials (If Not Using Keyless Signing)
    *   **Description:** If the application or its build pipeline uses traditional key-based signing with Sigstore (instead of keyless signing with OIDC), the private signing keys become a critical asset. Attackers could gain access to these keys through various means, such as compromising the build environment, exploiting vulnerabilities in key management systems, or insider threats.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can sign malicious artifacts as the legitimate entity, bypassing the intended security controls.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The system or process where signing keys are stored and used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prefer keyless signing using OIDC identities to minimize the risk of key compromise.**
        *   If key-based signing is necessary, implement robust key management practices, including secure storage (e.g., hardware security modules, secrets management systems), strong access controls, and regular key rotation.
        *   Avoid storing private keys directly in code or configuration files.
