**Threat Model: Compromising Application Using Sigstore - Focused View**

**Attacker's Goal:** Compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Sigstore integration.

**High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application via Sigstore [CRITICAL NODE]
    * Subvert Signature Verification [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]
        * Exploit Verification Library Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]
            * Vulnerable Sigstore Client Library
            * Logic Errors in Verification Code
    * Compromise Signing Process [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Trick Legitimate Signer into Signing Malicious Content [HIGH-RISK PATH]
            * Social Engineering
    * Abuse Application's Sigstore Integration Logic [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]
        * Improper Handling of Verification Failures [HIGH-RISK PATH]
            * Failing to Block on Verification Failure

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path: Subvert Signature Verification -> Exploit Verification Library Vulnerabilities**

* **Subvert Signature Verification:** The attacker aims to bypass or manipulate the application's signature verification process, allowing the acceptance of malicious artifacts.
* **Exploit Verification Library Vulnerabilities:** The attacker targets weaknesses within the Sigstore client library used by the application.
    * **Vulnerable Sigstore Client Library:** The application uses an outdated or vulnerable version of the Sigstore client library. This version contains known bugs that an attacker can exploit to bypass signature verification checks, leading the application to accept unsigned or maliciously signed artifacts.
    * **Logic Errors in Verification Code:** The application's custom verification logic (if any) contains flaws. An attacker can identify and exploit these flaws to trick the application into incorrectly validating signatures, leading to the acceptance of invalidly signed artifacts.

**High-Risk Path: Compromise Signing Process -> Trick Legitimate Signer into Signing Malicious Content**

* **Compromise Signing Process:** The attacker aims to interfere with the signing process to inject malicious content into artifacts before they are signed.
* **Trick Legitimate Signer into Signing Malicious Content:** The attacker manipulates a legitimate user with signing privileges into signing a malicious artifact.
    * **Social Engineering:** The attacker uses deception and manipulation techniques to trick a legitimate signer into signing a malicious artifact. This could involve phishing, impersonation, or other forms of social engineering, resulting in a valid signature being attached to a harmful artifact.

**High-Risk Path: Abuse Application's Sigstore Integration Logic -> Improper Handling of Verification Failures**

* **Abuse Application's Sigstore Integration Logic:** The attacker exploits flaws in how the application implements and uses Sigstore functionalities.
* **Improper Handling of Verification Failures:** The application does not adequately handle situations where signature verification fails.
    * **Failing to Block on Verification Failure:** The application continues its execution even when signature verification fails. This critical oversight allows malicious artifacts to be accepted and processed as if they were legitimate, leading to potential compromise.

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application via Sigstore:** This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has successfully compromised the application by exploiting weaknesses in its Sigstore integration.

* **Subvert Signature Verification:** This is a critical point because if the attacker can bypass signature verification, they can introduce any malicious artifact into the application as if it were legitimate.

* **Compromise Signing Process:** This is a critical point because if the attacker can compromise the signing process, they can create malicious artifacts that appear to be legitimately signed, making them harder to detect.

* **Abuse Application's Sigstore Integration Logic:** This is a critical point because flaws in the application's own implementation of Sigstore functionalities can directly lead to vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
