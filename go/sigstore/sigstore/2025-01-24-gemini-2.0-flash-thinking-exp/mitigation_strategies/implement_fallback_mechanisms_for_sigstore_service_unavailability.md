        *   **Defining Degradation Levels (Graceful Degradation):**  Clearly defining what "limited functionality" means and what security guarantees are reduced during graceful degradation.
        *   **Circuit Breaker Configuration:**  Properly configuring circuit breaker thresholds (failure count, cooldown period) to avoid premature or delayed tripping.
        *   **Testing Outage Scenarios:**  Thoroughly testing outage handling mechanisms under various Sigstore service failure scenarios.
    *   **Security Considerations:**
        *   **Graceful Degradation Risks:**  Clearly communicate reduced security guarantees to users during graceful degradation. Log all instances of bypassed verification for auditing and security monitoring.
        *   **Circuit Breaker Security:**  Ensure the circuit breaker mechanism itself is secure and cannot be manipulated by attackers to bypass verification permanently.
        *   **Complete Failure Security:**  While secure, complete failure can impact availability. Ensure clear error messages guide users and administrators.
    *   **Best Practices:**
        *   **Risk-Based Approach:**  Choose the outage handling strategy based on a thorough risk assessment of the application and the impact of Sigstore unavailability.
