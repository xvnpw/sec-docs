# Threat Model Analysis for sigstore/sigstore

## Threat: [Compromised OIDC Identity during Signing](./threats/compromised_oidc_identity_during_signing.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of a legitimate user's OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity and uses it to authenticate with **Fulcio** to obtain a signing certificate. This allows the attacker to sign malicious artifacts as the legitimate user.

**Impact:** The attacker can sign and publish malicious software, container images, or other artifacts that appear to be legitimately signed, leading to supply chain attacks.

**Affected Component:** Fulcio (certificate issuance).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts.
* Educate users about phishing and social engineering tactics.
* Regularly review and audit OIDC provider configurations.
* Implement device posture checks.
* Consider risk-based authentication.

## Threat: [Compromise of the Signing Environment](./threats/compromise_of_the_signing_environment.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the environment where the signing process takes place and manipulates the signing process using **Sigstore client tools** (e.g., Cosign) or by directly interacting with **Fulcio**.

**Impact:** The attacker has full control over the signing process and can sign any content they choose, leading to severe supply chain risks.

**Affected Component:** The environment where Sigstore client tools are executed, potentially direct interaction with Fulcio.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong access controls and least privilege principles for the signing environment.
* Regularly scan the signing environment for vulnerabilities and malware.
* Harden the operating systems and applications within the signing environment.
* Use secure build pipelines and infrastructure-as-code.
* Implement logging and monitoring of activities within the signing environment.

## Threat: [Reliance on Compromised Sigstore Infrastructure](./threats/reliance_on_compromised_sigstore_infrastructure.md)

**Description:** A hypothetical compromise of core **Sigstore** infrastructure components like **Fulcio** or **Rekor** could lead to the issuance of malicious certificates or the manipulation of the transparency log.

**Impact:** Widespread trust in Sigstore could be undermined, and applications relying on it might accept malicious artifacts as legitimately signed.

**Affected Component:** Fulcio (certificate issuance), Rekor (transparency log).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* This is largely outside the direct control of application developers.
* Stay informed about the security posture and any reported incidents related to the Sigstore project.
* Consider having contingency plans or alternative verification mechanisms for critical applications.
* Support and contribute to the security of the Sigstore project.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Sigstore Client Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_sigstore_client_libraries.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities in the **Sigstore client libraries** (e.g., the Go libraries used by Cosign or other tools) could be exploited by attackers.

**Impact:** Attackers could potentially manipulate the signing or verification process through vulnerabilities in the libraries, leading to the signing of malicious artifacts or the bypassing of verification checks.

**Affected Component:** Sigstore client libraries.

**Risk Severity:** High (if a critical vulnerability exists)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Sigstore client libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Regularly scan application dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
* Use dependency management tools to track and update library versions.
