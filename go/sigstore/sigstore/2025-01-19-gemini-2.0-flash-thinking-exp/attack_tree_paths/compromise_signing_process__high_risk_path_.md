## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Signing Process

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Compromise Signing Process" attack tree path for an application utilizing Sigstore. It outlines the objective, scope, and methodology used for this analysis, followed by a detailed breakdown of potential attack vectors and their implications.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors associated with compromising the signing process within an application leveraging Sigstore. This includes identifying specific weaknesses in the implementation, configuration, and surrounding infrastructure that could allow an attacker to manipulate or circumvent the artifact signing process. Ultimately, this analysis aims to inform the development team about the risks and guide the implementation of robust security measures to mitigate these threats.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the "Compromise Signing Process" attack tree path. The scope includes:

* **The application's integration with Sigstore:** This encompasses how the application interacts with Sigstore components like `cosign`, Fulcio, Rekor, and potentially TUF.
* **The signing environment:** This includes the infrastructure where the signing process takes place, such as CI/CD pipelines, developer workstations, or dedicated signing servers.
* **The key material and identities used for signing:** This includes private keys, certificates, and the mechanisms used for their storage and access.
* **The verification process:** While the focus is on compromise, understanding how verification works is crucial to identify bypass opportunities.
* **Relevant dependencies and tooling:** This includes the security of the tools and libraries used in the signing process.

The scope explicitly excludes:

* **General application vulnerabilities:**  This analysis does not cover vulnerabilities unrelated to the signing process, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting.
* **Attacks on the core Sigstore infrastructure itself:** We assume the core Sigstore services (Fulcio, Rekor) are operating as intended, although potential misconfigurations in their usage are within scope.
* **Social engineering attacks targeting end-users:** The focus is on compromising the signing *process*, not the consumption of signed artifacts.

### 3. Methodology

The methodology employed for this deep analysis involves:

* **Threat Modeling:**  Identifying potential attackers, their motivations, and capabilities. We will consider both internal and external attackers with varying levels of access and expertise.
* **Attack Vector Analysis:**  Brainstorming and documenting specific ways an attacker could compromise the signing process at different stages. This will involve considering the various components and interactions involved.
* **Vulnerability Assessment (Conceptual):**  Identifying potential weaknesses in the application's integration with Sigstore, the signing environment, and the handling of key material. This is a conceptual assessment based on common security pitfalls and best practices.
* **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluating the potential consequences of a successful attack, including the ability to distribute malicious artifacts, undermine trust, and potentially compromise downstream systems.
* **Mitigation Strategy Brainstorming:**  Identifying potential security controls and best practices to prevent or detect the identified attacks.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Signing Process

This path represents a critical risk as successful exploitation allows attackers to inject malicious content into the software supply chain, masquerading as legitimate releases. We can break down this path into several sub-categories based on the target of the attack:

**4.1. Targeting the Signing Key Material:**

* **4.1.1. Stolen Private Key:**
    * **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the private key used for signing. This could occur through:
        * **Compromised Developer Workstation:** Malware or direct access to a developer's machine where the key is stored.
        * **Insecure Key Storage:**  Storing the key in plaintext, weak encryption, or easily accessible locations.
        * **Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) Misconfiguration:**  Incorrect IAM policies or vulnerabilities in the KMS allowing unauthorized access.
        * **Supply Chain Compromise of Key Generation Tools:**  Malicious code injected into the tools used to generate the key.
    * **Impact:**  The attacker can sign arbitrary artifacts, making them appear legitimate. This is a catastrophic compromise.
    * **Mitigation Considerations:**
        * **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):** Store private keys in tamper-proof hardware.
        * **Secure Key Management Services (KMS):** Utilize robust KMS with strong access controls and auditing.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit access to the private key to only authorized processes and individuals.
        * **Regular Key Rotation:** Periodically generate and replace signing keys.
        * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for access to key management systems.

* **4.1.2. Compromised Certificate Authority (CA) (Indirect):**
    * **Description:** While less direct, a compromise of the CA that issued the signing certificate could allow an attacker to obtain a valid certificate for a key they control. This is less likely with Sigstore's ephemeral key model but could be relevant if long-lived certificates are used in conjunction.
    * **Impact:**  The attacker can obtain a valid certificate, potentially allowing them to sign artifacts.
    * **Mitigation Considerations:**
        * **Reliance on Sigstore's Ephemeral Keys:**  Leverage Sigstore's default behavior of using short-lived, automatically generated keys.
        * **Careful Selection of CAs:** If using long-lived certificates, choose reputable and secure CAs.
        * **Certificate Pinning:**  If applicable, pin the expected certificate to prevent the use of rogue certificates.

**4.2. Compromising the Signing Environment:**

* **4.2.1. Compromised CI/CD Pipeline:**
    * **Description:** An attacker gains control of the CI/CD pipeline responsible for building and signing artifacts. This could involve:
        * **Stolen Credentials:**  Compromising API keys, passwords, or tokens used to access the pipeline.
        * **Vulnerable Pipeline Configuration:**  Exploiting misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the CI/CD platform.
        * **Malicious Code Injection:**  Injecting malicious code into the build process that signs attacker-controlled artifacts.
        * **Dependency Confusion Attacks:**  Introducing malicious dependencies that are used during the signing process.
    * **Impact:** The attacker can manipulate the signing process to sign malicious artifacts or prevent legitimate artifacts from being signed.
    * **Mitigation Considerations:**
        * **Secure CI/CD Configuration:**  Follow security best practices for configuring the CI/CD platform.
        * **Secret Management:**  Securely store and manage secrets used by the pipeline.
        * **Pipeline Isolation:**  Isolate the signing process from other potentially vulnerable stages.
        * **Code Review and Static Analysis:**  Review pipeline configurations and scripts for vulnerabilities.
        * **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Utilize immutable infrastructure for the signing environment.

* **4.2.2. Compromised Developer Workstation (Signing Process):**
    * **Description:** If the signing process is performed on a developer's workstation, compromising that workstation allows the attacker to manipulate the signing process directly.
    * **Impact:** Similar to compromising the CI/CD pipeline, the attacker can sign malicious artifacts.
    * **Mitigation Considerations:**
        * **Centralized Signing:**  Avoid signing on individual developer workstations. Implement a centralized and controlled signing process.
        * **Secure Development Practices:**  Enforce secure coding practices and workstation security policies.
        * **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**  Deploy EDR solutions to detect and respond to threats on developer workstations.

* **4.2.3. Rogue Signing Agent/Tool:**
    * **Description:** An attacker replaces the legitimate signing tool (e.g., `cosign`) with a malicious version that signs artifacts with attacker-controlled keys or modifies the signing process.
    * **Impact:**  Malicious artifacts can be signed without the legitimate key material.
    * **Mitigation Considerations:**
        * **Verification of Signing Tool Integrity:**  Verify the checksum or signature of the signing tool before execution.
        * **Secure Software Supply Chain for Tooling:**  Ensure the integrity of the tools used in the signing process.
        * **Restricted Execution Environments:**  Run the signing process in a controlled and isolated environment.

**4.3. Circumventing the Signing Process:**

* **4.3.1. Bypassing Signing Checks:**
    * **Description:**  The application or deployment process might have vulnerabilities that allow bypassing the verification of signatures. This could involve:
        * **Incorrect Verification Logic:**  Flaws in the code that checks the signature.
        * **Missing Verification Steps:**  Failure to implement signature verification at critical points.
        * **Configuration Errors:**  Disabling or misconfiguring signature verification.
    * **Impact:**  Unsigned or maliciously signed artifacts can be deployed and executed.
    * **Mitigation Considerations:**
        * **Thorough Verification Implementation:**  Implement robust signature verification at all critical stages.
        * **Automated Verification Testing:**  Include tests to ensure signature verification is working correctly.
        * **Secure Configuration Management:**  Enforce secure configuration settings for signature verification.

* **4.3.2. Manipulating Metadata or Provenance:**
    * **Description:**  An attacker might manipulate the metadata associated with the signed artifact (e.g., the Rekor entry) to point to malicious content or misrepresent the origin of the artifact.
    * **Impact:**  Users or systems might be tricked into trusting malicious artifacts based on falsified metadata.
    * **Mitigation Considerations:**
        * **Immutable Provenance Records:**  Rely on the immutability of Rekor entries.
        * **Verification of Provenance:**  Verify the integrity and authenticity of the provenance information.
        * **Secure Metadata Handling:**  Ensure the metadata associated with signed artifacts is protected from tampering.

**4.4. Supply Chain Attacks Targeting the Signing Process:**

* **4.4.1. Compromised Dependencies of Signing Tools:**
    * **Description:**  The signing tools themselves might rely on vulnerable dependencies that could be exploited to compromise the signing process.
    * **Impact:**  The signing process could be manipulated through vulnerabilities in its dependencies.
    * **Mitigation Considerations:**
        * **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):**  Maintain an SBOM for the signing tools and their dependencies.
        * **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regularly scan the dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        * **Dependency Pinning:**  Pin dependencies to specific versions to prevent unexpected updates.

* **4.4.2. Malicious Build Steps Introduced Earlier:**
    * **Description:**  While not directly compromising the signing process, malicious code introduced earlier in the build process could create artifacts that appear legitimately signed but contain malicious functionality.
    * **Impact:**  Legitimately signed artifacts can still be malicious.
    * **Mitigation Considerations:**
        * **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):**  Implement secure coding practices and code review processes.
        * **Build Reproducibility:**  Strive for reproducible builds to ensure the integrity of the build process.
        * **Binary Authorization:**  Enforce policies that only allow deployment of signed and authorized artifacts.
