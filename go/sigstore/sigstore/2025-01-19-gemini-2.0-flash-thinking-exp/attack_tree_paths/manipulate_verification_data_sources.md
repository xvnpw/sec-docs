### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Manipulate Verification Data Sources

This attack path focuses on compromising the integrity and trustworthiness of the data sources that Sigstore relies upon for verifying the authenticity and provenance of software artifacts. A successful attack here can undermine the entire security model provided by Sigstore.

**4.1. Sub-Nodes and Attack Vectors:**

This high-level path can be broken down into several potential sub-nodes and specific attack vectors targeting Fulcio and Rekor:

**4.1.1. Attacks Targeting Fulcio:**

Fulcio is responsible for issuing short-lived signing certificates based on OIDC identity. Compromising Fulcio allows an attacker to generate valid-looking certificates for malicious artifacts.

* **4.1.1.1. Compromise Fulcio's Private Key:**
    * **Description:**  Gaining access to the private key used by Fulcio to sign certificates. This is a catastrophic compromise.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Insider Threat:** Malicious or compromised employee with access to key material.
        * **Supply Chain Attack:** Compromising a vendor or system involved in the key generation or storage process.
        * **Vulnerability Exploitation:** Exploiting a vulnerability in the Hardware Security Module (HSM) or software used to manage the key.
        * **Social Engineering:** Tricking personnel into revealing key material.
    * **Impact:**  Complete ability to forge valid certificates for any identity, rendering all subsequent verifications useless.

* **4.1.1.2. Compromise Fulcio's Issuance Process:**
    * **Description:**  Manipulating the process by which Fulcio issues certificates without directly compromising the private key.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Vulnerability in Fulcio's API:** Exploiting bugs in the API endpoints used for certificate requests.
        * **Bypassing Identity Verification:**  Finding ways to circumvent the OIDC identity verification process, allowing the issuance of certificates for illegitimate identities.
        * **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** Intercepting and modifying communication between a legitimate user and Fulcio to request a certificate for a malicious purpose.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS) on legitimate requests:** Overwhelming Fulcio with requests, potentially allowing malicious requests to be processed during periods of instability.
    * **Impact:** Ability to obtain valid certificates for malicious artifacts, potentially impersonating legitimate developers or organizations.

* **4.1.1.3. Manipulate Fulcio's Configuration:**
    * **Description:**  Altering Fulcio's configuration to weaken security controls or allow the issuance of invalid certificates.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining access to Fulcio's configuration files or management interfaces through compromised credentials or vulnerabilities.
        * **Configuration Drift:**  Subtly altering configurations over time to weaken security without immediate detection.
    * **Impact:**  Potentially allowing the issuance of certificates with weakened security properties or for unauthorized identities.

**4.1.2. Attacks Targeting Rekor:**

Rekor provides an immutable, tamper-proof ledger of signing events. Compromising Rekor allows an attacker to hide evidence of malicious signatures or make legitimate signatures appear invalid.

* **4.1.2.1. Compromise Rekor's Signing Key:**
    * **Description:** Gaining access to the private key used by Rekor to sign the Merkle tree root. This is a critical compromise.
    * **Attack Vectors:** Similar to Fulcio's private key compromise (insider threat, supply chain attack, vulnerability exploitation, social engineering).
    * **Impact:** Ability to forge the Rekor log, allowing the insertion or deletion of entries, effectively hiding or fabricating signing events.

* **4.1.2.2. Manipulate Rekor's Data Store:**
    * **Description:** Directly altering the underlying database or storage mechanism used by Rekor.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Database Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the database software used by Rekor.
        * **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining access to the database credentials or server through compromised systems or credentials.
        * **SQL Injection:** Injecting malicious SQL queries to modify or delete entries in the database.
    * **Impact:** Ability to remove evidence of malicious signatures or insert false entries to legitimize malicious artifacts.

* **4.1.2.3. Disrupt Rekor's Operation (Availability Attacks):**
    * **Description:**  Making Rekor unavailable, preventing verification from occurring.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):** Overwhelming Rekor with traffic, making it unresponsive.
        * **Resource Exhaustion:**  Consuming Rekor's resources (CPU, memory, disk space) to cause failure.
        * **Infrastructure Compromise:**  Compromising the servers or network infrastructure hosting Rekor.
    * **Impact:**  While not directly manipulating data, preventing access to Rekor can force applications to bypass verification, creating a window of opportunity for deploying malicious artifacts.

* **4.1.2.4. Fork the Rekor Log:**
    * **Description:** Creating a separate, malicious version of the Rekor log that diverges from the legitimate one.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Compromise of multiple Rekor nodes:**  If Rekor is distributed, compromising a sufficient number of nodes to create a false consensus.
        * **Sophisticated manipulation of the Merkle tree:**  Exploiting weaknesses in the Merkle tree implementation to create a valid-looking but fraudulent log.
    * **Impact:**  Applications querying the malicious fork will receive false information about the validity of signatures.

**4.2. Impact on the Application:**

Successful manipulation of Fulcio or Rekor can have severe consequences for the application relying on Sigstore for verification:

* **Installation of Malicious Software:**  Attackers can sign and distribute malicious software that appears to be legitimate, leading to compromise of the application's environment.
