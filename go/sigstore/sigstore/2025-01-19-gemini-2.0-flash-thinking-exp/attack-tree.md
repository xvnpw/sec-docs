## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Signing Process [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_signing_process__high_risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on attacks that aim to manipulate or circumvent the process of signing artifacts using Sigstore. Success here allows the attacker to introduce malicious code or configurations as if they were legitimate.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Private Key [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_private_key__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

This critical node represents the highest risk. If an attacker gains access to the private key used for signing, they can forge signatures for any artifact, completely undermining the trust provided by Sigstore.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal Key from Storage [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/steal_key_from_storage__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

An attacker gains unauthorized access to the storage location of the private key. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the storage system, weak access controls, or insider threats.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise CI/CD Pipeline Key [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_cicd_pipeline_key__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

Private keys are often used in automated CI/CD pipelines for signing artifacts. If the attacker compromises the CI/CD environment, they can potentially extract these keys.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Signing Process [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_signing_process__high_risk_path_.md)

This path involves deploying artifacts without going through the intended Sigstore signing process. This could be due to misconfigurations, developer errors, or vulnerabilities in the deployment pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Verification Process [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_verification_process__high_risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on attacks that aim to make the application accept a malicious artifact despite it not having a valid Sigstore signature or certificate.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Verification Logic [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_verification_logic__critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents flaws in the application's code responsible for verifying Sigstore signatures and certificates. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to the application incorrectly accepting invalid artifacts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors in Certificate/Signature Validation [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_in_certificatesignature_validation__high_risk_path_.md)

The application's verification logic contains flaws that allow an attacker to craft signatures or certificates that bypass the intended security checks. This could involve incorrect implementation of cryptographic algorithms or mishandling of certificate fields.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Verification Data Sources](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_verification_data_sources.md)

This path involves attacks that aim to compromise the sources of truth used during the verification process, such as Fulcio and Rekor.

## Attack Tree Path: [DNS Spoofing of Fulcio/Rekor Endpoints [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/dns_spoofing_of_fulciorekor_endpoints__high_risk_path_.md)

The attacker manipulates DNS records to redirect the application's requests to Fulcio or Rekor to attacker-controlled servers. This allows them to provide fake certificates or log entries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Verification Requests [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_verification_requests__high_risk_path_.md)

The attacker intercepts communication between the application and Sigstore services (Fulcio, Rekor), allowing them to modify the data exchanged and potentially forge verification responses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Verification Checks [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_verification_checks__high_risk_path_.md)

This path involves completely skipping or disabling the Sigstore verification process within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Configuration Errors Disabling Verification [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/configuration_errors_disabling_verification__high_risk_path_.md)

The application is misconfigured, leading to the Sigstore verification checks being disabled or bypassed unintentionally.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Logic Flaws Ignoring Verification Results [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/application_logic_flaws_ignoring_verification_results__high_risk_path_.md)

The application performs the Sigstore verification, but the application logic doesn't properly handle or enforce the results, effectively ignoring failed verification attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise System During Certificate Validity Window [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_system_during_certificate_validity_window__high_risk_path_.md)

This path acknowledges that even with valid Sigstore signatures, the short-lived nature of the certificates means a compromised system could be exploited within the certificate's validity period. This highlights the need for ongoing system security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Sigstore Libraries [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_sigstore_libraries__high_risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities present in the third-party libraries that the Sigstore client libraries depend on.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Go Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_go_dependencies__high_risk_path_.md)

The Sigstore client libraries are written in Go and rely on other Go packages. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them to compromise the application. This often involves using known exploits for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.
