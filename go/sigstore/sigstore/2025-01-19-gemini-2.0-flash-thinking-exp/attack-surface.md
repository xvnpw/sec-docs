# Attack Surface Analysis for sigstore/sigstore

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Sigstore Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/compromised_sigstore_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Sigstore libraries (e.g., Cosign, Go modules) used by the application can be exploited by attackers.

**How Sigstore Contributes:** Integrating Sigstore necessitates including its specific dependencies, which become potential attack vectors if they contain security flaws.

**Example:** An attacker finds a remote code execution vulnerability in an older version of the Cosign library used by the application. By crafting a specific input during the verification process, they can execute arbitrary code on the application's server.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the application, data breaches, supply chain attacks affecting downstream users.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Sigstore libraries to the latest versions.
* Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability management tools.
* Use Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) to track dependencies.
* Follow secure coding practices when integrating Sigstore libraries.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised OIDC Provider (for Fulcio)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_oidc_provider__for_fulcio_.md)

**Description:** If the OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider used by developers to obtain Fulcio signing certificates is compromised, attackers can obtain valid certificates for malicious artifacts.

**How Sigstore Contributes:** Sigstore's keyless signing relies on the security of the linked OIDC provider for identity verification. A compromised provider breaks this trust.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to a developer's account on the organization's OIDC provider. They then use this access to request a Fulcio signing certificate, which they can use to sign malicious code that appears legitimate.

**Impact:** Ability to sign and distribute malicious software that will be trusted by systems relying on Sigstore verification.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) on developer accounts for the OIDC provider.
* Implement robust account monitoring and anomaly detection on the OIDC provider.
* Regularly review and audit access controls for the OIDC provider.
* Educate developers on phishing and social engineering attacks targeting their OIDC credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Rekor Log Tampering (Infrastructure Compromise)](./attack_surfaces/rekor_log_tampering__infrastructure_compromise_.md)

**Description:** While highly improbable, if the Rekor transparency log infrastructure is compromised, attackers could potentially tamper with the log, removing evidence of malicious signatures or inserting false entries.

**How Sigstore Contributes:** Sigstore relies on Rekor for immutability and non-repudiation of signatures. Compromising Rekor undermines this core security feature.

**Example:** A sophisticated attacker gains control of Rekor servers and manipulates the log to remove entries related to a known malicious artifact, making it appear as if it was never signed or verified.

**Impact:** Complete erosion of trust in the Sigstore verification process, allowing malicious artifacts to be accepted as legitimate.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sigstore project implements robust security measures for Rekor infrastructure.
* Organizations relying on Sigstore should monitor the Rekor project's security advisories and updates.
* Consider using multiple independent transparency logs if extremely high assurance is required (though this is not a standard Sigstore practice).

## Attack Surface: [Verification Logic Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/verification_logic_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Bugs or flaws in the application's code that implements the Sigstore verification process can be exploited to bypass signature checks.

**How Sigstore Contributes:**  Integrating Sigstore requires developers to implement verification logic using Sigstore libraries. Errors in this implementation can create vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A developer incorrectly implements the verification logic, failing to properly check the validity period of the Fulcio certificate or the signature's integrity. This allows an attacker to use an expired or tampered signature.

**Impact:** Malicious or unauthorized artifacts can be accepted as valid, leading to application compromise or other security breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and test the Sigstore verification implementation.
* Follow Sigstore's recommended best practices and examples for verification.
* Utilize static analysis and code review tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* Implement unit and integration tests specifically for the verification logic.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Trust Roots](./attack_surfaces/compromised_trust_roots.md)

**Description:** If the set of trusted root certificates used to verify Fulcio certificates is compromised or contains malicious entries, attackers can forge valid-looking signatures.

**How Sigstore Contributes:** Sigstore's trust model relies on a set of trusted root certificates. Compromising these roots undermines the entire chain of trust.

**Example:** An attacker manages to inject a malicious root certificate into the application's trust store. They can then issue fake Fulcio certificates and sign malicious artifacts that will be considered valid by the application.

**Impact:** Ability to sign and distribute malicious software that will be trusted by systems relying on Sigstore verification.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully manage and secure the trust store used for Sigstore verification.
* Regularly update the trust store with the latest trusted root certificates from the Sigstore project.
* Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of the trust store.
* Consider using certificate pinning or other techniques to further restrict trusted certificates.
