# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for sigstore/sigstore

## Mitigation Strategy: [Short-Lived Certificates (Fulcio)](./mitigation_strategies/short-lived_certificates__fulcio_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Issue short-lived certificates (minutes to hours) from Fulcio.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configuration:** Configure Fulcio (the Sigstore CA) to issue certificates with a very short validity period (e.g., 10-20 minutes). This is a core configuration setting within Fulcio itself.
    2.  **Client Integration:** Ensure client tools (like `cosign`) are designed to interact with Fulcio to automatically request and renew these short-lived certificates before they expire. This relies on the Sigstore client libraries and APIs.
    3.  **Rekor Integration:**  The issuance of these short-lived certificates is recorded in Rekor (Sigstore's transparency log), providing an audit trail.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromise of Fulcio's root key (Severity: Critical):** Limits the damage from a compromised root key, as attackers can only issue short-lived certificates, reducing the attack window.
    *   **Compromised OIDC provider (Severity: High):** Reduces the window of opportunity for an attacker to misuse a certificate obtained through a compromised OIDC provider, as the certificate will quickly expire.
    *   **Stolen/leaked certificates (Severity: High):** Minimizes the impact of a stolen or leaked certificate, as it will quickly become invalid.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromise of Fulcio's root key:** Risk significantly reduced (time-bound impact).
    *   **Compromised OIDC provider:** Risk significantly reduced (time-bound impact).
    *   **Stolen/leaked certificates:** Risk significantly reduced (time-bound impact).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, this is a core design principle of Sigstore and is implemented in Fulcio.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None. This is a fundamental aspect of Sigstore's design.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict OIDC Provider Whitelisting (Fulcio)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_oidc_provider_whitelisting__fulcio_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Maintain a strict whitelist of trusted OIDC providers within Fulcio.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Whitelist Configuration:** Configure Fulcio (using its configuration files or settings) to *only* accept authentication tokens from a predefined list of trusted OIDC providers (e.g., Google, GitHub).
    2.  **Regular Review:**  The Sigstore maintainers must regularly review and update this whitelist, removing providers that no longer meet security requirements.
    3.  **Fulcio Enforcement:** Fulcio's code itself enforces this whitelist, rejecting any certificate requests that originate from unlisted OIDC providers.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised OIDC provider (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from using a compromised or malicious OIDC provider to obtain certificates from Fulcio.
    *   **Rogue OIDC provider (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from setting up a rogue OIDC provider to impersonate legitimate users and obtain certificates from Fulcio.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised OIDC provider:** Risk significantly reduced (limits the attack surface to known, trusted providers).
    *   **Rogue OIDC provider:** Risk significantly reduced (prevents unauthorized providers from being used).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, Fulcio has a configurable whitelist of allowed OIDC issuers.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Potentially, more formalized and publicly documented criteria for inclusion in the whitelist, and a more transparent process for adding/removing providers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Merkle Tree Verification in Clients (Rekor)](./mitigation_strategies/merkle_tree_verification_in_clients__rekor_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Ensure client tools (e.g., `cosign`) verify Rekor's Merkle Tree inclusion and consistency proofs.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Sigstore Client Libraries:**  The Sigstore client libraries (used by tools like `cosign`) are designed to automatically perform these verifications.
    2.  **Inclusion Proof Verification:** When retrieving an entry from Rekor, the client library verifies the inclusion proof, ensuring the entry's hash is correctly included in the Merkle Tree root.
    3.  **Consistency Proof Verification:** The client library also verifies the consistency proof, ensuring that the current Merkle Tree root is a consistent extension of previous roots, preventing tampering with the log's history.
    4.  **API Interaction:** This verification happens as part of the interaction between the client tool and the Rekor API.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Tampering with Rekor's log entries (Severity: High):** Detects attempts to delete or modify entries in the Rekor log.
    *   **Forking of Rekor's log (Severity: High):** Detects attempts to create a parallel, fraudulent version of the Rekor log.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Tampering with Rekor's log entries:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination, assuming correct implementation in the client libraries).
    *   **Forking of Rekor's log:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination, assuming correct implementation in the client libraries).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, `cosign` and other Sigstore client tools, using the Sigstore client libraries, are designed to verify Rekor's Merkle Tree proofs.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None. This is a fundamental aspect of how clients interact with Rekor via the Sigstore libraries.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Multiple Rekor Instances and Verification (Rekor & Clients)](./mitigation_strategies/multiple_rekor_instances_and_verification__rekor_&_clients_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Deploy and utilize multiple, independent Rekor instances, and configure clients to query them.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Multiple Rekor Deployments:** The Sigstore project (or organizations using Sigstore) deploys multiple, independent instances of Rekor, ideally on separate infrastructure.
    2.  **Client Configuration:** Client tools (like `cosign`) are configured (through command-line flags or configuration files) to query multiple Rekor instances.  This uses the Sigstore client libraries' ability to interact with multiple endpoints.
    3.  **Result Comparison:** The Sigstore client libraries compare the responses from the different Rekor instances. Discrepancies indicate a potential problem.
    4.  **Threshold Agreement (Ideal):**  Ideally, the client libraries would implement a threshold agreement mechanism (e.g., requiring agreement from 2 out of 3 instances).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Tampering with Rekor's log entries (Severity: High):** Makes it much harder for an attacker to tamper with the log, as they would need to compromise multiple independent instances.
    *   **Compromise of a single Rekor instance (Severity: High):** Prevents a single compromised Rekor instance from providing false information to clients.
    *   **DoS attack against a single Rekor instance (Severity: Medium):** Provides redundancy; clients can still function if one instance is unavailable.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Tampering with Rekor's log entries:** Risk significantly reduced (requires compromising multiple instances).
    *   **Compromise of a single Rekor instance:** Risk significantly reduced (other instances provide correct data).
    *   **DoS attack against a single Rekor instance:** Risk reduced (clients can use other instances).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. The Sigstore project operates multiple public Rekor instances. Client tools *can* be configured to use multiple instances, but it's not always the default behavior, and threshold agreement is not fully standardized.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Stronger encouragement and easier configuration for clients to *always* use multiple Rekor instances by default.
    *   A more formalized system for discovering and selecting trusted Rekor instances within the Sigstore ecosystem.
    *   Clearer documentation and standardized tooling within the Sigstore client libraries to support threshold agreement across multiple instances.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Witness Cosigning for Rekor (Rekor & Witnesses)](./mitigation_strategies/witness_cosigning_for_rekor__rekor_&_witnesses_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement witness cosigning for the Rekor transparency log, involving external, trusted witnesses.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Witness Selection:** The Sigstore project (or a consortium) identifies multiple independent and trusted parties to act as witnesses.
    2.  **Rekor Modification:** Rekor is modified to support a cosigning protocol.
    3.  **Cosigning Process:** Each witness independently monitors the Rekor log. When a new entry is added, each witness verifies the entry and its inclusion proof. If valid, the witness signs a statement (using their own key) attesting to this.
    4.  **Threshold Signature:** A threshold number of witness signatures (e.g., 2 out of 3) are required for the entry to be considered fully verified. This threshold signature is managed and enforced by Rekor.
    5.  **Client Verification:** Sigstore client tools are updated to verify these witness signatures before accepting an entry from Rekor.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Tampering with Rekor's log entries (Severity: High):** Makes it extremely difficult to tamper with the log, requiring compromise of a threshold number of independent witnesses.
    *   **Compromise of Rekor's signing key (Severity: High):** Even if Rekor's key is compromised, the attacker cannot forge valid entries without witness cooperation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Tampering with Rekor's log entries:** Risk significantly reduced (requires compromising multiple, independent witnesses).
    *   **Compromise of Rekor's signing key:** Risk significantly reduced (witness signatures provide an additional, independent layer of trust).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not fully implemented in the main Sigstore project. There have been discussions and proposals, but it's not a standard feature.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Complete implementation of the cosigning protocol within Rekor.
    *   Selection and onboarding of trusted witnesses within the Sigstore community.
    *   Development of tools and infrastructure to support the cosigning process.
    *   Updates to Sigstore client libraries to verify witness signatures.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Signed Releases of Sigstore Components (Bootstrapping)](./mitigation_strategies/signed_releases_of_sigstore_components__bootstrapping_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  All Sigstore components (Fulcio, Rekor, client tools) are signed using Sigstore itself (a bootstrapping process).

*   **Description:**
    1. **Initial Trust Anchor:** Establish an initial, trusted root key (likely using an HSM and key ceremony, as discussed previously).
    2. **Initial Signing:** Use this initial key to sign the first releases of Sigstore components.
    3. **Bootstrapping:** Once Sigstore is operational, subsequent releases of Sigstore components are signed using Sigstore itself (e.g., using Fulcio and Rekor).
    4. **Client Verification:** Users and systems verifying the signatures on Sigstore components rely on the established Sigstore infrastructure (Fulcio and Rekor) to validate the signatures.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Supply chain attacks targeting Sigstore itself (Severity: High):** Ensures that users are downloading and running authentic, untampered versions of Sigstore components.
    *   **Compromise of build servers (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from distributing malicious versions of Sigstore components if they compromise the build infrastructure.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Supply chain attacks targeting Sigstore itself:** Risk significantly reduced (relies on the integrity of the Sigstore infrastructure).
    *   **Compromise of build servers:** Risk significantly reduced (signatures provide an independent verification mechanism).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
      * Yes, Sigstore components are signed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Full bootstrapping (using Sigstore to sign *all* Sigstore components) may still be in progress or have edge cases.
    *   Clearer public documentation of the bootstrapping process and the initial trust anchor.
