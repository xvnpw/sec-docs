# Attack Surface Analysis for sigstore/sigstore

## Attack Surface: [Root CA Compromise (Fulcio)](./attack_surfaces/root_ca_compromise__fulcio_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker gains full control over the root Certificate Authority (CA) keys used by Fulcio to issue signing certificates.
    *   **Sigstore Contribution:** Fulcio *is* the certificate authority in the Sigstore ecosystem.  Its security is paramount.
    *   **Example:** An attacker breaches the server hosting Fulcio's root CA keys and steals them.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise. The attacker can issue valid certificates for *any* identity, allowing them to sign any artifact and bypass all trust checks.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Offline Root CA:** Keep the root CA completely offline and air-gapped.
        *   **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):** Store root and intermediate CA keys in FIPS 140-2 Level 3 (or higher) certified HSMs.
        *   **Strict Key Management:** Implement rigorous key management procedures, including multi-person control (MPC) for key operations, regular audits, and strong access controls.
        *   **Short-Lived Intermediates:** Use short-lived intermediate CAs to limit the impact of a potential intermediate CA compromise.  Rotate intermediate CAs frequently.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust monitoring and alerting systems to detect any unauthorized access or suspicious activity related to the CA infrastructure.

## Attack Surface: [Intermediate CA Compromise (Fulcio)](./attack_surfaces/intermediate_ca_compromise__fulcio_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of an intermediate CA used by Fulcio.
    *   **Sigstore Contribution:** Fulcio's architecture relies on a hierarchy of CAs, including intermediates.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the software managing an intermediate CA to gain control of its private key.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can issue certificates, but potentially limited by constraints (e.g., name constraints) in the intermediate certificate.  Still allows signing of malicious artifacts under the compromised CA's scope.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **HSMs:** Store intermediate CA keys in HSMs.
        *   **Strong Access Controls:** Implement strict access controls and least privilege principles for systems managing intermediate CAs.
        *   **Short Lifetimes:** Use very short lifetimes for intermediate certificates (e.g., hours or days).
        *   **Regular Rotation:** Rotate intermediate CA keys frequently.
        *   **Name Constraints:** Use name constraints and other certificate extensions to limit the scope of what the intermediate CA can sign.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor for unauthorized certificate issuance from intermediate CAs.

## Attack Surface: [OIDC Provider Compromise (Indirect Fulcio Impact)](./attack_surfaces/oidc_provider_compromise__indirect_fulcio_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider used by Fulcio for identity verification, or the trust configuration between Fulcio and the OIDC provider.
    *   **Sigstore Contribution:** Fulcio delegates identity verification to external OIDC providers. This is a *direct dependency* of Fulcio's operation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker phishes a user's Google account credentials and uses them to obtain a signing certificate from Fulcio.  Alternatively, the attacker compromises the OIDC provider itself.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can obtain valid signing certificates for identities they don't legitimately control, allowing them to sign malicious artifacts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong OIDC Configuration:** Use strong, well-vetted OIDC providers.  Configure strict security settings on the OIDC provider side (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the trust relationship and configuration between Fulcio and the OIDC provider.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the OIDC provider only has the minimum necessary permissions to interact with Fulcio.
        *   **Monitor OIDC Provider:** Monitor for security advisories and breaches related to the chosen OIDC provider.

## Attack Surface: [Rekor Transparency Log Tampering](./attack_surfaces/rekor_transparency_log_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to modify or delete entries in the Rekor transparency log, undermining its integrity.
    *   **Sigstore Contribution:** Rekor *is* the transparency log component of Sigstore.
    *   **Example:** An attacker attempts to exploit a vulnerability in the Rekor server software to remove a record of a previously signed (malicious) artifact.
    *   **Impact:**  Undermines the auditability and tamper-evidence of the system.  Could allow an attacker to retroactively "un-sign" an artifact or make it appear as though a malicious artifact was never signed.  (Note: This is extremely difficult due to Rekor's design).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust Infrastructure Security:** Implement strong security measures for the Rekor infrastructure, including intrusion detection/prevention systems, firewalls, and regular security audits.
        *   **Multiple Rekor Instances:** Use multiple, independent Rekor instances (federation) to increase resilience against tampering and provide redundancy.
        *   **Cryptographic Verification:** Clients should cryptographically verify the Merkle Tree root of the Rekor log to ensure its integrity.
        *   **Gossip Protocol:** Implement a gossip protocol between Rekor instances to detect inconsistencies and potential tampering.
        *   **Regular Backups:** Maintain secure, offline backups of the Rekor log data.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Software Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/client-side_software_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in client tools (like Cosign) that could lead to incorrect signature handling or other security issues.
    * **Sigstore Contribution:** Sigstore provides client tools, and their security is essential.
    * **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in Cosign's signature parsing logic allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability; could range from incorrect verification to remote code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices during client development.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of client software.
        *   **Prompt Patching:** Release security updates promptly to address vulnerabilities.
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities in client dependencies.
        *   **Use Signed Client Binaries:** Distribute client binaries signed with Sigstore itself, to ensure their integrity.
