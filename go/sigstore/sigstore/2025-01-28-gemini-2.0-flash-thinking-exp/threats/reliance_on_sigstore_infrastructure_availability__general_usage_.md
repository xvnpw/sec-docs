### 2. Deep Analysis of Threat: Reliance on Sigstore Infrastructure Availability

#### 2.1 Detailed Threat Description

The core of this threat lies in the application's dependency on external, centralized Sigstore services for critical security operations. Sigstore, while providing significant benefits in terms of ease of use and security for code signing and verification, introduces a dependency on its infrastructure being consistently available.

Specifically, applications relying on Sigstore typically interact with:

*   **Fulcio:**  To obtain short-lived certificates based on OIDC identities for signing artifacts. If Fulcio is unavailable, the application cannot obtain signing certificates and therefore cannot sign artifacts.
*   **Rekor:** To record signing events in a tamper-proof transparency log. If Rekor is unavailable, the application might be unable to record signing events, potentially impacting auditability and non-repudiation.  Verification processes also often rely on Rekor to check the transparency log.
*   **OIDC Providers:** While not strictly Sigstore infrastructure, the application relies on the availability of configured OIDC providers (like Google, GitHub, etc.) for user authentication and identity assertion required by Fulcio.  OIDC provider outages can indirectly impact Sigstore usage.

The "Reliance on Sigstore Infrastructure Availability" threat materializes when any of these components become unavailable due to:

*   **Sigstore Infrastructure Outages:**  Unforeseen technical issues, maintenance, or attacks on Sigstore's infrastructure.
*   **Network Connectivity Issues:**  Problems with network connectivity between the application and Sigstore services, either on the application's side or within the network path to Sigstore.
*   **OIDC Provider Outages:**  Unavailability of the configured OIDC identity provider.
*   **Rate Limiting or Throttling:**  If the application exceeds Sigstore's usage limits, it might be temporarily blocked, effectively simulating an outage from the application's perspective.

#### 2.2 Impact Analysis (Deep Dive)

The impact of Sigstore infrastructure unavailability is rated as **High** because it can directly disrupt critical application functionalities. Let's explore specific scenarios:

*   **Deployment Pipeline Disruption:**
    *   **Signing Stage Failure:**  If Sigstore (Fulcio/Rekor) is unavailable during the artifact signing stage in a CI/CD pipeline, new releases cannot be signed. This halts the deployment process, preventing new versions of the application from being deployed.
    *   **Verification Stage Failure:** If Sigstore (Rekor) is unavailable during the verification stage in a deployment pipeline, the pipeline might fail to verify the signatures of artifacts being deployed. This can block deployments even if the artifacts are validly signed, leading to deployment freezes and potential rollbacks.
*   **Broken Security Checks:**
    *   **Runtime Verification Failure:** Applications might perform signature verification at runtime to ensure the integrity and authenticity of loaded components or data. Sigstore unavailability during runtime verification can lead to application startup failures, feature degradation, or even security bypasses if verification is not properly handled.
    *   **Policy Enforcement Bypass:** Security policies might rely on signature verification using Sigstore. If Sigstore is unavailable, these policies cannot be enforced, potentially opening security vulnerabilities.
*   **Operational Workflow Disruption:**
    *   **Manual Signing Processes:** Development teams might rely on Sigstore for ad-hoc signing of tools, scripts, or configurations. Outages disrupt these workflows, hindering development and operational tasks.
    *   **Audit Trail Gaps:** If Rekor is unavailable, signing events might not be logged, creating gaps in audit trails and potentially impacting compliance requirements.
*   **Cascading Failures:**  Dependency on Sigstore can create cascading failures. If a core application component relies on Sigstore for verification, and verification fails due to Sigstore outage, it can lead to the failure of the entire application or critical subsystems.

**Example Scenario:** Consider a cloud-native application that uses Sigstore to sign container images in its CI/CD pipeline and verifies these signatures during deployment to Kubernetes. If Rekor is unavailable during deployment, Kubernetes might fail to verify the image signatures, preventing the application from being deployed or updated. This directly impacts application availability and release cycles.

#### 2.3 Vulnerability Analysis

The vulnerability stems from the **single point of failure** introduced by relying on external Sigstore services.  The application's security posture and operational continuity become directly tied to the availability of infrastructure it does not control.

Key vulnerabilities include:

*   **Lack of Redundancy (Application-Side):**  Applications often directly integrate with Sigstore APIs without built-in redundancy or fallback mechanisms to handle outages gracefully.
*   **Tight Coupling:**  Critical application logic (signing, verification) is tightly coupled to the availability of Sigstore services, making the application brittle in the face of external dependencies.
*   **Insufficient Error Handling:**  Applications might not implement robust error handling for Sigstore API failures, leading to abrupt failures instead of graceful degradation.
*   **Limited Offline Capabilities:**  Reliance on online Sigstore services inherently limits the application's ability to operate in offline or disconnected environments, or during periods of Sigstore unavailability.

#### 2.4 Mitigation Strategy Evaluation

The proposed mitigation strategies are a good starting point, focusing on application-level responsibilities:

*   **Caching Verification Results:**
    *   **Strengths:** Reduces real-time dependency on Rekor for repeated verifications. Improves performance and reduces load on Sigstore services.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Caching introduces complexity in cache management (invalidation, expiry).  Cache poisoning vulnerabilities need to be considered.  Caching might not be effective for initial verifications or infrequently accessed artifacts.  The cache itself becomes a point of concern for availability and consistency.
    *   **Evaluation:**  Effective for reducing *frequency* of Sigstore interaction but does not eliminate the dependency entirely. Requires careful implementation to avoid security and consistency issues.

*   **Fallback Mechanisms/Degraded Functionality:**
    *   **Strengths:** Allows the application to remain partially operational during Sigstore outages, minimizing disruption to core functionality.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Defining "degraded functionality" securely and effectively can be complex.  Fallback mechanisms must be carefully designed to avoid weakening security posture during outages.  Decisions on when and how to activate fallback modes need to be well-defined.
    *   **Evaluation:** Crucial for maintaining operational continuity. Requires careful planning and implementation to ensure security is not compromised in degraded modes.

*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   **Strengths:** Enables proactive detection of Sigstore outages, allowing for timely response and mitigation efforts.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Monitoring is reactive. Alerts need to be configured correctly to avoid false positives and alert fatigue.  Monitoring alone does not prevent outages, only detects them.  Response procedures need to be in place once alerts are triggered.
    *   **Evaluation:** Essential for operational awareness and incident response.  Needs to be integrated with incident management processes.

**Overall Evaluation of Proposed Mitigations:** The proposed strategies are valuable and necessary, but they are primarily focused on *reducing the impact* of outages rather than *eliminating the dependency*. They are application-level responsibilities and should be implemented. However, they might not be sufficient for all scenarios, especially for applications with stringent availability requirements.

#### 2.5 Gap Analysis and Additional Mitigation Strategies

While the proposed mitigations are important, there are gaps and opportunities for further strengthening resilience:

*   **No Mitigation for Signing Outages:** The current mitigations primarily address verification outages (caching, fallback).  There is no direct mitigation for the inability to *sign* artifacts if Fulcio/Rekor are unavailable. This is a significant gap, especially for CI/CD pipelines.
    *   **Additional Mitigation:** Explore options for delayed signing or queuing signing requests to be processed once Sigstore services are restored.  Consider if there are scenarios where local signing (without Fulcio/Rekor for immediate attestation) could be a temporary fallback, understanding the security implications and limitations.  This is complex and needs careful consideration as it deviates from the core Sigstore model.

*   **Granular Fallback Strategies:**  Instead of a single "degraded mode," consider more granular fallback strategies based on specific functionalities. For example, critical security checks might have stricter fallback requirements than less critical audit logging.

*   **Proactive Health Checks:** Implement proactive health checks for Sigstore services *before* attempting critical operations. This allows for early detection of potential issues and can trigger fallback mechanisms preemptively.

*   **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Implement a circuit breaker pattern for Sigstore API calls. If Sigstore services are repeatedly failing, the circuit breaker can temporarily halt requests to Sigstore, preventing cascading failures and allowing the application to operate in a degraded mode more gracefully.

*   **Dependency on Specific Sigstore Versions:**  Track the Sigstore service versions being used and have a plan for handling Sigstore service upgrades or potential API changes.  Ensure compatibility and test application behavior against different Sigstore versions.

*   **Consider Regionality and Redundancy (Sigstore Perspective - Awareness):** While the application cannot directly control Sigstore's infrastructure, understanding Sigstore's own redundancy and regional deployment strategy can inform risk assessment and mitigation planning.  Being aware of Sigstore's status pages and communication channels is important for incident response.

*   **Document Dependencies and Failure Modes:**  Clearly document the application's dependency on Sigstore, the potential failure modes, and the implemented mitigation strategies. This documentation is crucial for incident response and future development.

#### 2.6 Conclusion and Recommendations

Reliance on Sigstore infrastructure availability is a significant threat with a **High** risk severity due to its potential to disrupt critical application functionalities, particularly signing and verification processes.
