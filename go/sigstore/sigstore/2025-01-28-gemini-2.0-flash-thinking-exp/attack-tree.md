## Attack Tree Path: [1. Subvert Signature Verification [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__subvert_signature_verification__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** This path represents the overarching goal of bypassing Sigstore's security mechanism. If successful, the application will accept and potentially execute or process unverified or malicious artifacts, defeating the purpose of using Sigstore.
* **Why High-Risk:** Directly undermines the core security benefit of Sigstore integration, leading to potential full application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Bypass Verification Logic in Application [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__bypass_verification_logic_in_application__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Description:**  Focuses on vulnerabilities within the application's own code that handles Sigstore verification.  Instead of attacking Sigstore itself, the attacker targets weaknesses in *how* the application uses Sigstore.
* **Why High-Risk:** Application-level vulnerabilities are often easier to exploit than vulnerabilities in well-established security projects like Sigstore. Direct impact on application security.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Vulnerability in Application's Verification Code [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__vulnerability_in_application's_verification_code__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * **Code Defects:**  Programming errors in the application's code that performs signature verification. This could include:
        * Incorrect implementation of verification algorithms.
        * Logic flaws that allow bypassing verification checks under certain conditions.
        * Improper error handling that leads to accepting invalid signatures.
    * **Example:**  A developer might incorrectly use a Sigstore library function, or implement custom verification logic with flaws.
* **Why Critical:** Direct vulnerability in the application's security implementation. Exploitable with moderate skill and effort if the code is not thoroughly reviewed and tested.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Configuration Error in Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__configuration_error_in_application__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * **Misconfiguration:** Incorrectly setting up Sigstore verification parameters in the application's configuration. This could include:
        * Disabling verification entirely by mistake.
        * Using incorrect or insecure trust roots.
        * Setting overly permissive verification policies.
    * **Example:**  Accidentally setting a configuration flag to skip signature verification during development and forgetting to remove it in production.
* **Why Critical:** Simple misconfigurations can completely negate security measures. Low effort and skill for attackers to exploit if configuration is exposed or guessable.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Supply Malicious Artifact with Valid Sigstore Signature [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__supply_malicious_artifact_with_valid_sigstore_signature__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Description:**  Instead of bypassing verification, the attacker aims to obtain a *valid* Sigstore signature for a malicious artifact. If successful, the application will correctly verify the signature and accept the malicious artifact as legitimate.
* **Why High-Risk:**  Circumvents Sigstore's intended security by abusing the trust in valid signatures.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1. Compromise Developer's Signing Key (Ephemeral) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__compromise_developer's_signing_key__ephemeral___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Description:**  Focuses on compromising the ephemeral signing key used by a developer to sign artifacts. Sigstore's design relies on short-lived keys tied to OIDC identities, but compromise of these keys still allows signing malicious artifacts.
* **Why High-Risk:** Developer key compromise is a common and effective attack vector.  If a developer's key is compromised, any artifact signed with it will be considered valid by Sigstore.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1. Phishing/Social Engineering Developer [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1__phishingsocial_engineering_developer__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * **Phishing:** Tricking a developer into revealing their OIDC credentials or session tokens through deceptive emails, websites, or other social engineering tactics.
    * **Social Engineering:** Manipulating a developer into performing actions that compromise their credentials or machine, such as installing malware or visiting malicious links.
* **Why Critical:** Social engineering is often highly effective and requires low technical skill from the attacker. Developers are prime targets as they have access to signing keys.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.2. Compromise Developer's OIDC Account [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_2__compromise_developer's_oidc_account__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * **Credential Theft:** Stealing a developer's OIDC account credentials (username and password) through various means like phishing, credential stuffing, or malware.
    * **Session Hijacking:**  Stealing a developer's active OIDC session token to impersonate them without needing their credentials directly.
* **Why Critical:** OIDC account compromise grants the attacker access to the developer's identity within the Sigstore ecosystem, allowing them to generate valid signing keys.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.3. Malware on Developer's Machine [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_3__malware_on_developer's_machine__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * **Malware Infection:** Infecting a developer's computer with malware (e.g., keyloggers, spyware, remote access trojans) to steal credentials, session tokens, or even directly access signing keys if they are stored locally (though Sigstore encourages ephemeral keys).
* **Why Critical:** Malware on a developer's machine can provide broad access to sensitive information and actions, including signing processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on Verification Process [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_verification_process__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Description:**  Interception and manipulation of network communication between the application and Sigstore services (primarily Rekor) during the verification process. The attacker aims to alter the verification results to falsely indicate that a malicious artifact is valid.
* **Why High-Risk:** MitM attacks can directly manipulate the verification process without needing to compromise signatures or application code.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1. MitM between Application and Rekor [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1__mitm_between_application_and_rekor__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * **Network Interception:** Positioning an attacker's system between the application and the Rekor transparency log server.
    * **Response Manipulation:** Intercepting the application's requests to Rekor and manipulating the responses to falsely indicate that a signature is valid or that a malicious artifact is logged in Rekor when it is not.
    * **Example:**  An attacker on the same network as the application could use ARP spoofing to become the MitM and intercept/modify Rekor communication.
* **Why Critical:** Rekor is essential for verifying the transparency and immutability of signatures. MitM attacks here can completely undermine trust in Sigstore's verification process.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Sigstore Libraries Used by Application [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_sigstore_libraries_used_by_application__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Sigstore libraries (like `cosign` libraries) that the application uses for integration. This could be due to known vulnerabilities in the libraries themselves or due to incorrect usage of the libraries by the application.
* **Why High-Risk:** Library vulnerabilities can be widespread and affect many applications. Incorrect library usage is a common source of security issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3. Misuse of Sigstore Libraries Leading to Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3_3__misuse_of_sigstore_libraries_leading_to_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**
    * **Incorrect API Usage:**  Using Sigstore library functions in a way that was not intended or that introduces security vulnerabilities. This could include:
        * Not properly handling errors returned by library functions.
        * Using insecure or deprecated library features.
        * Incorrectly configuring library options.
    * **Lack of Understanding:** Developers not fully understanding the security implications of Sigstore library usage and making mistakes in integration.
    * **Example:**  Not properly validating inputs before passing them to Sigstore library functions, or mishandling cryptographic keys or certificates within the application's code.
* **Why Critical and High-Risk Path:** Even if Sigstore libraries are secure themselves, incorrect usage by the application can create significant vulnerabilities. This is a direct result of application development practices and requires careful code review and security awareness.
