# Attack Surface Analysis for sigstore/sigstore

## Attack Surface: [OIDC Identity Provider Compromise](./attack_surfaces/oidc_identity_provider_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the OIDC provider used by Fulcio for identity verification.
*   **Sigstore Contribution:** Sigstore relies on OIDC for user identity during certificate issuance via Fulcio. Compromise of the OIDC provider directly undermines Sigstore's trust model by allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users during certificate requests.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises the Google Workspace account of a developer and uses it to request a signing certificate from Fulcio, falsely representing themselves as the legitimate developer.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can obtain valid Sigstore certificates for arbitrary identities, allowing them to sign malicious artifacts that appear legitimate and bypass verification in downstream systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong OIDC Provider Security:** Implement robust security measures for the OIDC provider, including multi-factor authentication, strong password policies, and regular security audits.
    *   **Monitor OIDC Logs:** Actively monitor OIDC provider logs for suspicious activity and unauthorized access attempts related to Sigstore interactions.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions within the OIDC provider to applications and users interacting with Sigstore.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of OIDC Integration:** Periodically review and audit the integration between Fulcio and the OIDC provider to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the configuration and communication.

## Attack Surface: [Fulcio Private Key Compromise](./attack_surfaces/fulcio_private_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** The private key used by Fulcio to sign certificates is compromised.
*   **Sigstore Contribution:** Fulcio's private key is the root of trust for the entire Sigstore certificate issuance process. Its compromise completely breaks the chain of trust established by Sigstore, rendering all issued certificates potentially suspect.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Fulcio private key through a server breach, insider threat, or vulnerability in key management practices. They can then issue valid certificates for any identity without legitimate OIDC authentication.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Sigstore trust model. Attackers can sign any artifact and have it appear as validly signed by Sigstore, effectively bypassing all Sigstore-based verification mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):** Store the Fulcio private key in a highly secure HSM to protect it from unauthorized access, extraction, and misuse.
    *   **Strict Access Control:** Implement stringent access controls and monitoring for systems and personnel involved in managing the Fulcio private key and related infrastructure.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of Fulcio infrastructure, focusing on key management and access control mechanisms.
    *   **Key Rotation and Ceremony:** Implement regular key rotation procedures and secure key generation ceremonies to minimize the window of opportunity if a key is compromised and to limit the lifespan of any single key.

## Attack Surface: [Rekor Log Tampering/Corruption](./attack_surfaces/rekor_log_tamperingcorruption.md)

*   **Description:** The Rekor transparency log, which records signature information, is tampered with or corrupted.
*   **Sigstore Contribution:** Rekor provides the transparency and non-repudiation aspect of Sigstore. Tampering with Rekor directly undermines this core functionality, making it impossible to reliably verify the history and integrity of signatures.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Rekor database and modifies or deletes log entries to hide evidence of malicious signatures or forge the history of legitimate signatures, effectively manipulating the audit trail.
*   **Impact:** Loss of trust in the transparency and auditability of Sigstore. It becomes difficult or impossible to verify the integrity of the signature log, potentially allowing attackers to hide malicious activities or falsely claim legitimacy.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immutable Storage:** Utilize immutable storage solutions for the Rekor log to prevent tampering after entries are written, ensuring the integrity of historical records.
    *   **Cryptographic Integrity Checks:** Implement cryptographic integrity checks (e.g., Merkle tree) within Rekor to detect any unauthorized modifications to the log data and provide verifiable proof of log integrity.
    *   **Replication and Redundancy:** Replicate Rekor data across multiple geographically separated locations to ensure data availability, durability, and resilience against data loss or corruption due to localized failures or attacks.
    *   **Strict Access Control and Monitoring:** Implement strict access controls and comprehensive monitoring for Rekor infrastructure to prevent unauthorized access, modifications, and detect suspicious activities.
    *   **Regular Audits of Rekor Integrity:** Periodically audit the integrity of the Rekor log using cryptographic proofs and consistency checks to proactively detect any signs of tampering or corruption.

## Attack Surface: [Cosign Binary Compromise (Supply Chain Attack)](./attack_surfaces/cosign_binary_compromise__supply_chain_attack_.md)

*   **Description:** The Cosign binaries or distribution mechanism are compromised, leading users to download and use a malicious version of the Cosign tool.
*   **Sigstore Contribution:** Cosign is the primary client tool users interact with for signing and verifying artifacts with Sigstore. A compromised Cosign directly impacts user security and the integrity of their Sigstore operations.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises the Cosign release pipeline, build infrastructure, or a download mirror, replacing legitimate Cosign binaries with malicious versions that contain backdoors, malware, or bypass verification mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can control the signing and verification process on user machines, potentially injecting malicious signatures, bypassing security measures, or gaining unauthorized access to user systems through the compromised Cosign binary.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Software Supply Chain for Cosign:** Implement robust security measures for the Cosign build and release pipeline, including code signing of releases, vulnerability scanning of dependencies, reproducible builds, and strict access controls to the release infrastructure.
    *   **Verify Cosign Binary Integrity:** Users should always verify the integrity of downloaded Cosign binaries using checksums or digital signatures provided by the official Sigstore project through trusted channels.
    *   **Use Trusted Distribution Channels:** Download Cosign only from official and trusted sources, such as the Sigstore project's official website, GitHub releases page, or reputable package managers that verify signatures.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA) for Cosign Dependencies:** Regularly perform Software Composition Analysis on Cosign's dependencies to identify known vulnerabilities and promptly update them to patched versions.

## Attack Surface: [Cosign Verification Bypass Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/cosign_verification_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Cosign's signature verification logic allow attackers to craft artifacts that bypass verification checks, even if they are not legitimately signed or have been tampered with.
*   **Sigstore Contribution:** Cosign is the component responsible for enforcing signature verification based on Sigstore's trust model. Vulnerabilities in Cosign directly weaken the security guarantees provided by Sigstore, potentially allowing malicious artifacts to be accepted as valid.
*   **Example:** A bug in Cosign's verification code, such as improper handling of signature formats or certificate chains, allows an attacker to create a specially crafted container image or artifact that Cosign incorrectly identifies as validly signed, even though it lacks a legitimate Sigstore signature.
*   **Impact:** Applications and systems relying on Cosign for verification could be tricked into accepting unsigned or maliciously signed artifacts, leading to security breaches, supply chain attacks, or deployment of compromised software.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Cosign Updates:** Keep Cosign updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes, security patches, and improvements to verification logic.
    *   **Security Audits and Penetration Testing of Cosign:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting Cosign's verification logic to proactively identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
    *   **Report Vulnerabilities:** Encourage security researchers and users to responsibly report any discovered vulnerabilities in Cosign's verification process to the Sigstore project through established security channels.
    *   **Thorough Testing of Verification Logic:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for Cosign's verification logic, covering various scenarios, edge cases, and potential attack vectors to ensure its robustness and correctness.
