# Attack Surface Analysis for sigstore/sigstore

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Signing Key Material](./attack_surfaces/compromised_signing_key_material.md)

*   **Description:** The private key used for signing artifacts is exposed or stolen.
    *   **How Sigstore Contributes:** Sigstore relies on cryptographic keys for signing. While it encourages ephemeral keys via Fulcio, the initial private key generation or the storage of long-lived keys (if used) introduces this risk.
    *   **Example:** A developer's local machine containing the signing key is compromised, or a key stored in a poorly secured key management system is accessed by an attacker.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can sign malicious artifacts, making them appear legitimate and trusted by systems relying on Sigstore verification.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize ephemeral keys issued by Fulcio whenever possible to minimize the lifespan and exposure of private keys.
        *   If long-lived keys are necessary, store them securely using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or robust Key Management Systems (KMS) with strong access controls and auditing.
        *   Implement proper key rotation policies.
        *   Avoid storing private keys directly in code or configuration files.
        *   Educate developers on secure key management practices.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Signing Process](./attack_surfaces/compromised_signing_process.md)

*   **Description:** The process of signing an artifact is manipulated to sign unintended or malicious content.
    *   **How Sigstore Contributes:** The integration of Sigstore client tools (like `cosign`) into the build or release pipeline creates points where the signing process can be intercepted or altered.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD pipeline and modifies the signing script to sign a backdoored artifact instead of the intended one.
    *   **Impact:**  Malicious artifacts can be signed with legitimate identities, bypassing security checks and potentially compromising downstream systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the build and release pipeline infrastructure with strong access controls and monitoring.
        *   Implement integrity checks for signing scripts and tools.
        *   Use isolated and controlled environments for signing operations.
        *   Employ multi-factor authentication for accessing signing infrastructure.
        *   Regularly audit the signing process and related infrastructure.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Confusion/Supply Chain Attacks on Sigstore Client Libraries](./attack_surfaces/dependency_confusionsupply_chain_attacks_on_sigstore_client_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious versions of Sigstore client libraries are introduced into the build process, compromising the signing or verification functionality.
    *   **How Sigstore Contributes:** Applications directly depend on Sigstore client libraries (e.g., `cosign` as a library in some cases). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious package with a similar name to a legitimate Sigstore library to a public package repository, and a build system inadvertently pulls the malicious version.
    *   **Impact:**  Malicious code can be injected into the signing or verification process, potentially leading to the signing of malicious artifacts or the acceptance of invalid signatures.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize dependency pinning and checksum verification for Sigstore client libraries.
        *   Employ private package repositories for internal dependencies.
        *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools.
        *   Implement a robust software supply chain security strategy.

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of Rekor Instance](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_rekor_instance.md)

*   **Description:** The Rekor transparency log is compromised, allowing attackers to tamper with or delete log entries.
    *   **How Sigstore Contributes:** Rekor's integrity is crucial for the non-repudiation and auditability of signatures. Compromising it undermines the trust model.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains administrative access to the Rekor instance and removes entries related to the signing of a malicious artifact.
    *   **Impact:**  The ability to verify the history and authenticity of signed artifacts is compromised. Attackers could potentially hide evidence of malicious activity.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the Rekor instance is securely configured and hardened.
        *   Implement strong access controls and authentication for the Rekor instance.
        *   Regularly back up the Rekor data.
        *   Monitor the Rekor instance for suspicious activity and unauthorized access.
        *   Consider using multiple Rekor instances or participating in a public Rekor instance for increased resilience.

## Attack Surface: [Bypassing Verification Checks](./attack_surfaces/bypassing_verification_checks.md)

*   **Description:**  The application's implementation of Sigstore verification is flawed, allowing unsigned or invalidly signed artifacts to be accepted.
    *   **How Sigstore Contributes:** While Sigstore provides the tools for verification, the application developer is responsible for correctly implementing and enforcing these checks.
    *   **Example:** The application checks for the presence of a signature but doesn't properly validate the signature's authenticity or chain of trust.
    *   **Impact:**  The application can be tricked into trusting malicious artifacts, negating the security benefits of using Sigstore.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test the signature verification logic.
        *   Use well-vetted and maintained Sigstore verification libraries.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions based on signature verification.
        *   Regularly review and audit the verification implementation.

## Attack Surface: [Reliance on Compromised Trust Roots](./attack_surfaces/reliance_on_compromised_trust_roots.md)

*   **Description:** The application trusts a compromised Fulcio root certificate or Rekor public key.
    *   **How Sigstore Contributes:** The trust model of Sigstore relies on the integrity of these root components. If they are compromised, the entire system is vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker manages to compromise the Fulcio root CA and issues a malicious signing certificate that is trusted by applications.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can forge valid signatures that are trusted by the application, completely undermining the security of the system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Verify the authenticity and integrity of the Fulcio root certificate and Rekor public key used for verification.
        *   Stay informed about any potential compromises or changes to these root components from the Sigstore project.
        *   Implement mechanisms to update trust roots securely if necessary.
