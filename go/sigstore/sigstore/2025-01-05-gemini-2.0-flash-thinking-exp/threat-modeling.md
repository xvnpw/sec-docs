# Threat Model Analysis for sigstore/sigstore

## Threat: [Compromised OIDC Provider](./threats/compromised_oidc_provider.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the configured OIDC provider used by Fulcio. They could then authenticate as legitimate users and obtain valid signing certificates from Fulcio for malicious purposes.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can sign and distribute malicious artifacts that appear to be legitimately signed by Sigstore, potentially leading to supply chain attacks, malware distribution, or unauthorized actions.
*   **Affected Component:** Fulcio.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on OIDC Flow](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_oidc_flow.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the user/application and the OIDC provider during the authentication process, specifically targeting the flow used to obtain signing certificates from Fulcio. They could steal the OIDC token or manipulate the flow to obtain signing certificates on behalf of the legitimate user.
*   **Impact:** Similar to a compromised OIDC provider, attackers can obtain valid signing certificates from Fulcio and sign malicious artifacts that will be trusted by systems relying on Sigstore verification.
*   **Affected Component:** Fulcio (via its reliance on the OIDC flow).
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Replay Attacks on Signing Certificates](./threats/replay_attacks_on_signing_certificates.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts a valid, short-lived signing certificate issued by Fulcio along with a signing request. They could then replay this certificate and request within its validity period to sign unauthorized artifacts, bypassing the intended one-time use of the Fulcio certificate.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can sign malicious content that will be considered valid by Sigstore verification processes.
*   **Affected Component:** Fulcio.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium (While the impact can be high, the window of opportunity is limited by the certificate's short lifespan. However, given the potential for misuse, it's included here).

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Sigstore Signing Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_sigstore_signing_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist in the client libraries used to interact with Sigstore for signing (e.g., `cosign`, `go-sig`). Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass security checks within the Sigstore libraries, manipulate signing requests processed by Sigstore components, or potentially extract sensitive information related to Sigstore interactions.
*   **Impact:** Attackers could forge signatures that are considered valid by Sigstore, sign malicious artifacts without proper authorization through Sigstore, or gain access to sensitive data handled by Sigstore libraries.
*   **Affected Component:** Sigstore client-side signing libraries (e.g., `cosign`, `go-sig`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability).

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Sigstore Verification Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_sigstore_verification_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist in the client libraries used for signature verification against Sigstore. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to forge successful verification results even for invalid signatures generated outside of Sigstore's intended processes, or manipulate the verification process within the Sigstore libraries.
*   **Impact:** The application incorrectly trusts malicious artifacts that would otherwise be flagged by proper Sigstore verification, leading to potential security breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** Sigstore client-side verification libraries (e.g., `cosign`, `go-sig`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability).

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Rekor Retrieval](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_rekor_retrieval.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the application and the Rekor transparency log when retrieving verification information. They could manipulate the retrieved entries from Rekor, leading the application to believe a malicious artifact has a valid Sigstore signature when it doesn't, or vice versa.
*   **Impact:** The application makes incorrect trust decisions based on falsified Rekor data, undermining the integrity guarantees provided by Sigstore's transparency log.
*   **Affected Component:** Rekor.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Compromise of Rekor Infrastructure](./threats/compromise_of_rekor_infrastructure.md)

*   **Description:** The Rekor transparency log infrastructure itself is compromised. Attackers could potentially tamper with the log entries, making it impossible to reliably verify the authenticity and integrity of signed artifacts through Sigstore.
*   **Impact:** The entire trust model of Sigstore is undermined, as the transparency log, a core component, can no longer be relied upon.
*   **Affected Component:** Rekor infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Data Integrity Issues in Rekor (Beyond Compromise)](./threats/data_integrity_issues_in_rekor__beyond_compromise_.md)

*   **Description:** Due to unforeseen bugs or vulnerabilities in the Rekor software itself, inconsistencies or data corruption might occur within the log, even without a direct external compromise. This affects the reliability of Sigstore's transparency guarantees.
*   **Impact:** Verification results become unreliable, potentially leading to the acceptance of invalid artifacts or the rejection of valid ones based on faulty Rekor data.
*   **Affected Component:** Rekor software.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Compromise of Fulcio Infrastructure](./threats/compromise_of_fulcio_infrastructure.md)

*   **Description:** The Fulcio certificate authority infrastructure is compromised. Attackers could issue valid signing certificates for arbitrary identities, completely undermining the trust model enforced by Sigstore.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can create and distribute malicious artifacts that are indistinguishable from legitimate ones verified by Sigstore. This represents a catastrophic failure of the Sigstore trust system.
*   **Affected Component:** Fulcio infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Fulcio Software](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_fulcio_software.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist in the Fulcio software itself. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass security checks or manipulate the certificate issuance process within Fulcio, allowing them to obtain unauthorized signing certificates.
*   **Impact:** Attackers could obtain signing certificates that should not be issued, allowing them to forge identities within the Sigstore ecosystem.
*   **Affected Component:** Fulcio software.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability).

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Fulcio](./threats/misconfiguration_of_fulcio.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect configuration of Fulcio could lead to the issuance of certificates with unintended permissions or for unauthorized identities, weakening the intended security controls of Sigstore.
*   **Impact:** Attackers might be able to obtain certificates they shouldn't have access to, potentially allowing them to sign artifacts under false pretenses within the Sigstore framework.
*   **Affected Component:** Fulcio configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks on Sigstore Libraries](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution_attacks_on_sigstore_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious library with the same name as a legitimate Sigstore client library to a public repository. If the application's dependency management is not properly configured, it might download and use the malicious Sigstore library instead of the official one.
*   **Impact:** The application uses a compromised Sigstore library, potentially leading to signature forgery, bypassed verification checks enforced by Sigstore libraries, or other security issues directly related to Sigstore functionality.
*   **Affected Component:** Sigstore client libraries (as dependencies).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
