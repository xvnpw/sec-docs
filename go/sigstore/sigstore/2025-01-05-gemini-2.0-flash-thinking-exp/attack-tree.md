## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Weaknesses in Signature Verification](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_weaknesses_in_signature_verification.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application verifies signatures generated by Sigstore. If successful, an attacker can introduce malicious artifacts that the application mistakenly trusts.
    * **Bypass Signature Verification [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The application entirely skips the signature verification process, making it vulnerable to any unsigned or maliciously signed content.
        * **Attack Vector:**  The application attempts verification but fails to execute the verification logic due to errors or exceptions.
    * **Application Does Not Implement Verification [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Developers neglect to implement any signature verification logic, assuming trust based on other factors or simply overlooking this critical step.
    * **Verification Logic is Flawed [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The verification logic contains errors that allow invalid signatures to pass.
            * **Incorrect Certificate Chain Validation:** The application fails to properly build or validate the chain of trust from the signing certificate back to a trusted root, allowing signatures with untrusted or expired certificates to be accepted.
            * **Ignoring or Misinterpreting Verification Results:** The verification process might correctly identify an invalid signature, but the application logic fails to act upon this information, proceeding as if the signature was valid.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Sigstore Infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_sigstore_infrastructure.md)

**Attack Vector:** This node represents a direct attack on the core components of the Sigstore ecosystem. Success here has wide-ranging and severe consequences.
    * **Compromise Fulcio (Certificate Authority):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Fulcio software itself to gain control or manipulate its operations.
        * **Attack Vector:**  Though highly unlikely due to ephemeral keys, in a hypothetical scenario where signing keys were compromised, an attacker could forge valid signing certificates for any identity.
    * **Compromise the OIDC Provider Used by Sigstore:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the OIDC provider's software to gain unauthorized access.
        * **Attack Vector:**  Successfully performing an account takeover of a legitimate user's OIDC account, allowing the attacker to generate valid signing certificates under that user's identity.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Weaknesses in Signature Creation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_weaknesses_in_signature_creation.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path focuses on manipulating the signature creation process to sign malicious artifacts with seemingly valid identities.
    * **Trick a Legitimate User/Process into Signing Malicious Artifact:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Using social engineering techniques to deceive a legitimate user into signing a malicious artifact. This could involve phishing, impersonation, or other forms of manipulation.
        * **Attack Vector:** In a CI/CD pipeline or automated signing process, compromising the environment or tools used for signing, allowing the attacker to inject malicious artifacts into the signing flow.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Dependencies or Interactions with Sigstore](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_dependencies_or_interactions_with_sigstore.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities introduced by the application's reliance on Sigstore client libraries and how it handles Sigstore-related data.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Sigstore Client Libraries Used by the Application [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the Sigstore client libraries used by the application. These vulnerabilities could allow for bypassing verification, forging requests, or other malicious actions. Attackers often target known vulnerabilities in popular libraries as they provide a wide attack surface.
