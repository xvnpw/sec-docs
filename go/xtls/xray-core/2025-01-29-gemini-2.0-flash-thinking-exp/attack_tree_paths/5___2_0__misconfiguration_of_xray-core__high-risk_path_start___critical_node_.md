### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Misconfiguration of Xray-core

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the "Misconfiguration of Xray-core" attack path, categorized by common misconfiguration areas.

**4.1. Insecure Transport Layer Security (TLS) Configuration**

*   **Specific Misconfiguration Examples:**
    *   **Weak Cipher Suites:**  Using outdated or weak cipher suites (e.g., those vulnerable to known attacks like POODLE or BEAST) in the `tlsSettings` section of inbound or outbound configurations.
    *   **Disabled or Weak TLS Versions:**  Allowing or enforcing outdated TLS versions like TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1, which have known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Missing or Incorrect Certificate Verification:** Disabling certificate verification (`allowInsecure: true`) or improperly configuring certificate chains, allowing for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
    *   **Self-Signed Certificates in Production:** Using self-signed certificates without proper trust management, leading to browser warnings and potential MITM risks if users ignore warnings.
    *   **Insecure SNI Configuration:** Incorrect or missing Server Name Indication (SNI) configuration, potentially leading to routing errors or exposure of internal server names.

*   **Exploitation Techniques:**
    *   **MITM Attacks:**  Exploiting weak cipher suites or disabled certificate verification to intercept and decrypt encrypted traffic, potentially stealing sensitive data (credentials, API keys, user data).
    *   **Downgrade Attacks:** Forcing the connection to use weaker TLS versions to exploit known vulnerabilities in those versions.
    *   **Passive Eavesdropping:**  In some cases, weak cipher suites might be susceptible to passive decryption over time.
