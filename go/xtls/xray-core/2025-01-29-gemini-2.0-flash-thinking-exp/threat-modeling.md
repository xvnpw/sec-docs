# Threat Model Analysis for xtls/xray-core

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration of Xray-core](./threats/insecure_configuration_of_xray-core.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit misconfigurations in xray-core to bypass security controls, intercept traffic, or gain unauthorized access. For example, they might leverage weak ciphers to decrypt traffic, exploit open management APIs, or use permissive routing rules to access internal resources.
*   **Impact:** Compromised confidentiality, integrity, and availability of proxied traffic. Potential data breaches, unauthorized access to internal systems, and service disruption.
*   **Affected Xray-core Component:** Configuration system, Inbound/Outbound proxies, Routing module, API (if enabled).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow security hardening guides for xray-core configuration.
    *   Use strong encryption protocols and ciphers (e.g., TLS 1.3, AES-GCM).
    *   Disable or secure management APIs with strong authentication and authorization.
    *   Implement least privilege routing rules and access control lists.
    *   Regularly audit and review configurations.
    *   Use configuration management tools for consistent and secure deployments.

## Threat: [Exposure of Xray-core Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_xray-core_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** If configuration files are exposed (e.g., due to misconfigured permissions, insecure storage, or accidental disclosure), an attacker could gain access to sensitive information like private keys, certificates, and credentials. This allows them to impersonate the server, decrypt traffic, or gain control over the xray-core instance.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of xray-core instance and potentially the application and network it protects. Data breaches, man-in-the-middle attacks, and unauthorized access.
*   **Affected Xray-core Component:** Configuration file storage, potentially Key Management if keys are stored in files.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store configuration files in secure locations with restricted access permissions (e.g., 600 or 400).
    *   Encrypt sensitive data within configuration files using appropriate tools.
    *   Avoid storing configuration files in publicly accessible directories or repositories.
    *   Utilize secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) to manage sensitive configuration data.
    *   Regularly rotate keys and certificates.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known Xray-core Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_known_xray-core_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in xray-core code. They might use readily available exploit code to target unpatched instances, potentially leading to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*   **Impact:** Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including denial of service, remote code execution, information disclosure, and bypass of security controls.
*   **Affected Xray-core Component:** Various modules depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., protocol handlers, core logic, parsers).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep xray-core updated to the latest stable version.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories and monitor vulnerability databases related to xray-core.
    *   Implement a vulnerability management process to promptly apply patches and updates.
    *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to detect and block known exploits.

## Threat: [Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Xray-core](./threats/zero-day_vulnerabilities_in_xray-core.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could discover and exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities (zero-days) in xray-core. These are particularly dangerous as no patches are initially available, and detection can be challenging. Exploitation could lead to similar impacts as known vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Similar to known vulnerabilities, potentially including remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, and bypass of security controls, but with delayed mitigation.
*   **Affected Xray-core Component:** Any part of the xray-core codebase.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Employ defense-in-depth strategies (multiple layers of security).
    *   Implement robust monitoring and logging to detect suspicious activity and potential exploitation attempts.
    *   Use runtime application self-protection (RASP) or similar technologies if applicable to detect and block exploit attempts at runtime.
    *   Participate in security communities and share threat intelligence to stay informed about emerging threats.
    *   Conduct regular code reviews and security audits of xray-core integration and configuration to identify potential weaknesses.

## Threat: [Traffic Interception and Decryption (if encryption is weak or broken)](./threats/traffic_interception_and_decryption__if_encryption_is_weak_or_broken_.md)

*   **Description:** If weak or outdated encryption protocols or ciphers are used in xray-core configurations, or if vulnerabilities are discovered in the encryption implementation, attackers might be able to intercept and decrypt traffic passing through the proxy. This allows them to eavesdrop on sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality of proxied data, exposure of sensitive information (credentials, personal data, etc.), and potential for further attacks based on intercepted data.
*   **Affected Xray-core Component:** TLS/Encryption modules, Protocol handlers.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce the use of strong and modern encryption protocols (e.g., TLS 1.3) and ciphers (e.g., AES-GCM, XChaCha20-Poly1305).
    *   Disable support for weak or outdated protocols and ciphers (e.g., SSLv3, TLS 1.0, RC4).
    *   Regularly review and update encryption configurations to align with security best practices.
    *   Implement strong key management practices, including secure key generation, storage, and rotation.
    *   Monitor for signs of traffic interception attempts and unusual network activity.
