# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for xtls/xray-core

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Inbound/Outbound Validation (within xray-core config)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_inboundoutbound_validation__within_xray-core_config_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Inbound/Outbound Validation (within xray-core config)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Allowed Protocols:** Within the xray-core configuration file itself, explicitly specify the allowed protocols for inbounds and outbounds (e.g., `vmess`, `vless`, `trojan`, `shadowsocks`).  Do *not* rely solely on external validation.
    2.  **Port Range Restrictions:** Define strict port ranges for inbounds and outbounds within the configuration.  Avoid using overly broad ranges or default ports if possible.
    3.  **TLS Settings Validation (within config):**
        *   Ensure `allowInsecure` is set to `false` in the `streamSettings` for all inbounds and outbounds unless there's a *very* specific and justified reason (and even then, document it extensively).
        *   Specify valid certificate and key file paths within the configuration.  Xray-core will perform basic checks for file existence.
        *   Configure `serverName` (SNI) appropriately for outbound connections in `streamSettings`.
        *   Use `alpn` to specify allowed application-layer protocols.
    4.  **Disable Unused Features:** Explicitly disable any xray-core features that are not required, such as specific sniffing configurations or routing rules that are not in use. This minimizes the attack surface.
    5. **IP/CIDR Restrictions (using routing rules):** While xray-core doesn't have direct "whitelist" settings, you can achieve similar results using its powerful routing capabilities.  Use `rules` in the `routing` section to:
        *   Direct traffic from specific source IPs/CIDRs to specific inbounds.
        *   Direct traffic to specific destination IPs/CIDRs to specific outbounds.
        *   Block traffic that doesn't match any defined rules (using a "block" outbound).  This effectively creates a whitelist.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Internal Services:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Bypassing Security Controls:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Data Leaks:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Unintentional Proxying of Malicious Traffic:** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Configuration Errors:** (Severity: Medium)
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Internal Services:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Bypassing Security Controls:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Data Leaks:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **MitM Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (if TLS settings are correct).
    *   **Unintentional Proxying of Malicious Traffic:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Configuration Errors:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic protocol and port settings are configured in the xray-core config.
    *   `allowInsecure` is set to `false`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive use of routing rules for IP/CIDR-based whitelisting is *not* implemented.
    *   Strict SNI configuration in `streamSettings` is incomplete.
    *   Explicit disabling of unused features is not systematically done.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Protocol Hardening (within xray-core config)](./mitigation_strategies/protocol_hardening__within_xray-core_config_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Protocol Hardening (within xray-core config)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Supported Protocols:** In the xray-core configuration, *only* include inbounds and outbounds for the protocols that are absolutely necessary.  Remove any unused protocol configurations.
    2.  **Prioritize Secure Protocols:** If supporting multiple protocols, configure xray-core to prefer newer, more secure protocols (e.g., VLESS over VMess) where possible. This might involve setting up separate inbounds/outbounds for different protocols and using routing rules to prioritize.
    3.  **Disable Deprecated Protocols:** Explicitly remove any configurations related to deprecated or known-vulnerable protocols.
    4.  **Cipher Suite Restrictions (via TLS settings):** Within the `streamSettings` -> `tlsSettings` section of the xray-core configuration, use the `cipherSuites` option (if available and supported by the xray-core version) to specify a list of allowed, strong cipher suites.  This restricts the TLS connections to use only those ciphers.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Protocol-Specific Vulnerabilities:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Use of Weak Cryptography:** (Severity: Medium)
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Protocol-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced (proportional to the number of protocols removed).
    *   **Use of Weak Cryptography:** Risk significantly reduced (if `cipherSuites` is configured correctly).
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The configuration includes inbounds/outbounds for VMess and VLESS.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal review and justification for the chosen protocols is missing (should be documented).
    *   Explicit disabling of deprecated protocols is not consistently done.
    *   `cipherSuites` configuration within `tlsSettings` is *not* implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Traffic Obfuscation (using xray-core features)](./mitigation_strategies/traffic_obfuscation__using_xray-core_features_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Traffic Obfuscation (using xray-core features)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Realistic TLS Configuration (within `streamSettings`):**
        *   Use valid certificates from reputable CAs (configure paths in `certificateFile` and `keyFile`).
        *   Set realistic `serverName` (SNI) values in outbound `streamSettings`.
        *   Use appropriate `alpn` values.
    2.  **Explore `streamSettings` Options:** Utilize the various `streamSettings` options within xray-core to obfuscate traffic:
        *   **`tcpSettings`:**  Use `header` to configure HTTP header obfuscation.
        *   **`kcpSettings`:** Explore options for mKCP protocol.
        *   **`wsSettings`:** Configure WebSocket settings, including `path` and `headers`.
        *   **`httpSettings`:** Use for HTTP/2.
        *   **`quicSettings`:** Explore options for QUIC protocol.
        *   **`grpcSettings`:** Explore options for gRPC protocol.
        *   Carefully evaluate the performance impact of each option.
    3.  **Avoid Default Ports:**  Change the default ports used by xray-core protocols to less common ports.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Traffic Analysis and Fingerprinting:** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) based blocking:** (Severity: Medium)
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Traffic Analysis and Fingerprinting:** Risk reduced (effectiveness depends on the chosen `streamSettings`).
    *   **DPI based blocking:** Risk reduced.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic TLS is configured with certificate files.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Realistic `serverName` (SNI) is not consistently used.
    *   Advanced `streamSettings` options (beyond basic TLS) are *not* utilized.
    *   Default ports are still used in some configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Connection Limiting (using routing and policy)](./mitigation_strategies/connection_limiting__using_routing_and_policy_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Connection Limiting (using routing and policy)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Policy Configuration:** Utilize the `policy` section within the xray-core configuration.
        *   Set `levels` to define different user levels (if applicable).
        *   Configure `handshake` timeout (time to establish a connection).
        *   Configure `connIdle` timeout (time before an idle connection is closed).
        *   Configure `uplinkOnly` and `downlinkOnly` timeouts (time for data transfer).
        *   Set `statsUserUplink` and `statsUserDownlink` to `true` to enable per-user traffic statistics (required for some limits).
        *   Use `bufferSize` to control buffer sizes.
    2.  **Routing Rules:** Combine `policy` with `routing` rules.
        *   Use `domain` and `ip` rules within the `routing` section to direct traffic based on source/destination.
        *   Use `userLevel` in routing rules to apply different policies to different users (if using user levels).
        *   Use routing rules to send traffic to specific inbounds/outbounds based on connection characteristics.
    3. **Limit Concurrent Connections (Indirectly):** While xray-core doesn't have a direct "max connections" setting *per se*, you can achieve a similar effect by combining:
        *   Strict `handshake`, `connIdle`, `uplinkOnly`, and `downlinkOnly` timeouts in the `policy` section.
        *   Routing rules that limit the number of users or IP addresses that can connect to specific inbounds.
        *   Careful configuration of system resources (e.g., file descriptor limits) *outside* of xray-core.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (DoS/DDoS):** (Severity: High)
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (DoS/DDoS):** Risk reduced (effectiveness depends on the configured timeouts and routing rules).
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic `policy` settings (timeouts) are configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive use of `policy` and `routing` rules to limit concurrent connections is *not* fully implemented.
    *   Per-user traffic statistics (`statsUserUplink`, `statsUserDownlink`) are not enabled.
    *   `bufferSize` is not optimized.
