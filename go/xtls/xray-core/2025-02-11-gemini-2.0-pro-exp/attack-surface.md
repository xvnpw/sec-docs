# Attack Surface Analysis for xtls/xray-core

## Attack Surface: [1. Misconfigured Inbound Listeners](./attack_surfaces/1__misconfigured_inbound_listeners.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured inbound connections, exposing the proxy to unauthorized access.
    *   **Xray-core Contribution:** Xray-core provides a wide range of inbound protocols (Socks, HTTP, Shadowsocks, VMess, VLESS, Trojan, etc.), each requiring specific configuration.  Complexity increases the risk of misconfiguration.
    *   **Example:** A Socks proxy configured to listen on `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) without authentication, allowing anyone on the network to use it.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the proxy, potential for attackers to relay traffic, mask their origin, or access internal networks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the network environment and exposed services).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Provide clear documentation and examples for secure inbound configurations.  Implement input validation to prevent invalid configurations.  Consider providing a "secure by default" configuration template.
        *   **Users:**  Bind listeners only to specific, necessary interfaces (e.g., `127.0.0.1` for local-only access).  Always use strong authentication for inbound connections.  Regularly audit inbound configurations.  Use network firewalls to restrict access.

## Attack Surface: [2. Protocol-Specific Vulnerabilities (Inbound/Outbound)](./attack_surfaces/2__protocol-specific_vulnerabilities__inboundoutbound_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the specific proxy protocols implemented by Xray-core.
    *   **Xray-core Contribution:** Xray-core implements various protocols, each with its own potential security weaknesses (known or unknown).
    *   **Example:** A zero-day vulnerability discovered in the VMess protocol implementation allowing for remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the proxy, traffic interception, modification, denial of service, or potentially remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability and protocol).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Prioritize security audits and penetration testing of protocol implementations.  Respond rapidly to security advisories and release patches promptly.  Consider deprecating or removing support for less-secure protocols.
        *   **Users:**  Prefer modern, well-vetted protocols (VLESS, Trojan with strong configurations).  Keep Xray-core updated to the latest version.  Use an IDS/IPS to monitor for suspicious traffic.

## Attack Surface: [3. Misconfigured Outbound Connections/Routing](./attack_surfaces/3__misconfigured_outbound_connectionsrouting.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured outbound protocols or routing rules, leading to unintended traffic destinations or data leaks.
    *   **Xray-core Contribution:** Xray-core's powerful routing capabilities allow for complex outbound configurations, increasing the risk of misconfiguration.
    *   **Example:** A routing rule misconfigured to send sensitive internal traffic to an external, untrusted server.
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage, circumvention of security policies, potential exposure of internal systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the sensitivity of the data and the misconfiguration).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Provide clear documentation and examples for secure outbound configurations.  Implement input validation for routing rules.  Consider a visual configuration tool to reduce errors.
        *   **Users:** Carefully review and test outbound configurations.  Use a "least privilege" approach.  Implement strict routing rules.  Regularly audit outbound configurations.

## Attack Surface: [4. Xray-Core Code-Level Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/4__xray-core_code-level_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitable bugs in the Xray-core codebase itself.
    *   **Xray-core Contribution:**  As with any software, Xray-core may contain vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Xray-core configuration parser allowing for remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely, from denial of service to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.  Use static analysis tools.  Follow secure coding practices.  Respond promptly to security reports.
        *   **Users:** Keep Xray-core updated to the latest version.  Monitor for security advisories.

## Attack Surface: [5. DNS Resolution Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/5__dns_resolution_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of DNS vulnerabilities (spoofing, poisoning) to redirect Xray-core traffic.
    *   **Xray-core Contribution:** Xray-core relies on DNS resolution to connect to outbound destinations.
    *   **Example:** An attacker poisoning the DNS cache to redirect traffic intended for a legitimate server to a malicious server.
    *   **Impact:** Traffic redirection, data interception, or modification.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Provide options for configuring secure DNS resolvers (DoH, DoT). Consider implementing DNSSEC validation within Xray-core.
        *   **Users:** Use secure DNS resolvers (DoH, DoT). Configure Xray-core to use specific, trusted DNS servers. Implement DNS monitoring.
