## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Buffer Overflow (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_buffer_overflow__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker sends specially crafted inbound network traffic to the Xray-core application. This traffic contains more data than the allocated buffer can hold.

**Mechanism:** Due to insufficient input validation within Xray-core's handling of network data, the excess data overwrites adjacent memory locations.

**Impact:** This memory corruption can lead to various outcomes, including:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashing the Xray-core process.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The attacker can overwrite critical program data or inject malicious code, allowing them to gain control of the Xray-core process and potentially the underlying system.

**Critical Node within Path: Send Maliciously Crafted Inbound Traffic:** This is the specific action that initiates the buffer overflow.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Bypass (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_bypass__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts specific network requests that exploit flaws in Xray-core's authentication or authorization logic.

**Mechanism:** These crafted requests bypass intended security checks, allowing the attacker to access protected resources or perform actions they are not authorized for. This could involve manipulating parameters, exploiting logic errors in the authentication flow, or leveraging vulnerabilities in how roles and permissions are handled.

**Impact:** Successful bypass can grant the attacker unauthorized access to sensitive data, configuration settings, or administrative functionalities within the application or Xray-core itself.

**Critical Node within Path: Send Crafted Request Bypassing Checks:** This is the specific action that exploits the authentication/authorization flaw.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Improper Key Management (Critical Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_improper_key_management__critical_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker attempts to gain access to the private cryptographic keys used by Xray-core for secure communication (e.g., TLS).

**Mechanism:** This could involve various methods:
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in how keys are stored (e.g., insecure file permissions, storing keys in plaintext).
    *   Social engineering or phishing attacks targeting administrators who have access to the keys.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system or infrastructure where the keys are stored.

**Impact:**  Compromise of private keys has critical consequences:
    *   **Traffic Decryption:** The attacker can decrypt past and future encrypted communication, exposing sensitive data.
    *   **Server Impersonation:** The attacker can impersonate the Xray-core server, potentially intercepting or manipulating traffic, or launching man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Critical Node within Path: Obtain Access to Private Keys:** This is the point of critical compromise, leading to severe security breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Access Control Configuration (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_access_control_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The Xray-core application is configured with overly permissive access controls, exposing services or ports unnecessarily.

**Mechanism:** This could involve:
    *   Leaving management interfaces or ports open to the public internet.
    *   Failing to implement proper firewall rules or access control lists (ACLs).
    *   Incorrectly configuring network settings, allowing unauthorized connections.

**Impact:**  This misconfiguration allows attackers to directly interact with Xray-core services without proper authentication or authorization, potentially leading to:
    *   Exploitation of vulnerabilities in those exposed services.
    *   Unauthorized access to configuration settings.
    *   Denial of Service attacks.

**Critical Node within Path: Identify Open Ports or Services:** This is the initial step where the attacker discovers the misconfiguration that creates the vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak or Default Credentials (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/weak_or_default_credentials__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The Xray-core application or its management interfaces use weak, easily guessable, or default credentials.

**Mechanism:** Attackers attempt to log in using common default usernames and passwords or by employing brute-force or dictionary attacks against weak credentials.

**Impact:** Successful login grants the attacker administrative or privileged access to Xray-core, allowing them to:
    *   Modify configurations.
    *   Monitor traffic.
    *   Potentially pivot to other systems.
    *   Disable security features.

**Critical Node within Path: Attempt Default Credentials:** This is the direct action to exploit the weak credential vulnerability.
