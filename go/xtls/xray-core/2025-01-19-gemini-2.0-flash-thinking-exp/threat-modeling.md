# Threat Model Analysis for xtls/xray-core

## Threat: [Insecure Default Ciphers](./threats/insecure_default_ciphers.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit weak or outdated default encryption ciphers used by Xray-core's TLS implementation to perform cryptanalysis or downgrade attacks, potentially intercepting and decrypting communication.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, sensitive data exposure.
*   **Affected Component:** `transport/internet/tls` (module responsible for TLS configuration)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Explicitly configure the `tlsSettings` within the Xray-core configuration file to use strong and recommended cipher suites.
    *   Disable weak or outdated ciphers.
    *   Regularly review and update the configured cipher suites based on current security recommendations.

## Threat: [Weak or Missing Server Certificate Verification](./threats/weak_or_missing_server_certificate_verification.md)

*   **Description:** If the client-side of an Xray-core connection (e.g., in a proxy setup) does not properly verify the server's TLS certificate, an attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by presenting a fraudulent certificate.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality and integrity breach, potential for data manipulation.
*   **Affected Component:** `transport/internet/tls` (client-side TLS verification logic)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that client-side Xray-core configurations have `allowInsecure` set to `false` (or not present, as `false` is often the default for secure configurations).
    *   Configure `serverName` in the `tlsSettings` to match the expected server certificate's Common Name or Subject Alternative Name.
    *   Consider using `pinnedPeerCertificateChain` for enhanced security by pinning the expected server certificate.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Supported Protocols (e.g., VMess, VLESS, Trojan)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_supported_protocols__e_g___vmess__vless__trojan_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the implementation of the various protocols supported by Xray-core to bypass authentication, inject malicious traffic, or cause denial-of-service.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data manipulation, service disruption.
*   **Affected Component:**  Specific protocol implementations within `proxy` directory (e.g., `proxy/vmess`, `proxy/vless`, `proxy/trojan`).
*   **Risk Severity:**  Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Xray-core updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Xray-core and its supported protocols.
    *   Carefully evaluate the security implications of each protocol before enabling it.

## Threat: [Configuration Injection via External Input](./threats/configuration_injection_via_external_input.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows external input to directly influence the Xray-core configuration without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious configuration parameters, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other severe consequences.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, arbitrary code execution, data breach.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration loading and parsing logic (`core/conf`, `infra/conf`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never directly use external input to construct Xray-core configuration.
    *   Use a predefined and validated configuration.
    *   If dynamic configuration is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Xray-core configuration files might contain sensitive information like private keys, passwords, or API credentials. If these files are not properly protected with appropriate file system permissions, attackers could gain access to them.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, credential compromise, potential for further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration file handling (`core/conf`, `infra/conf`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that Xray-core configuration files have restrictive file system permissions (e.g., readable only by the user running the Xray-core process).
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in plain text within configuration files. Consider using environment variables or secure secrets management solutions.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass in Specific Protocols](./threats/authentication_bypass_in_specific_protocols.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanisms of specific protocols (e.g., weaknesses in VMess AEAD implementation in older versions) could allow attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the proxy.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, potential for malicious traffic routing.
*   **Affected Component:** Specific protocol authentication logic (e.g., `proxy/vmess/inbound`, `proxy/vless/inbound`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the protocol and vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use the latest versions of Xray-core that include fixes for known authentication bypass vulnerabilities.
    *   Carefully configure the authentication settings for each protocol, using strong and recommended methods.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities](./threats/memory_corruption_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs in Xray-core's code, such as buffer overflows or use-after-free vulnerabilities, could be exploited by sending specially crafted network packets or data to cause memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected Component:** Any part of the codebase, but particularly components handling network data parsing and processing (`transport`, `app`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Xray-core updated to the latest version, as security updates often address memory corruption vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent malformed data from reaching vulnerable code paths.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Private Keys](./threats/insecure_handling_of_private_keys.md)

*   **Description:** If Xray-core is configured to use private keys (e.g., for TLS or certain protocols), improper handling or storage of these keys could lead to their compromise.
*   **Impact:** Impersonation, decryption of past communications, loss of trust.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration loading and handling of cryptographic keys (`core/conf`, `infra/conf`, `transport/internet/tls`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store private keys securely with appropriate file system permissions.
    *   Consider using hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure key management systems for storing and managing private keys.
    *   Avoid embedding private keys directly in the configuration file if possible.
