## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Etcd Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_etcd_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting security flaws within the etcd software itself. This is a critical node because vulnerabilities in etcd can have widespread and severe consequences for applications relying on it.
*   **1.1. Exploit Known Etcd CVEs [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Targeting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in etcd versions that are not patched. This is a high-risk path because known vulnerabilities are well-documented and exploit code may be readily available.
        *   **1.1.1. Identify and Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Actively scanning for and exploiting known vulnerabilities in the deployed etcd version. Attackers use CVE databases and security advisories to find exploitable weaknesses.
            *   **Impact:** Can range from information disclosure, data manipulation, denial of service, to complete compromise of the etcd cluster and potentially the application.
            *   **Mitigation:**  Implement a robust patch management process to promptly apply security updates for etcd. Regularly monitor CVE databases and etcd release notes.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Etcd Configuration and Access Control Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_etcd_configuration_and_access_control_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Leveraging misconfigurations or weak access controls in the etcd deployment. This is a critical node because proper configuration and access control are fundamental security pillars for etcd.
*   **2.1. Exploit Weak or Default Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weak or missing authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to the etcd API. This is a high-risk path due to the commonality of default credentials and misconfigurations.
        *   **2.1.1. Brute-force or Guess Default/Weak Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attempting to guess or brute-force default or weak usernames and passwords if they haven't been changed from default settings.
            *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to etcd, allowing data manipulation, configuration changes, or denial of service.
            *   **Mitigation:** Never use default credentials. Enforce strong password policies. Implement account lockout mechanisms.
        *   **2.1.2. Exploit Missing or Weak Authentication Mechanisms [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting deployments where authentication is disabled or uses weak methods (e.g., basic authentication without TLS).
            *   **Impact:**  Unauthenticated access to etcd, leading to full compromise.
            *   **Mitigation:** Always enable authentication for etcd client and peer communication. Use strong authentication methods like mutual TLS.
    *   **2.2. Exploit Unsecured Etcd API Access [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing the etcd API over unencrypted channels or from unauthorized networks. This is a high-risk path because it directly exposes the API to potential attackers.
            *   **2.2.1. Access Etcd API without TLS Encryption [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Intercepting or eavesdropping on unencrypted communication with the etcd API to steal credentials or data.
                *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data, credential theft, and potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.
                *   **Mitigation:** Always enforce TLS encryption for all etcd client and peer communication. Disable non-TLS ports if possible.
            *   **2.2.2. Access Etcd API from Unauthorized Networks [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing the etcd API from networks that should not have access, bypassing network segmentation controls.
                *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to etcd from potentially compromised networks.
                *   **Mitigation:** Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict access to the etcd API to only authorized networks and clients.
    *   **2.3. Exploit Leaked or Exposed Etcd Credentials [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Obtaining valid etcd credentials through various means, such as finding them in code, logs, or compromised environments. This is a high-risk path because valid credentials grant immediate and significant access.

                *   **Attack Vector:** Discovering hardcoded credentials within application source code or configuration files.
                *   **Impact:**  Direct access to etcd using the exposed credentials.
                *   **Mitigation:** Never hardcode credentials. Use secure secret management solutions.
            *   **2.3.2. Find Credentials in Logs or Monitoring Systems [HIGH-RISK PATH]**

                *   **Impact:**  Exposure of credentials through logging systems.
                *   **Mitigation:** Avoid logging credentials. Sanitize logs to prevent accidental exposure. Secure access to logging and monitoring systems.
            *   **2.3.3. Find Credentials in Compromised Development/Staging Environments [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Stealing credentials from less secure development or staging environments that might have weaker security controls.
                *   **Impact:**  Compromise of production etcd using credentials leaked from less secure environments.
                *   **Mitigation:** Maintain strong security practices across all environments. Isolate environments and use different credentials for each.

                *   **Mitigation:** Implement network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection. Ensure sufficient network bandwidth for etcd cluster communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Application Logic Vulnerabilities via Etcd Interaction [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_application_logic_vulnerabilities_via_etcd_interaction__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's code that arise from how it interacts with etcd data. This is a critical node because application logic flaws are often application-specific and can be subtle.
    *   **5.3. Lack of Input Validation on Data Retrieved from Etcd [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  The application blindly trusts data retrieved from etcd without proper validation, leading to exploitable vulnerabilities. This is a high-risk path due to the common occurrence of input validation issues in applications.
            *   **5.3.1. Application Blindly Trusts Data from Etcd [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  The application directly uses data from etcd in operations without validating or sanitizing it, leading to vulnerabilities like injection flaws, logic errors, or other unexpected behavior.
                *   **Impact:**  Wide range of application vulnerabilities, including injection attacks (SQL, command, etc.), logic flaws, and data corruption.
                *   **Mitigation:** Always validate and sanitize data retrieved from etcd before using it in the application. Treat data from etcd as external input and apply appropriate security measures.
