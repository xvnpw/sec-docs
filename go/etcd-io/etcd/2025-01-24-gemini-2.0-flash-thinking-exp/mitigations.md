# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for etcd-io/etcd

## Mitigation Strategy: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Enable RBAC:** Configure etcd to enable RBAC by setting the `--auth-token` flag to `simple` or `jwt` during etcd server startup.
2.  **Define Roles:** Use `etcdctl role add <role-name>` to create roles. Define roles based on the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary permissions. Examples: `config-reader`, `app-writer`, `monitoring`.
3.  **Assign Permissions:** Use `etcdctl role grant-permission <role-name> <permission-type> <key-prefix>` to assign permissions to roles. Permission types include `read`, `write`, `readwrite`.  Specify key prefixes to limit access to specific parts of the etcd key space (e.g., `/config/`, `/app-data/`).
4.  **Create Users:** Use `etcdctl user add <username> -p <password>` to create users or service accounts for applications. For production, prefer certificate-based authentication over passwords.
5.  **Assign Roles to Users:** Use `etcdctl user grant-role <username> <role-name>` to assign roles to users.
6.  **Configure Clients:** Applications must authenticate with etcd using the created users and their assigned credentials (tokens or certificates). Configure application etcd clients to provide these credentials during connection.
7.  **Regularly Review and Update:** Periodically review roles, permissions, and user assignments to ensure they remain aligned with application needs and security policies.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data (High Severity):** Without RBAC, any client with network access to etcd can potentially read or modify all data.
*   **Data Tampering/Integrity Violation (High Severity):** Unauthorized write access can lead to data corruption.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** A compromised application with overly broad etcd access can be used to gain further control.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data (High):** Risk reduced to **Low** for unauthorized users/applications.
*   **Data Tampering/Integrity Violation (High):** Risk reduced to **Low** for unauthorized users/applications.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Medium):** Risk reduced to **Low** as application access is limited.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   RBAC is enabled in the production etcd cluster.
*   Basic roles are defined for applications.
*   Service accounts are used for applications in production.
*   Implemented in: `etcd server configuration files`, `application deployment scripts`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   More granular roles based on specific key prefixes are not fully implemented.
*   RBAC is not consistently enforced in development and staging environments.
*   Missing in: `development/staging etcd configurations`, `developer access control policies`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Client Certificate Authentication (TLS Mutual Authentication)](./mitigation_strategies/enable_client_certificate_authentication__tls_mutual_authentication_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Generate Certificates:** Create a Certificate Authority (CA) and generate server and client certificates.
2.  **Configure etcd Server:** Start etcd server with flags: `--client-cert-auth`, `--trusted-ca-file=<path-to-ca-cert>`.
3.  **Distribute Client Certificates:** Securely distribute client certificates to authorized applications.
4.  **Configure Clients:** Configure etcd client libraries in applications to use the client certificate and key for authentication.
5.  **Certificate Management:** Implement a system for managing certificates.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Without client certificate authentication, weaker authentication methods can be vulnerable.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** Client certificate authentication verifies client identity.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (High):** Risk reduced to **Low**. Only clients with valid certificates can authenticate.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High):** Risk reduced to **Low**. Prevents client impersonation.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Client certificate authentication is enabled for the production etcd cluster.
*   Client certificates are generated and distributed to applications.
*   Implemented in: `etcd server startup scripts`, `application deployment configurations`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Client certificate authentication is not consistently enforced in non-production environments.
*   Automated certificate rotation for client certificates is not fully implemented.
*   Missing in: `development/staging etcd configurations`, `automated certificate rotation scripts`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable TLS for All Communication (Client-to-Server and Peer-to-Peer)](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tls_for_all_communication__client-to-server_and_peer-to-peer_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Generate Certificates:** Create a Certificate Authority (CA) and generate server and peer certificates for each etcd member.
2.  **Configure etcd Server (Client TLS):** Start etcd server with flags: `--cert-file=<path-to-server-cert>`, `--key-file=<path-to-server-key>`, `--advertise-client-urls=https://...`, `--listen-client-urls=https://...`.
3.  **Configure etcd Server (Peer TLS):** Start etcd server with flags: `--peer-cert-file=<path-to-peer-cert>`, `--peer-key-file=<path-to-peer-key>`, `--advertise-peer-urls=https://...`, `--listen-peer-urls=https://...`.
4.  **Configure Clients:** Ensure all etcd clients connect using `https://` URLs.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Interception (Confidentiality Breach) (High Severity):** Without TLS, communication is in plaintext.
*   **Data Tampering (Integrity Violation) (High Severity):** Without TLS, communication is susceptible to MITM attacks.
*   **Replay Attacks (Medium Severity):** Without TLS, attackers could replay etcd requests.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Interception (Confidentiality Breach) (High):** Risk reduced to **Low**. TLS encryption protects data confidentiality.
*   **Data Tampering (Integrity Violation) (High):** Risk reduced to **Low**. TLS provides data integrity.
*   **Replay Attacks (Medium):** Risk reduced to **Low**. TLS prevents replay attacks.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   TLS is enabled for both client-to-server and peer-to-peer communication in production.
*   Certificates are managed by a certificate management system.
*   Implemented in: `etcd server startup scripts`, `application etcd client configurations`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   TLS is not consistently enforced in development and staging environments.
*   Automated certificate rotation for etcd server and peer certificates could be more robust.
*   Missing in: `development/staging etcd configurations`, `fully automated certificate rotation and testing`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Undetected Security Breaches (High Severity):** Without logging and monitoring, breaches might go undetected.
*   **Delayed Incident Response (Medium Severity):** Lack of monitoring can delay response to incidents.
*   **Configuration Drift (Medium Severity):** Audits help identify configuration drift.

**Impact:**
