## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via etcd [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_etcd__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This represents the overarching goal and encompasses all the high-risk methods an attacker can use to compromise the application by targeting etcd. Success in any of the sub-paths listed below achieves this goal.
* **Impact:** Full control over the application, potential data breach, service disruption, and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit etcd Data Manipulation [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_etcd_data_manipulation__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Attackers aim to gain write access to etcd and then modify the data stored there to negatively impact the application. This could involve changing configuration settings, service discovery information, or any other data the application relies on.
* **Impact:**  Application malfunction, data corruption, redirection to malicious services, and potential complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Write Access to etcd [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_write_access_to_etcd__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is a pivotal point. Attackers attempt to obtain the necessary credentials or exploit vulnerabilities to gain the ability to write data to the etcd cluster. This can be achieved through various authentication bypass methods or by compromising an etcd node.
* **Impact:**  Unlocks the ability to perform data manipulation attacks, directly leading to application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weakness [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_weakness__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target weaknesses in how etcd authenticates and authorizes access. This includes exploiting default credentials, brute-forcing weak passwords, exploiting authentication bypass vulnerabilities within etcd itself, or leveraging misconfigured Access Control Lists (ACLs).
* **Impact:**  Gaining unauthorized access to etcd, potentially with write permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Credentials (if any) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials__if_any___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Using default usernames and passwords that were not changed after etcd deployment.
* **Impact:**  Immediate and easy access to etcd, often with administrative privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigured Access Control Lists (ACLs) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigured_access_control_lists__acls___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Leveraging improperly configured ACLs that grant excessive permissions to unauthorized users or roles.
* **Impact:**  Gaining unintended access to specific keys or the entire etcd namespace, potentially with write permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Data to Compromise Application [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_data_to_compromise_application__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Once write access is gained, attackers modify data in etcd to directly impact the application's functionality or security.
* **Impact:**  Application malfunction, redirection to malicious resources, data breaches, and potential complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Configuration Data [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_configuration_data__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Modifying configuration parameters stored in etcd that the application relies on. This could include database credentials, API endpoints, or other critical settings.
* **Impact:**  Complete application compromise, unauthorized access to backend systems, or redirection of application traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Key Application Settings Stored in etcd (e.g., database credentials, API endpoints) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_key_application_settings_stored_in_etcd__e_g___database_credentials__api_endpoints___high_ris_c1e6a3ea.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Specifically targeting sensitive configuration settings like database credentials or API endpoints used by the application.
* **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the application's database or other connected services, allowing for data breaches or further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Service Discovery Information [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_service_discovery_information__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Modifying service discovery data in etcd to point the application to attacker-controlled services.
* **Impact:**  The application connects to malicious services, potentially sending sensitive data to the attacker or executing malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Register Malicious Service Endpoints that the Application Connects To [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/register_malicious_service_endpoints_that_the_application_connects_to__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Specifically registering malicious endpoints in etcd's service discovery mechanism that the application will resolve and connect to.
* **Impact:**  The application unknowingly interacts with attacker-controlled services, leading to data interception, manipulation, or further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Read Access to etcd [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_read_access_to_etcd__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to obtain the necessary credentials or exploit vulnerabilities to gain the ability to read data from the etcd cluster.
* **Impact:** While not as severe as write access, read access allows attackers to understand the application's internal workings, configuration, and potentially sensitive data, which can be used for reconnaissance and planning further attacks. It also enables manipulation of the watch mechanism.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit etcd Clustering Weaknesses [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_etcd_clustering_weaknesses__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Targeting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the etcd cluster's communication protocols, leader election process, or data replication mechanisms.
* **Impact:**  Cluster instability, data corruption, denial of service, and potential loss of data consistency, significantly impacting the application's reliability and availability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit etcd API Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_etcd_api_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting known security flaws in the etcd API endpoints to gain unauthorized access or manipulate the cluster's state.
* **Impact:**  Direct control over the etcd cluster, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in etcd API Endpoints [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_etcd_api_endpoints__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Utilizing publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities in the etcd API to execute unauthorized actions.
* **Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to complete cluster takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit etcd Backup/Restore Mechanisms [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_etcd_backuprestore_mechanisms__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Targeting vulnerabilities in the backup and restore process to either gain access to sensitive data stored in backups or to inject malicious data during a restore operation.
* **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive application data or the introduction of compromised data into the etcd cluster, leading to application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Backup Files [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_backup_files__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Obtaining unauthorized access to etcd backup files stored in a potentially insecure location.
* **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive application data and the entire state of the etcd cluster at the time of backup.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Stored Backups Containing Sensitive Application Data or etcd State [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/access_stored_backups_containing_sensitive_application_data_or_etcd_state__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Successfully accessing backup files and extracting sensitive information.
* **Impact:**  Data breaches, exposure of configuration secrets, and insights into the application's architecture.
