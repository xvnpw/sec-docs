## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to etcd](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_etcd.md)

**[CRITICAL NODE] Gain Unauthorized Access to etcd**
* This node represents the attacker's goal of bypassing etcd's access controls. Success here allows for subsequent data manipulation or disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_weaknesses.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Authentication Weaknesses**
* This path focuses on compromising etcd's authentication mechanisms.
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Default Credentials (if not changed):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in to etcd using the default username and password provided by the etcd distribution. If these credentials have not been changed by the administrator, access is granted.
        * **Impact:** Full administrative access to etcd, allowing for complete control over the stored data and cluster configuration.
        * **Likelihood:** High if default credentials are not changed.
        * **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies and mandatory credential changes upon initial deployment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Credentials (if not changed)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials__if_not_changed_.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Default Credentials (if not changed):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in to etcd using the default username and password provided by the etcd distribution. If these credentials have not been changed by the administrator, access is granted.
        * **Impact:** Full administrative access to etcd, allowing for complete control over the stored data and cluster configuration.
        * **Likelihood:** High if default credentials are not changed.
        * **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies and mandatory credential changes upon initial deployment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Network Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_network_vulnerabilities.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Network Vulnerabilities**
* This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how etcd communicates over the network.
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Intercept Unencrypted Communication (if TLS is not enforced):**
        * **Attack Vector:** If TLS encryption is not enabled or enforced for client-to-server and peer-to-peer communication, attackers on the network can eavesdrop on the traffic. This allows them to intercept sensitive data, including authentication credentials, stored data, and cluster membership information.
        * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential compromise of authentication credentials leading to unauthorized access, and the ability to understand the etcd cluster structure.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium if TLS is not enforced.
        * **Mitigation:** Enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) for all client-to-server and peer-to-peer communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept Unencrypted Communication (if TLS is not enforced)](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_unencrypted_communication__if_tls_is_not_enforced_.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Intercept Unencrypted Communication (if TLS is not enforced):**
        * **Attack Vector:** If TLS encryption is not enabled or enforced for client-to-server and peer-to-peer communication, attackers on the network can eavesdrop on the traffic. This allows them to intercept sensitive data, including authentication credentials, stored data, and cluster membership information.
        * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential compromise of authentication credentials leading to unauthorized access, and the ability to understand the etcd cluster structure.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium if TLS is not enforced.
        * **Mitigation:** Enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) for all client-to-server and peer-to-peer communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Data within etcd](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_data_within_etcd.md)

**[CRITICAL NODE] Manipulate Data within etcd:**
* This node represents the attacker's goal of altering the data stored within etcd. Successful manipulation can directly compromise the application's functionality and security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Critical Application Data](./attack_tree_paths/modify_critical_application_data.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Modify Critical Application Data**
* This path focuses on altering data within etcd that is crucial for the application's operation.
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Alter Configuration Settings Leading to Application Compromise:**
        * **Attack Vector:** After gaining unauthorized access, attackers modify configuration settings stored in etcd that are used by the application. This could involve changing database connection strings, feature flags, security settings, or other critical parameters.
        * **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application's behavior, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access to other systems, or denial of service.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium if unauthorized access is gained.
        * **Mitigation:** Implement strong authentication and authorization, validate and sanitize data retrieved from etcd, and implement integrity checks on configuration data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Alter Configuration Settings Leading to Application Compromise](./attack_tree_paths/alter_configuration_settings_leading_to_application_compromise.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Alter Configuration Settings Leading to Application Compromise:**
        * **Attack Vector:** After gaining unauthorized access, attackers modify configuration settings stored in etcd that are used by the application. This could involve changing database connection strings, feature flags, security settings, or other critical parameters.
        * **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application's behavior, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access to other systems, or denial of service.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium if unauthorized access is gained.
        * **Mitigation:** Implement strong authentication and authorization, validate and sanitize data retrieved from etcd, and implement integrity checks on configuration data.
