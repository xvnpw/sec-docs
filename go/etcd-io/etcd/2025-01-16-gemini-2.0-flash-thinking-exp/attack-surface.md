# Attack Surface Analysis for etcd-io/etcd

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated Access to etcd API](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_weakly_authenticated_access_to_etcd_api.md)

*   **Description:**  The etcd API (gRPC or HTTP) is accessible without proper authentication or with easily compromised credentials.
    *   **How etcd Contributes:** etcd provides mechanisms for authentication (e.g., basic auth, client certificates), but if these are not configured or are poorly implemented, access is open.
    *   **Example:** An application connects to an etcd instance with default credentials or no authentication enabled. An attacker discovers the etcd endpoint and can directly use `etcdctl` or the API to read or modify data.
    *   **Impact:**  Critical data breaches, data manipulation leading to application malfunction, denial of service by deleting critical keys.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and enforce strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., mutual TLS, username/password with strong passwords).
        *   Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in etcd to restrict access based on roles.
        *   Regularly rotate etcd credentials.
        *   Ensure the application uses the configured authentication when connecting to etcd.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on etcd Client Communication](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_etcd_client_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between the application and the etcd server is intercepted and potentially modified by an attacker.
    *   **How etcd Contributes:** etcd supports TLS encryption for client communication. If TLS is not enabled or properly configured, communication occurs in plaintext.
    *   **Example:** An application communicates with etcd over an unsecured network. An attacker intercepts the communication and reads sensitive data being exchanged or modifies write requests.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, unauthorized modification of application state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always enable and enforce TLS encryption for client communication with etcd.
        *   Verify the etcd server's certificate to prevent connecting to rogue servers.
        *   Ensure the application is configured to use TLS when connecting to etcd.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on etcd Peer Communication](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_etcd_peer_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between etcd cluster members is intercepted and potentially modified.
    *   **How etcd Contributes:** etcd supports TLS encryption for peer communication. If not enabled, inter-node communication is vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** In an etcd cluster without TLS for peer communication, an attacker on the same network intercepts communication between members, potentially disrupting the Raft consensus or injecting malicious data.
    *   **Impact:** Cluster instability, data inconsistencies, potential for a rogue member to be introduced.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always enable and enforce TLS encryption for peer communication within the etcd cluster.
        *   Use proper certificate management for etcd members.
        *   Isolate the etcd cluster network to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in etcd Values](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_etcd_values.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information is stored directly within etcd values without proper encryption or obfuscation.
    *   **How etcd Contributes:** etcd stores data as key-value pairs. It does not inherently encrypt the values at rest or in transit (without TLS).
    *   **Example:** An application stores API keys, passwords, or personal data directly as plaintext values in etcd. If etcd is compromised, this data is readily accessible.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, compromise of user accounts or other systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing highly sensitive data directly in etcd if possible.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at the application level *before* storing it in etcd.
        *   Consider using a secrets management solution integrated with etcd if appropriate.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Weaknesses in etcd Access Control](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_weaknesses_in_etcd_access_control.md)

*   **Description:**  Authorization policies in etcd are not configured correctly, granting excessive permissions.
    *   **How etcd Contributes:** etcd provides RBAC, but misconfiguration can lead to unintended access.
    *   **Example:** A user or application is granted write access to all keys in etcd when they only need read access to a specific prefix. If compromised, this entity can now modify critical data.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized modification of application state, potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege when configuring RBAC in etcd.
        *   Regularly review and audit etcd access control policies.
        *   Use granular permissions to restrict access to specific keys or prefixes.

## Attack Surface: [Data Corruption via Malicious Writes](./attack_surfaces/data_corruption_via_malicious_writes.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with write access to etcd modifies data in a way that breaks the application's logic or introduces vulnerabilities.
    *   **How etcd Contributes:** etcd allows clients with write permissions to modify the stored data.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to etcd and modifies configuration values used by the application, causing it to malfunction or behave in an insecure way.
    *   **Impact:** Application instability, data integrity issues, potential for further exploitation based on the corrupted data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization to limit write access.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization in the application when processing data retrieved from etcd.
        *   Consider using versioning or backups of etcd data to recover from accidental or malicious modifications.
