# Attack Surface Analysis for etcd-io/etcd

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Client Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_client_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Applications connecting to `etcd` with weak or default security settings.
    *   **How etcd Contributes:** `etcd` relies on client-side configurations like certificates and authentication methods to control access. Weak settings expose the cluster.
    *   **Example:** An application connecting to `etcd` using default, easily guessable client certificates or without TLS encryption.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to `etcd`, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation of configuration, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for client authentication.
        *   Use strong, unique client certificates generated for each application or service.
        *   Enforce TLS encryption for all client-server communication.
        *   Securely store and manage client certificates and keys.
        *   Regularly rotate client certificates.

## Attack Surface: [etcd API Exposure without Proper Authorization](./attack_surfaces/etcd_api_exposure_without_proper_authorization.md)

*   **Description:** The `etcd` API (gRPC or HTTP) is accessible without adequate authorization checks.
    *   **How etcd Contributes:** `etcd` exposes an API for managing its data and cluster configuration. If not properly secured, anyone with network access can interact with it.
    *   **Example:** An `etcd` instance deployed without authentication enabled, allowing any client to read or write data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the `etcd` cluster, including data breaches, data corruption, and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable authentication and authorization in `etcd`.
        *   Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access based on the principle of least privilege.
        *   Define granular roles and permissions for different applications or services interacting with `etcd`.
        *   Secure the network access to the `etcd` API using firewalls and network segmentation.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in etcd Server Software](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_etcd_server_software.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting known security vulnerabilities within the `etcd` server software itself.
    *   **How etcd Contributes:** Like any software, `etcd` may contain bugs that can be exploited by attackers.
    *   **Example:** A remote code execution vulnerability in a specific version of `etcd` allowing an attacker to gain control of the server.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and potential lateral movement within the infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `etcd` server software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists for `etcd`.
        *   Implement a robust vulnerability management process.
        *   Consider using a security scanner to identify known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Inter-Node Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_inter-node_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between `etcd` cluster members is not properly secured.
    *   **How etcd Contributes:** `etcd` relies on communication between its members for data replication and consensus. Insecure communication can be intercepted or manipulated.
    *   **Example:** An `etcd` cluster where inter-node communication is not encrypted using TLS, allowing an attacker on the network to eavesdrop on data replication.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, and potential disruption of the `etcd` cluster's functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS encryption for all inter-node communication.
        *   Use strong, unique certificates for each `etcd` member.
        *   Secure the network where `etcd` members communicate.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in etcd](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_etcd.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information is stored directly within `etcd` without proper encryption or access controls.
    *   **How etcd Contributes:** `etcd` is a key-value store and can hold various types of data, including sensitive configuration or secrets.
    *   **Example:** Storing database credentials or API keys in plaintext within `etcd` values.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information, leading to unauthorized access to other systems or data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing highly sensitive data directly in `etcd` if possible.
        *   If sensitive data must be stored, encrypt it at rest using appropriate encryption mechanisms.
        *   Implement strong access controls to limit who can access sensitive data within `etcd`.
        *   Consider using a dedicated secrets management solution and storing only references in `etcd`.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Snapshots and WAL](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_snapshots_and_wal.md)

*   **Description:** `etcd` snapshots and Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) are stored or transmitted insecurely.
    *   **How etcd Contributes:** Snapshots and WAL files contain the entire state of the `etcd` cluster and can be used to restore it. If compromised, they can reveal sensitive information.
    *   **Example:** Storing `etcd` snapshots on an unencrypted filesystem or transmitting them over an insecure network.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of the entire `etcd` data, including potentially sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Encrypt `etcd` snapshots at rest.
        *   Secure the storage location of snapshots and WAL files with appropriate permissions.
        *   Encrypt the transmission of snapshots if they need to be moved.
        *   Regularly rotate and securely delete old snapshots.
