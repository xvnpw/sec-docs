# Threat Model Analysis for etcd-io/etcd

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access due to Missing Authentication](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_due_to_missing_authentication.md)

**Description:** An attacker, either internal or external, gains direct network access to the etcd instance and, due to the absence of authentication *within etcd*, can read any data stored within it. This could involve using `etcdctl` or the gRPC/HTTP API directly.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive application configuration, secrets, service discovery information, and coordination data. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, and a deeper understanding of the application's architecture for further attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable client authentication using TLS client certificates in etcd.
* Alternatively, enable username/password authentication in etcd.
* Restrict network access to the etcd ports (2379 for clients, 2380 for peer communication) using firewalls or network policies.

## Threat: [Credential Compromise Leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/credential_compromise_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker obtains valid authentication credentials (TLS client certificates or username/password) *for etcd*. This could happen through phishing, insider threat, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in systems where these credentials are stored. With these credentials, they can bypass etcd's authentication and interact with it as a legitimate client.

**Impact:** Full read and write access to etcd data, allowing the attacker to exfiltrate sensitive information, modify configurations, disrupt services, or even take control of the application's state.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store etcd authentication credentials securely using secrets management solutions.
* Enforce strong password policies and regularly rotate passwords if using username/password authentication in etcd.
* Implement certificate rotation and revocation mechanisms for TLS client certificates used by etcd.
* Monitor etcd access logs for suspicious activity and credential usage.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass due to Misconfigured RBAC](./threats/authorization_bypass_due_to_misconfigured_rbac.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits overly permissive or incorrectly configured Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rules *within etcd*. This allows a user or service with limited intended permissions to access or modify data they shouldn't have access to within etcd.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to specific keys or directories within etcd, leading to data breaches, unintended modifications of application behavior, or privilege escalation within the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement fine-grained RBAC rules *within etcd*, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
* Regularly review and audit RBAC configurations *in etcd* to ensure they are appropriate and secure.
* Use tools and scripts to automate the verification of RBAC policies in etcd.

## Threat: [Data Tampering by Authorized but Malicious Actor](./threats/data_tampering_by_authorized_but_malicious_actor.md)

**Description:** An authenticated user or service with write access *to etcd* intentionally modifies data to disrupt the application's functionality, inject malicious configurations, or cause other harm.

**Impact:** Application malfunction, incorrect data processing, security vulnerabilities introduced through manipulated configurations stored in etcd, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust auditing *within etcd* to track all data modifications and identify the source of changes.
* Implement data validation and integrity checks within the application to detect and potentially revert unauthorized changes in etcd.
* Consider implementing versioning or revision history for critical data stored in etcd.

## Threat: [Data Exposure in Transit due to Missing TLS](./threats/data_exposure_in_transit_due_to_missing_tls.md)

**Description:** Communication between clients and etcd, or between etcd cluster members, is not encrypted using TLS *within etcd*. An attacker on the network can intercept this traffic and read sensitive data being transmitted to or from etcd.

**Impact:** Exposure of authentication credentials, application configuration, and other sensitive data being exchanged with etcd.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce TLS encryption for all client-to-server communication with etcd.
* Enable TLS for peer-to-peer communication within the etcd cluster.
* Ensure proper certificate management and rotation for etcd's TLS certificates.

## Threat: [Data Exposure at Rest due to Lack of Encryption](./threats/data_exposure_at_rest_due_to_lack_of_encryption.md)

**Description:** Sensitive data stored in etcd's persistent storage on disk is not encrypted *by etcd*. If the underlying storage is compromised, an attacker can access and read the data.

**Impact:** Exposure of all data stored in etcd, including sensitive application secrets and configurations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable encryption at rest for the etcd data directory using etcd's built-in encryption features or operating system-level encryption.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in etcd](./threats/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_etcd.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits known security vulnerabilities in the specific version of etcd being used. These vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution, privilege escalation *within etcd*, or other malicious activities.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the etcd instance, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or control of the underlying infrastructure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if actively exploited), High (if a known but not actively exploited vulnerability exists)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update etcd to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Subscribe to security advisories for etcd to stay informed about new vulnerabilities.
* Implement a vulnerability scanning process for your infrastructure.
