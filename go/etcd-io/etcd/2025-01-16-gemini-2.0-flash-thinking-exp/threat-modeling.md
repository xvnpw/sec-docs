# Threat Model Analysis for etcd-io/etcd

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Read](./threats/unauthorized_data_read.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits missing or weak authentication/authorization to directly access etcd's API (gRPC or HTTP) and read sensitive data stored as key-value pairs. This could involve using tools like `etcdctl` or crafting API requests.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential information stored in etcd (e.g., secrets, configuration data, application state) is exposed, potentially leading to further attacks, data breaches, or service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication module, gRPC server, HTTP server, KV store.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and enforce TLS client authentication for all clients accessing etcd.
        *   Implement and configure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to specific keys or key prefixes based on user or application identity.
        *   Ensure etcd's API endpoints are not publicly accessible without proper authentication.
        *   Regularly review and update access control policies.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Modification](./threats/unauthorized_data_modification.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses authentication or leverages compromised credentials to write or modify data within etcd. This could involve changing critical configuration values, deleting essential data, or injecting malicious data.
    *   **Impact:** Application malfunction, data corruption, service disruption, or the introduction of vulnerabilities through malicious configuration changes.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication module, gRPC server, HTTP server, KV store, Watch mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms (TLS client authentication, RBAC).
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting write access to etcd.
        *   Implement auditing and logging of all write operations to etcd.
        *   Consider using the watch API to detect unauthorized changes and trigger alerts or rollback mechanisms.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via API Abuse](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_api_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods etcd with a large number of requests (read or write) through its API, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network) and causing it to become unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** Application downtime, inability to access or modify data, and potential cascading failures in dependent services.
    *   **Affected Component:** gRPC server, HTTP server, Request handling logic, Watch mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on etcd API endpoints.
        *   Configure resource limits for etcd processes (CPU, memory).
        *   Use connection pooling and request queuing on the client side to avoid overwhelming etcd.
        *   Monitor etcd's performance metrics and set up alerts for high load.

## Threat: [Leader Election Manipulation](./threats/leader_election_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** In a multi-node etcd cluster, an attacker with network access attempts to disrupt the leader election process, potentially forcing an election or influencing which node becomes the leader. This could involve network partitioning or exploiting vulnerabilities in the Raft consensus algorithm implementation.
    *   **Impact:** Cluster instability, temporary unavailability, potential data inconsistencies if a compromised node becomes leader.
    *   **Affected Component:** Raft consensus module, Leader election logic, Network communication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the network infrastructure where the etcd cluster is deployed.
        *   Use a reliable network with low latency and minimal packet loss.
        *   Ensure proper firewall rules are in place to restrict access to etcd's peer communication ports.
        *   Monitor the health and stability of the etcd cluster.

## Threat: [Rogue Member Introduction](./threats/rogue_member_introduction.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the etcd cluster's membership management and introduces a malicious or compromised etcd member. This rogue member could then participate in the consensus process, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized data access.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized data access, cluster instability, potential for the rogue member to act as a man-in-the-middle.
    *   **Affected Component:** Membership management module, Peer communication, Raft consensus module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable peer authentication using TLS certificates to ensure only authorized members can join the cluster.
        *   Secure the initial cluster bootstrapping process.
        *   Regularly review the list of cluster members and remove any unauthorized or suspicious nodes.

## Threat: [Snapshot and Backup Exposure](./threats/snapshot_and_backup_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to etcd's snapshot files or backups. These files contain the entire state of the etcd cluster and can be used to extract sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of all data stored in etcd, including secrets and sensitive configuration.
    *   **Affected Component:** Snapshotting mechanism, Backup procedures, Data storage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Encrypt etcd snapshots and backups at rest.
        *   Secure the storage location of snapshots and backups with appropriate access controls.
        *   Implement secure transfer mechanisms for backups.

## Threat: [Exploiting Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in etcd's dependencies (e.g., Go language libraries) to compromise the etcd process.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** All components relying on vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update etcd to the latest stable version, which includes updated dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for etcd and its dependencies.
        *   Implement vulnerability scanning for the etcd deployment environment.
