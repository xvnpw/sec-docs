# Attack Surface Analysis for etcd-io/etcd

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Client-Server Communication (gRPC/HTTP)](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_client-server_communication__grpchttp_.md)

**Description:**  Communication between your application and the etcd server is not encrypted, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on or manipulate data in transit.
*   **How etcd Contributes:** etcd exposes both gRPC and HTTP APIs for client interaction. If TLS/SSL is not properly configured and enforced, these channels are vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network as your application and the etcd server intercepts API calls containing sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, configuration secrets) being written to or read from etcd.
*   **Impact:** Data confidentiality breach, potential data integrity compromise if manipulation occurs.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS/SSL: Configure etcd to use TLS/SSL for both gRPC and HTTP client communication.
    *   Enforce TLS Client Certificates (Mutual TLS - mTLS):  Require clients to present valid certificates for authentication, providing stronger assurance of client identity.
    *   Use HTTPS for HTTP API: Ensure your application uses `https://` when interacting with the etcd HTTP API.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Missing Client Authentication](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_missing_client_authentication.md)

**Description:**  etcd is accessible without proper authentication, or weak authentication mechanisms are used, allowing unauthorized access to the data store.
*   **How etcd Contributes:** etcd offers authentication mechanisms (e.g., username/password, client certificates). If these are not enabled or are configured with weak credentials, access control is bypassed.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers the etcd endpoint and is able to read or modify any data stored within it without providing any valid credentials.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the data stored in etcd, potential for data corruption, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and disruption of application functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable Client Authentication: Configure etcd to require authentication for all client API requests.
    *   Use Strong Passwords (if applicable): If using username/password authentication, enforce strong, unique passwords and implement proper password management practices.
    *   Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Define granular roles and permissions to restrict access to specific keys or operations based on the client's identity.
    *   Prefer Client Certificates (mTLS):  Client certificates offer a more robust authentication method compared to passwords.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Inter-Node Communication (Cluster)](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_inter-node_communication__cluster_.md)

**Description:** Communication between etcd cluster members is not encrypted, potentially allowing attackers within the network to eavesdrop on or manipulate cluster-internal traffic.
*   **How etcd Contributes:** etcd relies on the Raft consensus protocol for inter-node communication. If TLS/SSL is not enabled for peer communication, this traffic is vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the internal network monitors communication between etcd nodes, potentially gaining insights into cluster state, leadership elections, and data replication processes. In a more sophisticated attack, they might attempt to inject malicious messages to disrupt the cluster.
*   **Impact:** Loss of data confidentiality regarding cluster operations, potential for cluster instability or data inconsistencies if manipulation occurs.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS/SSL for Peer Communication:** Configure etcd to use TLS/SSL for communication between cluster members (peer URLs).
    *   Use Peer Certificates:**  Implement certificate-based authentication for peer communication to ensure only authorized members can join the cluster.
    *   Secure the Network:** Properly segment the network where the etcd cluster resides and implement firewall rules to restrict access to cluster communication ports.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Data at Rest](./attack_surfaces/insecure_data_at_rest.md)

**Description:**  Data stored by etcd on disk is not encrypted, making it vulnerable to compromise if the underlying storage is accessed by an attacker.
*   **How etcd Contributes:** etcd persists its data to disk for durability. If encryption at rest is not configured, this data is stored in plaintext.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized physical access to the server hosting the etcd data directory or compromises the storage volume. They can then directly read the data stored by etcd.
*   **Impact:** Complete breach of all data stored in etcd, including potentially sensitive secrets, configurations, and application data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable Encryption at Rest:** Configure etcd to encrypt its data on disk. This can be done through etcd's built-in encryption features or by leveraging underlying storage encryption mechanisms.
    *   Secure the Storage Media:** Implement physical security measures to protect the servers hosting etcd and the storage volumes used by etcd.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in etcd Binaries and Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_etcd_binaries_and_dependencies.md)

**Description:**  Known security vulnerabilities exist in the specific version of etcd being used or its dependencies.
*   **How etcd Contributes:** Like any software, etcd and its dependencies can have security flaws that are discovered over time.
*   **Example:** A publicly known vulnerability in the etcd version being used allows an attacker to perform remote code execution on the etcd server.
*   **Impact:** Range from denial of service to complete system compromise, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep etcd Up-to-Date:** Regularly update etcd to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to etcd and its dependencies.
    *   Perform Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scans of the etcd deployment.
