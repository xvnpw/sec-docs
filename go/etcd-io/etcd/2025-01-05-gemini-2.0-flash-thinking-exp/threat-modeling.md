# Threat Model Analysis for etcd-io/etcd

## Threat: [Weak or Default Authentication Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_authentication_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to log in to the etcd cluster using default credentials (e.g., default username/password combinations) or easily guessable passwords. This could be done through brute-force attacks or by exploiting publicly known default credentials.
*   **Impact:** Successful authentication grants the attacker full control over the etcd cluster, allowing them to read, modify, or delete any data stored within, potentially disrupting the application's functionality and compromising sensitive information.
*   **Affected etcd Component:** Authentication module, client API endpoints.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Immediately change default etcd usernames and passwords upon deployment.
    *   Enforce strong password policies for all etcd users.
    *   Consider using certificate-based authentication (TLS client authentication) for enhanced security.
    *   Regularly audit and rotate etcd credentials.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access due to Missing or Insufficient Authentication](./threats/unauthorized_access_due_to_missing_or_insufficient_authentication.md)

*   **Description:**  The etcd cluster is configured without authentication enabled, or the authentication mechanisms are insufficient to prevent unauthorized clients from connecting and interacting with the data store. Attackers can directly access the etcd API without providing valid credentials.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized parties can read sensitive configuration data, application state, or secrets stored in etcd. They can also modify or delete data, leading to application malfunctions, data corruption, or denial of service.
*   **Affected etcd Component:** Authentication module, client API endpoints, network listener.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always enable authentication for the etcd cluster.
    *   Configure TLS client authentication to verify the identity of connecting clients.
    *   Restrict network access to the etcd cluster to only authorized clients and networks using firewalls or network policies.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass Vulnerability](./threats/authorization_bypass_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** A flaw in etcd's authorization logic allows an authenticated user to perform actions they are not explicitly permitted to perform. This could involve accessing restricted keys, modifying protected data, or performing administrative operations.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker with limited legitimate access can escalate their privileges within the etcd cluster, gaining control over sensitive data or the cluster itself. This can lead to data breaches, application disruption, or complete compromise.
*   **Affected etcd Component:** Authorization module, access control logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep etcd updated to the latest version to patch known authorization vulnerabilities.
    *   Thoroughly test authorization rules and configurations.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to etcd users and applications.
    *   Regularly audit etcd's role-based access control (RBAC) configuration.

## Threat: [Data Exposure in Transit (Man-in-the-Middle Attack)](./threats/data_exposure_in_transit__man-in-the-middle_attack_.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between application clients and the etcd cluster is not encrypted using TLS. An attacker positioned on the network can intercept this traffic and eavesdrop on sensitive data being exchanged, including configuration details, secrets, or application state.
*   **Impact:** Confidential information stored in etcd can be exposed to unauthorized parties. This can lead to the compromise of secrets, intellectual property, or sensitive user data managed by the application.
*   **Affected etcd Component:** Network communication layer, client API endpoints.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always enable TLS encryption for client-to-server communication in etcd.
    *   Ensure that clients are configured to verify the server's TLS certificate.
    *   Use secure protocols like HTTPS for accessing the etcd API.

## Threat: [Data Exposure at Rest](./threats/data_exposure_at_rest.md)

*   **Description:** The data stored by etcd on disk is not encrypted. An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the underlying file system of the etcd server can directly read the stored data, including potentially sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Confidential data managed by the application and stored within etcd can be compromised if the underlying storage is accessed by an attacker.
*   **Affected etcd Component:** Storage engine (e.g., boltdb), data directory.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable encryption at rest for the etcd data store. Etcd supports encryption at rest using a KMS (Key Management Service).
    *   Ensure the underlying file system and storage volumes are properly secured with appropriate permissions and encryption.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on etcd](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_on_etcd.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the etcd cluster with a large number of requests, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and causing it to become unresponsive or crash. This can disrupt the application's ability to access configuration or state information.
*   **Impact:** The application relying on etcd becomes unavailable, leading to service disruption, potential data loss, and a negative user experience.
*   **Affected etcd Component:** Client API endpoints, request processing logic, consensus mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on client requests to the etcd cluster.
    *   Deploy etcd behind a load balancer with DoS protection capabilities.
    *   Monitor etcd resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.
    *   Ensure sufficient resources are allocated to the etcd cluster to handle expected load.

## Threat: [Leaking Secrets Stored in etcd](./threats/leaking_secrets_stored_in_etcd.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive secrets (API keys, database passwords, etc.) are stored directly in etcd as plain text or with weak encryption. An attacker gaining unauthorized access to etcd can easily retrieve these secrets.
*   **Impact:** Compromised secrets can be used to gain unauthorized access to other systems or resources, leading to further security breaches and potential data loss.
*   **Affected etcd Component:** Data storage, key-value store.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing sensitive secrets directly in etcd if possible.
    *   Use dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) and store references to secrets in etcd instead of the secrets themselves.
    *   If secrets must be stored in etcd, encrypt them using strong encryption algorithms at the application level before storing them.

## Threat: [Vulnerable etcd Version](./threats/vulnerable_etcd_version.md)

*   **Description:**  Using an outdated version of etcd with known security vulnerabilities exposes the application to those risks. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, cause denial of service, or compromise data integrity.
*   **Impact:** The application becomes susceptible to attacks that target known vulnerabilities in the outdated etcd version. This can lead to various security breaches and operational disruptions.
*   **Affected etcd Component:** All components of etcd.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the severity of the vulnerabilities)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the etcd version up-to-date with the latest stable releases and security patches.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to etcd to stay informed about new vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a process for regularly patching and upgrading the etcd cluster.
