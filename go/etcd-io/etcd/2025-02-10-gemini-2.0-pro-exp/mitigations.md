# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for etcd-io/etcd

## Mitigation Strategy: [TLS Encryption (Client-to-Server and Peer-to-Peer)](./mitigation_strategies/tls_encryption__client-to-server_and_peer-to-peer_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enable TLS Encryption for all etcd communication.

**Description:**
1.  **Generate Certificates:**
    *   Create a Certificate Authority (CA) key and certificate.
    *   Generate server, client, and peer keys and certificates, signed by the CA.
    *   Use strong key algorithms.
2.  **Configure etcd:** Start etcd with these flags:
    *   `--cert-file=<path_to_server_certificate>`
    *   `--key-file=<path_to_server_key>`
    *   `--trusted-ca-file=<path_to_ca_certificate>`
    *   `--peer-cert-file=<path_to_peer_certificate>`
    *   `--peer-key-file=<path_to_peer_key>`
    *   `--peer-trusted-ca-file=<path_to_ca_certificate>`
    *   `--client-cert-auth=true` (for client certificate authentication)
3.  **Configure Clients:**  etcd clients (e.g., `etcdctl`, application code) must use TLS:
    *   Provide client certificate, key, and CA certificate.
    *   Verify the server's certificate.
4.  **Regularly Rotate Certificates:** Rotate certificates before expiration.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Eavesdropping (High Severity):** TLS prevents interception of unencrypted data.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** TLS verifies identities, preventing interception and modification.
*   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Client certificate authentication (with TLS) prevents unauthorized connections.

**Impact:**
*   **Eavesdropping:** Risk reduced to near zero.
*   **MITM Attacks:** Risk reduced to near zero.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (with client cert auth).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement etcd's built-in RBAC.

**Description:**
1.  **Enable RBAC:** Start etcd with `--auth-token=simple` (or configure advanced authentication).
2.  **Create Roles:** `etcdctl role add <role_name>`
3.  **Grant Permissions:** `etcdctl role grant-permission <role_name> <permission_type> <key> [<end_key>]`
    *   `permission_type`: `read`, `write`, `readwrite`.
    *   Example: `etcdctl role grant-permission app-read read /config/app/*`
4.  **Create Users:** `etcdctl user add <user_name>`
5.  **Assign Roles:** `etcdctl user grant-role <user_name> <role_name>`
6.  **Authenticate:** Clients use `etcdctl --user <user_name>:<password> ...` or provide credentials in API requests.
7.  **Regularly Audit:** Review roles and permissions.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Limits user actions based on roles.
*   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Prevents compromised accounts from gaining full access.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion by Unauthorized Users (High Severity):** Restricts write/delete operations.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Risk significantly reduced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authentication (Client Authentication)](./mitigation_strategies/authentication__client_authentication_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Require client authentication.

**Description:**
1.  **Choose Method:**
    *   **TLS Client Certificates (Recommended):** Use `--client-cert-auth=true` in etcd. Provide clients with signed certificates.
    *   **Username/Password:** Use `--auth-token=simple` and `etcdctl user add`. *Less secure.*
2.  **Configure Clients:**
    *   **TLS Client Certificates:** Clients provide certificate and key.
    *   **Username/Password:** Clients provide username and password.
3.  **Enforce Strong Passwords (if using username/password).**
4.  **Regularly Rotate Credentials.**

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthenticated connections.
*   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Makes credential guessing harder.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk reduced (with strong passwords).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Quotas](./mitigation_strategies/resource_quotas.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Set resource quotas to limit data storage.

**Description:**
1.  **Determine Quota:** Decide on a data store size limit (in bytes).
2.  **Configure etcd:** Start etcd with `--quota-backend-bytes=<size_in_bytes>`.  Example: `--quota-backend-bytes=8589934592` (8GB).
3.  **Monitor:** Use `etcdctl endpoint status` to check `dbSize` and `dbSizeInUse`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium Severity):** Prevents storage exhaustion.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Prevents uncontrolled data growth.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS Attacks:** Risk reduced.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Backups](./mitigation_strategies/regular_backups.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Create regular backups of etcd data.

**Description:**
1.  **Choose Method:**
    *   **`etcdctl snapshot save` (Recommended):** Creates consistent snapshots.
    *   File System Snapshots (if supported, with consistency checks).
2.  **Automate:** Use a script or scheduler (e.g., cron).
3.  **Secure Storage:** Store backups securely and offsite. Encrypt if possible.
4.  **Test Restoration:** Regularly test with `etcdctl snapshot restore`.
5.  **Retention Policy:** Define how long to keep backups.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Loss (High Severity):** Allows recovery from various failures.
*   **Data Corruption (High Severity):** Allows restoration to a clean state.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Loss:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Multi-Member Cluster (High Availability)](./mitigation_strategies/multi-member_cluster__high_availability_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Deploy etcd as a multi-member cluster.

**Description:**
1.  **Cluster Size:** Use an odd number of members (3, 5, 7).
2.  **Configure Members:**
    *   Unique `--name` for each member.
    *   Unique `--initial-advertise-peer-urls` for each member.
    *   `--initial-cluster` to specify all members and peer addresses.
    *   Ensure peer communication (default port 2380).
3.  **Monitor:** Use `etcdctl endpoint health` and `etcdctl endpoint status`.
4.  **Test Failover:** Simulate member failures.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Single Point of Failure (High Severity):** Cluster survives member failures.
*   **Downtime (High Severity):** Reduces downtime due to failures.

**Impact:**
*   **Single Point of Failure:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Downtime:** Risk significantly reduced.
