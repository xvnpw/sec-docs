# Threat Model Analysis for etcd-io/etcd

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via Client API](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_client_api.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Access via Client API

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the etcd client API (typically port 2379) and issues read requests (e.g., `get`, `range`) to retrieve sensitive data. This leverages weaknesses *within etcd's authentication or authorization mechanisms* or exploits vulnerabilities in the API handling.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive configuration data, service discovery information, secrets, leading to further compromise.
    *   **Affected etcd Component:** `etcdserver/api/v3rpc` (gRPC server handling client requests), `auth` module (if authentication is bypassed or flawed).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable TLS with Mutual Authentication (mTLS):**  Enforce client certificate verification within etcd.
        *   **Implement RBAC:**  Use etcd's RBAC to restrict client access to only necessary keys/prefixes.  Regularly audit RBAC rules.
        *   **Audit Logging:** Enable and regularly review etcd's audit logs for unauthorized access.

## Threat: [Data Modification/Deletion via Client API](./threats/data_modificationdeletion_via_client_api.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Modification/Deletion via Client API

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the etcd client API and issues write requests (e.g., `put`, `delete`, `txn`) to modify or delete data.  This exploits vulnerabilities in etcd's authorization, input validation, or transaction handling.
    *   **Impact:** Disruption of application functionality, service outages, data loss, potential for complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected etcd Component:** `etcdserver/api/v3rpc` (gRPC server), `auth` module, `mvcc` (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication and Authorization (RBAC):** Use mTLS and granular RBAC within etcd to strictly control write access.
        *   **Input Validation (within etcd client libraries):** While primarily a client-side concern, etcd client libraries *should* perform basic validation to prevent obviously malformed requests.
        *   **Transaction Limits:** Use etcd's transaction features correctly; avoid overly large or complex transactions that could be exploited.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Excessive Key-Value Operations](./threats/denial_of_service_via_excessive_key-value_operations.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Excessive Key-Value Operations

    *   **Description:** An attacker floods the etcd cluster with read/write requests, exceeding etcd's capacity and causing it to become unresponsive. This targets vulnerabilities in etcd's request handling, resource management, or the Raft consensus algorithm.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service for all applications relying on etcd.
    *   **Affected etcd Component:** `etcdserver/api/v3rpc` (gRPC server), `mvcc` module, `raft` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting (within etcd):** Utilize etcd's built-in rate limiting features to protect against request floods.
        *   **Connection Limits (within etcd):** Configure etcd to limit the number of concurrent connections.
        *   **Resource Limits (within etcd):** Configure appropriate resource limits (CPU, memory) for the etcd process itself.
        *   **Request Timeouts (within etcd):** Ensure etcd has appropriate timeouts configured to prevent slow clients from consuming resources.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Lease Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_via_lease_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Lease Exhaustion

    *   **Description:** An attacker creates many leases with short TTLs, exhausting etcd's lease ID space and preventing legitimate clients from creating leases. This targets the `lease` module specifically.
    *   **Impact:** Disruption of services relying on leases (leader election, ephemeral data).
    *   **Affected etcd Component:** `lease` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Limit Maximum Lease TTL (within etcd):** Configure a reasonable maximum TTL within etcd to prevent abuse.
        *   **Monitor Lease Usage (and alert on anomalies):** Track lease creation rates and alert on suspicious activity.
        *   **Rate Limiting (on lease creation, within etcd):** Implement rate limiting specifically for lease creation requests within etcd.

## Threat: [Compromise of etcd Peer Communication](./threats/compromise_of_etcd_peer_communication.md)

*   **Threat:**  Compromise of etcd Peer Communication

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts/modifies communication *between etcd cluster members*, exploiting vulnerabilities in the Raft communication protocol or its implementation. This could involve injecting false data or disrupting quorum.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of data consistency, split-brain, cluster instability, data corruption/loss.
    *   **Affected etcd Component:** `etcdserver/api/rafthttp` (Raft communication), `raft` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable TLS for Peer Communication (within etcd):** Configure etcd to use TLS for *all* inter-member communication. Use strong cipher suites.

## Threat: [Exploitation of etcd Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_etcd_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:**  Exploitation of etcd Vulnerabilities

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability *in the etcd software itself* (e.g., buffer overflow, code injection) to gain unauthorized access, execute code, or cause a DoS.
    *   **Impact:** Varies; could range from data exposure to complete cluster compromise.
    *   **Affected etcd Component:** Potentially *any* component, depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for exploitable vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep etcd Up-to-Date:** Regularly update etcd to the latest stable release. This is the *primary* defense.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about new etcd vulnerabilities.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning (of the etcd binary):** Use tools to scan the etcd binary for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Improper Cluster Membership Changes Leading to Split Brain](./threats/improper_cluster_membership_changes_leading_to_split_brain.md)

* **Threat:** Improper Cluster Membership Changes Leading to Split Brain

    * **Description:** An operator incorrectly adds or removes nodes, violating quorum or causing partitions, leading to a "split-brain" where multiple inconsistent clusters form. This is a direct operational error *interacting with etcd's core functionality*.
    * **Impact:** Data inconsistency, data loss, cluster unavailability.
    * **Affected etcd Component:** `raft` module, `etcdserver/api/membership`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strictly Adhere to etcd Documentation:** Follow official procedures for membership changes.
        * **Use `etcdctl` for Membership Changes:** Use the `etcdctl` commands; avoid manual configuration edits.
        * **Monitor Cluster Health:** Closely monitor health during and after changes.
