### Predictable ULIDs generated by default `Make()` function and `-q` flag in command line tool

- **Description:**
    1. The `ulid.Make()` function in the `ulid` library is designed to generate ULIDs using the current time and random entropy. By default, it utilizes `defaultEntropy` as the entropy source.
    2. `defaultEntropy` is initialized to use `math/rand.Rand`, a pseudo-random number generator that is not cryptographically secure, seeded with the current Unix nano timestamp.
    3. Consequently, ULIDs generated using `ulid.Make()` by default are predictable, especially if an attacker can observe a sequence of generated ULIDs or estimate the time of generation.
    4. Similarly, the command-line tool `ulid` provides a `-q` or `--quick` flag. When used, this flag also employs `math/rand` for entropy generation, leading to the creation of predictable ULIDs in the command-line tool as well.
    5. An attacker who can observe or infer the approximate time at which ULIDs are generated might narrow down the seed value for `math/rand`. With knowledge (or estimation) of the seed, the attacker can reproduce the pseudo-random stream and predict future ULIDs.
    6. This predictability issue affects both the library's default `Make()` function and the command-line tool when the `-q` flag is used.

- **Impact:**
    - If ULIDs generated by `ulid.Make()` or `ulid -q` are used as security-sensitive identifiers (e.g., session IDs, API keys, CSRF tokens, or in URL parameters), this vulnerability can have a high impact.
    - Predictable ULIDs can enable attackers to bypass security measures, gain unauthorized access, perform session hijacking, or execute CSRF attacks by predicting or enumerating valid identifiers.
    - The vulnerability rank is high because predictable identifiers in security contexts can directly lead to breaches of confidentiality and integrity.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** high

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Documentation:** The README.md file explicitly warns that `math/rand.Rand` is not cryptographically secure and recommends using `crypto/rand` for security-sensitive use cases. It also notes that `Make()` uses a "pseudo-random" source of entropy.
    - **Command Line Help:** The command-line tool help text for the `-q` flag states "when generating, use non-crypto-grade entropy", indicating that the quick mode is not intended for secure applications.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Default Entropy Source:** The default entropy source for `ulid.Make()` should be changed to a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as `crypto/rand.Reader`.
    - **Command Line Tool Default:** The command line tool `ulid` should use `crypto/rand.Reader` as the default entropy source when generating ULIDs without the `-q` flag to promote secure-by-default behavior.
    - **Security Warning:** Add a prominent security warning in the documentation, specifically highlighting the risks of using `ulid.Make()` and `ulid -q` in security-sensitive contexts due to the use of pseudo-random entropy. Recommend using `ulid.New` with `crypto/rand.Reader` for secure applications.
    - **Runtime Check (Optional):** Consider adding an optional runtime check or build flag that would enforce the use of `crypto/rand` in production environments or for security-sensitive operations, although this might add complexity for users.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The application or system must be using the `ulid.Make()` function or the `ulid -q` command-line tool to generate ULIDs.
    - These generated ULIDs are employed as security-sensitive identifiers where unpredictability is a requirement for maintaining security (e.g., authentication tokens, access control identifiers).
    - An attacker needs to be able to observe or intercept a sufficient number of generated ULIDs, or have knowledge about the system's time, to potentially analyze and predict future values if `math/rand` is used.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `/code/ulid.go`:
        ```go
        var defaultEntropy = func() io.Reader {
            rng := rand.New(rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano())) // math/rand is used here
            return &LockedMonotonicReader{MonotonicReader: Monotonic(rng, 0)}
        }()

        func Make() (id ULID) {
            return MustNew(Now(), defaultEntropy) // defaultEntropy is used by Make()
        }
        ```
        The `Make()` function, intended for general use, defaults to `defaultEntropy`, which utilizes `math/rand`. This makes the generated entropy source predictable.

    - `/code/cmd/ulid/main.go`:
        ```go
        func generate(quick, zero bool) {
            entropy := cryptorand.Reader // Default entropy is crypto/rand
            if quick {
                seed := time.Now().UnixNano()
                source := mathrand.NewSource(seed)
                entropy = mathrand.New(source) // math/rand is used when -q is used
            }
            // ...
            id, err := ulid.New(ulid.Timestamp(time.Now()), entropy)
            // ...
        }
        ```
        In the `generate` function of the command-line tool, the default entropy source is `crypto/rand.Reader`, which is secure. However, when the `-q` flag is used, it switches to `math/rand`, making the generated ULIDs predictable.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Deploy a service or application that uses `ulid.Make()` to generate identifiers in a security-sensitive context (e.g., session IDs).**
    2. **Collect a sequence of ULIDs generated by this service, along with timestamps of their generation if possible.**
    3. **Alternatively, use the command line tool with `-q` flag:**
        ```bash
        ulid -q
        ulid -q
        ulid -q
        ```
        Collect several ULIDs generated using `ulid -q`.
    4. **Analyze the entropy portion of the collected ULIDs.** Observe if there are discernible patterns or a lack of expected randomness, especially when compared to ULIDs generated without the `-q` flag or using `crypto/rand` directly.
    5. **Attempt to predict future ULIDs.** Based on the observed patterns or by trying to estimate the seed used for `math/rand` (if timestamps are available), attempt to predict subsequently generated ULIDs. If successful, this confirms the predictability of ULIDs generated using `math/rand` and thus the vulnerability.
    6. **For command line `-q` test case**, generate a few ULIDs and observe the entropy part for repetition or lack of randomness compared to default `ulid` command output.

### Zeroed Entropy Mode via “-z” Flag – Predictable ULIDs

- **Description:**
    1. The command-line tool `ulid` supports a `-z` (or `--zero`) flag intended to “fix entropy to all-zeroes.”
    2. When this flag is used, the `generate()` function in `cmd/ulid/main.go` sets the entropy source to `zeroReader{}`.
    3. The `zeroReader`'s `Read` method fills every byte of the provided slice with zero.
    4. As a result, when the `-z` flag is used, the ULID's entropy component becomes entirely predictable (all bytes are zero), and only the timestamp portion varies.

- **Impact:**
    - If ULIDs generated with zero entropy (using the `-z` flag) are inadvertently or intentionally used as unique identifiers in a security-sensitive application (e.g., in URL parameters, session IDs, or API access tokens), they become trivially predictable.
    - An attacker aware that the `-z` flag is in use can easily enumerate ULID values (since the entropy portion is fixed) and potentially attempt unauthorized actions such as resource enumeration or impersonation.
    - This vulnerability has a high rank because it directly leads to predictable identifiers in security contexts, severely compromising confidentiality and integrity.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** high

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Explicit Option:** The `-z` flag is provided explicitly as a command-line option with accompanying help text, suggesting it is intended for testing or demonstration purposes.
    - **No Runtime Warning:** There is no additional guard or runtime warning when the `-z` flag is used.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Usage Prevention/Warning:** The tool does not prevent or warn against using the `-z` flag in production or any environment where ULID unpredictability is critical for security.
    - **Confirmation Prompt:** A safer implementation might prompt for confirmation or refuse to operate in security-sensitive contexts when an all-zero entropy source is selected, to prevent accidental misuse in production.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An operator uses the command-line tool with the `-z` flag (either inadvertently or due to misconfiguration) in a production or publicly accessible service environment.
    - ULIDs generated with all-zero entropy are employed for purposes beyond mere testing, specifically as security-sensitive identifiers (e.g., authentication tokens or resource identifiers).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `/code/cmd/ulid/main.go`:
        ```go
        func generate(quick, zero bool) {
            // ...
            if zero {
              entropy = zeroReader{}
            }
            // ...
            id, err := ulid.New(ulid.Timestamp(time.Now()), entropy)
            // ...
        }
        ```
    - `/code/cmd/ulid/main.go`:
        ```go
        type zeroReader struct{}

        func (zeroReader) Read(p []byte) (int, error) {
            for i := range p {
                p[i] = 0
            }
            return len(p), nil
        }
        ```
        The `generate()` function checks for the `zero` flag. If set, it uses `zeroReader` as the entropy source. `zeroReader`'s `Read` method always fills the buffer with zeros. This means every generated ULID with `-z` will have its lower 10 bytes (entropy) fixed to 0, leaving only the time-based 6 bytes variable.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Run the ULID command-line tool with the `-z` flag:**
        ```bash
        ulid -z
        ```
    2. **Observe the generated ULID output.** Note that the last 16 characters (encoding the 80-bit entropy) correspond to a fixed value (all zeroes). For example: `01AN4Z07BY77EZK1CQ0XDGZY0Z`. The entropy part `77EZK1CQ0XDGZY0Z` when decoded from base32 will be all zeros.
    3. **Generate multiple ULIDs in quick succession using the `-z` flag:**
        ```bash
        ulid -z
        ulid -z
        ulid -z
        ```
        Confirm that only the timestamp portion changes while the entropy portion remains unchanged (all zeroes).
    4. **Demonstrate Predictability:** Explain that knowing the timestamp is sufficient to almost completely determine the ULID, as the entropy is fixed.  In a real-world scenario, if an attacker knows that `-z` flag is used and can estimate the time of ULID generation, they can effectively predict the entire identifier, confirming the vulnerability.
