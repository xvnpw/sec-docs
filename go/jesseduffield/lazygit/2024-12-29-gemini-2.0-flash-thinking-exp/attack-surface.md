Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Lazygit, with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Inadvertent Triggering of Malicious Git Hooks
    *   **Description:** Lazygit triggers various Git commands that can execute Git hooks (pre-commit, post-receive, etc.). If a repository contains malicious Git hooks, Lazygit's actions could inadvertently trigger their execution.
    *   **How Lazygit Contributes:** By simplifying Git workflows, Lazygit can lead users to perform actions that trigger hooks without necessarily being aware of their presence or content.
    *   **Example:** A developer using Lazygit to commit changes in a repository with a malicious `pre-commit` hook could unknowingly execute arbitrary code on their machine when attempting to commit.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Be cautious when working with repositories from untrusted sources.
        *   Inspect Git hooks in a repository before performing actions that might trigger them.
        *   Consider using tools or configurations to disable or control the execution of Git hooks.

*   **Attack Surface:** Lazygit Configuration File Manipulation
    *   **Description:** Lazygit uses a configuration file (`config.yml`) to store user preferences and settings. If this file is writable by an attacker, they could modify it to alter Lazygit's behavior or potentially execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **How Lazygit Contributes:** Lazygit reads and applies settings from this configuration file. If the file is compromised, Lazygit will operate based on the attacker's modified settings.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could modify the `config.yml` file to include custom commands that are executed when Lazygit performs certain actions, effectively achieving command execution.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary command execution, modification of Lazygit's behavior to facilitate further attacks, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure proper file permissions are set on the Lazygit configuration file to prevent unauthorized modification.
        *   Regularly review the contents of the configuration file for any unexpected changes.
