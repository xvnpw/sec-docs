# Threat Model Analysis for mislav/hub

## Threat: [1. Git Command Execution Threats via `hub`](./threats/1__git_command_execution_threats_via__hub_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Command Injection Vulnerabilities in `hub` Command Construction.
    *   **Description:**  An attacker can inject malicious commands if user-controlled input is directly concatenated into shell commands executed by `hub`. For example, if the application uses user input to construct a `hub pull-request` command without sanitization, an attacker could inject shell commands to be executed alongside the intended `hub` command. This is possible because `hub` relies on shell execution to run `git` commands and can be vulnerable if input to `hub` is not properly handled.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**.  Full system compromise, arbitrary code execution on the server, data breach, denial of service, and complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
    *   **Affected Hub Component:** `hub`'s command execution mechanism, specifically when constructing and executing shell commands based on application input.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never directly concatenate user input into shell commands when using `hub`.**
        *   If possible, avoid constructing shell commands directly and use safer alternatives if available (though `hub` primarily works by shell command execution).
        *   Rigorous input sanitization and validation is absolutely crucial if direct command construction with `hub` is unavoidable.
        *   Employ input validation whitelists to restrict allowed characters and formats in user inputs used with `hub`.
        *   Consider using a wrapper library or function that abstracts away direct command construction with `hub` and provides safer interfaces.

## Threat: [2. Dependency and Supply Chain Threats](./threats/2__dependency_and_supply_chain_threats.md)

*   **Threat:**  Vulnerabilities in `hub` or its Dependencies.
    *   **Description:**  `hub` itself, or libraries it depends on, might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses a vulnerable version of `hub`. This is a supply chain risk, where the vulnerability exists within the `hub` tool itself or its dependencies, and the application becomes vulnerable by using `hub`. Exploitation could range from denial of service to remote code execution depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** **Medium to High**.  The impact depends on the nature and severity of the vulnerability in `hub` or its dependencies. Could lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or even remote code execution, potentially compromising the application or the system it runs on. In worst case scenarios, this could be **Critical** if remote code execution is possible.
    *   **Affected Hub Component:** The `hub` binary and its dependencies as a whole.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High to Critical** (depending on vulnerability severity, potentially Critical for RCE vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regularly update `hub` to the latest version.** This is the most important mitigation.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases specifically for `hub` and its dependencies.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in `hub` and its dependencies within your application's build or deployment pipeline.
        *   Consider pinning the version of `hub` used by the application to ensure consistent behavior, but ensure a process is in place for timely updates when security patches are released.
