# Attack Surface Analysis for mislav/hub

## Attack Surface: [GitHub API Token Exposure](./attack_surfaces/github_api_token_exposure.md)

*   **Description:**  Compromise of GitHub API tokens used by `hub` to authenticate with GitHub.
*   **Hub Contribution:** `hub` *directly* relies on API tokens for authentication and *directly* stores them locally in configuration files (`~/.config/hub`, `.gitconfig`), making these files a primary target if local system security is weak.  `hub`'s functionality is impossible without these tokens.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a developer's workstation and reads the `~/.config/hub` file, extracting the GitHub API token. They then use this token to access the developer's GitHub account and potentially organization repositories, even without knowing the developer's GitHub password. This is a direct consequence of how `hub` manages authentication.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to GitHub account and repositories, data breaches, code modification, malicious commits, and potential supply chain attacks if the compromised account has write access to critical repositories.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure File Permissions:** Ensure strict file permissions on `~/.config/hub` and `.gitconfig` to prevent unauthorized local access to token files.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant API tokens only the necessary scopes required for `hub`'s intended use. Avoid overly broad scopes.
    *   **Credential Manager:**  Use a dedicated credential manager to store and manage API tokens more securely than plain text files, instead of relying on `hub`'s default configuration file storage.
    *   **Regular Token Rotation:** Periodically rotate GitHub API tokens to limit the window of opportunity if a token is compromised.
    *   **Avoid Committing Tokens:**  Absolutely never commit configuration files containing API tokens to version control.

## Attack Surface: [Git Hook Exploitation via Cloned Repositories (Indirectly Facilitated by Hub)](./attack_surfaces/git_hook_exploitation_via_cloned_repositories__indirectly_facilitated_by_hub_.md)

*   **Description:**  Execution of malicious Git hooks from repositories cloned using `hub`.
*   **Hub Contribution:** `hub` *directly* simplifies and encourages repository cloning with commands like `hub clone`. While the Git hook vulnerability is inherent to Git itself, `hub`'s ease of use in cloning can *indirectly* increase the likelihood of users cloning repositories from untrusted sources, thus increasing exposure to this risk.
*   **Example:** A developer uses `hub clone` to quickly clone a repository from an unfamiliar or potentially malicious source. This repository contains a malicious `post-checkout` Git hook that, when executed during the clone process or later Git operations triggered by `hub` interactions, installs malware on the developer's system or steals credentials.
*   **Impact:** Local system compromise, malware infection, credential theft, and potential lateral movement within the network if the compromised system is connected to internal resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (depending on the severity of the malicious hook - can be **High** if it leads to critical system compromise)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Repository Source Awareness:** Be extremely cautious when cloning repositories from untrusted or unknown sources, especially when using tools like `hub` that streamline the process. Verify repository legitimacy *before* cloning.
    *   **Git Hook Inspection:** Before working with *any* newly cloned repository, but especially from untrusted sources cloned via `hub`, inspect the `.git/hooks` directory for unusual or suspicious scripts.
    *   **Disable Git Hooks (Temporarily):** If unsure about a repository's hooks, temporarily disable Git hooks globally or for the specific repository while inspecting it, especially after using `hub clone` on a new repository. (e.g., `git config --local core.hooksPath /dev/null`)
    *   **Security Scanning of Repositories:** Implement repository security scanning tools that can detect potentially malicious content, including Git hooks, *before* cloning or integrating repositories into workflows, especially if `hub` is used to quickly onboard new repositories.
