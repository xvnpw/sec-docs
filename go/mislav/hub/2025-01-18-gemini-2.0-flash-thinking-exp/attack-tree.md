## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Hub Authentication Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_hub_authentication_credentials__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path focuses on compromising the credentials used by the application to authenticate with GitHub through `hub`. If an attacker gains access to these credentials, they can impersonate the application and perform actions on GitHub on its behalf.
*   **Critical Node: Steal Stored GitHub Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application stores GitHub credentials (e.g., OAuth tokens, personal access tokens) in a location accessible to an attacker.
    *   **Specific Scenarios:**
        *   **Access Environment Variables Containing Tokens:** The application stores the token in an environment variable without proper protection or restrictions on access. An attacker gaining access to the server or container environment can read these variables.
        *   **Read Configuration Files with Stored Credentials:** The token is stored in a configuration file with insufficient permissions, allowing unauthorized users to read its contents.
        *   **Exploit Insecure Storage Mechanisms (e.g., plaintext files):** The token is stored in a plaintext file or a poorly secured database, making it easily accessible to an attacker who gains access to the file system or database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Hub Command Execution [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_hub_command_execution__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path centers on manipulating the commands that the application executes using the `hub` tool. By controlling the command or its arguments, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server or perform unintended actions on GitHub.
*   **Critical Node: Command Injection via Unsanitized Input [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application constructs `hub` commands by incorporating data from untrusted sources (e.g., user input, external APIs) without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands into the `hub` command string.
    *   **Specific Scenarios:**
        *   **Inject Malicious Arguments into `hub` Commands:** The attacker crafts input that, when incorporated into the `hub` command, executes unintended shell commands or modifies the behavior of the `hub` command in a harmful way.
            *   **Exploit User-Controlled Input Passed to `hub`:** User-provided input (e.g., repository names, branch names) is directly used in the `hub` command without proper sanitization. An attacker can inject shell commands within this input.
            *   **Exploit Internal Application Logic Flaws Leading to Command Injection:**  Flaws in the application's logic might lead to the construction of malicious `hub` commands based on internal data or states that can be manipulated by an attacker.
