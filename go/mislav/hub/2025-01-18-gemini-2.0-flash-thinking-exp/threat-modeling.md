# Threat Model Analysis for mislav/hub

## Threat: [Compromised `hub` Binary Leading to Arbitrary Code Execution](./threats/compromised__hub__binary_leading_to_arbitrary_code_execution.md)

- **Threat:** Compromised `hub` Binary Leading to Arbitrary Code Execution
    - **Description:** An attacker could replace the legitimate `hub` binary with a malicious one. When the application executes `hub`, the malicious code runs with the application's privileges, potentially allowing the attacker to gain full control of the application's environment, access sensitive data, or pivot to other systems.
    - **Impact:** Critical - Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system. Data breach, service disruption, and reputational damage are likely.
    - **Affected `hub` Component:** The entire `hub` executable.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Verify the integrity of the `hub` binary using checksums or signatures provided by the official repository or trusted sources.
        - Download `hub` from trusted sources only (official GitHub releases, reputable package managers).
        - Implement a process for verifying the integrity of dependencies during deployment and runtime.
        - Use a security tool that monitors file integrity.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Input in `hub` Commands](./threats/command_injection_via_unsanitized_input_in__hub__commands.md)

- **Threat:** Command Injection via Unsanitized Input in `hub` Commands
    - **Description:** If the application constructs `hub` commands by concatenating user-provided input without proper sanitization or validation, an attacker could inject malicious commands. When the application executes this crafted `hub` command, the injected commands will be executed by the system, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data manipulation, or system compromise. For example, an attacker could inject `&& rm -rf /` into a command if the application doesn't properly escape or validate input.
    - **Impact:** High - Potential for arbitrary code execution with the application's privileges, leading to data breaches, system modification, or denial of service.
    - **Affected `hub` Component:** The command execution logic within `hub` when processing arguments.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Avoid constructing `hub` commands directly from user input.
        - If user input is necessary, strictly validate and sanitize it using allow-lists and escaping techniques specific to the shell environment.
        - Use parameterized commands or libraries that abstract away direct command execution where possible.
        - Employ the principle of least privilege when executing `hub` commands, limiting the permissions of the user or service account running the application.

## Threat: [Exposure of GitHub Credentials Used by `hub`](./threats/exposure_of_github_credentials_used_by__hub_.md)

- **Threat:** Exposure of GitHub Credentials Used by `hub`
    - **Description:** `hub` requires GitHub credentials (like OAuth tokens or personal access tokens) to interact with the GitHub API. If these credentials are stored insecurely by the application (e.g., in plain text configuration files, environment variables accessible to unauthorized users, or in the application's code), an attacker could gain access to them. With these credentials, the attacker can impersonate the application and perform actions on GitHub, potentially leading to data breaches, code modification, or unauthorized access to private repositories.
    - **Impact:** High - Unauthorized access to GitHub resources, potential for data breaches, code tampering, and reputational damage.
    - **Affected `hub` Component:** The authentication mechanisms used by `hub` to interact with the GitHub API.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Store GitHub credentials securely using dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
        - Avoid storing credentials directly in code, configuration files, or environment variables that are not strictly controlled.
        - Use environment variables only if the environment is securely managed and access is restricted.
        - Implement the principle of least privilege for the GitHub tokens, granting only the necessary permissions.
        - Regularly rotate GitHub credentials.
