# Attack Surface Analysis for mislav/hub

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_github_personal_access_tokens__pats_.md)

*   **Description:** GitHub PATs, used by `hub` for authentication, are stored insecurely, making them vulnerable to theft.
    *   **How `hub` Contributes:** `hub` relies on PATs for authenticating with the GitHub API. If the application doesn't manage these PATs securely, it directly exposes this credential required by `hub`.
    *   **Example:** The application stores the user's PAT in a plain text configuration file or environment variable without proper encryption, which `hub` then uses. An attacker gaining access to the server can easily retrieve the PAT used by `hub`.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can gain full access to the associated GitHub account, allowing them to modify repositories, access private information, and potentially compromise other systems connected to that account through actions performed via `hub`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Avoid storing PATs directly in code or configuration files used by `hub`.
            *   Utilize secure credential management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and retrieve PATs used by `hub`.
            *   If environment variables are used for `hub`'s PAT, ensure proper access controls and consider encryption at rest.
            *   Implement mechanisms to retrieve PATs securely at runtime for `hub`'s use, avoiding persistent storage.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Input in `hub` Commands](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_unsanitized_input_in__hub__commands.md)

*   **Description:** The application constructs `hub` commands using user-provided input without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary commands that `hub` will execute.
    *   **How `hub` Contributes:** `hub` extends `git` and executes shell commands. If the application doesn't sanitize input before passing it to `hub`, it can lead to the execution of unintended commands by the underlying shell invoked by `hub`.
    *   **Example:** The application allows users to specify a branch name to create using `hub`. An attacker provides an input like `; rm -rf /`, which, if not sanitized, could be executed by the shell when `hub` attempts to create the branch.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server or the user's machine, potentially leading to data loss, system compromise, or denial of service triggered by commands executed via `hub`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Never directly embed user input into shell commands passed to `hub`.
            *   Use parameterized commands or libraries that handle command construction safely, ensuring input is properly escaped before being used with `hub`.
            *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization to remove or escape potentially harmful characters before constructing `hub` commands.
            *   Adopt a "least privilege" approach for the user running the application and the `hub` commands.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via GitHub API Interactions initiated by `hub`](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_github_api_interactions_initiated_by__hub_.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses `hub` to interact with the GitHub API in a way that allows an attacker to make requests to unintended internal or external resources through `hub`'s API calls.
    *   **How `hub` Contributes:** If the application uses `hub` to construct API requests that include URLs based on user input without proper validation, it can be exploited for SSRF when `hub` makes those requests.
    *   **Example:** The application uses `hub` to create a pull request and allows users to specify a "reference" URL. An attacker provides a URL pointing to an internal service, and `hub`'s API call to GitHub includes this malicious URL.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially access internal services, read sensitive data, or perform actions on other systems through the application's server by leveraging `hub`'s ability to make API calls with attacker-controlled URLs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Strictly validate and sanitize any URLs provided by users before using them in `hub` commands or API requests.
            *   Use allow lists for allowed domains or protocols when constructing URLs for `hub`'s API interactions.
            *   Disable or restrict redirects when making external requests through `hub`'s actions.
            *   Implement network segmentation to isolate internal resources from the application's server running `hub`.

## Attack Surface: [Reliance on Potentially Compromised `hub` Executable](./attack_surfaces/reliance_on_potentially_compromised__hub__executable.md)

*   **Description:** The application relies on the `hub` executable being present and trustworthy. If an attacker can replace the legitimate `hub` executable with a malicious one, they can compromise the application's interactions with GitHub.
    *   **How `hub` Contributes:** The application directly executes the `hub` binary to interact with GitHub. If this binary is compromised, all of the application's GitHub interactions through `hub` are also compromised.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the server and replaces the `hub` executable in the system's PATH with a malicious script that intercepts credentials or performs unauthorized actions when the application calls `hub`.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application's GitHub interactions, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and further system compromise due to malicious actions performed by the compromised `hub` executable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers & Users:**
            *   Ensure the `hub` executable is obtained from a trusted source (official GitHub repository or package manager).
            *   Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized changes to the `hub` executable used by the application.
            *   Regularly update `hub` to patch potential vulnerabilities within the tool itself.
            *   Consider using containerization or virtual environments to isolate the application and its dependencies, including the `hub` executable.
