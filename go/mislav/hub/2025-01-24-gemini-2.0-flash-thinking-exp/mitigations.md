## Mitigation Strategy: [Securely Manage GitHub API Tokens for `hub`](./mitigation_strategies/securely_manage_github_api_tokens_for__hub_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify `hub` Token Usage:** Determine where and how `hub` is configured to authenticate with GitHub in your application.  `hub` typically uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable or the `gh auth login` mechanism.
    2.  **Avoid Hardcoding Tokens in `hub` Configurations:** Ensure that you are not hardcoding GitHub API tokens directly within scripts, configuration files, or environment variable settings that are easily accessible or version controlled when used with `hub`.
    3.  **Utilize Secure Storage for `hub` Tokens:** Store the `GITHUB_TOKEN` used by `hub` in a secure manner:
        *   **Environment Variables (Secure Context):**  Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` as an environment variable in secure execution environments like CI/CD pipelines or containerized deployments, ensuring these environments are properly secured.
        *   **Secrets Management Systems:** For more sensitive environments or complex setups, use a dedicated secrets management system to store and retrieve the `GITHUB_TOKEN` used by `hub`.
    4.  **Principle of Least Privilege for `hub` Tokens:** When generating GitHub API tokens intended for use with `hub`, grant only the necessary scopes required for the specific `hub` commands being executed. Avoid overly permissive scopes.
    5.  **Regular Token Rotation for `hub`:** Implement a policy to regularly rotate the GitHub API tokens used by `hub` to limit the lifespan of a potentially compromised token.
    6.  **Revocation Procedures for `hub` Tokens:** Establish clear steps to quickly revoke a GitHub API token used by `hub` if compromise is suspected. Update the token in your secure storage and reconfigure `hub` to use the new token.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exposure of API Tokens Used by `hub` (High Severity):** Hardcoded or insecurely stored tokens used by `hub` can be exposed, leading to unauthorized access to GitHub resources via `hub`.
        *   **Unauthorized Actions via `hub` (High Severity):** Compromised tokens used by `hub` can allow attackers to perform actions on GitHub as authorized by the token's scope, potentially using `hub` commands to manipulate repositories, issues, etc.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exposure of API Tokens Used by `hub`:** High reduction. Secure storage methods significantly reduce the risk of token exposure compared to insecure practices when using `hub`.
        *   **Unauthorized Actions via `hub`:** High reduction. Least privilege and token rotation limit the potential damage from compromised tokens used with `hub`.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**  Specify if secure token management for `hub` is currently implemented and where (e.g., "Yes, `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set via environment variable in CI/CD", "No"). Example: "Yes, `GITHUB_TOKEN` is securely passed as an environment variable in our CI/CD pipeline when `hub` is used."

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Specify where secure token management for `hub` is missing if not fully implemented (e.g., "Missing in local development scripts using `hub`", "Token rotation for `hub` not yet implemented"). Example: "No missing implementation for CI/CD, but local development scripts using `hub` might need review."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User-Provided Input in `hub` Command Construction](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user-provided_input_in__hub__command_construction.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User Input in `hub` Commands:** Analyze your application code to pinpoint where user-provided input (directly or indirectly) is incorporated into commands executed by `hub`. This includes repository names, branch names, issue titles, or any other parameters passed to `hub` commands that originate from user input.
    2.  **Strict Input Validation for `hub` Parameters:** Implement rigorous input validation specifically for user-provided data that becomes part of `hub` commands.
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Characters for `hub` Inputs:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters for each input field used in `hub` commands. Reject any input containing characters outside this whitelist.
        *   **Format Validation for `hub` Inputs:** Validate input against expected formats and patterns relevant to `hub` commands (e.g., repository name format, branch name conventions).
        *   **Length Limits for `hub` Inputs:** Enforce reasonable length limits on user inputs used in `hub` commands to prevent potential buffer overflow issues or unexpected behavior in shell command processing.
    3.  **Minimize Dynamic Command Construction for `hub`:** Reduce the dynamic construction of `hub` commands based on user input as much as possible. Prefer static command structures where feasible and pass user input as validated arguments rather than directly concatenating strings into commands.
    4.  **Avoid Shell Interpolation Vulnerabilities with `hub`:** Be extremely cautious about shell interpolation when constructing `hub` commands with user input.  Ensure that user input is not interpreted as shell commands or operators when passed to `hub`. While shell escaping can be attempted, it is complex and might not be completely reliable. Strict input validation is the primary defense.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Command Injection via `hub` (High Severity):** If user input is not properly sanitized when constructing `hub` commands, attackers could inject malicious shell commands that are executed by `hub` through the underlying shell, leading to arbitrary code execution.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Command Injection via `hub`:** High reduction. Input sanitization and validation are critical to prevent command injection vulnerabilities when using `hub` with user-provided data.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Specify if input sanitization is implemented for `hub` commands and where (e.g., "Yes, input validation for repository names used in `hub` commands", "No input sanitization for `hub` commands yet"). Example: "Yes, we have input validation in place for repository names and branch names used in `hub` commands within our application's backend."

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Specify where input sanitization is missing for `hub` commands (e.g., "Missing input validation for issue titles used in `hub` commands", "Need to review all places where user input is used with `hub`"). Example: "No missing implementation for currently used `hub` commands, but we need to ensure input validation is added if we introduce new features that use `hub` with user input."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Logging of `hub` Command Execution](./mitigation_strategies/secure_logging_of__hub__command_execution.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `hub` Command Logging:** Examine your application's logging practices to understand what information related to `hub` command execution is being logged (e.g., commands executed, output, errors).
    2.  **Prevent Logging of Sensitive Data in `hub` Context:** Ensure that logs related to `hub` commands do not inadvertently log sensitive information such as GitHub API tokens, repository secrets, or other confidential data that might be part of the environment or command output. Implement filtering or masking of sensitive data in `hub` command logs.
    3.  **Regularly Inspect `hub` Command Logs:** Periodically review logs related to `hub` command execution to identify and rectify any instances where sensitive information might be unintentionally logged.
    4.  **Control Access to `hub` Command Logs:** Restrict access to application logs that contain information about `hub` command execution to authorized personnel only to prevent unauthorized viewing of potentially sensitive data.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure via `hub` Command Logs (Medium to High Severity):** If sensitive information is logged in connection with `hub` command execution, it can be exposed to unauthorized individuals who gain access to the logs.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure via `hub` Command Logs:** High reduction. Secure logging practices specifically for `hub` command execution minimize the risk of information disclosure through logs related to `hub`.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Specify if secure logging for `hub` commands is implemented (e.g., "Yes, sensitive data is filtered from `hub` command logs", "No specific secure logging for `hub` commands yet"). Example: "Yes, we have implemented filtering to prevent logging of API tokens and other sensitive data in logs related to `hub` command execution."

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Specify if secure logging for `hub` commands is missing (e.g., "Need to implement sensitive data filtering in `hub` command logs", "Review `hub` command logs for potential sensitive data leaks"). Example: "No missing implementation, but regular reviews of logging configurations related to `hub` are necessary."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep `mislav/hub` Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep__mislavhub__updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor `mislav/hub` Releases:** Regularly check the `mislav/hub` GitHub repository for new releases, security advisories, and bug fixes. Subscribe to release notifications or periodically visit the repository's release page.
    2.  **Update `hub` Regularly:** Establish a process for regularly updating the `hub` version used in your development environment, CI/CD pipelines, and production systems to benefit from the latest security patches and bug fixes.
    3.  **Test `hub` Updates:** Before deploying updated `hub` versions to production, thoroughly test them in a staging or testing environment to ensure compatibility with your application and avoid any regressions in `hub`'s functionality.
    4.  **Automate `hub` Updates (If Possible):** If feasible, automate the process of updating `hub` dependencies using dependency management tools or scripts to ensure timely updates.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of `hub` Vulnerabilities (Varying Severity):** Using outdated versions of `hub` can expose your application to known security vulnerabilities present in older versions of `hub` that have been fixed in newer releases.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of `hub` Vulnerabilities:** Medium to High reduction. Keeping `hub` updated reduces the risk of attackers exploiting known vulnerabilities in `hub` itself. The impact depends on the severity of vulnerabilities addressed in updates.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Specify if `hub` updates are managed (e.g., "Yes, `hub` is managed as a dependency and updated regularly", "No formal process for updating `hub`"). Example: "Yes, `hub` is managed as a dependency in our project and we have a process for regularly updating dependencies, including `hub`."

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Specify if `hub` updates are not effectively managed (e.g., "Need to automate `hub` updates in CI/CD pipeline", "No regular checks for `hub` updates"). Example: "No missing implementation, but we can explore further automation of the `hub` update process in our CI/CD pipeline."
