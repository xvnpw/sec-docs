## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.1

### 2.1 Technical Description

*   **`hub` and its Configuration:**  `hub` is a command-line tool that wraps `git` to make it easier to work with GitHub.  It stores authentication information, including GitHub API tokens, in a YAML file located at `~/.config/hub`.  This file typically contains a section like this:

    ```yaml
    github.com:
    - user: your_username
      oauth_token: YOUR_GITHUB_API_TOKEN
      protocol: https
    ```

    The `oauth_token` field holds the sensitive API token.

*   **File Permissions (Unix-like Systems):**  Unix-like operating systems (Linux, macOS) use a permission system based on three categories of users:
    *   **Owner (u):** The user who owns the file.
    *   **Group (g):** A group of users associated with the file.
    *   **Others (o):** All other users on the system.

    Each category has three permissions:
    *   **Read (r):**  Allows viewing the file's contents.
    *   **Write (w):** Allows modifying the file.
    *   **Execute (x):** Allows running the file (if it's a script or executable).

    Permissions are represented numerically (octal notation):
    *   `r` = 4
    *   `w` = 2
    *   `x` = 1

    `0600` means:
    *   Owner: Read (4) + Write (2) = 6
    *   Group: No permissions = 0
    *   Others: No permissions = 0

    `0644` means:
    *   Owner: Read (4) + Write (2) = 6
    *   Group: Read (4) = 4
    *   Others: Read (4) = 4  (This is insecure for a sensitive file!)

*   **Vulnerability Mechanism:** If `~/.config/hub` has permissions that allow "others" (or even the "group," depending on system configuration) to read the file (e.g., `0644`, `0666`, `0777`), any user on the system can simply open the file and read the GitHub API token.

### 2.2 Attack Scenario Walkthrough

1.  **Prerequisite:** An attacker has gained some level of access to the target system. This could be:
    *   **Local User Account:** The attacker is a legitimate user on the system, but with malicious intent.
    *   **Compromised User Account:** The attacker has gained access to a legitimate user's account through phishing, password guessing, or other means.
    *   **Remote Access (with limitations):** The attacker has gained remote access, perhaps through a vulnerable service, but is limited to a low-privilege user account.

2.  **Reconnaissance:** The attacker, knowing about `hub`, checks for the existence of the `~/.config/hub` file.  They might use commands like:
    ```bash
    ls -l ~/.config/hub
    ```

3.  **Exploitation:** If the file exists and the permissions are insecure (e.g., `-rw-r--r--`), the attacker can read the file's contents:
    ```bash
    cat ~/.config/hub
    ```
    The attacker now has the GitHub API token.

4.  **Post-Exploitation:** The attacker can use the stolen token to access the victim's GitHub account.  Depending on the token's scope, the attacker could:
    *   Read private repositories.
    *   Modify code in private repositories.
    *   Create/delete repositories.
    *   Access other GitHub services associated with the account.
    *   Potentially use the token to pivot to other systems if the token is reused or has excessive permissions.

### 2.3 Impact Assessment

*   **Confidentiality:**  **High.**  The attacker gains access to the victim's GitHub API token, which is a highly sensitive credential.
*   **Integrity:**  **High.**  The attacker can potentially modify code, configurations, and other data within the victim's GitHub repositories.
*   **Availability:**  **Medium to High.**  The attacker could delete repositories or disrupt the victim's development workflow.  The attacker could also lock the user out of their account by changing the password or enabling 2FA.
*   **Overall Impact:** **Critical.**  This vulnerability can lead to complete compromise of the victim's GitHub account and potentially other connected systems.

### 2.4 Likelihood Assessment

*   **Attacker Motivation:**  **Medium to High.**  GitHub accounts are valuable targets for attackers seeking source code, intellectual property, or access to infrastructure.
*   **Skill Level:**  **Novice.**  Reading a file with insecure permissions requires minimal technical skill.
*   **System Configuration:**  **Variable.**  The likelihood depends on whether the user has manually changed the permissions or if `hub` itself has created the file with insecure permissions.  Default installations of `hub` *should* create the file with secure permissions, but this is not guaranteed.
*   **Overall Likelihood:**  **High.**  Given the low skill level required and the potential for high impact, this vulnerability is highly likely to be exploited if it exists.

### 2.5 Mitigation Strategies

*   **For `hub` Developers:**
    *   **Secure File Creation:**  Ensure that `~/.config/hub` is *always* created with `0600` permissions (owner read/write only).  Use secure file creation APIs that explicitly set permissions.
    *   **Permission Check:**  Implement a check within `hub` to detect insecure permissions on the configuration file.  If insecure permissions are found, warn the user prominently and provide instructions on how to fix them.  Consider refusing to operate until the permissions are corrected.
    *   **Documentation:**  Clearly document the security implications of insecure file permissions and the recommended configuration.
    *   **Consider Encryption:** Explore encrypting the token at rest within the configuration file, using a key derived from the user's password or another secure mechanism. This adds a layer of defense even if file permissions are compromised.

*   **For Users:**
    *   **Manual Permission Setting:**  Immediately after installing `hub`, run the following command:
        ```bash
        chmod 600 ~/.config/hub
        ```
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Periodically check the permissions of sensitive files, including `~/.config/hub`.
    *   **Use a Password Manager:** Store your GitHub API token in a secure password manager instead of relying solely on the `hub` configuration file.  This is a more general security best practice.

*   **For System Administrators:**
    *   **Security Audits:**  Include checks for insecure file permissions in regular security audits.
    *   **User Education:**  Educate users about the importance of secure file permissions and how to set them correctly.
    *   **Automated Remediation:**  Consider using configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Puppet, Chef) to enforce secure file permissions on sensitive files across multiple systems.

### 2.6 Detection Methods

*   **Manual Inspection:**
    ```bash
    ls -l ~/.config/hub
    ```
    Look for permissions that are *not* `-rw-------`.

*   **Automated Scripting:**  A simple Bash script can check the permissions:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    if [[ $(stat -c '%a' ~/.config/hub) != "600" ]]; then
      echo "WARNING: Insecure permissions on ~/.config/hub"
    fi
    ```

*   **Security Scanners:**  Security scanning tools (e.g., Lynis, OpenSCAP) can be configured to detect insecure file permissions.

### 2.7 Tooling

*   **Exploitation:**
    *   `cat`:  To read the file contents.
    *   `curl` or `hub` itself:  To use the stolen token to interact with the GitHub API.

*   **Detection:**
    *   `ls -l`:  To view file permissions.
    *   `stat`:  To get detailed file information, including permissions in octal format.
    *   `find`:  To search for files with specific permissions.
    *   Lynis, OpenSCAP:  Security auditing tools.

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   `chmod`:  To change file permissions.
    *   Configuration management tools (Ansible, Puppet, Chef).
