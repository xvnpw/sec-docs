# Attack Surface Analysis for mislav/hub

## Attack Surface: [Credential Compromise (via `hub` Storage/Handling)](./attack_surfaces/credential_compromise__via__hub__storagehandling_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to GitHub authentication tokens *specifically due to how `hub` stores or handles them*. This excludes general credential theft from the user's system, focusing on `hub`'s specific role.
*   **How `hub` Contributes:** `hub` stores tokens locally (e.g., `~/.config/hub`) to avoid repeated authentication prompts. The security of this storage is crucial.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in `hub`'s code that allows them to read the contents of `~/.config/hub` even with restricted file permissions, or a flaw in how `hub` handles tokens in memory exposes them to other processes.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Full control over the user's GitHub account (depending on token scope).
    *   Ability to read, write, and delete repositories, modify issues/PRs, access private data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if the token has broad scopes) or High (if the token has limited scopes).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **User:**
        *   Regularly update `hub` to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Use *secure credential storage mechanisms* appropriate for the operating system (e.g., OS-specific keychains, encrypted storage).
        *   *Minimize the time tokens are held in memory*.
        *   Implement robust error handling to prevent accidental token leakage in logs or error messages.
        *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the credential handling code.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Execution of arbitrary shell commands through `hub` due to insufficient input sanitization *within `hub`'s code*.
*   **How `hub` Contributes:** `hub` takes user-provided input and uses it in shell commands when interacting with `git` or constructing API calls. This is the core vulnerability point.
*   **Example:** A malicious user crafts a branch name containing shell metacharacters (e.g., `"; rm -rf /;"`) that are not properly escaped by `hub` when constructing a `git` command, leading to command execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary code execution on the user's system.
    *   Potential for complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **User:**
        *   Regularly update `hub` to the latest version.
    *   **Developer:**
        *   *Rigorously sanitize* all user-provided input before using it in *any* shell command or API call. Use a combination of whitelisting (preferred), escaping, and quoting.
        *   Avoid using direct shell command execution whenever possible. Use libraries that provide safer interfaces to `git` and the GitHub API.
        *   Conduct thorough security code reviews and penetration testing, specifically focusing on input handling.
        *   Implement static analysis tools to automatically detect potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Data Manipulation (via `hub` Commands)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_data_manipulation__via__hub__commands_.md)

*   **Description:** Using `hub`'s commands to perform unauthorized actions on GitHub repositories *due to flaws in `hub`'s implementation or logic*. This is distinct from simply having a compromised token; it focuses on `hub`'s role in enabling the malicious actions.
*   **How `hub` Contributes:** `hub` provides a simplified interface for performing actions on GitHub. A vulnerability in `hub` could allow an attacker to bypass intended restrictions or perform actions in an unintended way.
*   **Example:** A bug in `hub`'s pull request creation logic allows an attacker to bypass branch protection rules and merge a pull request without the required reviews, *even if the attacker has a valid token but lacks the necessary permissions on GitHub itself*.  This is a `hub`-specific flaw, not just a compromised token.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Introduction of malicious code into repositories.
    *   Data loss or corruption.
    *   Disruption of development workflows.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **User:**
        *   Regularly update `hub` to the latest version.
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Thoroughly test all `hub` commands, especially those related to potentially destructive actions (e.g., force-pushing, deleting branches/repositories).
        *   Ensure that `hub` *correctly enforces* GitHub's permissions and branch protection rules.  `hub` should not be able to bypass these restrictions.
        *   Implement robust error handling and input validation to prevent unexpected behavior.
        *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Attack Surface: [`git` Configuration Manipulation (by `hub`)](./attack_surfaces/_git__configuration_manipulation__by__hub__.md)

*   **Description:** `hub` modifying the user's `git` configuration in a *malicious or unintended way*, leading to credential leaks or altered `git` behavior *due to flaws in `hub`*.
*   **How `hub` Contributes:** `hub` interacts with and can modify the user's `git` configuration. A vulnerability in `hub` could lead to malicious modifications.
*   **Example:** A compromised version of `hub`, or a version with a critical bug, modifies the user's `git` configuration to use a malicious credential helper that steals credentials, *without the user's knowledge or consent*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Credential theft.
    *   Redirection of `git` operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **User:**
        *   Regularly update `hub` to the latest version.
    * **Developer:**
        *   *Minimize* the changes `hub` makes to the user's `git` configuration.
        *   *Thoroughly test* any code that modifies the `git` configuration.
        *   Provide clear and transparent documentation about any configuration changes made by `hub`.
        *   Use secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities that could allow malicious configuration modifications.
