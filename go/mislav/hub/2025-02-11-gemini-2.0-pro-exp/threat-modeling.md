# Threat Model Analysis for mislav/hub

## Threat: [Credential Theft from Configuration File](./threats/credential_theft_from_configuration_file.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with local access (through malware, physical access, or a compromised user account) reads the `hub` configuration file (typically `~/.config/hub` on Linux/macOS, or a similar location on Windows) to obtain the stored GitHub API token (OAuth or PAT). The attacker could use a simple file read operation or a more sophisticated malware technique to extract the token.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over the victim's GitHub account, including access to all repositories (public and private, depending on token scope), ability to create/delete repositories, modify code, manage issues/pull requests, and potentially access other connected services.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration file storage mechanism (`~/.config/hub` or equivalent). Specifically, the YAML parsing and storage logic within `hub` that handles the `github.com` host configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use a Secure Credential Manager:** Configure `hub` to use the operating system's credential manager (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or a compatible secrets service). This is the recommended approach.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables (e.g., `GITHUB_TOKEN`) to temporarily provide the token to `hub` without storing it persistently. This is suitable for scripts and CI/CD.
    *   **Token Rotation:** Regularly rotate GitHub API tokens to limit the impact of a potential compromise.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Use tokens with the minimum necessary scope.  Avoid using tokens with full `repo` access unless absolutely required.
    *   **File Permissions:** Ensure the `~/.config/hub` file (and its parent directories) have restrictive permissions (e.g., `chmod 600 ~/.config/hub`).  This is a basic security practice but is often overlooked.

## Threat: [Dependency Hijacking (Malicious Dependency)](./threats/dependency_hijacking__malicious_dependency_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency of `hub` (e.g., a Go library it uses) and publishes a malicious version. When a developer updates `hub` or its dependencies, the malicious code is executed.
*   **Impact:**  The attacker could gain arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine, potentially stealing the GitHub API token, accessing local files, or performing other malicious actions.
*   **Affected Component:**  The dependency management system used by `hub` (Go modules) and any of the external libraries that `hub` imports.  This is not a specific *code* component within `hub`, but rather its external dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `hub` and its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
    *   **Dependency Verification:** Use a package manager that verifies the integrity of downloaded packages (Go modules do this with checksums).
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., `go list -m -u all`, or dedicated tools like Snyk, Dependabot) to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **SBOM:** Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track all dependencies and their versions.

## Threat: [Exploitation of a `hub` Vulnerability](./threats/exploitation_of_a__hub__vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability in the `hub` codebase itself (e.g., a buffer overflow, command injection, or logic flaw).
*   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution and token theft.
*   **Affected Component:**  Potentially any part of the `hub` codebase, depending on the vulnerability. This could be in the command parsing logic, API interaction code, or configuration handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep `hub` Updated:**  Install the latest version of `hub` promptly to receive security patches.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:**  Follow the `hub` project's security advisories and announcements (e.g., on GitHub, mailing lists, or security blogs).
    *   **Contribute to Security:** If you discover a vulnerability, report it responsibly to the `hub` maintainers.
