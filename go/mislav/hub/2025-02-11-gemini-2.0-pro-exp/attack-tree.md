## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise GitHub API Token [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_github_api_token__critical_.md)

*   This is the primary objective for most attackers, as the API token grants access to GitHub resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit 'hub' Configuration File Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_'hub'_configuration_file_vulnerabilities__high-risk_.md)

*   This attack path focuses on weaknesses related to how `hub` stores the API token.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Insecure File Permissions on ~/.config/hub [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_insecure_file_permissions_on_~_confighub__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** `hub` stores the GitHub API token in `~/.config/hub`. If this file has overly permissive permissions (e.g., world-readable), any user on the system (or potentially remote attackers with some level of access) can read the token.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High (complete token compromise)
*   **Effort:** Very Low (reading a file)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires auditing file permissions)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   `hub`: Ensure secure file permissions (`0600`) are set upon creation. Warn users if insecure permissions are detected.
    *   Users: Manually set secure permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.config/hub`.
    *   Application Developers: Document security implications and recommend secure configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3 Environment Variable Hijacking (e.g., HUB_CONFIG) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_environment_variable_hijacking__e_g___hub_config___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** If `hub` uses the `HUB_CONFIG` environment variable to determine the configuration file location, an attacker could set this variable to point to a malicious file they control.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (requires some control over the environment)
*   **Impact:** High (token compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low (setting an environment variable)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires monitoring environment variables)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   `hub`: Sanitize or validate `HUB_CONFIG` before use. Consider disallowing it or providing a warning.
    *   Application Developers: Avoid setting `HUB_CONFIG` in untrusted environments.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Social Engineering / Phishing [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_social_engineering__phishing__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers trick the user into revealing their GitHub API token or installing a compromised version of `hub`. This could involve fake login pages, phishing emails, or malicious websites.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (token compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (depends on user awareness)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   User Education: Train users to recognize phishing attempts and verify the authenticity of websites and software.
    *   2FA: Encourage the use of two-factor authentication on GitHub.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4 Exploit 'hub' Command Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_exploit_'hub'_command_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This attack path focuses on injecting malicious code through `hub` commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4.1 Improper Input Sanitization in 'hub' Commands [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_1_improper_input_sanitization_in_'hub'_commands__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** If `hub` doesn't properly sanitize user-provided input before passing it to the shell or the GitHub API, an attacker could craft malicious input that executes arbitrary commands or manipulates API calls.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (but critical if present)
*   **Impact:** Very High (potential for arbitrary code execution)
*   **Effort:** High (requires finding and exploiting a specific vulnerability)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires code analysis and dynamic analysis)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   `hub`: Thoroughly sanitize all user input. Use parameterized API calls. Perform rigorous security testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Repositories (Assuming Token Compromise or Direct Access) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_repositories__assuming_token_compromise_or_direct_access___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Once an attacker has the GitHub API token, they can use `hub` (or the API directly) to manipulate repositories the user has access to. This includes injecting code, deleting branches, modifying settings, etc.
*   **Likelihood:** High (given token compromise)
*   **Impact:** High (potential for data loss, code compromise, disruption)
*   **Effort:** Low (using `hub` commands)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies (Easier with branch protection and audit logs)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   GitHub: Use branch protection rules, require pull request reviews, enable 2FA.
    *   Users: Use strong passwords, enable 2FA, be cautious about granting access.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Leverage 'hub' for Lateral Movement [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__leverage_'hub'_for_lateral_movement__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** A compromised token can be used to access other GitHub resources beyond the initially targeted repository.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Access Other Repositories [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_access_other_repositories__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses the compromised token to access other repositories the user has access to, potentially escalating the impact of the compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** High (given token compromise)
*   **Impact:** Very High (widespread compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium/Hard (requires monitoring API usage)
*   **Mitigation:** Principle of least privilege, regular access reviews.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Access Other GitHub Resources (e.g., Organizations) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_access_other_github_resources__e_g___organizations___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses the compromised token to access other GitHub resources associated with the user or their organizations, such as organization settings, teams, or other applications.
*   **Likelihood:** High (given token compromise)
*   **Impact:** Very High (widespread compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium/Hard (requires monitoring API usage)
*   **Mitigation:** Principle of least privilege, regular access reviews.
