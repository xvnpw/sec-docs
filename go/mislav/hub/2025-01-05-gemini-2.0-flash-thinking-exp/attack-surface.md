# Attack Surface Analysis for mislav/hub

## Attack Surface: [Stolen GitHub Credentials](./attack_surfaces/stolen_github_credentials.md)

* **Attack Surface: Stolen GitHub Credentials**
    * **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the GitHub credentials used by `hub`.
    * **How Hub Contributes:** `hub` requires GitHub credentials (personal access tokens or OAuth tokens) to interact with the GitHub API. If these are compromised, the attacker can impersonate the application's GitHub interactions via `hub`.
    * **Example:** A developer accidentally commits a file containing the GitHub personal access token used by `hub` to a public repository. An attacker finds this token and uses it to make unauthorized changes to the application's repositories using `hub`.
    * **Impact:**  Unauthorized code changes, data breaches in repositories, creation of malicious pull requests, deletion of resources, potential compromise of other services using the same credentials.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Store GitHub credentials securely using environment variables, dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or platform-specific secure storage mechanisms.
            * Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application code or configuration files.
            * Implement proper access control and least privilege principles for the GitHub account used by `hub`.
            * Regularly rotate GitHub API tokens.
        * **Users:**
            * Be cautious about sharing or exposing any credentials used by the application.
            * Report any suspicious activity related to the application's GitHub interactions.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on GitHub API Interactions](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_github_api_interactions.md)

* **Attack Surface: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on GitHub API Interactions**
    * **Description:** Attackers intercept communication between `hub` and the GitHub API to eavesdrop or manipulate data.
    * **How Hub Contributes:** `hub` makes requests to the GitHub API. If these requests are not made over secure HTTPS connections, they are vulnerable to interception.
    * **Example:** An attacker on a shared Wi-Fi network intercepts the API request made by `hub` to create a new issue on GitHub, potentially reading sensitive information or altering the issue details.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data (including credentials if not properly handled), manipulation of data sent to GitHub, injection of malicious data into the application's workflow.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Ensure the application and `hub` are configured to enforce HTTPS for all GitHub API interactions.
            * Verify the SSL/TLS certificates of the GitHub API endpoints.
            * Consider using certificate pinning for enhanced security.
        * **Users:**
            * Avoid using the application on untrusted networks.
            * Ensure their system's root certificates are up-to-date.

## Attack Surface: [Local Git Repository Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/local_git_repository_manipulation.md)

* **Attack Surface: Local Git Repository Manipulation**
    * **Description:** Attackers gain access to the local Git repository used by the application and manipulate it to influence `hub`'s behavior.
    * **How Hub Contributes:** `hub` operates on the local Git repository. If an attacker can modify the repository's configuration or files, they can indirectly control `hub`'s actions.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the server running the application and modifies the `.git/config` file to change the remote repository URL to a malicious one. When `hub` is used to push changes, it sends them to the attacker's repository.
    * **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code, data exfiltration, disruption of the application's workflow, potential compromise of the build or deployment process.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Implement strong access controls on the server and file system where the Git repository is stored.
            * Regularly monitor the integrity of the Git repository.
            * Use secure coding practices to prevent local file manipulation vulnerabilities in the application itself.
        * **Users:**
            * Ensure the system running the application is secure and protected from unauthorized access.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Manipulation Affecting `hub`](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_manipulation_affecting__hub_.md)

* **Attack Surface: Configuration File Manipulation Affecting `hub`**
    * **Description:** Attackers modify `hub`'s configuration files to alter its behavior for malicious purposes.
    * **How Hub Contributes:** `hub` reads configuration from files like `.gitconfig`. If an attacker can modify these files, they can influence how `hub` interacts with Git and GitHub.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies the `.gitconfig` file to set a malicious editor. When `hub` tries to open an editor (e.g., for writing a commit message), the malicious editor executes arbitrary code.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, credential theft (if the malicious configuration targets authentication), redirection of Git operations to attacker-controlled servers.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Restrict write access to `hub`'s configuration files.
            * Implement checks to validate the integrity of configuration files before `hub` uses them.
        * **Users:**
            * Protect their user account and file system from unauthorized access.
            * Be cautious about running scripts or commands from untrusted sources that might modify configuration files.

## Attack Surface: [Environment Variable Manipulation Affecting `hub`](./attack_surfaces/environment_variable_manipulation_affecting__hub_.md)

* **Attack Surface: Environment Variable Manipulation Affecting `hub`**
    * **Description:** Attackers manipulate environment variables that `hub` relies on for configuration or authentication.
    * **How Hub Contributes:** `hub` might use environment variables for settings like API tokens or GitHub organization names. If these are compromised, `hub`'s behavior can be manipulated.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the server and sets a malicious `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. When the application uses `hub`, it will authenticate with GitHub using the attacker's token.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to GitHub resources, impersonation of the application's GitHub actions, potential data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Sanitize and validate environment variables used by `hub`.
            * Implement strict access controls on the server to prevent unauthorized modification of environment variables.
            * Prefer secure storage mechanisms over relying solely on environment variables for sensitive information.
        * **Users:**
            * Ensure their system is secure and protected from unauthorized access that could lead to environment variable manipulation.
