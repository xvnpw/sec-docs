# Threat Model Analysis for mislav/hub

## Threat: [Exposed GitHub API Token](./threats/exposed_github_api_token.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the GitHub API token used by `hub`. This could happen through various means, such as accessing insecurely stored environment variables, configuration files, or application memory. The attacker might then use this token to impersonate the application and perform unauthorized actions on the GitHub repository *via `hub` or directly using the token*.

**Impact:** The attacker could modify code, create or delete repositories, access private information, manage issues and pull requests maliciously, or even compromise the entire GitHub organization if the token has broad permissions.

**Affected Component:** `hub`'s authentication mechanism, specifically how it retrieves and uses the GitHub API token. This affects the `api` module or functions responsible for making authenticated requests to GitHub.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store GitHub API tokens securely using dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
*   Avoid storing tokens in environment variables directly. If necessary, ensure proper isolation and access controls.
*   Grant the API token the least privilege necessary for the application's intended interactions with GitHub *through `hub`*.
*   Regularly rotate API tokens.
*   Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious API activity.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Input](./threats/command_injection_via_unsanitized_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious commands into the arguments passed to the `hub` executable by exploiting insufficient input sanitization in the application. This could involve manipulating user input or exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application constructs `hub` commands. The attacker might then execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application *by leveraging the application's invocation of `hub`*.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service. The attacker could also manipulate the GitHub repository if the `hub` command is crafted to do so.

**Affected Component:** The application's code that constructs and executes `hub` commands using functions like `subprocess.run` (Python), `exec` (JavaScript), or similar system call mechanisms. This directly affects the way the application interacts with the `hub` executable.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid constructing `hub` commands dynamically from user-provided input whenever possible.
*   If dynamic command construction is necessary, use robust input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent command injection. Use allow-lists of acceptable characters and escape or quote untrusted input.
*   Consider using libraries or wrappers that provide safer ways to interact with Git and GitHub APIs, rather than directly invoking `hub`.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `hub` Dependency](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in__hub__dependency.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits known security vulnerabilities within the `hub` tool itself. This could involve crafting specific inputs or exploiting weaknesses in `hub`'s code to achieve malicious goals *when the application invokes `hub`*.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, information disclosure, denial of service, or manipulation of Git/GitHub operations.

**Affected Component:** Various modules and functions within the `hub` codebase, depending on the specific vulnerability. This could range from command parsing logic to network communication handling *within `hub`*.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `hub` updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Monitor security advisories for `hub` and its dependencies.
*   Implement dependency scanning and management practices in the development pipeline to identify and address vulnerable versions of `hub`.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Repository Access via `hub` Configuration](./threats/unauthorized_repository_access_via__hub__configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the application's environment or configuration where `hub` is configured, potentially revealing credentials or configurations that allow them to access GitHub repositories that the application should not have access to *through `hub`*.

**Impact:** The attacker could gain unauthorized access to private code, intellectual property, or sensitive data stored in the GitHub repositories *by using the compromised `hub` configuration*. They could also potentially modify the repository content or settings.

**Affected Component:** `hub`'s configuration loading mechanism, which reads credentials and settings from files or environment variables.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the application's environment and configuration files with appropriate access controls.
*   Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in configuration files. Prefer using secure secrets management.
*   Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to the credentials used by `hub`.
