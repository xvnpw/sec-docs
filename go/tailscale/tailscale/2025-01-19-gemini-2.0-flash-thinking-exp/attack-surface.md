# Attack Surface Analysis for tailscale/tailscale

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Tailscale Account](./attack_surfaces/compromised_tailscale_account.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Tailscale account used by the application's nodes.

**How Tailscale Contributes:** Tailscale's account system is the central authentication and authorization mechanism for the network. Compromise grants control over network membership.

**Example:** An attacker obtains the credentials for the Tailscale account used by the application's server through phishing or credential stuffing.

**Impact:** The attacker could add malicious devices to the network, remove legitimate devices, or reconfigure network settings, potentially granting them access to the application or its data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on Tailscale accounts.
* Use strong, unique passwords for Tailscale accounts.
* Regularly review authorized devices and remove any unrecognized entries.
* Monitor Tailscale account activity for suspicious logins or changes.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Tailscale Authentication Keys/Tokens](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_tailscale_authentication_keystokens.md)

**Description:** The application stores Tailscale authentication keys or tokens insecurely, making them accessible to attackers.

**How Tailscale Contributes:** Tailscale relies on these keys for node identification and authentication. Insecure storage bypasses Tailscale's intended security.

**Example:** The Tailscale API key is hardcoded in the application's source code or stored in a plain text configuration file accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact:** An attacker could use the stolen keys to impersonate legitimate nodes, gaining unauthorized access to the application and its resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid storing Tailscale API keys or authentication tokens directly in code or configuration files.
* Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and manage sensitive credentials.
* Encrypt sensitive data at rest.
* Implement proper access controls to restrict access to configuration files and secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in the Tailscale Client Library](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_the_tailscale_client_library.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a security vulnerability within the Tailscale client library used by the application.

**How Tailscale Contributes:** The application's reliance on the Tailscale client library introduces the risk of vulnerabilities within that library.

**Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific version of the Tailscale client library allows for remote code execution if a specially crafted message is received.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, an attacker could potentially gain control of the application's host, escalate privileges, or disrupt the application's functionality.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if remote code execution is possible), High (for other significant vulnerabilities)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the Tailscale client library to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Subscribe to Tailscale's security advisories and monitor for announcements of new vulnerabilities.
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent the application from processing potentially malicious data intended to exploit client vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Tailscale Funnel Feature](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_tailscale_funnel_feature.md)

**Description:** The application uses Tailscale Funnel to expose services publicly, and this feature is misconfigured or the application itself has vulnerabilities.

**How Tailscale Contributes:** Tailscale Funnel creates a publicly accessible endpoint, expanding the attack surface beyond the private Tailscale network.

**Example:** An application exposed via Tailscale Funnel has an unpatched vulnerability that allows for remote code execution when accessed through the public URL.

**Impact:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the application directly from the public internet, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or complete compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly audit and secure any application services exposed via Tailscale Funnel.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for Funnel-exposed services.
* Regularly update the application and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of Funnel endpoints for added protection.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Tailscale Subnet Routes](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_tailscale_subnet_routes.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configured Tailscale subnet routes grant unintended access to internal networks or resources.

**How Tailscale Contributes:** Tailscale's subnet routing feature, if misconfigured, can bridge the Tailscale network with other networks, potentially exposing them.

**Example:** A subnet route is configured to allow access to an entire internal network segment when only a specific service should be accessible. An attacker on the Tailscale network could then access other systems on the internal network.

**Impact:** Attackers on the Tailscale network could pivot to other internal networks, gaining access to sensitive resources beyond the intended scope of the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully plan and configure subnet routes, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
* Regularly review and audit subnet route configurations.
* Implement network segmentation and firewalls within the internal network to limit the impact of a potential breach.
