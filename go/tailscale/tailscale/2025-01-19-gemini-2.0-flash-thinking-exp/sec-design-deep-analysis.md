    *   **Tailored Recommendation:** Utilize secure key exchange mechanisms facilitated by the control plane. Ensure the integrity of peer information received from the control plane.
    *   **Tailored Mitigation:** The `tailscale/tailscale`'s control plane is responsible for secure key exchange. Verify the implementation details.
*   **Data Transmission (Peer-to-Peer and Relayed):**
    *   **Security Implication:** Lack of encryption would expose data in transit.
    *   **Tailored Recommendation:** Rely on the end-to-end encryption provided by WireGuard.
    *   **Tailored Mitigation:** Ensure WireGuard is correctly configured and enabled for all connections.
    *   **Security Implication (Relayed):**  While encrypted, reliance on potentially untrusted DERP servers raises concerns about metadata exposure or potential future vulnerabilities.
