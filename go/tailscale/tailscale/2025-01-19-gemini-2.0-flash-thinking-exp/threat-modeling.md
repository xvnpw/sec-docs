# Threat Model Analysis for tailscale/tailscale

## Threat: [Compromised Tailscale Account](./threats/compromised_tailscale_account.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Tailscale account used to manage the application's nodes. This could be achieved through credential phishing, password reuse, or a breach of the email account associated with the Tailscale account. The attacker might then use the Tailscale admin panel or API to manipulate the network.

**Impact:** The attacker could add malicious nodes to the network, remove legitimate nodes, modify network settings (like ACLs or subnet routes), potentially gaining access to internal resources or disrupting application functionality. They could also access logs and metadata about the network.

**Affected Component:** Tailscale Control Plane (account management).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong, unique passwords for the Tailscale account.
*   Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the Tailscale account.
*   Restrict access to the Tailscale admin panel to authorized personnel only.
*   Regularly review account activity and audit logs.
*   Use API keys with restricted permissions for programmatic access.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Node Joining](./threats/unauthorized_node_joining.md)

**Description:** An attacker manages to add a device to the application's Tailscale network without proper authorization. This could happen if pre-authentication keys are leaked, the node joining process is insecure, or if there's a vulnerability in the Tailscale client software. The attacker's node would then be part of the trusted network.

**Impact:** The unauthorized node could be used to access internal services and data, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized modifications. It could also be used as a launchpad for attacks against other nodes within the network.

**Affected Component:** Tailscale Client (node authentication), Tailscale Control Plane (node authorization).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Securely manage and distribute pre-authentication keys (if used).
*   Utilize short-lived pre-authentication keys.
*   Implement device authorization policies and review new node additions.
*   Monitor for unexpected devices joining the network.
*   Ensure all nodes are running the latest, patched version of the Tailscale client.

## Threat: [Key Re-use or Weak Key Management](./threats/key_re-use_or_weak_key_management.md)

**Description:** Authentication keys or other secrets used for Tailscale are reused across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) or are stored insecurely (e.g., hardcoded in code, stored in plain text). If one key is compromised, multiple environments could be affected.

**Impact:** A single key compromise could grant an attacker access to multiple parts of the infrastructure, significantly increasing the attack surface.

**Affected Component:** Tailscale Client (key storage), potentially the Tailscale Control Plane if keys are managed there.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Generate unique keys for each environment and purpose.
*   Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and manage sensitive keys.
*   Avoid hardcoding keys in application code or configuration files.
*   Implement key rotation policies.

## Threat: [Leaked or Stolen Auth Keys](./threats/leaked_or_stolen_auth_keys.md)

**Description:** Pre-authentication keys or other secrets used to join the Tailscale network are accidentally leaked (e.g., committed to a public repository, shared insecurely) or stolen by an attacker.

**Impact:** Unauthorized individuals can use these keys to add their own devices to the Tailscale network, gaining unauthorized access to internal resources.

**Affected Component:** Tailscale Client (authentication process).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Treat pre-authentication keys as highly sensitive secrets.
*   Avoid storing them in version control systems.
*   Use secure methods for distributing these keys.
*   Implement short expiry times for pre-authentication keys.
*   Regularly rotate pre-authentication keys.

## Threat: [Exit Node Misconfiguration or Compromise](./threats/exit_node_misconfiguration_or_compromise.md)

**Description:** If the application uses a Tailscale exit node to route traffic to the internet, a misconfigured or compromised exit node could expose traffic or allow for interception. A compromised node could be under the attacker's control.

**Impact:** Traffic routed through a compromised exit node could be intercepted, modified, or logged by the attacker. This could lead to data breaches or man-in-the-middle attacks if HTTPS is not used for external communication. The compromised node could also be used to launch attacks against external targets, potentially being attributed to the application's network.

**Affected Component:** Tailscale Exit Nodes, Tailscale Client (exit node configuration).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully configure exit nodes and restrict their usage.
*   Ensure the exit node is a hardened and trusted system.
*   Enforce HTTPS for all external communication, regardless of the exit node.
*   Monitor traffic passing through the exit node for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the Tailscale Client](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_tailscale_client.md)

**Description:** Exploitable vulnerabilities might exist in the Tailscale client software running on application servers or developer machines. An attacker could leverage these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the affected system, allowing the attacker to steal data, disrupt services, or pivot to other systems.

**Affected Component:** Tailscale Client (various modules and functions).

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the severity of the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Tailscale client software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Monitor Tailscale's security advisories for known vulnerabilities.
*   Implement host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) to detect potential exploitation attempts.

## Threat: [Inadequate Patching and Updates](./threats/inadequate_patching_and_updates.md)

**Description:** Failure to keep the Tailscale client software up-to-date can leave the application vulnerable to known exploits that have been patched in newer versions.

**Impact:** Attackers could exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated Tailscale clients to gain unauthorized access or compromise systems.

**Affected Component:** Tailscale Client (all components).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Establish a process for regularly updating the Tailscale client software on all nodes.
*   Subscribe to Tailscale's security advisories and release notes.
*   Consider using automated update mechanisms where appropriate.
