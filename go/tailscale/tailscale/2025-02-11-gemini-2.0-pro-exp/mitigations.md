# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tailscale/tailscale

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict, Granular ACLs with "Deny All" Default](./mitigation_strategies/strict__granular_acls_with_deny_all_default.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Start with "Deny All":** Begin the Tailscale ACL configuration with a rule that denies all traffic by default. This ensures that no communication is allowed unless explicitly permitted.
    2.  **Identify Specific Communication Needs:** Analyze the application's architecture and identify *precisely* which nodes need to communicate with each other and on which ports.  Document these requirements thoroughly.
    3.  **Create Specific Allow Rules:** For each identified communication need, create a highly specific ACL rule.  Use the most restrictive criteria possible:
        *   **Source:** Specify individual users (e.g., `user:alice@example.com`) or, if necessary, narrowly defined tags (e.g., `tag:prod-webserver-01`). Avoid broad tags like `tag:servers`.
        *   **Destination:** Specify individual nodes (e.g., `node:database-server-01`) or narrowly defined tags.
        *   **Ports:** Specify the exact TCP/UDP ports required (e.g., `tcp:8080`, `udp:53`). Avoid wildcards (`*:*`) unless absolutely necessary and well-justified.
        *   **Protocol:** If possible, specify the protocol (TCP or UDP).
    4.  **Regular Review and Audit:** Schedule regular reviews (e.g., monthly, quarterly) of the ACLs.  Use automated scripts to check for overly permissive rules, unused tags, or deviations from the documented communication requirements.
    5.  **Version Control:** Store the ACL configuration in a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and facilitate rollbacks if necessary.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users or nodes from accessing services.  A compromised node key or misconfigured service won't grant broad access.
    *   **Accidental Network Exposure (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unintentionally exposing services to the wider internet or unintended parts of the Tailscale network.
    *   **Lateral Movement (High Severity):** Limits the ability of an attacker who compromises one node to move laterally and access other resources on the network.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduction: High.  Significantly reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Accidental Network Exposure:** Risk reduction: Medium.  Minimizes the impact of configuration errors.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Risk reduction: High.  Contains the blast radius of a compromise.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in `network/acl.json`. Basic ACLs exist, but they are not fully "deny all" and use some broad tags.
    *   Version control of `acl.json` is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Full "deny all" default is not yet implemented.
    *   More granular rules based on individual users and nodes are needed.  Transition away from broad tags is required.
    *   Automated ACL auditing is not yet implemented.
    *   Documentation of specific communication needs is incomplete.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Node Key Management and Rotation](./mitigation_strategies/robust_node_key_management_and_rotation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Short-Lived Auth Keys:** For ephemeral nodes (e.g., short-lived containers, CI/CD runners), use Tailscale's ephemeral node feature or generate short-lived auth keys via the API.  Set the key expiry to the minimum necessary duration.
    2.  **Automated Key Rotation:** Implement a system to automatically rotate node keys for long-lived nodes.  The frequency should be determined based on risk assessment (e.g., monthly, quarterly).  This can be achieved using scripting and the Tailscale API.
    3.  **Secure Key Storage:** Store node keys *outside* of the application code and configuration files. Use a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).  Ensure the secrets manager itself is properly secured.
    4.  **Automated Revocation:** Implement a process to automatically revoke node keys when a node is decommissioned or if a compromise is suspected.  This should be integrated with the node lifecycle management system.  Use the Tailscale API for revocation.
    5.  **Audit Logging:** Enable audit logging for key generation, rotation, and revocation events within Tailscale (if available) and within your secrets manager. Monitor these logs for suspicious activity.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised Node Keys (High Severity):** Limits the impact of a compromised key.  An attacker's access is time-limited.
    *   **Key Reuse (Medium Severity):** Prevents the accidental or malicious reuse of old keys on new nodes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised Node Keys:** Risk reduction: High.  Significantly reduces the window of opportunity for an attacker.
    *   **Key Reuse:** Risk reduction: Medium.  Enforces good key hygiene.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic key storage in a secrets manager is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated key rotation is not implemented.
    *   Use of short-lived auth keys for ephemeral nodes is not consistent.
    *   Automated key revocation is not fully integrated with node lifecycle management.
    *   Comprehensive audit logging for key management is not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strict Tagging Discipline](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strict_tagging_discipline.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Documented Tagging Policy:** Create a clear, concise, and well-documented tagging policy *specifically for Tailscale tags*.  This policy should define:
        *   Allowed tag prefixes (e.g., `prod-`, `dev-`, `staging-`).
        *   Naming conventions for tags (e.g., lowercase, hyphen-separated).
        *   The purpose and security implications of each tag *within the Tailscale ACL context*.
        *   Prohibited tags (e.g., overly broad tags like `all`, `servers`).
    2.  **Tagging Enforcement:** Implement mechanisms to enforce the tagging policy.  This could involve:
        *   Code reviews to ensure that new nodes are tagged correctly *when joining the Tailscale network*.
        *   Automated scripts that use the Tailscale API to scan for and report on non-compliant tags.
        *   Integration with infrastructure-as-code tools to enforce tagging at deployment time *when configuring Tailscale*.
    3.  **Regular Tag Audits:** Conduct regular audits of the tags in use *within Tailscale* to identify and remediate any deviations from the policy. Use the Tailscale API for this.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Overly Permissive ACLs (Medium Severity):** Prevents the creation of ACLs that grant excessive access due to poorly defined tags.
    *   **Misconfigured ACLs (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of errors in ACL configuration by providing a clear and consistent tagging scheme.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Overly Permissive ACLs:** Risk reduction: Medium.  Improves the clarity and maintainability of ACLs.
    *   **Misconfigured ACLs:** Risk reduction: Medium.  Reduces the likelihood of human error.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   A basic tagging convention exists, but it is not formally documented or enforced.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A comprehensive, documented tagging policy is missing.
    *   Automated tag enforcement mechanisms are not in place.
    *   Regular tag audits are not performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor Tailscale Status and Security Advisories](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_tailscale_status_and_security_advisories.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Subscribe to Notifications:** Subscribe to Tailscale's status page (status.tailscale.com) and security advisories (via email or RSS feed).
    2.  **Automated Monitoring:** Integrate Tailscale status monitoring into the application's existing monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog).  Set up alerts for any reported outages or performance issues *related to Tailscale*.
    3.  **Incident Response Plan:** Develop a plan to respond to Tailscale outages or security incidents.  This plan should include:
        *   Communication procedures.
        *   Fallback mechanisms (if applicable, and *specifically addressing the loss of Tailscale connectivity*).
        *   Steps to assess and mitigate the impact on the application *due to Tailscale issues*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Tailscale Infrastructure Compromise (Low Probability, High Impact):** Provides early warning of potential issues, allowing for proactive mitigation.
    *   **Tailscale Service Outages (Medium Probability, Medium Impact):** Enables timely response to outages and minimizes disruption to the application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Tailscale Infrastructure Compromise:** Risk reduction: Low (primarily provides early warning).
    *   **Tailscale Service Outages:** Risk reduction: Medium.  Improves resilience and reduces downtime.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Manual monitoring of the status page is performed occasionally.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated monitoring and alerting are not integrated with the existing monitoring system.
    *   A formal incident response plan for Tailscale-specific issues is not fully developed.
    *   Subscription to security advisories is not formalized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Tailscale LocalAPI](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_tailscale_localapi.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Identify LocalAPI Usage:** Determine if and how the application interacts with the Tailscale LocalAPI. Document all interactions.
    2. **Restrict Access:** If the LocalAPI is used, ensure that access is *strictly* limited to authorized components of the application.
    3. **Authentication:** Implement strong authentication for any access to the LocalAPI. This might involve using API keys, tokens, or other authentication mechanisms *provided by or compatible with Tailscale*.
    4. **Authorization:** Implement fine-grained authorization to control which actions can be performed via the LocalAPI *based on Tailscale's capabilities*.
    5. **Input Validation:** If the application accepts any input that is passed to the LocalAPI, rigorously validate and sanitize this input to prevent injection attacks *targeting the Tailscale client*.
    6. **Auditing:** Log all interactions with the LocalAPI, including successful and failed attempts.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Unauthorized LocalAPI Access (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from manipulating the Tailscale client configuration.
    * **Injection Attacks (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious commands into the Tailscale LocalAPI.

* **Impact:**
     * **Unauthorized LocalAPI Access:** Risk Reduction: High.
     * **Injection Attacks :** Risk Reduction: Medium.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Not applicable. The application does not currently use the Tailscale LocalAPI.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * If LocalAPI usage is introduced in the future, all of the above steps will need to be implemented.
