# Attack Surface Analysis for tailscale/tailscale

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Tailscale Control Server](./attack_surfaces/compromised_tailscale_control_server.md)

*   **1. Compromised Tailscale Control Server**

    *   **Description:**  A breach of Tailscale's central coordination server (the "control plane"). This is the most severe, but also least likely, scenario.
    *   **How Tailscale Contributes:** Tailscale's architecture fundamentally relies on a central control server for node discovery, key exchange, and ACL management. This is inherent to its operation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains administrative access to Tailscale's infrastructure, allowing them to inject malicious nodes or modify ACLs.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete network compromise.
        *   Ability to inject malicious nodes.
        *   Ability to modify access rules (ACLs).
        *   Potential for widespread data breaches.
        *   Network disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Independent Authentication & Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms *within the application itself*, independent of Tailscale. Don't rely *solely* on Tailscale for access control. This mitigates the impact of a control server compromise by requiring a separate, independent authentication layer.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits that include a review of how Tailscale is integrated and used, looking for ways a control server compromise could be exploited.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised User Tailscale Account](./attack_surfaces/compromised_user_tailscale_account.md)

*   **2. Compromised User Tailscale Account**

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a legitimate user's Tailscale account credentials.
    *   **How Tailscale Contributes:** Tailscale uses user accounts (often linked to SSO providers) to authenticate and authorize nodes. This is a core part of Tailscale's access control mechanism.
    *   **Example:** An attacker phishes a user's Google account credentials, which are also used for Tailscale access.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to resources the compromised user has access to.
        *   Potential for lateral movement within the network.
        *   Data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for *all* Tailscale accounts, ideally using a strong MFA method (e.g., hardware security keys, authenticator apps). This is a direct mitigation against compromised credentials.
        *   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies for Tailscale accounts (and the underlying SSO provider).
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (ACLs):**  Strictly limit user permissions within Tailscale ACLs to the absolute minimum required. This is a *Tailscale-specific* mitigation.
        *   **Regular Access Reviews:**  Periodically review user access and permissions *within Tailscale* to ensure they are still appropriate. This is a *Tailscale-specific* mitigation.
        *   **Session Management (within Tailscale):** If Tailscale offers session management features (e.g., forcing re-authentication after a period), utilize them.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Node (Device Running Tailscale Client)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_node__device_running_tailscale_client_.md)

*   **3. Compromised Node (Device Running Tailscale Client)**

    *   **Description:** A device running the Tailscale client is compromised (e.g., through malware or an OS vulnerability).
    *   **How Tailscale Contributes:** Tailscale extends the network to each connected device, making each device a potential entry point *into the Tailscale network*.
    *   **Example:** A user's laptop, running the Tailscale client, is infected with malware that grants the attacker remote access.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Access to resources accessible from the compromised node *via Tailscale*.
        *   Potential for lateral movement to other nodes *on the Tailscale network*.
        *   Data breaches.
        *   Use of the compromised node as a launchpad for further attacks *within the Tailscale network*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Network Segmentation (via ACLs):** Use Tailscale ACLs to segment the network and limit the "blast radius" of a compromised node.  Isolate critical resources. This is a *Tailscale-specific* mitigation.
        *   **Least Privilege (ACLs):**  Restrict the compromised node's access *within Tailscale* to only the resources it absolutely needs. This is a *Tailscale-specific* mitigation.
        * **Device Posture Checks (Future):** Utilize Tailscale's future device posture checking capabilities (when available) to restrict access based on device security status. This is a *Tailscale-specific* mitigation.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured or Overly Permissive ACLs](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_or_overly_permissive_acls.md)

*   **4. Misconfigured or Overly Permissive ACLs**

    *   **Description:**  Tailscale Access Control Lists (ACLs) are incorrectly configured, granting users or nodes more access than intended.
    *   **How Tailscale Contributes:** Tailscale *relies entirely* on ACLs to define network access policies. This is the core mechanism for controlling access within a Tailscale network.
    *   **Example:** An ACL is accidentally configured to allow all users access to a sensitive database server.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
        *   Increased attack surface.
        *   Data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design ACLs with the principle of least privilege in mind. Grant only the minimum necessary access. This is a fundamental best practice for *using* Tailscale ACLs.
        *   **Regular ACL Audits:**  Periodically review and audit ACLs to ensure they are correct, up-to-date, and enforce the intended security policies. This is a direct mitigation related to *Tailscale's ACL system*.
        *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test ACL changes in a staging environment *before* deploying them to production. This is specific to managing *Tailscale ACLs*.
        *   **Use of Tags and Groups:**  Leverage Tailscale's tags and groups to simplify ACL management and reduce the risk of errors. This is a best practice for *using Tailscale's features*.
        *   **Documentation:** Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation of ACL policies.
