# Threat Model Analysis for tailscale/tailscale

## Threat: [Unauthorized Device Enrollment](./threats/unauthorized_device_enrollment.md)

* **Description:** An attacker obtains valid Tailscale credentials or exploits enrollment process vulnerabilities to enroll an unauthorized device into your Tailscale network. This device can then access internal services.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal services and data, potential data exfiltration, lateral movement, and service disruption.
* **Tailscale Component Affected:** Enrollment process, Tailscale client, Control Plane (account management).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all Tailscale accounts.
    * Securely manage and rotate enrollment keys if used, limiting their validity.
    * Implement device authorization policies using Tailscale ACLs.
    * Regularly audit enrolled devices and revoke unauthorized access.
    * Monitor enrollment activity for anomalies.

## Threat: [Compromised Tailscale Account](./threats/compromised_tailscale_account.md)

* **Description:** An attacker compromises a legitimate Tailscale user account (especially admin accounts) through phishing, credential stuffing, or malware.
* **Impact:** Full control over the Tailscale network (if admin account), significant unauthorized access, data exfiltration, service disruption, and configuration changes.
* **Tailscale Component Affected:** Tailscale Accounts, Control Plane (account management and ACLs).
* **Risk Severity:** Critical (if admin account), High (if regular user account with critical access).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Enforce strong password policies and MFA for all Tailscale accounts.
    * Implement the principle of least privilege for Tailscale account permissions.
    * Provide security awareness training to users about phishing and password security.
    * Implement account activity monitoring and alerting for suspicious logins.
    * Regularly audit user permissions and account activity.

## Threat: [ACL Bypass or Misconfiguration](./threats/acl_bypass_or_misconfiguration.md)

* **Description:** Incorrectly configured Tailscale Access Control Lists (ACLs) grant unintended access between devices or services, allowing attackers to bypass intended restrictions.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to services and data, potential lateral movement and data breaches.
* **Tailscale Component Affected:** ACL Engine, Control Plane (ACL configuration).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Thoroughly review and test Tailscale ACLs before deployment.
    * Implement a "deny by default" approach in ACLs.
    * Use version control for ACL configurations and track changes.
    * Regularly audit and review ACLs for correctness and necessity.
    * Utilize Tailscale's ACL testing tools to verify intended access control.

## Threat: [Traffic Interception within the Tailscale Network (Internal Compromise)](./threats/traffic_interception_within_the_tailscale_network__internal_compromise_.md)

* **Description:** If a device within your Tailscale network is compromised, an attacker could potentially intercept and decrypt traffic between other devices on the same network, even though Tailscale uses WireGuard encryption.
* **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted within the Tailscale network, data exfiltration, manipulation, or eavesdropping.
* **Tailscale Component Affected:** WireGuard tunnel, Tailscale client on compromised device.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement robust endpoint security measures on all devices within the Tailscale network (EDR, patching, etc.).
    * Enforce strong device security policies and regularly audit device configurations.
    * Implement end-to-end encryption at the application layer for sensitive data.
    * Use network segmentation within Tailscale using tags and ACLs to limit lateral movement.

## Threat: [Tailscale Service Outage](./threats/tailscale_service_outage.md)

* **Description:**  A Tailscale service outage disrupts communication between your application components that rely on Tailscale for networking.
* **Impact:** Application downtime and service disruption, loss of availability.
* **Tailscale Component Affected:** Tailscale Control Plane, DERP relays, entire Tailscale infrastructure.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Understand Tailscale's Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and uptime history.
    * Implement monitoring and alerting for Tailscale connectivity issues.
    * Design application to be resilient to temporary network disruptions and consider fallback mechanisms.
    * Consider redundancy in Tailscale setup where possible.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the Tailscale Client Software](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_tailscale_client_software.md)

* **Description:** Security vulnerabilities in the Tailscale client software could be exploited to compromise the device running the client, leading to arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation.
* **Impact:** Device compromise, potential lateral movement, application disruption, data breaches.
* **Tailscale Component Affected:** Tailscale client software (various modules).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Keep Tailscale clients updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * Subscribe to Tailscale's security advisories and promptly apply updates.
    * Implement endpoint security measures on devices running Tailscale clients.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Tailscale Features](./threats/misconfiguration_of_tailscale_features.md)

* **Description:** Incorrectly configuring Tailscale features like subnet routers, exit nodes, or MagicDNS can introduce security vulnerabilities or unintended network exposure.
* **Impact:** Security breaches, unintended network exposure, network instability, application malfunctions, data leaks.
* **Tailscale Component Affected:** Subnet Router, Exit Node, MagicDNS, ACL Engine (configuration related to these features).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Thoroughly understand the implications of each Tailscale feature before enabling it.
    * Follow Tailscale's best practices and documentation for configuration.
    * Test configurations in a non-production environment before deploying to production.
    * Use infrastructure-as-code to manage Tailscale configurations.
    * Regularly review and audit Tailscale configurations.

## Threat: [Unintended Exposure of Services via Tailscale](./threats/unintended_exposure_of_services_via_tailscale.md)

* **Description:** Accidentally exposing services or ports through Tailscale that were not intended to be accessible, due to misconfiguration or misunderstanding of network exposure.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to services, potential security breaches, exploitation of vulnerable services.
* **Tailscale Component Affected:** ACL Engine, Tailscale client (service exposure configuration).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Regularly review and audit exposed services and ports within the Tailscale network.
    * Use network scanning tools to verify intended network exposure.
    * Implement the principle of least privilege - only expose necessary services and ports.
    * Document all intentionally exposed services and their access controls.
