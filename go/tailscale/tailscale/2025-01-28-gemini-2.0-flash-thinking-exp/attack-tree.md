## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Tailscale](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__compromise_application_via_tailscale.md)

*   **Description:** This is the root goal.  Success means the attacker has achieved unauthorized access to the application's resources by exploiting Tailscale.
*   **Why High Risk:**  Represents the ultimate failure from a security perspective.
*   **Mitigation:** All subsequent mitigations aim to prevent reaching this root goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HIGH RISK PATH] Route Traffic Outside of Intended Tailscale Network](./attack_tree_paths/2___high_risk_path__route_traffic_outside_of_intended_tailscale_network.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations in Tailscale exit nodes or subnet routers to route traffic in unintended ways, potentially exposing internal networks or data to external networks or vice versa.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Improperly Configured Exit Node Allows Unintended External Access:**  An exit node is set up incorrectly, allowing traffic that should be confined to the Tailscale network to leak out to the public internet or other unintended networks.
    *   **Subnet Router Misconfiguration Exposes Internal Network to External Networks:** A subnet router is misconfigured, bridging the Tailscale network with an internal network in a way that exposes the internal network to unauthorized access from the Tailscale network or potentially even the internet if the Tailscale network is connected to it.
*   **Why High Risk:** Relatively easy to misconfigure, can lead to significant data exposure and broader network compromise.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Strict Configuration Management:** Implement rigorous processes for configuring exit nodes and subnet routers, including peer reviews and testing.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only configure exit nodes and subnet routers when absolutely necessary and with the most restrictive settings possible.
    *   **Regular Configuration Audits:** Periodically review Tailscale configurations to identify and correct any misconfigurations.
    *   **Network Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic patterns for unexpected routing or traffic leaving the intended Tailscale network boundaries.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [HIGH RISK PATH] Compromise Tailscale User Account](./attack_tree_paths/3___high_risk_path__compromise_tailscale_user_account.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers compromise a legitimate Tailscale user account to gain access to the Tailscale network and potentially the application resources.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Credential Phishing for Tailscale Account (Google, Microsoft, etc.):**  Attackers use phishing techniques to trick users into revealing their credentials for their identity provider accounts (used for Tailscale authentication).
*   **Why High Risk:** Phishing is a common and effective attack vector, relying on user behavior rather than technical vulnerabilities.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all Tailscale user accounts at the identity provider level.
    *   **User Security Awareness Training:**  Conduct regular training to educate users about phishing attacks, how to recognize them, and best practices for password security.
    *   **Phishing Detection Tools:** Implement email and web filtering tools to detect and block phishing attempts.
    *   **Account Monitoring:** Monitor user account login activity for suspicious patterns or logins from unusual locations.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [CRITICAL NODE] Bypass Tailscale ACLs (Access Control Lists)](./attack_tree_paths/4___critical_node__bypass_tailscale_acls__access_control_lists_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass Tailscale's Access Control Lists to gain unauthorized access to resources within the Tailscale network, even if they have a legitimate Tailscale account or compromised a node.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Misconfiguration of Tailscale ACLs:**
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Overly Permissive ACL Rules:** ACL rules are configured too broadly, granting access to resources that should be restricted.
*   **Why High Risk:** ACLs are the primary authorization mechanism in Tailscale. Bypassing them defeats a core security control. Misconfiguration is a common source of ACL bypass.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in ACLs:** Design ACLs with the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary access to each user or group.
    *   **Regular ACL Review and Audits:** Periodically review and audit ACL rules to ensure they are still appropriate, correctly implemented, and not overly permissive.
    *   **Testing and Validation of ACLs:** Thoroughly test ACL configurations to ensure they enforce the intended access controls and do not have unintended bypasses.
    *   **Centralized ACL Management:** Use Tailscale's centralized ACL management features to maintain consistency and control over access policies.
    *   **Logging and Monitoring of ACL Enforcement:** Implement logging and monitoring of ACL enforcement to detect potential bypass attempts or unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Tailscale Integration with Application](./attack_tree_paths/5___high_risk_path__exploit_tailscale_integration_with_application.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities arising from how the application is integrated with Tailscale, often due to misconfigurations or exposing unintended services.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Misconfiguration of Application to Expose Unintended Services via Tailscale:**
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Exposing Debug Interfaces or Admin Panels on Tailscale Network:** Debug interfaces, administrative panels, or other sensitive services that should not be publicly accessible are inadvertently exposed on the Tailscale network.
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Running Vulnerable Services on Tailscale Network without Proper Security Hardening:** Vulnerable services (e.g., older versions of software, services with known vulnerabilities) are run on the Tailscale network without proper security hardening, making them exploitable by attackers who gain access to the Tailscale network.
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Application Logic Vulnerabilities Exposed via Tailscale Network Access:** Vulnerabilities in the application's code that were previously not easily reachable from the public internet become exploitable because Tailscale provides network connectivity to previously internal or protected parts of the application (e.g., internal APIs, backend services).
*   **Why High Risk:** Misconfigurations and application-level vulnerabilities are common, and Tailscale can inadvertently expand the attack surface if integration is not carefully considered.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Application Services:** Only expose necessary application services on the Tailscale network and restrict access using ACLs.
    *   **Security Hardening of Application Services:**  Thoroughly harden all services running on the Tailscale network, including patching vulnerabilities, disabling unnecessary features, and implementing strong authentication and authorization within the application itself.
    *   **Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing of the application and its integration with Tailscale, focusing on services exposed on the Tailscale network and application logic vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secure Development Practices:** Follow secure development practices to minimize application logic vulnerabilities, especially in areas that become accessible via the Tailscale network.
    *   **Configuration Reviews:** Regularly review application configurations to ensure that debug interfaces, admin panels, and other sensitive services are not unintentionally exposed on the Tailscale network.
