## DEPLOYMENT

- Deployment Architecture Options:
  - Option 1: Cloud-based deployment (Tailscale managed cloud). This is the primary and recommended deployment model where Tailscale manages the Auth & Control Plane, DERP relays, and Update Servers in their cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure). Users only need to deploy the Tailscale client on their devices.
  - Option 2: Self-hosted deployment (Headscale). For users who require more control or have specific compliance needs, Tailscale offers Headscale, an open-source implementation of the Tailscale control server. Users can deploy and manage Headscale on their own infrastructure. DERP relays and Update Servers are still typically managed by Tailscale or can be self-hosted with more effort.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Securely connecting users and devices to private networks.
  - Authenticating and authorizing users and devices.
  - Managing network configurations and access control policies.
  - Providing reliable and performant VPN service.
  - Distributing software updates securely.
  - Protecting user data and privacy.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - User credentials (hashed passwords, API keys): Highly sensitive, confidentiality and integrity are critical.
  - Cryptographic keys (WireGuard keys, etc.): Highly sensitive, confidentiality and integrity are critical.
  - Network configuration data (ACLs, device lists): Sensitive, confidentiality and integrity are important.
  - User activity logs (connection logs, etc.): Moderately sensitive, confidentiality and integrity are important for auditing and troubleshooting.
  - Personal information (email addresses, usernames): Moderately sensitive, confidentiality is important for privacy.
  - Source code: Sensitive, confidentiality and integrity are important to prevent unauthorized modifications and intellectual property theft.
  - Build artifacts: Sensitive, integrity and authenticity are critical to prevent supply chain attacks.
