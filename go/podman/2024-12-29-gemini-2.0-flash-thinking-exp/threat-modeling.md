### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Podman

*   **Threat:** Malicious Base Image Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a public or private container registry and injects a malicious base image with backdoors or malware. When the application pulls this image using `podman pull`, the malicious code is deployed. The attacker might gain initial access to the container environment, potentially escalating privileges or exfiltrating data.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the application and potentially the host system. Data breach, service disruption, and reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Podman Component:** `podman pull`, Podman Image Storage
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only use base images from trusted and verified sources.
        *   Implement image signing and verification using tools like `skopeo`.
        *   Regularly scan base images for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy or Clair before deployment.
        *   Maintain a private registry with strict access controls.

*   **Threat:** Container Escape via Kernel Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the host kernel that is accessible from within a container managed by Podman. This allows them to break out of the container's isolation and gain direct access to the host operating system. They could then compromise the host, access sensitive data, or disrupt other containers.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the host system, potentially affecting all applications and data on the host.
    *   **Affected Podman Component:** Container Runtime (used by Podman, leveraging the host kernel)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the host operating system and kernel updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Utilize security features like SELinux or AppArmor to further restrict container capabilities.
        *   Consider using rootless Podman to reduce the attack surface on the host kernel.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Podman Socket
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Podman socket (usually `/run/user/$UID/podman/podman.sock` or `/var/run/podman/podman.sock`). This allows them to directly interact with the Podman daemon and perform actions like creating, starting, stopping, or deleting containers, potentially disrupting services or gaining access to container data.
    *   **Impact:**  Control over containers, potential data access or deletion, service disruption.
    *   **Affected Podman Component:** Podman Daemon, Podman API
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to the Podman socket using file system permissions.
        *   Use SSH tunnels or other secure methods for remote access to the Podman API.
        *   Consider using rootless Podman, which isolates the socket to the user's namespace.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Container Registry Credentials
    *   **Description:**  An attacker gains access to credentials used by Podman to authenticate with a private container registry. This allows them to push malicious images or pull sensitive images, potentially compromising the application deployment pipeline.
    *   **Impact:**  Deployment of malicious code, unauthorized access to private images.
    *   **Affected Podman Component:** `podman login`, Image Pull/Push operations
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store and manage container registry credentials. Avoid embedding them directly in code.
        *   Use credential management tools or secrets management systems.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication for registry access.
        *   Regularly rotate registry credentials.
