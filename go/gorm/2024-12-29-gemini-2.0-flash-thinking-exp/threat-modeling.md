*   **Threat:** SQL Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries by manipulating input that is directly incorporated into GORM's query building mechanisms (e.g., using `DB.Raw()` or dynamically building `Where` clauses). This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands against the database.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches (accessing sensitive data), data modification or deletion, potential for command execution on the database server, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected GORM Component:**
        *   `gorm.DB.Raw()`: Executing raw SQL queries.
        *   `gorm.DB.Exec()`: Executing raw SQL commands.
        *   Dynamic query construction using methods like `Where`, `Not`, `Or`, `Having`, `Joins` when user input is directly embedded without proper sanitization or parameterization.
        *   Custom GORM callbacks that involve dynamic SQL construction.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries:** Utilize GORM's built-in support for parameterized queries when dealing with user input in `Where` clauses, `Updates`, etc.
        *   **Avoid `gorm.DB.Raw()` and `gorm.DB.Exec()` with user-controlled input:** If raw SQL is necessary, carefully sanitize and validate all user-provided data before incorporating it.
        *   **Use GORM's query builders securely:** Ensure that user input used in `Where`, `Not`, `Or`, `Having`, and `Joins` clauses is properly sanitized or passed as arguments for parameterization.

*   **Threat:** Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate request parameters to modify model fields that were not intended to be user-editable during create or update operations. This can lead to unauthorized changes in data, privilege escalation, or bypassing business logic.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized modification of user roles or permissions, bypassing security checks, and potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected GORM Component:**
        *   GORM's model binding mechanism during `Create` and `Update` operations.
        *   Potentially affected by the use of `struct` tags for field binding.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use `Select` or `Omit`:** Explicitly define which fields are allowed for mass assignment during create and update operations using GORM's `Select` or `Omit` methods.
        *   **Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):** Create separate structs for receiving user input and map only the allowed fields to the GORM model.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Custom Callbacks
    *   **Description:** Developers can define custom callbacks in GORM to execute logic before or after database operations. If these callbacks are not implemented securely, they can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution, data manipulation, or bypassing security checks depending on the logic implemented in the callback.
    *   **Affected GORM Component:**
        *   GORM's callback mechanism (`BeforeCreate`, `AfterCreate`, `BeforeUpdate`, etc.).
        *   The specific logic implemented within the custom callbacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the callback logic)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Securely implement custom callback logic:**  Avoid executing untrusted input or performing insecure operations within callbacks.
        *   **Follow secure coding practices:** Apply principles like input validation, output encoding, and least privilege within callback functions.
        *   **Regularly review custom callbacks:** Ensure that custom callbacks are still necessary and are implemented securely.
