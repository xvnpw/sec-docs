## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Password Policies -> Gain access to privileged Gitea account](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_password_policies_-_gain_access_to_privileged_gitea_account.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage weak or default passwords on privileged Gitea accounts (e.g., administrators). This can be achieved through brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or obtaining leaked credentials.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Successful compromise of a privileged account grants extensive control over Gitea, allowing for malicious code injection, data manipulation, and potentially compromising the entire application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs in Gitea) -> Gain unauthorized access to Gitea](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_bypass_vulnerabilities__e_g___cves_in_gitea__-_gain_unauthorized_access_to_gi_0e5caf49.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in Gitea's authentication mechanisms to bypass login procedures and gain unauthorized access to the platform.
    * **Why High-Risk:** This provides an initial foothold for attackers, allowing them to explore the system, access sensitive information, and potentially escalate privileges or inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Pull Request -> Social Engineering Maintainers -> Get malicious PR merged into a critical branch](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_pull_request_-_social_engineering_maintainers_-_get_malicious_pr_merged_in_91c38038.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers create malicious pull requests containing vulnerabilities or backdoors and use social engineering tactics to convince maintainers to merge them into critical branches of the repository.
    * **Why High-Risk:** This directly introduces malicious code into the application's codebase, potentially leading to widespread compromise when the code is deployed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Pull Request -> Exploit Lack of Code Review/Automated Checks -> Introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_pull_request_-_exploit_lack_of_code_reviewautomated_checks_-_introduce_vul_c744fd55.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers submit pull requests with malicious code, relying on the absence of thorough code reviews or automated security checks to slip the code into the main codebase.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Similar to the previous point, this injects malicious code directly into the application, bypassing security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Gitea Actions (CI/CD) Functionality -> Inject Malicious Code into Workflow Definitions -> Execute arbitrary code on the Gitea server or connected infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gitea_actions__cicd__functionality_-_inject_malicious_code_into_workflow_definitions_-_execu_d303a406.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers compromise Gitea accounts or exploit vulnerabilities to modify CI/CD workflow definitions, inserting malicious commands that execute during the build or deployment process.
    * **Why High-Risk:** This allows for arbitrary code execution on the Gitea server or connected infrastructure, potentially leading to complete server compromise or deployment of malicious application versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Gitea Actions (CI/CD) Functionality -> Exploit Secrets Management Vulnerabilities -> Access sensitive credentials used in CI/CD pipelines](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gitea_actions__cicd__functionality_-_exploit_secrets_management_vulnerabilities_-_access_sen_d00363f4.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in how Gitea Actions manages secrets (e.g., insecure storage, improper access controls) to gain access to sensitive credentials used in the CI/CD pipeline.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Compromised CI/CD secrets can be used to access other systems, deploy malicious code, or further compromise the application and its infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Gitea Actions (CI/CD) Functionality -> Tamper with Workflow Execution -> Modify build artifacts or deploy malicious code](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gitea_actions__cicd__functionality_-_tamper_with_workflow_execution_-_modify_build_artifacts_d97736cc.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate the CI/CD workflow execution process to alter build artifacts or deploy malicious code, even if the original codebase is secure.
    * **Why High-Risk:** This allows for the deployment of compromised application versions without directly modifying the source code, making it harder to detect.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Gitea Configuration/Deployment Weaknesses -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Gitea Dependencies -> Outdated Libraries with Known Vulnerabilities -> Exploit vulnerabilities in underlying libraries used by Gitea](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gitea_configurationdeployment_weaknesses_-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_gitea_dependencies_-_o_b3887644.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers target known vulnerabilities in outdated libraries used by Gitea. If Gitea's dependencies are not regularly updated, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain control of the Gitea server.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Exploiting dependency vulnerabilities can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Gitea server, granting the attacker significant control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks via Gitea -> Compromise Gitea Instance Itself -> Exploit vulnerabilities in Gitea infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks_via_gitea_-_compromise_gitea_instance_itself_-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_gitea_42489b52.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers directly target the infrastructure hosting the Gitea instance, exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system, network configurations, or other services to gain control of the server.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Compromising the Gitea instance provides complete control over all hosted repositories and data, allowing for widespread malicious code injection and data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks via Gitea -> Compromise a Gitea Administrator Account -> Inject malicious code or modify repositories with high privileges](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks_via_gitea_-_compromise_a_gitea_administrator_account_-_inject_malicious_code_or_1eba194c.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers compromise a Gitea administrator account through various means (e.g., phishing, credential theft, exploiting vulnerabilities).
    * **Why High-Risk:** A compromised administrator account allows for direct and unrestricted manipulation of repositories, including injecting malicious code, altering commit history, and compromising the integrity of the entire codebase.
