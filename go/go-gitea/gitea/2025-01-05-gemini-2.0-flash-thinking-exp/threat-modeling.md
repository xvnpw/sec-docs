# Threat Model Analysis for go-gitea/gitea

## Threat: [Weak Password Policies and Brute-Force Attacks](./threats/weak_password_policies_and_brute-force_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to user accounts by trying various password combinations. This can be automated using scripting tools. If Gitea's *configured* password policies are weak (e.g., short minimum length, no complexity requirements) or if Gitea's *built-in* rate limiting is insufficient, the attacker has a higher chance of success.
    *   **Impact:** Successful account compromise allows the attacker to access private repositories, modify code, create malicious commits, and potentially gain control over the entire Gitea instance depending on the compromised user's permissions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gitea's authentication module, specifically the user login functionality and password storage mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure strong password policies within Gitea's settings (minimum length, complexity requirements, prevent common passwords).
        *   Ensure Gitea's rate limiting on login attempts is enabled and appropriately configured.
        *   Encourage or enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) within Gitea.
        *   Regularly monitor Gitea's logs for suspicious login attempts.

## Threat: [Session Hijacking](./threats/session_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Gitea's *own* session management to intercept or steal a valid user session ID. This could be due to flaws in Gitea's cookie handling, session storage mechanisms, or lack of proper HTTPS enforcement *within Gitea's configuration*. With the stolen session ID, the attacker can impersonate the legitimate user without needing their credentials.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker gains full access to the compromised user's Gitea account and its associated privileges, potentially leading to data breaches, code manipulation, or unauthorized actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gitea's session management module, including cookie handling and session storage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS for all Gitea communication within Gitea's configuration.
        *   Ensure Gitea's session cookies are configured with secure attributes (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`).
        *   Configure Gitea to regularly regenerate session IDs.
        *   Keep Gitea updated to patch any known session management vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure API Key Management](./threats/insecure_api_key_management.md)

*   **Description:** Gitea API keys, used for programmatic access, are stored or transmitted insecurely due to *Gitea's default behavior or lack of secure configuration options*. This could involve storing keys in plaintext in Gitea's configuration files or exposing them through Gitea's API or logs if not configured carefully. An attacker who gains access to these keys can bypass normal authentication and interact with the Gitea API with the privileges associated with that key.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Gitea API allows attackers to perform actions like creating/deleting repositories, modifying code, managing users, and potentially disrupting the entire Gitea instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gitea's API authentication and authorization mechanisms, configuration management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing API keys directly in Gitea's configuration files. Utilize environment variables or secure vault solutions.
        *   Implement proper access control and least privilege principles for API keys within Gitea's settings.
        *   Regularly rotate API keys within Gitea.
        *   Secure access to the Gitea server's filesystem to prevent unauthorized access to configuration files.

## Threat: [Introduction of Malicious Code through Unreviewed Pull Requests (Gitea's Role)](./threats/introduction_of_malicious_code_through_unreviewed_pull_requests__gitea's_role_.md)

*   **Description:** While code review is a general practice, Gitea's *lack of robust built-in mechanisms to enforce or facilitate thorough code review* can contribute to this threat. If Gitea doesn't offer features to easily identify risky changes or integrate with automated security scanning tools, malicious code might be merged more easily.
    *   **Impact:** The introduction of malicious code can lead to various negative consequences, including application vulnerabilities, data breaches, supply chain attacks, and reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gitea's pull request and merge request functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Gitea's features for requiring approvals before merging pull requests.
        *   Integrate Gitea with external code review tools and static analysis security testing (SAST) tools.
        *   Implement clear guidelines and training for developers on secure coding practices and code review processes *within the context of using Gitea*.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within Gitea](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_gitea.md)

*   **Description:** A user with limited privileges exploits a vulnerability *within Gitea's code* in its authorization mechanisms to gain access to resources or perform actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges (e.g., administrators).
    *   **Impact:** Successful privilege escalation can allow attackers to bypass access controls, modify critical settings, access sensitive data managed by Gitea, or even take control of the entire Gitea instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gitea's authorization and permission management system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly review and audit Gitea's access control configurations.
        *   Apply security patches promptly to address known privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Gitea.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning user roles and permissions within Gitea.
        *   Implement thorough testing of Gitea's authorization logic when deploying or upgrading.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities in Gitea](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerabilities_in_gitea.md)

*   **Description:** Critical vulnerabilities *within Gitea's codebase* could potentially allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Gitea instance. This could be through exploiting flaws in how Gitea handles user input, processes Git commands, or interacts with the underlying operating system.
    *   **Impact:** Successful RCE allows an attacker to gain complete control over the Gitea server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and the ability to pivot to other systems on the network.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various core components of Gitea, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Gitea updated to the latest stable version to patch known RCE vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization throughout Gitea's codebase (if contributing to Gitea development).
        *   Follow secure coding practices to prevent the introduction of RCE vulnerabilities.
        *   Restrict access to the Gitea server and its resources.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Gitea's Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_gitea's_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Gitea relies on various third-party libraries and components. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, attackers could exploit them *through Gitea's usage of those libraries* to compromise the Gitea instance.
    *   **Impact:** Exploitation of dependency vulnerabilities can lead to various issues, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service *affecting the Gitea instance*.
    *   **Affected Component:** All components of Gitea that rely on vulnerable third-party libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability (can be Critical).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Gitea and its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Gitea's dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Gitea and its dependencies.
        *   Consider using dependency management tools that provide vulnerability information and facilitate updates.
