## Deep Dive Threat Analysis: Weak Password Policies and Brute-Force Attacks on Gitea

**Introduction:**

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Weak Password Policies and Brute-Force Attacks" threat identified within the threat model for our application utilizing Gitea. As cybersecurity experts, our goal is to provide the development team with a comprehensive understanding of this threat, its potential impact, and actionable mitigation strategies. We will delve into the technical aspects, Gitea-specific considerations, and best practices to effectively address this risk.

**1. Deeper Understanding of the Threat:**

The core of this threat lies in the attacker's ability to repeatedly attempt to log in to user accounts using various password combinations. This is often automated through scripting tools, making it a persistent and potentially high-volume attack. The success of such attacks hinges on two primary factors:

* **Weak Password Policies:** If Gitea is configured with lax password requirements (e.g., short minimum length, no requirement for special characters, uppercase/lowercase letters, or numbers), attackers can significantly reduce the search space for potential passwords. Common and easily guessable passwords become viable targets.
* **Insufficient Rate Limiting:**  Even with stronger password policies, a lack of effective rate limiting allows attackers to make numerous login attempts in a short period. Without proper controls, they can exhaust the password space over time, eventually gaining access to accounts.

**Attacker Motivation and Goals:**

The attacker's motivation behind a brute-force attack on a Gitea instance can vary, but common goals include:

* **Accessing Private Repositories:** This is a primary objective, allowing attackers to steal sensitive source code, intellectual property, and potentially secrets like API keys or database credentials embedded within the code.
* **Modifying Code and Introducing Malicious Commits:** Once inside, attackers can subtly alter code, introduce backdoors, or inject malicious dependencies. This can have severe consequences for the application's security and integrity.
* **Gaining Control Over the Gitea Instance:** Depending on the compromised user's permissions (especially if it's an administrator account), the attacker could gain complete control over the Gitea instance, potentially locking out legitimate users, deleting repositories, or even compromising the underlying server.
* **Data Exfiltration:**  Beyond code, attackers might target other data stored within Gitea, such as issue tracking information, wikis, or user details.
* **Using the Compromised Account as a Pivot Point:** A compromised Gitea account could be used as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the organization's network.

**2. Technical Analysis of the Attack:**

* **Brute-Force Techniques:**
    * **Dictionary Attacks:** Attackers use lists of common passwords and variations.
    * **Rainbow Table Attacks:** Pre-computed hashes of common passwords are used to quickly identify matching passwords. While Gitea uses salting to mitigate this, weak password policies increase the likelihood of finding matches.
    * **Hybrid Attacks:** Combinations of dictionary words, numbers, and special characters are tried.
    * **Credential Stuffing:** Attackers use lists of usernames and passwords obtained from previous data breaches on other platforms, hoping users reuse credentials.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Gitea's Login Form (Web Interface):** The most common entry point. Attackers can automate submissions to the login form.
    * **Gitea's API Endpoints (Authentication):**  Attackers might target API endpoints used for authentication, potentially bypassing some web interface protections if not properly secured.
    * **SSH Access (If Enabled):** If SSH access is enabled for Git operations, attackers might attempt to brute-force SSH keys or passwords.

* **Gitea's Authentication Process (Simplified):**
    1. User submits username and password.
    2. Gitea retrieves the user's stored password hash and salt.
    3. Gitea hashes the submitted password using the retrieved salt.
    4. Gitea compares the generated hash with the stored hash.
    5. If the hashes match, authentication is successful.

    **Vulnerabilities at this stage:**
    * **Weak Hashing Algorithm:** While Gitea uses robust hashing algorithms (like bcrypt), older versions or misconfigurations could potentially use weaker algorithms.
    * **Lack of Salting or Weak Salts:**  Salts are random values added to the password before hashing, making rainbow table attacks more difficult. Weak or absent salts significantly reduce the security of the hashing process.

**3. Gitea-Specific Considerations:**

* **Password Policy Configuration:** Gitea allows administrators to configure password policies through the `app.ini` configuration file or the administrative web interface. Key settings include:
    * `MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH`:  Sets the minimum number of characters required.
    * `PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY`:  Can enforce requirements for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
    * `PREVENT_USERNAMES_AS_PASSWORDS`:  Helps prevent users from using their username as their password.
    * `PREVENT_COMMON_PASSWORDS`:  Blocks the use of commonly used and easily guessable passwords.

    **Failure to configure these settings adequately leaves Gitea vulnerable.**

* **Rate Limiting:** Gitea implements rate limiting on login attempts to mitigate brute-force attacks. This can be configured in `app.ini` with settings like:
    * `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`:  The maximum number of failed login attempts allowed within a specific timeframe.
    * `LOGIN_THROTTLE_TIME`: The duration for which a user is locked out after exceeding the maximum login attempts.

    **Insufficiently configured rate limiting allows attackers to make more attempts before being blocked.**

* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Gitea supports MFA, adding an extra layer of security beyond just a password. This significantly reduces the risk of successful brute-force attacks, even if passwords are weak.

* **Password Storage:** Gitea uses secure password hashing algorithms (like bcrypt) with unique salts for each user. This is a crucial security measure to protect passwords even if the database is compromised.

* **Logging and Monitoring:** Gitea logs login attempts, including failed attempts. Regularly monitoring these logs is crucial for detecting suspicious activity and potential brute-force attacks.

**4. Detailed Impact Assessment:**

Beyond the initial description, the impact of successful brute-force attacks can be far-reaching:

* **Reputational Damage:**  A security breach can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode trust among users and stakeholders.
* **Legal and Compliance Issues:** Depending on the sensitivity of the data stored in Gitea, a breach could lead to legal repercussions and non-compliance with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:** If an attacker compromises a developer's account, they could introduce malicious code into projects that are dependencies for other systems, leading to a supply chain attack.
* **Loss of Intellectual Property:**  Access to private repositories can result in the theft of valuable intellectual property and trade secrets.
* **Business Disruption:**  Remediation efforts after a successful attack can lead to significant downtime and disruption of development workflows.
* **Financial Losses:**  Costs associated with incident response, data recovery, legal fees, and potential fines can be substantial.

**5. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed):**

Expanding on the initial list, here are more specific and actionable mitigation strategies:

* **Implement Strong Password Policies:**
    * **Minimum Length:** Enforce a minimum password length of at least 12 characters, ideally 14 or more.
    * **Complexity Requirements:** Require a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
    * **Prevent Common Passwords:** Utilize Gitea's built-in feature or integrate with a common password blacklist.
    * **Password History:** Consider preventing users from reusing recently used passwords.
    * **Regular Password Changes (Optional but Recommended):** While not always user-friendly, periodic password changes can further enhance security.

* **Configure Robust Rate Limiting:**
    * **Aggressive Thresholds:**  Set a low `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` (e.g., 3-5 attempts) within a short timeframe (e.g., 5-10 minutes).
    * **Appropriate Lockout Duration:**  Increase the `LOGIN_THROTTLE_TIME` to a reasonable duration (e.g., 15-30 minutes) to deter persistent attacks.
    * **Consider IP-Based Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting based on the originating IP address to block attackers attempting to brute-force multiple accounts from the same source.

* **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    * **Mandatory MFA:**  Strongly consider making MFA mandatory for all users, especially administrators and those with access to sensitive repositories.
    * **Support Multiple MFA Methods:** Offer various MFA options like authenticator apps (TOTP), security keys (U2F/WebAuthn), or SMS codes (with caution due to SMS interception risks).

* **Regularly Monitor Gitea Logs:**
    * **Automated Log Analysis:** Implement tools or scripts to automatically analyze Gitea's logs for patterns indicative of brute-force attacks (e.g., multiple failed login attempts from the same IP or for the same user).
    * **Alerting Mechanisms:** Set up alerts to notify security personnel of suspicious login activity.

* **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of Gitea's configuration and security settings.
    * **Penetration Testing:** Engage external security experts to perform penetration testing, specifically targeting authentication mechanisms, to identify vulnerabilities.
