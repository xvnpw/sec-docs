# Attack Surface Analysis for go-gitea/gitea

## Attack Surface: [Potential for Code Injection via Git Hooks](./attack_surfaces/potential_for_code_injection_via_git_hooks.md)

**Description:** Attackers with write access to a repository can modify or create Git hooks that execute arbitrary code on the Gitea server when certain Git events occur (e.g., `post-receive`).

**How Gitea Contributes:** Gitea executes Git commands, including hooks, on the server. This functionality, while powerful, introduces the risk of code injection if hooks are not carefully managed.

**Example:** An attacker pushes a commit that includes a malicious `post-receive` hook designed to execute system commands on the Gitea server.

**Impact:**  Complete server compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, and other severe security breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers (Gitea):** Implement stricter controls and sandboxing for Git hook execution. Consider options to disable server-side hooks entirely or provide granular control over their execution. Implement robust logging and monitoring of hook executions.
*   **Administrators (Gitea Instance):**  Carefully review and audit all Git hooks within repositories. Limit write access to repositories to trusted users. Implement system-level security measures to mitigate the impact of compromised hooks. Consider using containerization to isolate Gitea processes.
*   **Users (Repository Owners):** Be extremely cautious about the origin and content of Git hooks in your repositories. Only add hooks from trusted sources and thoroughly review their code.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Brute-Force and Credential Stuffing](./attack_surfaces/authentication_brute-force_and_credential_stuffing.md)

**Description:** Attackers attempt to guess user credentials through repeated login attempts or by using lists of previously compromised credentials.

**How Gitea Contributes:** Gitea's login form is a direct target for such attacks. Without proper protection, attackers can try numerous username/password combinations.

**Example:** An attacker uses automated tools to try thousands of common passwords against a list of usernames on the Gitea instance.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially leading to data breaches, repository manipulation, and other malicious activities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers (Gitea):** Implement robust rate limiting on login attempts. Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts. Encourage and support multi-factor authentication (MFA).
*   **Administrators (Gitea Instance):** Enforce strong password policies. Monitor login attempts for suspicious activity. Configure firewalls or intrusion detection systems to block malicious traffic.
*   **Users:** Use strong, unique passwords for your Gitea account. Enable multi-factor authentication if available. Be aware of phishing attempts that might try to steal your credentials.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Gitea API's authentication or authorization mechanisms could allow unauthorized access to API endpoints or resources.

**How Gitea Contributes:** Gitea provides an API for interacting with its functionalities. Flaws in how this API verifies user identity or permissions can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker finds an API endpoint that allows them to modify repository settings without proper authentication.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulation of repositories, and potential disruption of services.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers (Gitea):** Implement robust authentication mechanisms for all API endpoints (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0). Enforce strict authorization checks to ensure users can only access resources they are permitted to. Avoid relying solely on client-side validation for authorization. Regularly audit API endpoints for security vulnerabilities.
*   **Administrators (Gitea Instance):**  Monitor API usage for suspicious patterns. Restrict API access to trusted clients or applications where appropriate.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**How Gitea Contributes:** Gitea renders user-provided content like issue comments, pull request descriptions, repository names, and Markdown files. If this rendering doesn't properly sanitize or escape user input, it can become a vector for XSS.

**Example:** A user injects `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into an issue comment. When another user views the issue, the script executes in their browser.

**Impact:**  Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, and potentially more severe attacks depending on the user's privileges.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and output encoding/escaping for all user-provided content rendered in the web interface. Utilize security-focused templating engines that automatically handle escaping. Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources. Regularly update Gitea to benefit from security patches.
*   **Users:**  Report any suspicious behavior or rendering issues. Be cautious when clicking on links within Gitea content from unknown or untrusted sources.
