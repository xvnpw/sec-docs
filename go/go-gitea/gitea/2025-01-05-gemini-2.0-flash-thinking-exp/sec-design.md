## 6. Security Considerations (Pre-Threat Modeling)

This section elaborates on potential security areas and specific threats that will be crucial during threat modeling:

* **Authentication and Authorization:**
    * **Threats:** Brute-force attacks on login forms, credential stuffing, compromised credentials, insecure storage of password hashes, privilege escalation, unauthorized API access.
    * **Considerations:** Strength of password hashing algorithms (e.g., Argon2), use of salt, protection against timing attacks, multi-factor authentication (MFA), robust session management, API key management, OAuth 2.0 implementation details, role-based access control (RBAC) effectiveness.
* **Data Security:**
    * **Threats:** Database injection attacks (SQLi), cross-site scripting (XSS), stored XSS in user-generated content, exposure of sensitive data in logs or error messages, insecure file uploads (malware), unauthorized access to file storage.
    * **Considerations:** Input validation and sanitization, output encoding, parameterized queries, content security policy (CSP), secure handling of user-uploaded files, encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit (HTTPS), file system permissions, secure storage of Git LFS objects.
* **Input Validation:**
    * **Threats:** Various injection attacks (SQLi, command injection, LDAP injection), cross-site scripting (XSS), path traversal vulnerabilities, denial-of-service through malformed input.
    * **Considerations:** Strict validation of user input on both client-side and server-side, whitelisting allowed characters and formats, proper handling of special characters, protection against command injection when interacting with the `git` command.
* **Session Management:**
    * **Threats:** Session hijacking, session fixation, insecure session cookie attributes (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`), predictable session IDs.
    * **Considerations:** Use of strong, randomly generated session IDs, secure cookie attributes (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`), proper session expiration and logout mechanisms, protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
* **Rate Limiting:**
    * **Threats:** Denial-of-service attacks, brute-force attacks, API abuse.
    * **Considerations:** Implementing rate limits for API endpoints, login attempts, Git operations, and other resource-intensive actions.
* **Vulnerability Management:**
    * **Threats:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in dependencies or Gitea's codebase.
    * **Considerations:** Regularly updating dependencies, security audits, penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, having a process for addressing security vulnerabilities.
* **Git Hook Security:**
    * **Threats:** Malicious code execution through compromised or poorly written Git hooks.
    * **Considerations:** Securely managing and validating Git hooks, limiting the ability to install server-side hooks, sandboxing hook execution.
* **Admin Panel Security:**
    * **Threats:** Unauthorized access to administrative functions, leading to full system compromise.
    * **Considerations:** Strong authentication for admin accounts, logging of administrative actions, limiting access to the admin panel to authorized users.
* **Third-Party Integrations:**
    * **Threats:** Security vulnerabilities in integrated services, insecure communication with third-party services, exposure of sensitive data to third parties.
    * **Considerations:** Securely configuring and managing integrations, using secure communication protocols (HTTPS), validating data received from third-party services, carefully reviewing permissions granted to third-party applications.

## 7. Deployment Considerations

* **Deployment Environment:** Gitea can be deployed on various platforms, including bare metal servers, virtual machines, and containerized environments (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes). Containerization offers benefits for isolation and reproducibility.
* **Network Security:** Implementing firewalls to restrict access to necessary ports, using network segmentation to isolate Gitea components, and protecting against common network attacks.
* **Reverse Proxy:** Utilizing a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) for SSL termination, load balancing, request filtering, and adding an extra layer of security. Properly configuring the reverse proxy is crucial.
* **Database Security:** Securing the database server by restricting access, using strong authentication, encrypting data at rest, and regularly patching the database software.
* **File System Permissions:**  Setting appropriate file system permissions for the Git repositories directory to prevent unauthorized read or write access.
* **Regular Backups:** Implementing a reliable backup strategy for both the database and the Git repository data to ensure data recovery in case of failure.

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle a growing number of users, repositories, and requests. Consider horizontal scaling options for web and API servers and database clustering.
* **Performance:** The system should provide fast response times for user interactions and Git operations. Caching, efficient database queries, and optimized Git operations are important.
* **Reliability:** The system should be stable and available with minimal downtime. Implementing redundancy and failover mechanisms is crucial.
* **Maintainability:** The codebase should be well-structured, documented, and follow coding best practices for easy maintenance and updates.
* **Extensibility:** The system should be designed to be extensible through plugins, APIs, and webhooks to support additional features and integrations.
