## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Malicious Code via Pull Request in Gitea

This analysis delves into the specific attack tree path: **Inject Malicious Code via Pull Request -> Exploit Lack of Code Review/Automated Checks -> Introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors** within the context of a Gitea instance. We will examine the attack vector, its high-risk nature, the technical details, potential impacts, mitigation strategies, and detection methods.

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

This attack path leverages the collaborative nature of Git-based development platforms like Gitea. Attackers exploit the trust inherent in the pull request (PR) process, hoping to bypass security measures by submitting malicious code changes. The success of this attack hinges on the absence or inadequacy of code review and automated security checks.

**Detailed Breakdown of Each Stage:**

1. **Inject Malicious Code via Pull Request:**

   * **Attacker Motivation:** The attacker's goal is to introduce malicious code into the Gitea codebase. This could be for various reasons:
      * **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data stored within the Gitea instance or accessible through it (e.g., repository contents, user credentials, configuration data).
      * **System Compromise:** Gaining unauthorized access to the server hosting Gitea or other connected systems.
      * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Introducing code that can crash or significantly degrade the performance of the Gitea instance.
      * **Supply Chain Attack:**  If the Gitea instance is used to manage code for other applications or services, the malicious code could propagate to those systems.
      * **Reputation Damage:**  Compromising the integrity of the Gitea platform can severely damage the organization's reputation and user trust.
   * **Attack Methodology:** The attacker will:
      * **Fork the Repository:** Create a personal copy of the target Gitea repository.
      * **Introduce Malicious Code:**  Craft code changes containing vulnerabilities or backdoors. This could involve:
         * **Introducing new vulnerabilities:**  SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, insecure deserialization, etc.
         * **Inserting backdoors:**  Code that allows the attacker remote access or control after the PR is merged. This could be a simple shell command execution vulnerability or a more sophisticated remote access mechanism.
         * **Modifying existing code:**  Subtly altering existing functionality to introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors. This can be harder to detect.
      * **Submit a Pull Request:**  Create a PR proposing to merge the malicious changes back into the main repository.
      * **Social Engineering (Optional):**  The attacker might use social engineering tactics to convince reviewers to accept the PR quickly, such as:
         * **Creating a sense of urgency.**
         * **Impersonating a trusted contributor.**
         * **Providing misleading descriptions of the changes.**

2. **Exploit Lack of Code Review/Automated Checks:**

   * **Vulnerability:** This stage highlights a critical weakness in the development process. The absence or inadequacy of code review and automated checks creates an opportunity for malicious code to slip through.
   * **Lack of Code Review:**  Without thorough human review, malicious code can easily be overlooked, especially if it is subtly crafted or hidden within a large changeset.
   * **Inadequate Automated Checks:**  The absence or insufficient configuration of automated security checks like:
      * **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Tools that analyze the source code for potential vulnerabilities without executing it.
      * **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Tools that identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.
      * **Linters and Code Style Checkers:** While not directly security-focused, they can help maintain code quality and consistency, making it easier to spot anomalies.
      * **Unit and Integration Tests:**  Lack of comprehensive tests can prevent the detection of unintended side effects or vulnerabilities introduced by the malicious code.
   * **Consequences:** The lack of these safeguards creates a blind spot, allowing the attacker's malicious code to proceed to the next stage.

3. **Introduce Vulnerabilities or Backdoors:**

   * **Outcome:** If the PR is merged without proper scrutiny, the malicious code becomes part of the main codebase.
   * **Types of Malicious Code Introduced:**
      * **Vulnerabilities:**  Weaknesses in the code that can be exploited by attackers after deployment. Examples include:
         * **SQL Injection:** Allows attackers to manipulate database queries.
         * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
         * **Command Injection:** Permits attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
         * **Insecure Deserialization:**  Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code by manipulating serialized data.
      * **Backdoors:**  Secret entry points into the system that allow the attacker to bypass normal authentication and access controls. Examples include:
         * **Hardcoded Credentials:**  Embedding usernames and passwords directly in the code.
         * **Remote Command Execution:**  Code that listens for commands from the attacker and executes them on the server.
         * **Web Shells:**  Scripts that provide a web-based interface for executing commands on the server.
   * **Impact:** The introduction of vulnerabilities or backdoors significantly compromises the security of the Gitea instance and potentially the entire infrastructure.

**Why This Attack Path is High-Risk:**

* **Direct Code Injection:**  This attack bypasses traditional network security measures by injecting malicious code directly into the application's source code.
* **Persistence:** Once merged, the malicious code becomes a permanent part of the codebase until it is discovered and removed.
* **Difficult to Detect:**  Subtly introduced vulnerabilities or backdoors can be challenging to identify through manual code review, especially in large codebases.
* **Wide-Ranging Impact:**  Successful exploitation can lead to data breaches, system compromise, denial of service, and supply chain attacks.
* **Trust Exploitation:**  The attack leverages the trust placed in contributors and the PR process, making it psychologically effective.

**Technical Details and Examples:**

* **Example of a Vulnerability:** A malicious PR could introduce a new endpoint in the Gitea API that doesn't properly sanitize user input, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.
* **Example of a Backdoor:** A PR could add a hidden function that accepts a specific HTTP header containing a secret key. If the key is present, the function executes arbitrary commands on the server.
* **Disguising Malicious Code:** Attackers might try to obfuscate the malicious code, hide it within seemingly legitimate changes, or break it into small, less suspicious chunks across multiple commits.

**Impact on Gitea:**

* **Data Breach:**  Attackers could gain access to sensitive repository data, user credentials, and configuration information.
* **System Compromise:**  The attacker could gain control of the server hosting Gitea, potentially impacting other services running on the same infrastructure.
* **Reputation Damage:**  A successful attack could erode trust in the Gitea instance and the organization using it.
* **Supply Chain Compromise:** If the Gitea instance manages code for other projects, the malicious code could propagate to those projects, affecting their security.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Implement a strict policy requiring all pull requests to be reviewed by at least one or more designated reviewers before merging.
    * **Focus on Security:** Train reviewers to specifically look for security vulnerabilities and suspicious code patterns.
    * **Use Review Tools:** Leverage Gitea's built-in review features and potentially integrate with external code review tools.
* **Automated Security Checks:** Integrate automated security scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline:
    * **SAST (Static Application Security Testing):** Analyze code for vulnerabilities before runtime. Integrate tools like SonarQube, Semgrep, or Bandit.
    * **SCA (Software Composition Analysis):** Identify vulnerabilities in dependencies. Use tools like Dependency-Check or Snyk.
    * **Secret Scanning:** Prevent accidental exposure of secrets in the codebase. Tools like git-secrets or truffleHog can be used.
    * **Linters and Code Style Checkers:** Enforce coding standards and identify potential issues.
* **Branch Protection Rules:** Configure branch protection rules in Gitea to:
    * **Require a certain number of approvals before merging.**
    * **Prevent direct pushes to protected branches (like `main` or `master`).**
    * **Require successful status checks (from CI/CD pipelines) before merging.**
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant contributors only the necessary permissions. Limit who can merge pull requests.
* **Security Training for Developers:** Educate developers on secure coding practices and common attack vectors.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the Gitea instance and its codebase.
