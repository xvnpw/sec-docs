## Deep Analysis: Exploiting Gitea Actions (CI/CD) - Tamper with Workflow Execution -> Modify Build Artifacts or Deploy Malicious Code

This analysis delves into the specific attack path identified within Gitea Actions, focusing on how an attacker could manipulate the CI/CD process to inject malicious code without directly altering the source code repository. This is a critical vulnerability as it bypasses traditional code review and security scanning focused on the codebase itself.

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

The core of this attack lies in exploiting the trust and automation inherent in CI/CD systems like Gitea Actions. Instead of directly modifying the source code, which would likely trigger alerts and reviews, the attacker focuses on influencing the *execution* of the workflow. This allows them to inject malicious elements during the build or deployment phases.

**Deep Dive into Attack Techniques:**

Let's break down the "Tamper with Workflow Execution" stage and explore concrete methods an attacker could employ:

**1. Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Workflow Definitions (.github/workflows):**

* **Insecure Use of Third-Party Actions:**  Attackers could introduce malicious or compromised third-party actions into the workflow. These actions, while seemingly legitimate, could contain code to inject malware, exfiltrate secrets, or modify artifacts.
    * **Example:**  Using a popular action with a known vulnerability or a typosquatted malicious action with a similar name.
* **Unsanitized Inputs in Workflow Commands:** If workflow commands accept external inputs without proper sanitization, attackers could inject malicious commands.
    * **Example:**  A workflow step using user-provided data to construct a `git clone` command. An attacker could inject additional parameters to clone from a malicious repository.
* **Insecure Environment Variable Usage:**  If workflows rely on environment variables that are not properly secured or can be manipulated, attackers could inject malicious values.
    * **Example:**  A build script uses an environment variable for the artifact repository URL. An attacker could potentially overwrite this variable to point to their malicious repository.
* **Race Conditions in Workflow Execution:**  While less common, if workflows have dependencies or parallel execution that are not properly synchronized, attackers could exploit race conditions to inject malicious steps or modify data at a critical moment.

**2. Compromising Workflow Secrets and Credentials:**

* **Exfiltration of Secrets:** Attackers might target stored secrets used within the workflow (e.g., API keys, deployment credentials). If these secrets are compromised, they can be used to inject malicious steps or deploy altered artifacts.
    * **Methods:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the runner environment, logging secrets inadvertently, or gaining access to the Gitea server's secret storage.
* **Manipulating Service Accounts/Tokens:** If the workflow uses service accounts or tokens for authentication, compromising these credentials allows the attacker to act as the CI/CD system and perform malicious actions.

**3. Tampering with the Runner Environment:**

* **Compromising the Runner Machine:** If the Gitea Actions runner is self-hosted and not properly secured, an attacker could compromise the runner machine itself. This grants them the ability to directly manipulate the build process, modify artifacts, and deploy malicious code.
* **Exploiting Containerization Vulnerabilities:** If the runner uses containers (e.g., Docker), vulnerabilities in the container runtime or image could be exploited to gain access to the container and modify the build environment.

**4. Manipulating Dependencies and Build Tools:**

* **Dependency Confusion Attacks:** Attackers could upload malicious packages to public repositories with the same name as internal dependencies, hoping the build process will pull the malicious version.
* **Compromising Build Tool Configurations:** If the build process relies on configuration files (e.g., `pom.xml` for Maven, `package.json` for npm), attackers might find ways to inject malicious configurations that download and execute malicious code during the build.
* **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Dependency Downloads:**  While less likely in controlled environments, attackers could attempt to intercept the download of dependencies during the build process and replace legitimate packages with malicious ones.

**Impact of Modifying Build Artifacts or Deploying Malicious Code:**

This final stage represents the culmination of the attack, with potentially severe consequences:

* **Deployment of Backdoored Applications:**  The most direct impact is deploying a version of the application containing malicious code. This could include:
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data from users or the application's environment.
    * **Remote Access:** Creating backdoors for persistent access to the server or network.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:**  If the compromised application is a library or dependency used by other systems, the attack can propagate further.
* **Compromised Infrastructure:** Malicious code deployed through the CI/CD pipeline could be used to compromise the underlying infrastructure where the application is hosted.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Deploying a compromised application can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode user trust.
* **Financial Losses:**  Breaches can lead to significant financial losses through fines, legal fees, recovery costs, and loss of business.

**Why This Attack Vector is High-Risk:**

* **Bypass Traditional Security Measures:** This attack bypasses traditional code review and static analysis tools focused on the source code repository. The malicious changes occur *after* the code is considered "clean."
* **Difficult to Detect:**  Detecting manipulation within the CI/CD pipeline requires specialized monitoring and auditing of the workflow execution environment. Standard security tools might not be effective.
* **High Level of Trust:** CI/CD systems are inherently trusted to deploy code. This trust can be exploited by attackers.
* **Potential for Widespread Impact:**  A successful attack can affect all deployments made through the compromised workflow, potentially impacting a large number of users.

**Mitigation and Prevention Strategies:**

To defend against this attack path, the development team should implement the following security measures:

* **Secure Workflow Definitions:**
    * **Pin Actions to Specific Versions/Commits:** Avoid using `latest` tags for actions. Pinning ensures that the workflow uses a known and trusted version.
    * **Thoroughly Review Third-Party Actions:**  Evaluate the security and reputation of any external actions used in workflows.
    * **Sanitize Inputs in Workflow Commands:**  Treat all external inputs as potentially malicious and sanitize them before using them in commands.
    * **Minimize the Use of Environment Variables for Sensitive Data:**  Opt for secure secret management solutions.
* **Robust Secret Management:**
    * **Utilize Gitea's Secret Management Features:** Store sensitive credentials securely within Gitea and access them within workflows using secure methods.
    * **Implement Least Privilege for Secrets:** Grant access to secrets only to the workflows and steps that absolutely need them.
    * **Regularly Rotate Secrets:**  Periodically change sensitive credentials to limit the impact of a potential compromise.
* **Secure Runner Environment:**
    * **Harden Self-Hosted Runners:**  Implement strong security measures on self-hosted runner machines, including regular patching, strong access controls, and endpoint security.
    * **Use Ephemeral Runners:**  Consider using ephemeral runners that are created and destroyed for each job to minimize the attack surface.
    * **Secure Container Images:**  If using containers, ensure the base images are secure and regularly updated. Implement container security scanning.
* **Dependency Management Security:**
    * **Utilize Dependency Scanning Tools:** Integrate tools that scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    * **Implement Dependency Pinning and Locking:**  Use tools like `requirements.txt` (Python) or `package-lock.json` (Node.js) to lock down dependency versions.
    * **Consider Using Private Package Registries:**  For internal dependencies, using a private registry can reduce the risk of dependency confusion attacks.
* **Workflow Execution Monitoring and Auditing:**
    * **Enable Detailed Workflow Logging:**  Capture comprehensive logs of workflow execution, including commands executed, environment variables used, and artifact manipulations.
    * **Implement Real-time Monitoring and Alerting:**  Set up alerts for suspicious activities within workflows, such as unexpected commands, access to sensitive secrets, or changes to artifacts.
    * **Regularly Review Workflow Execution Logs:**  Proactively analyze logs for anomalies or potential security incidents.
* **Code Review and Security Scanning Integration:**
    * **Integrate Security Scanning Tools into the Workflow:**  Automate static and dynamic analysis of code and configurations within the CI/CD pipeline.
    * **Implement Manual Code Reviews for Workflow Changes:**  Treat changes to workflow definitions with the same scrutiny as source code changes.
* **Network Segmentation:**
    * **Isolate the CI/CD Environment:**  Segment the network to limit the potential impact if the CI/CD environment is compromised.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Grant Minimal Permissions to Workflow Actions:**  Ensure that workflow steps and actions only have the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.

**Recommendations for the Development Team:**

1. **Prioritize Security in CI/CD:** Recognize that the CI/CD pipeline is a critical security component and requires dedicated attention.
2. **Implement a Security-Focused Workflow Review Process:**  Establish a process for reviewing and approving changes to workflow definitions, similar to code reviews.
3. **Invest in CI/CD Security Tools:**  Explore and implement tools for secret management, dependency scanning, workflow monitoring, and runner security.
4. **Educate Developers on CI/CD Security Best Practices:**  Provide training and awareness programs to educate developers on the risks associated with CI/CD and how to mitigate them.
5. **Regularly Audit and Review CI/CD Configurations:**  Periodically review workflow definitions, secret management configurations, and runner security settings to identify potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
6. **Implement a Security Incident Response Plan for CI/CD:**  Develop a plan for responding to security incidents within the CI/CD pipeline, including steps for containment, eradication, and recovery.

**Conclusion:**

The attack path exploiting Gitea Actions to tamper with workflow execution and modify build artifacts or deploy malicious code presents a significant and often overlooked security risk. By understanding the potential attack techniques and implementing robust preventative and detective measures, development teams can significantly reduce the likelihood of this type of attack and protect their applications and infrastructure.
