# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for go-gitea/gitea

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Password Policies](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_password_policies.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Strong Password Policies
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access Gitea Configuration:** Locate and open the Gitea configuration file (`app.ini`).
    2.  **Configure Password Policy Settings:** Within the `[security]` section, set:
        *   `PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH`: Define minimum password length (e.g., `PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH = 12`).
        *   `PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY = true`: Enable complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).
        *   `PASSWORD_HISTORY`: Set password history to prevent reuse (e.g., `PASSWORD_HISTORY = 5`).
        *   `PASSWORD_EXPIRE_DAYS`:  Optionally set password expiration (e.g., `PASSWORD_EXPIRE_DAYS = 90`).
    3.  **Restart Gitea:** Restart the Gitea service for changes to apply.
    4.  **Communicate Policy to Users:** Inform users about the new password policy.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):** Weak passwords are vulnerable to cracking.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (High Severity):** Reused passwords can be compromised from other breaches.
    *   **Dictionary Attacks (Medium Severity):** Common passwords are easily guessed.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** High risk reduction. Strong passwords make brute-force attacks much harder.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces likelihood of reused passwords being weak.
    *   **Dictionary Attacks:** High risk reduction. Eliminates dictionary attacks effectively.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Minimum password length is set, but complexity and history are not enforced.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Complexity requirements, password history, and password expiration policies are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Mandatory Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)](./mitigation_strategies/mandatory_two-factor_authentication__2fa_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Mandatory Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
