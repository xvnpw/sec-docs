# Attack Surface Analysis for go-gitea/gitea

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass/Brute Force](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypassbrute_force.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access by guessing passwords, exploiting weak authentication mechanisms, or bypassing authentication controls *within Gitea's implementation*.
*   **Gitea Contribution:** Gitea provides the authentication interface and logic, including support for various authentication methods (local, LDAP, OAuth). Vulnerabilities *in Gitea's code* or misconfigurations *of Gitea's settings* can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in Gitea's session management allows an attacker to hijack a user's session.  Or, a flaw in Gitea's LDAP integration code allows unauthenticated access.
*   **Impact:** Complete account takeover, access to private repositories, potential for lateral movement within the system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust rate limiting and account lockout policies *within Gitea*. Ensure secure handling of session tokens and cookies *according to best practices*. Thoroughly test all authentication methods and integrations *for vulnerabilities*. Provide clear documentation on secure configuration *of Gitea's authentication features*.
    *   **Users/Admins:** Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, uniqueness) *within Gitea's settings*. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all accounts, especially administrative ones *if supported by Gitea*. Regularly audit user accounts and permissions *within Gitea*. Monitor Gitea's login logs for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass (Privilege Escalation)](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass__privilege_escalation_.md)

*   **Description:** An authenticated user gains access to resources or performs actions they are not authorized to access *due to flaws in Gitea's authorization logic*.
*   **Gitea Contribution:** Gitea manages repository permissions, team memberships, and organization-level access controls. *Bugs in Gitea's code* can allow users to escalate their privileges.
*   **Example:** A user with read-only access to a repository exploits a *vulnerability in Gitea's permission checking code* to gain write access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of code, access to sensitive data, potential for complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict authorization checks *in Gitea's code* at every level (repository, organization, global). Follow the principle of least privilege. Thoroughly test all authorization logic, including edge cases and boundary conditions.
    *   **Users/Admins:** Regularly review and audit user permissions and team memberships *within Gitea*. Ensure that users only have the minimum necessary access *as defined by Gitea's roles*. Use Gitea's built-in roles and permissions system effectively.

## Attack Surface: [Git Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/git_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious Git commands into user-supplied input, leading to arbitrary code execution on the Gitea server *due to improper input handling in Gitea*.
*   **Gitea Contribution:** Gitea interacts with the Git backend to perform repository operations. *If Gitea's code does not properly sanitize user input*, it can be used to inject malicious commands.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a specially formatted repository name that, when processed by *Gitea's code*, executes arbitrary shell commands on the server.
*   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data exfiltration, potential for lateral movement to other systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** *Never* directly construct Git commands using unsanitized user input *within Gitea's codebase*. Use parameterized Git commands or libraries that provide safe command execution. Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data that interacts with the Git backend *within Gitea*. Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing focused on command injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users/Admins:** This is primarily a developer-side mitigation. Keeping Gitea updated to the latest version is crucial.

## Attack Surface: [Webhook Abuse](./attack_surfaces/webhook_abuse.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities *in Gitea's webhook handling logic* to trigger unauthorized actions or gain information.
*   **Gitea Contribution:** Gitea provides a webhook system and *the code to process incoming webhook requests*.  Vulnerabilities in this code can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a *vulnerability in Gitea's webhook parsing code* to bypass signature verification and trigger unauthorized actions.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized code execution, data breaches, disruption of services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement secure webhook secret management and *robust signature verification within Gitea*.  *Validate the source and content of webhook requests within Gitea's code*.  Limit the scope of actions that webhooks can trigger *through Gitea's configuration*.
    *   **Users/Admins:** Carefully configure webhook settings *within Gitea*, using strong secrets and restricting access to trusted sources. Regularly audit webhook configurations and Gitea's logs.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Directly Affecting Gitea)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__directly_affecting_gitea_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in *Go libraries directly used by Gitea's code* are exploited to attack the system.  This focuses on vulnerabilities that impact Gitea's functionality, not just general Go vulnerabilities.
*   **Gitea Contribution:** Gitea's choice of dependencies and *how it uses them* directly impacts this risk.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in a Go library used by Gitea *for its authentication process* is exploited to bypass authentication.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Regularly update Gitea to the latest version. Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to identify and track vulnerable dependencies *specifically used by Gitea*. Carefully vet new dependencies for security. Contribute to upstream projects to fix vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users/Admins:** Keep Gitea updated. Monitor security advisories for Gitea and its *direct* dependencies.
