Okay, let's create a design document for the Gitea project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Gitea is a self-hosted Git service, similar to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.  It's open-source and written in Go.  The primary business goals and priorities revolve around providing a lightweight, easy-to-install, and maintain Git server solution.  It caters to individuals, teams, and organizations who prefer or require on-premises code hosting for reasons of control, compliance, or cost.

Business Priorities:

*   Provide a stable and reliable Git hosting service.
*   Ensure ease of installation and maintenance.
*   Offer a user-friendly interface and experience.
*   Maintain a lightweight footprint to run on low-resource systems.
*   Support a wide range of operating systems and architectures.
*   Foster a strong open-source community.
*   Provide features comparable to popular hosted Git services.

Business Goals:

*   Become a leading self-hosted Git solution.
*   Attract a large and active user and contributor base.
*   Offer a viable alternative to commercial Git hosting platforms.
*   Enable secure and private code collaboration.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data breaches leading to unauthorized access to source code repositories.
*   Service downtime or unavailability impacting user workflows.
*   Vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise user accounts or the server itself.
*   Loss of user data due to hardware failure, software bugs, or malicious attacks.
*   Failure to keep up with security best practices and emerging threats.
*   Reputational damage due to security incidents or poor user experience.
*   Inability to scale to meet the needs of growing organizations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Gitea incorporates several security controls and addresses various risks.  However, as with any complex software, there are always areas for improvement and ongoing vigilance.

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Authentication: Gitea supports multiple authentication methods, including built-in user accounts, LDAP, OAuth (GitHub, GitLab, Google, etc.), and PAM. Described in documentation and implemented in code.
*   security control: Authorization: Gitea provides role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions on repositories and organizations. Described in documentation and implemented in code.
*   security control: SSH Key Management: Users can manage their SSH keys for secure Git operations. Described in documentation and implemented in code.
*   security control: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Gitea supports 2FA for enhanced account security. Described in documentation and implemented in code.
*   security control: Web Application Firewall (WAF) (Recommended to be used externally): While not built-in, Gitea is often deployed behind a reverse proxy that can act as a WAF (e.g., Nginx, Apache, Caddy).
*   security control: Regular Security Updates: The Gitea project releases regular updates to address security vulnerabilities and improve overall security.
*   security control: Input Validation: Gitea performs input validation to mitigate risks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection. Implemented in code.
*   security control: CSRF Protection: Gitea implements measures to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Implemented in code.
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP): Gitea uses CSP headers to mitigate XSS and other code injection attacks. Implemented in code.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on External Authentication Providers: When using OAuth or LDAP, the security of user accounts partially depends on the security of the external provider.
*   accepted risk: Self-Hosting Responsibility: Users who self-host Gitea are responsible for securing the underlying server infrastructure and operating system.
*   accepted risk: Potential for Zero-Day Exploits: Like all software, Gitea is susceptible to undiscovered vulnerabilities (zero-days).
*   accepted risk: Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: Gitea depends on third-party libraries and dependencies, which could introduce vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

*   Implement a robust vulnerability scanning and management process, including regular penetration testing.
*   Integrate with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for centralized logging and threat detection.
*   Provide more granular permission controls beyond the current RBAC model.
*   Implement stricter password policies and account lockout mechanisms.
*   Offer built-in support for WebAuthn/FIDO2 for passwordless authentication.
*   Implement signed commits and releases by default.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support strong password policies.
    *   Enforce 2FA for all users or specific roles.
    *   Provide secure session management.
    *   Log all authentication attempts (success and failure).

*   Authorization:
    *   Implement fine-grained access control to repositories, branches, and specific actions.
    *   Regularly review and audit user permissions.
    *   Provide a clear and understandable permission model.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all user inputs on both the client-side and server-side.
    *   Use a whitelist approach to input validation whenever possible.
    *   Sanitize output to prevent XSS attacks.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms for storing passwords and sensitive data.
    *   Use HTTPS for all communication.
    *   Support secure key management practices.
    *   Regularly review and update cryptographic implementations.

*   security control: Linters: Employs linters to enforce code style and identify potential issues.
*   security control: Dependency Management: Uses Go modules for dependency management, allowing for auditing and vulnerability scanning of dependencies.
*   security control: Signed Releases: Gitea releases are digitally signed to ensure authenticity and integrity.
*   security control: Automated Testing: Includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   Code Repository Management: Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of source code repositories.
*   User Authentication and Authorization: Protecting user accounts and ensuring proper access control.
*   Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD): Maintaining a secure and reliable build and deployment pipeline.
*   Collaboration and Communication: Enabling secure collaboration among developers.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   Source Code: Highly sensitive; unauthorized access could lead to intellectual property theft, competitive disadvantage, or the introduction of malicious code.
*   User Account Information (Passwords, Email Addresses, SSH Keys): Sensitive; requires strong protection to prevent account compromise. Passwords are cryptographically hashed.
*   Repository Metadata (Commit History, Issues, Pull Requests): Moderately sensitive; could reveal information about development activities and potential vulnerabilities.
*   Configuration Data: Sensitive; could expose internal system details and credentials.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What is the specific threat model used by the Gitea development team?
*   What are the procedures for handling security incidents and vulnerability reports?
*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that need to be considered?
*   What is the frequency and scope of penetration testing performed on Gitea?
*   What are the plans for future security enhancements and features?
*   What is process to report security vulnerabilities?
*   What is the process for managing and updating third-party dependencies?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a secure and reliable self-hosted Git service.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: Gitea follows security best practices, but there's always room for improvement.
*   DESIGN: The deployment will use Docker for ease of management and portability. A reverse proxy will be used for TLS termination and security. The build process is automated and includes security checks.
