Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Unauthorized Repository Access via Access Token Leakage" threat for a Gitea-based application, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: Unauthorized Repository Access via Access Token Leakage (Gitea)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the threat of unauthorized repository access in Gitea due to leaked access tokens (PATs or OAuth tokens).  This includes identifying the root causes, potential attack vectors, the specific Gitea components involved, and the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to minimize the risk and impact of this threat.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   **Gitea's built-in token management system:**  We are *not* analyzing external authentication providers (like LDAP) unless they interact directly with Gitea's token system.
*   **Personal Access Tokens (PATs) and OAuth tokens:**  These are the primary mechanisms for programmatic access to Gitea.
*   **Unauthorized access to repositories and actions performed within Gitea:**  We are concerned with actions an attacker can take *within* Gitea using a compromised token.
*   **The identified Gitea components:** `models/accesstoken.go`, `routers/api/v1/user/tokens.go`, and authentication middleware (`modules/auth/auth.go` and related files).
*   **Direct leakage of tokens:** We are focusing on scenarios where the token itself is compromised, not on vulnerabilities that might allow an attacker to *generate* a token without authorization.

We will *not* cover:

*   General web application vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) unless they directly contribute to token leakage.
*   Physical security breaches (e.g., stolen laptops).
*   Compromise of the underlying server infrastructure (unless it directly leads to token leakage).

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the relevant Gitea source code (specifically the components listed in the scope) to understand how tokens are generated, stored, validated, and revoked.  This will identify potential weaknesses in the implementation.
2.  **Threat Modeling:**  Use the STRIDE model (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to systematically identify potential attack vectors related to token leakage.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Investigate known vulnerabilities and exploits related to token management in Gitea and similar systems.  This includes reviewing CVEs, security advisories, and bug reports.
4.  **Best Practices Analysis:**  Compare Gitea's token management practices against industry best practices for secure token handling (e.g., OWASP guidelines).
5.  **Mitigation Effectiveness Assessment:**  Evaluate the proposed mitigation strategies (both developer and user-focused) to determine their effectiveness in preventing or mitigating the threat.  This includes identifying potential gaps or weaknesses in the mitigations.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 4.1. Attack Vectors and Scenarios

Several scenarios can lead to token leakage:

1.  **Accidental Commitment to Public Repositories:**  Developers inadvertently include tokens in code pushed to public repositories (on Gitea or other platforms like GitHub). This is a very common source of leaks.
2.  **Compromised Development Environment:**  Malware on a developer's machine steals tokens stored in configuration files, environment variables, or IDE settings.
3.  **Phishing/Social Engineering:**  Attackers trick users into revealing their tokens through deceptive emails, websites, or other social engineering tactics.
4.  **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:**  If Gitea is accessed over an insecure connection (HTTP instead of HTTPS), attackers can intercept tokens during transmission.  Even with HTTPS, compromised CAs or misconfigured TLS could allow MitM attacks.
5.  **Database Breach:**  If the Gitea database is compromised, attackers could potentially extract stored tokens.  (This depends on how tokens are stored â€“ ideally, they should be hashed and salted).
6.  **Log File Exposure:**  If Gitea logs contain sensitive information, including tokens, and these logs are exposed, attackers could gain access.
7.  **Browser Extensions/Plugins:**  Malicious or vulnerable browser extensions could access and steal tokens from the user's browser session.
8.  **Third-Party Application Compromise:** If a user grants access to a malicious or compromised third-party application via OAuth, that application could misuse the granted token.
9. **Shoulder Surfing:** An attacker may observe a user entering or displaying their token.

### 4.2. Gitea Component Analysis

*   **`models/accesstoken.go`:** This file defines the `AccessToken` structure and associated methods for database interaction.  Key areas to examine:
    *   **Token Generation:** How are tokens generated?  Are they cryptographically strong random numbers?
    *   **Token Storage:** Are tokens stored securely?  Are they hashed and salted before being stored in the database?  What hashing algorithm is used?
    *   **Token Expiration:** Does the code enforce token expiration?  How is the expiration time handled?
    *   **Token Revocation:**  Is there a mechanism to revoke tokens?  How is revocation implemented?

*   **`routers/api/v1/user/tokens.go`:** This file defines the API endpoints for managing tokens.  Key areas to examine:
    *   **Authentication:**  How are API requests authenticated?  Are there any vulnerabilities that could allow bypassing authentication?
    *   **Authorization:**  Are there proper authorization checks to ensure that users can only manage their own tokens?
    *   **Input Validation:**  Is user input properly validated to prevent injection attacks or other vulnerabilities?
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Are there rate limits in place to prevent brute-force attacks against the token management API?

*   **Authentication Middleware (`modules/auth/auth.go` and related files):** This middleware handles authentication for all requests.  Key areas to examine:
    *   **Token Validation:**  How are tokens validated?  Is the signature checked?  Is the expiration time checked?  Is the token checked against a revocation list?
    *   **Error Handling:**  How are errors handled?  Are error messages revealing sensitive information?
    *   **Session Management:**  How are user sessions managed?  Are there any vulnerabilities related to session hijacking or fixation?

### 4.3. Mitigation Strategy Evaluation

*   **Developer Mitigations:**

    *   **Robust Token Revocation:**  *Effective.*  Gitea should provide a clear and easy-to-use mechanism for users to revoke tokens, both individually and in bulk.  This should invalidate the token immediately.
    *   **Token Expiration Policies:**  *Effective.*  Enforcing token expiration is crucial.  Shorter expiration times reduce the window of opportunity for attackers.  Gitea should allow administrators to configure expiration policies.
    *   **Auditing Capabilities:**  *Effective.*  Detailed audit logs of token usage (creation, access, revocation) allow for detection of suspicious activity and forensic analysis.
    *   **Token Scanning:**  *Highly Effective.*  Implementing a system to scan repositories for accidentally committed tokens (similar to GitHub's secret scanning) can prevent leaks before they become public. This should be a high-priority feature.

*   **User Mitigations:**

    *   **Education:**  *Effective, but requires ongoing effort.*  Users need to understand the risks and best practices.  This includes training materials, documentation, and in-app reminders.
    *   **Short-Lived Tokens:**  *Effective.*  Encouraging users to create tokens with short lifespans minimizes the impact of a leak.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  *Highly Effective.*  MFA adds a crucial layer of security.  Even if a token is leaked, the attacker still needs the second factor.  Gitea should strongly encourage or even require MFA.
    *   **Regular Token Review:**  *Effective.*  Users should periodically review their active tokens and revoke any that are no longer needed or suspicious.

### 4.4. Gaps and Weaknesses

*   **Lack of Built-in Token Scanning:**  This is a significant gap.  Gitea currently relies on users and external tools to detect leaked tokens.
*   **Potential for Database Compromise:**  If tokens are not stored securely (e.g., not hashed and salted), a database breach could expose all tokens.  This needs to be verified through code review.
*   **Reliance on User Diligence:**  Many mitigations rely on users following best practices.  This is inherently unreliable, as users may make mistakes or be unaware of the risks.
* **Lack of Granular Permissions:** Gitea access tokens often have broad permissions.  A compromised token with full access can cause significant damage. Implementing more granular permissions (e.g., read-only tokens, repository-specific tokens) would limit the blast radius of a compromised token.
* **Insufficient Logging:** While auditing is mentioned, the specifics of what is logged and how it's protected are crucial. Logs should include detailed information about token usage, including IP addresses, user agents, and accessed resources. Log integrity must also be ensured.

## 5. Recommendations

1.  **Implement Token Scanning:**  Prioritize the development of a built-in token scanning feature to detect accidentally committed tokens.
2.  **Enhance Token Storage Security:**  Verify that tokens are hashed and salted using a strong, modern hashing algorithm (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt) before being stored in the database.
3.  **Mandatory MFA:** Strongly encourage or require MFA for all users, especially those with access to sensitive repositories.
4.  **Granular Permissions:** Introduce more granular permission levels for access tokens, allowing users to create tokens with limited scope (e.g., read-only access to specific repositories).
5.  **Improve Logging and Auditing:** Ensure comprehensive logging of token-related events, including IP addresses, user agents, and accessed resources. Protect log integrity and implement log analysis tools.
6.  **Security Awareness Training:** Provide regular security awareness training for developers and users, emphasizing the importance of token security and best practices.
7.  **API Rate Limiting:** Implement robust rate limiting on the token management API to prevent brute-force attacks.
8.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in Gitea's token management system.
9.  **Consider Token Binding:** Explore the possibility of implementing token binding (e.g., using TLS client certificates) to further enhance security and prevent token replay attacks.
10. **OAuth 2.0 Best Practices:** If using OAuth, strictly adhere to OAuth 2.0 best practices, including using short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens, and validating redirect URIs.

By implementing these recommendations, the risk of unauthorized repository access due to token leakage in Gitea can be significantly reduced. Continuous monitoring and improvement are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
