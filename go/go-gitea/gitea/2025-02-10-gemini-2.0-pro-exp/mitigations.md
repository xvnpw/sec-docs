## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `app.ini` Configuration (Gitea-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure__app_ini__configuration__gitea-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate `app.ini`:** Find the `app.ini` file.
    2.  **Restrict File Permissions:** Set strict file permissions (e.g., `chmod 600 app.ini`). Only the Gitea user should have access.
    3.  **Review Security Settings:** Examine each setting, especially:
        *   `SECRET_KEY`: Long, random string.
        *   `JWT_SECRET`: Long, random string (if using JWT).
        *   Database settings: Strong passwords; restricted access.
        *   `RUN_MODE`: `prod` for production.
        *   `ENABLE_ গেলেন_SIGNUP` / `DISABLE_REGISTRATION`: Disable open registration if not needed.
        *   Authentication sources: Disable unused providers.
        *   Mailer settings: Configure securely.
        *   Webhook settings: Use secret tokens and HTTPS.
    4.  **Store Outside Web Root:** `app.ini` must *not* be in the web root.

    *   Documentation of settings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Webhook Security (Gitea-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/webhook_security__gitea-specific_.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Access Webhook Settings:** In Gitea, navigate to the repository or organization settings where webhooks are configured.
    2. **Use HTTPS:** Ensure all webhook URLs use `https://` to encrypt communication.
    3. **Set Secret Token:** Generate a strong, random secret token for each webhook.
    4. **Verify Signatures (Code Change):** In the application receiving webhook requests, implement code to verify the `X-Gitea-Signature` header using the secret token.  This confirms the request originated from your Gitea instance.  Gitea provides documentation and examples for this.
    5. **Restrict Source IPs (If Possible):** If your webhook receiver has a static IP address, configure Gitea (if possible) or your firewall to only allow webhook requests from the Gitea server's IP address.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** HTTPS prevents eavesdropping on webhook data.
    * **Forged Webhook Requests (High Severity):** Signature verification prevents attackers from sending fake webhook requests to trigger actions in your application.
    * **Replay Attacks (Medium Severity):** While signature verification helps, consider adding timestamp checks or nonce handling in your webhook receiver to further mitigate replay attacks.

* **Impact:**
    * **MitM Attacks:** Significantly reduces risk (with HTTPS).
    * **Forged Webhook Requests:** Eliminates risk (with signature verification).
    * **Replay Attacks:** Moderately reduces risk (with additional measures).

* **Currently Implemented:** (Example) HTTPS is used, but secret tokens are not consistently set, and signature verification is not implemented in the receiving application.

* **Missing Implementation:** (Example)
    * Consistent use of secret tokens for all webhooks.
    * Implementation of signature verification in the webhook receiver application.
    * IP address restrictions (if feasible).
