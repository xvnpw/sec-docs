# Threat Model Analysis for go-gitea/gitea

## Threat: [Unauthorized Repository Access via Access Token Leakage](./threats/unauthorized_repository_access_via_access_token_leakage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains a valid Gitea personal access token (PAT) or OAuth token. The attacker uses this token to access private repositories or perform actions on behalf of the compromised user.  This is a *direct* threat because the token is a Gitea-specific authentication mechanism.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Confidentiality breach: Sensitive code, data, or configuration files within private repositories are exposed.
        *   Integrity breach: The attacker could modify code, introduce vulnerabilities, or delete data.
        *   Availability breach: The attacker could delete repositories or make them inaccessible.
    *   **Gitea Component Affected:**
        *   `models/accesstoken.go`:  Handles access token management.
        *   `routers/api/v1/user/tokens.go`: API endpoints for managing tokens.
        *   Authentication middleware (`modules/auth/auth.go` and related files).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Implement robust token revocation mechanisms in Gitea.
            *   Enforce token expiration policies.
            *   Provide auditing capabilities for token usage.
            *   Consider implementing token scanning in repositories to detect accidentally committed tokens.
        *   **User:**
            *   Educate users about the risks of token leakage and best practices for secure token storage.
            *   Encourage users to use short-lived tokens and to revoke them immediately if compromise is suspected.
            *   Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) to mitigate the impact of token compromise.
            *   Regularly review and audit granted access tokens.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Branch Protection Bypass](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_branch_protection_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Gitea's *own* branch protection logic to bypass restrictions and push unauthorized code to protected branches. This is a *direct* threat because it targets a core Gitea feature.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Integrity breach: Malicious or buggy code is introduced into critical branches, potentially affecting production systems.
        *   Availability breach:  The attacker could introduce code that causes instability or downtime.
    *   **Gitea Component Affected:**
        *   `models/repo_protect.go`:  Handles branch protection rules.
        *   `routers/repo/setting.go`:  Handles repository settings, including branch protection configuration.
        *   `services/repository/push.go`:  Handles push operations and enforces branch protection rules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Thoroughly audit and test the branch protection logic for race conditions, edge cases, and potential bypasses.
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all API requests related to branch protection.
            *   Ensure that branch protection rules are consistently enforced across all relevant code paths (e.g., web interface, API, Git hooks).
            *   Consider implementing a "defense in depth" approach.
        *   **User:**
            *   Configure branch protection rules carefully.
            *   Regularly review and audit branch protection settings.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Uncontrolled Repository Creation](./threats/denial_of_service_via_uncontrolled_repository_creation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker creates a large number of repositories, exploiting Gitea's repository creation functionality, to exhaust server resources and make Gitea unavailable. This is a *direct* threat because it targets Gitea's repository management.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Availability breach: Gitea becomes unresponsive or unavailable.
        *   Potential data loss if disk space is completely exhausted.
    *   **Gitea Component Affected:**
        *   `routers/user/repo.go`:  Handles repository creation.
        *   `services/repository/repository.go`:  Handles repository management.
        *   `modules/setting/setting.go`:  Contains configuration settings related to repository limits.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Implement rate limiting for repository creation, both globally and per user.
            *   Allow administrators to configure limits on the number of repositories per user and the total size of repositories.
            *   Implement resource monitoring and alerting.
        *   **User (Administrator):**
            *   Configure appropriate repository creation limits in Gitea's settings.
            *   Monitor server resource usage.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Markdown Rendering](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_markdown_rendering.md)

* **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a Markdown file. When another user views the rendered Markdown, the attacker's code executes in their browser. This is a *direct* threat because it targets Gitea's *own* Markdown rendering engine.
    * **Impact:**
        *   Confidentiality breach: The attacker could steal the victim's session cookies or other sensitive information.
        *   Integrity breach: The attacker could modify the content of the page or perform actions on behalf of the victim.
        *   Spoofing: The attacker could impersonate the victim.
    * **Gitea Component Affected:**
        *   `modules/markup/markdown/markdown.go`:  Handles Markdown rendering.
        *   `modules/template`: Template rendering engine.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Use a well-vetted and regularly updated Markdown rendering library.
            *   Implement strict output encoding to prevent the execution of injected scripts.
            *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP).
            *   Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing.
        *   **User:**
            *   Be cautious when viewing Markdown files from untrusted sources.
            *   Keep your browser and any browser extensions up to date.
