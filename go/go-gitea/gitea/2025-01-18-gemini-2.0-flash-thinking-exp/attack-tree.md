## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Gitea Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gitea_vulnerabilities.md)

- Exploit Known Gitea Vulnerabilities (CVEs):
    - Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific versions of Gitea.
    - Exploits can range from simple URL manipulations to complex, multi-stage attacks.
    - Success can lead to Remote Code Execution, Authentication Bypass, or other critical compromises.
    - Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability:
        - Attackers exploit a flaw allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the Gitea server.
        - This often involves sending specially crafted requests to vulnerable endpoints.
        - Gain shell access on Gitea server -> Pivot to application infrastructure:
            - Once RCE is achieved, attackers gain a command-line interface on the Gitea server.
            - From there, they can explore the network, access sensitive files, and potentially pivot to other systems, including the application's infrastructure.
- Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:
    - Attackers discover and exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in Gitea.
    - This requires significant reverse engineering skills and effort.
    - The impact is similar to exploiting known CVEs but is harder to defend against initially.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Gitea Features for Malicious Purposes - Exploit Webhooks](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_gitea_features_for_malicious_purposes_-_exploit_webhooks.md)

- Compromise a user account with webhook creation permissions:
    - Attackers gain access to a legitimate user account with the ability to create webhooks.
    - This can be achieved through phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting other vulnerabilities.
    - Create malicious webhook pointing to attacker-controlled server:
        - Once logged in, the attacker creates a new webhook that sends Gitea event data to a server they control.
        - Trigger malicious actions on the application when Gitea events occur:
            - If the application relies on webhook data without proper validation, attackers can craft malicious payloads in Gitea (e.g., in commit messages or issue updates) that trigger unintended actions in the application when the webhook is fired.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Gitea Features for Malicious Purposes - Abuse Repository Features](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_gitea_features_for_malicious_purposes_-_abuse_repository_features.md)

- Introduce malicious code into repositories:
    - Compromise developer account with push access:
        - Attackers gain control of a developer's Gitea account, allowing them to directly modify the codebase.
        - Inject backdoors or vulnerabilities into the application codebase:
            - With push access, attackers can introduce malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities into the application's source code.
    - Exploit vulnerabilities in pull request review process:
        - Attackers exploit weaknesses in the code review process to sneak malicious code into the main branch.
        - Sneak malicious code through review and merge:
            - This could involve subtle changes that are overlooked during review, or collusion with a compromised reviewer.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Gitea Features for Malicious Purposes - Abuse API Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_gitea_features_for_malicious_purposes_-_abuse_api_functionality.md)

- Exploit insecure storage of API credentials in the application:
    - If the application stores Gitea API keys insecurely (e.g., hardcoded, in easily accessible configuration files), attackers can retrieve these keys and use them to access Gitea's API with the application's privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Gitea Infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_gitea_infrastructure.md)

- Exploit vulnerabilities in underlying operating system or libraries:
    - Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the operating system, libraries, or other software running on the Gitea server.
    - Gain access to the Gitea server:
        - Successful exploitation grants the attacker direct access to the server hosting Gitea.
- Exploit misconfigurations in Gitea deployment:
    - Weak database credentials:
        - If the Gitea database credentials are weak or default, attackers can gain direct access to the database.
        - Access and manipulate Gitea database, potentially affecting application data:
            - Direct database access allows attackers to read, modify, or delete any data within the Gitea database, potentially impacting the application if it relies on this data.
    - Default or weak Gitea administrator credentials:
        - If the default administrator credentials are not changed or a weak password is used, attackers can easily gain full administrative control over the Gitea instance.
        - Gain full control over Gitea instance:
            - With administrator access, attackers can manage users, repositories, settings, and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Social Engineering against Gitea administrators:
    - Attackers use social engineering tactics to trick Gitea administrators into revealing their credentials.
    - Obtain credentials to Gitea server or administrator accounts:
        - Successful social engineering can provide attackers with legitimate credentials to access the Gitea server or administrator accounts.
