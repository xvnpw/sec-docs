# Attack Surface Analysis for go-gitea/gitea

## Attack Surface: [Compromised SSH Keys:](./attack_surfaces/compromised_ssh_keys.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to repositories and the ability to perform Git operations (push, pull, etc.) using a compromised user's SSH private key.
*   **How Gitea Contributes:** Gitea manages the association of SSH public keys with user accounts for authentication and authorization to repositories.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a developer's laptop and steals their private SSH key. They then use this key to push malicious code into a critical repository.
*   **Impact:** Code injection, data breaches, supply chain attacks, unauthorized modifications to the codebase.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users:**
        *   Securely store private SSH keys (e.g., using encrypted storage, hardware security modules).
        *   Use strong passphrases to protect private keys.
        *   Regularly rotate SSH keys.
        *   Revoke keys immediately upon suspicion of compromise.
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement branch protection rules to prevent direct pushes to critical branches.
        *   Enforce code review processes.
        *   Monitor Git logs for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Issues/Pull Requests:](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_issuespull_requests.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious scripts into issue descriptions, comments, or pull request content that are executed in the browsers of other users viewing the content.
*   **How Gitea Contributes:** Gitea renders user-provided content (Markdown, HTML) in issue tracking and pull request features. If not properly sanitized, this can lead to XSS.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into a comment on a pull request. When another developer views this pull request, the script executes, potentially stealing their session cookie or redirecting them to a phishing site.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, credential theft, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided content.
        *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
        *   Regularly update Gitea to benefit from security patches.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Be cautious when clicking on links or interacting with content from untrusted sources within Gitea.
        *   Keep your web browser up to date.
        *   Use browser extensions that can help mitigate XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Bypass:](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Circumventing the intended authentication and authorization mechanisms of the Gitea API to gain unauthorized access to data or functionality.
*   **How Gitea Contributes:** Gitea provides a RESTful API for interacting with its features. Vulnerabilities in the API's authentication or authorization logic can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker finds a flaw in how Gitea validates API tokens, allowing them to forge a valid token for another user or an administrator, granting them access to sensitive API endpoints.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of repositories or user accounts, denial-of-service attacks via API abuse.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust and well-tested authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints.
        *   Follow security best practices for API development (e.g., least privilege principle, input validation).
        *   Regularly audit API endpoints for vulnerabilities.
        *   Enforce rate limiting on API requests to prevent abuse.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Securely store and manage API tokens.
        *   Only grant necessary permissions to API tokens.

## Attack Surface: [Markdown Rendering Vulnerabilities:](./attack_surfaces/markdown_rendering_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Markdown rendering engine used by Gitea to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive information.
*   **How Gitea Contributes:** Gitea uses a Markdown rendering engine to display user-provided content in issues, pull requests, and other areas. If the engine has vulnerabilities, malicious Markdown can be crafted to exploit them.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a specific Markdown payload that, when rendered by Gitea, allows them to execute arbitrary commands on the server or access files outside of the intended scope.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Keep the Markdown rendering engine updated to the latest version with security patches.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed or more secure Markdown rendering library.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization even for Markdown content.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Be cautious when viewing content from untrusted sources within Gitea.
