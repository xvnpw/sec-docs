# Threat Model Analysis for go-gitea/gitea

## Threat: [Default Administrator Credentials Exploitation](./threats/default_administrator_credentials_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to log in to the Gitea instance using default administrator credentials (if not changed after installation). This could be done through brute-force attempts or by leveraging publicly known default credentials.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Gitea instance, including access to all repositories, user data, and the ability to modify configurations and execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Affected Component:** `routers/web/user/auth.go` (authentication handling), potentially impacting the entire Gitea application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Immediately change default administrator credentials during the initial setup.
- Enforce strong password policies for all users.
- Consider implementing account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts.

## Threat: [API Key Compromise Leading to Unauthorized Actions](./threats/api_key_compromise_leading_to_unauthorized_actions.md)

**Description:** An attacker obtains a valid Gitea API key (e.g., through phishing, insecure storage, or a data breach). They then use this key to perform actions on behalf of the legitimate user, such as modifying repositories, creating users, or accessing sensitive information via the API.

**Impact:** Unauthorized modification of code, data breaches, privilege escalation, and potential disruption of development workflows.

**Affected Component:** `modules/auth/api.go` (API authentication), `routers/api/v1/*` (various API endpoints).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Store API keys securely (e.g., using secrets management tools).
- Implement granular API key permissions, limiting access to only necessary resources.
- Regularly rotate API keys.
- Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Git Command Injection via Webhooks](./threats/git_command_injection_via_webhooks.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates webhook configurations or data sent through webhooks to inject malicious Git commands that are executed by the Gitea server. This could happen if Gitea or integrated applications directly execute Git commands based on webhook data without proper sanitization.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the Gitea server, potentially leading to full server compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `modules/webhook/deliver.go` (webhook delivery and processing), potentially impacting any module that handles webhook events and executes Git commands.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Avoid directly executing Git commands based on webhook data.
- If necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate all input received from webhooks.
- Implement strong verification mechanisms for incoming webhooks (e.g., using secret tokens).

## Threat: [Unauthorized Repository Access due to Permission Misconfiguration](./threats/unauthorized_repository_access_due_to_permission_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to a private repository due to misconfigured permissions (e.g., accidentally granting public access, incorrect team assignments, or vulnerabilities in the permission model). They can then view, clone, or potentially modify the repository's contents.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive source code, intellectual property, or confidential data. Potential for malicious code injection or data tampering.

**Affected Component:** `modules/permission/*` (permission management), `routers/repo/*` (repository access control).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement the principle of least privilege when assigning repository permissions.
- Regularly review and audit repository permissions.
- Use teams and organizational structures to manage access effectively.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Gitea's Authentication Mechanisms](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_gitea's_authentication_mechanisms.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages a security vulnerability in Gitea's authentication logic (e.g., flaws in password reset mechanisms, session management, or OAuth implementation) to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to user accounts or the entire instance.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, repositories, and potentially administrative functions. Data breaches, code tampering, and disruption of service.

**Affected Component:** `modules/auth/*` (authentication modules), `routers/web/user/auth.go`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Keep Gitea updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
- Follow Gitea's best practices for authentication configuration.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data](./threats/insecure_storage_of_sensitive_data.md)

**Description:** Gitea might store sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, API keys, session tokens) in an insecure manner, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access if the underlying storage is compromised.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potentially leading to account takeovers, data breaches, or further attacks.

**Affected Component:** `modules/setting/*` (configuration management), `modules/auth/*` (authentication data storage), potentially the database layer.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Ensure sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Follow secure coding practices for handling sensitive information.
- Secure the underlying database and file system used by Gitea.
