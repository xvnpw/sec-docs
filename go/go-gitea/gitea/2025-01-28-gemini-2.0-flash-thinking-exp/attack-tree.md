*   Exploit known vulnerabilities in OS or dependencies:
    *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Critical
        *   Effort: Medium
        *   Skill Level: Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
*   **Description:** Running Gitea on an outdated or unpatched operating system or using vulnerable libraries creates opportunities for attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation can lead to full server compromise, command execution, or privilege escalation.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement a robust patch management process for the operating system and all installed libraries. Regularly scan for vulnerabilities and apply security updates promptly.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Gitea Configuration/Deployment Issues - Insecure Deployment Environment - Unpatched server software [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_gitea_configurationdeployment_issues_-_insecure_deployment_environment_-_unpatched_server_bd130468.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Unpatched server software:
    *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Critical
        *   Effort: Medium
        *   Skill Level: Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
*   **Description:** Similar to OS vulnerabilities, running outdated or unpatched server software (like the web server or database server) exposes the Gitea instance to known vulnerabilities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can result in full server compromise.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement a patch management process for all server software. Regularly update and patch all server components.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Exploit Gitea Configuration/Deployment Issues - Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data - Unencrypted storage of sensitive data [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/7__exploit_gitea_configurationdeployment_issues_-_insecure_storage_of_sensitive_data_-_unencrypted_s_5610c72c.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Unencrypted storage of sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database credentials in plaintext config files):
    *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: Critical
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Low
        *   Detection Difficulty: Hard
*   **Description:** Storing sensitive data like API keys, database credentials, or encryption keys in plaintext configuration files or other insecure locations makes them easily accessible if an attacker gains access to the server or configuration files. This can lead to complete system compromise and data breaches.
*   **Mitigation:** Never store sensitive data in plaintext. Use encryption at rest for sensitive data. Utilize secrets management systems to securely store and manage secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Exploit Gitea Integrations/Features - Git Submodules/LFS Exploitation - Malicious Submodule Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/8__exploit_gitea_integrationsfeatures_-_git_submoduleslfs_exploitation_-_malicious_submodule_injecti_ba7489a5.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Malicious Submodule Injection:
    *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: High
        *   Effort: Medium
        *   Skill Level: Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: Hard
*   **Description:** Attackers can compromise a Git submodule repository and inject malicious code. When developers clone or update the main repository containing this submodule, the malicious code is pulled into their local environments, potentially leading to code execution on developer machines and supply chain compromise.
*   **Mitigation:** Exercise caution when using submodules from untrusted sources. Regularly audit submodules for potential malicious code. Implement code review processes for submodule updates. Consider using dependency scanning tools for submodules.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Supply Chain Attacks via Gitea Dependencies - Compromise Gitea dependencies - Exploit vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Gitea [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/9__supply_chain_attacks_via_gitea_dependencies_-_compromise_gitea_dependencies_-_exploit_vulnerabili_2628a176.md)
