### Vulnerability: PATH Environment Variable Hijacking Leading to Arbitrary Command Execution

- **Description:**  
  The `homedir` package’s `Dir()` function (in the Unix-specific branch) determines the user’s home directory by falling back to system commands when the `HOME` environment variable is not set. In particular, on Darwin systems it runs:
  ```
  exec.Command("sh", "-c", `dscl -q . -read /Users/"$(whoami)" NFSHomeDirectory | sed 's/^[^ ]*: //'`)
  ```
  and in other Unix-like systems it runs:
  ```
  exec.Command("getent", "passwd", strconv.Itoa(os.Getuid()))
  ```
  as well as a fallback:
  ```
  exec.Command("sh", "-c", "cd && pwd")
  ```
  None of these invocations specify an absolute path for the executables (e.g. `/bin/sh` or `/usr/bin/getent`), but rely on the process’s `PATH` environment variable to locate them. If an attacker is able to control or influence the `PATH` variable in the execution environment—such as through insecure deployment configurations—malicious executables placed in an attacker-controlled directory (with the same names as the expected binaries) would be run instead. An external attacker who can force the process into an environment with a manipulated `PATH` (for example, via a misconfigured startup script or vulnerable container settings) could thereby trigger execution of their malicious code.

- **Impact:**  
  Exploitation of this vulnerability could result in arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the running process. In a worst-case scenario—especially if the process runs with elevated privileges—this could lead to a complete system compromise.

- **Vulnerability Rank:**  
  Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The library does not explicitly mitigate this risk internally. It relies on invoking system commands using the default environment, which means the resolution of command names (e.g. `"sh"` and `"getent"`) is entirely determined by the runtime’s `PATH` variable.

- **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - **Absolute Path Specification:** The code should invoke commands using an absolute path (for example, using `/bin/sh` instead of `"sh"`).
  - **Environment Sanitization:** Alternatively, the code should sanitize or explicitly set a safe `PATH` environment variable for the external command invocations.
  - **Reduced Shell Reliance:** Avoid using `sh -c` when it is not necessary or limit the command’s scope to avoid shell interpretation issues.

- **Preconditions:**  
  - The application is running in an environment where an attacker can influence or control the `PATH` environment variable (e.g., due to insecure process startup or container misconfiguration).
  - The process runs in a context where these external commands (like `sh` or `getent`) are called as part of user request handling (such as through public API endpoints).
  - The affected process has not overridden or sanitized its `PATH`, thereby allowing an attacker to substitute malicious executables.

- **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In the `dirUnix()` function (starting around line 47), the code first attempts to use the `HOME` environment variable. If that is not set, on Darwin systems it constructs and executes the command:
    ```go
    exec.Command("sh", "-c", `dscl -q . -read /Users/"$(whoami)" NFSHomeDirectory | sed 's/^[^ ]*: //'`)
    ```
    This invocation uses the command name `"sh"` without an absolute path, relying on `PATH` for its resolution.
  - In the alternative Unix branch (for non-Darwin systems), a similar approach is used with:
    ```go
    exec.Command("getent", "passwd", strconv.Itoa(os.Getuid()))
    ```
    Again, `"getent"` is resolved via the current `PATH`.
  - Finally, a fallback method executes:
    ```go
    exec.Command("sh", "-c", "cd && pwd")
    ```
    which also depends on the `PATH` to locate `sh`.
  - Since none of these invocations enforce an absolute location for the executables, an attacker with control over the environment’s `PATH` variable could force the process to execute a malicious binary instead.

- **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Preparation:**
     - Create a controlled directory (e.g., `/tmp/malicious_bin`) and place a malicious executable named `sh` (or `getent`). This executable could simply write a distinct marker to a log file or echo a predetermined message to prove it was invoked.
  2. **Environment Setup:**
     - Launch the vulnerable application (or a test harness that calls `Dir()`) with its `PATH` environment variable modified so that `/tmp/malicious_bin` is at the very beginning. For example:
       ```
       export PATH=/tmp/malicious_bin:$PATH
       ```
  3. **Triggering the Vulnerability:**
     - Cause the library’s home directory resolution to be invoked. This can be done by ensuring that the `HOME` environment variable is unset (or empty) so that the code falls back to calling one of the external commands.
  4. **Observation:**
     - Check the logs or outputs that would be produced by the malicious executable. If the marker or expected malicious behavior is observed (such as the creation of a log file, or an altered output from the `Dir()` function), this confirms that the externally controlled `PATH` forced the execution of the attacker’s binary.
  5. **Confirmation:**
     - Repeat the test under controlled conditions to verify that the vulnerability is reproducible and that the malicious executable is consistently invoked.
