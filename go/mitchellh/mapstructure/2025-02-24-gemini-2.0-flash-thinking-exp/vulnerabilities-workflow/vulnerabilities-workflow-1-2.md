- **Vulnerability Name:** Information Disclosure via Detailed Error Messages in Type Conversion

- **Description:**  
  The library’s various type‐conversion routines (for example, in functions such as `decodeInt`, `decodeString`, `decodeBool`, etc.) generate error messages that explicitly include the expected type, the actual type encountered, and even the raw input value. An external attacker who is able to supply untrusted (or crafted) input can deliberately send values with mismatched types (for instance, supplying an integer for a field defined as a string). When the conversion fails, the returned error message contains detailed internal information about the expected structure and type details. If these error messages are propagated—whether directly to a user in an API response or via logs that are accessible to an attacker—the internal implementation details of the system are disclosed.

- **Impact:**  
  Attackers can leverage the detailed error messages to learn about the internal data structures and type expectations of the target application. This information can be used to craft further targeted attacks (such as using the exposed data model and type details to bypass validation or to improve probing of system behavior). In environments where error messages are returned to clients or stored in accessible logs, sensitive internal metadata may be disclosed.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  The library itself does not perform any sanitization or abstraction on these error messages. The errors are constructed directly via calls to functions such as `fmt.Errorf` (as seen in functions like `decodeInt`, `decodeString`, etc.) and then aggregated into a custom `Error` type (defined in *error.go*). There is no built‑in mechanism to remove or mask internal type names or raw data values from these messages.

- **Missing Mitigations:**  
  A mitigating control would be to add a configuration option (or to modify the default behavior) so that when errors are generated during type conversion, the library either:  
  • Redacts or abstracts away internal type information and raw input data (for example, by replacing them with generic placeholders) before propagating the error, or  
  • Logs the full details only on an internal debug channel while returning a sanitized error message to a caller.  
  As it stands, no such mitigation exists in the library code.

- **Preconditions:**  
  An attacker must be able to supply input data (for example, via a JSON payload or other data stream that is decoded by the application using this library) and—more critically—have the application return or log the detailed error messages to a location where the attacker can retrieve them. In other words, the vulnerability is exploitable when untrusted input is decoded and error details are not suitably sanitized before exposure.

- **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In functions such as `decodeInt` (and similarly in `decodeString`, `decodeBool`, etc.), after attempting to convert the input value to the expected type, the code uses a statement like:  
    ```go
    return fmt.Errorf("'%s' expected type '%s', got unconvertible type '%s', value: '%v'", name, val.Type(), dataVal.Type(), data)
    ```  
    This error string reveals the field name, the expected type (derived from the target struct), the actual dynamic type of the supplied data, and the unaltered value itself.
  - These errors are then aggregated into an `Error` struct (see *error.go*) that simply joins the messages together.  
  - Because there is no filtering or sanitization of the error text, if an application passes these errors along—whether in logs or as part of an HTTP response—the internal type and structure information becomes visible to any external party who can trigger a type mismatch.

- **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Setup:**  
     Create a simple struct that defines the expected type for a field. For example:
     ```go
     type User struct {
         Username string
     }
     ```
  2. **Malicious Input:**  
     Prepare an input map that deliberately uses the wrong type for the field:
     ```go
     input := map[string]interface{}{
         "Username": 123,  // the field expects a string
     }
     ```
  3. **Triggering the Vulnerability:**  
     Invoke the decoder:
     ```go
     var user User
     err := Decode(input, &user)
     if err != nil {
         // The error message will be returned.
         fmt.Println(err.Error())
     }
     ```
  4. **Observation:**  
     The returned error message should look similar to:
     ```
     'Username' expected type 'string', got unconvertible type 'int', value: '123'
     ```
     This confirms that internal type information and the raw input value are exposed.
  5. **Result:**  
     An attacker monitoring responses or logs where such errors are output could use the detailed information to map out internal data structures and refine further attacks.

---

In summary, if applications using this library do not sanitize or obscure error messages before exposing them externally, an attacker can trigger detailed type conversion errors that leak internal implementation details. This information disclosure vulnerability is rated as high risk.
