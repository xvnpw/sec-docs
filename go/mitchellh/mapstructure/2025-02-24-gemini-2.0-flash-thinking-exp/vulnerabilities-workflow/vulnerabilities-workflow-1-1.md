## Vulnerability List for mapstructure Library

### 1. Potential Type Confusion via Decode Hooks leading to Unintended Behavior

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious input map.
    2. This input is designed to be decoded into a Go struct using the `mapstructure` library.
    3. The decoding process utilizes a `DecodeHookFunc` that is intended to perform type conversions or data sanitization.
    4. However, due to a vulnerability in the decode hook logic or the way `mapstructure` handles decode hooks, the attacker can cause a type confusion.
    5. This type confusion allows the decode hook to return a value of an unexpected type, which is then incorrectly processed by the `mapstructure` library in subsequent decoding steps.
    6. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect data being written to the target struct, program logic bypasses, or potentially memory corruption if the type confusion is severe enough and mishandled later in the application using the decoded struct.

- Impact:
    - High: Depending on the application logic that uses the decoded struct, this vulnerability can lead to data integrity issues, application malfunctions, or in severe cases, potentially escalate to other vulnerabilities if the type confusion allows bypassing security checks or corrupting memory in a way that can be exploited. The impact is highly application-dependent, but the potential for significant issues is there.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None in the `mapstructure` library itself to prevent misuse of decode hooks. The library provides the functionality of decode hooks but relies on the user to implement them securely and correctly.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation within the `mapstructure` library to verify the type returned by `DecodeHookFunc` against the expected type.
    - Clearer documentation and examples emphasizing the security implications of using decode hooks and the importance of careful type handling within them.
    - Potentially, a mechanism to enforce stricter type contracts for decode hooks, although this might reduce flexibility.

- Preconditions:
    - The application using `mapstructure` must be using `DecodeHookFunc`.
    - The attacker must have control over the input data being decoded.
    - The decode hook implementation must have a flaw that allows it to return an unexpected type under certain input conditions.

- Source code analysis:
    1. **File: /code/decode_hooks.go**
    2. The `DecodeHookExec` function is responsible for executing decode hooks:
       ```go
       func DecodeHookExec(
           raw DecodeHookFunc,
           from reflect.Value, to reflect.Value) (interface{}, error) {

           switch f := typedDecodeHook(raw).(type) {
           case DecodeHookFuncType:
               return f(from.Type(), to.Type(), from.Interface())
           case DecodeHookFuncKind:
               return f(from.Kind(), to.Kind(), from.Interface())
           case DecodeHookFuncValue:
               return f(from, to)
           default:
               return nil, errors.New("invalid decode hook signature")
           }
       }
       ```
    3. This function calls the user-provided decode hook and directly returns the `interface{}` result.
    4. **File: /code/mapstructure.go**
    5. The `decode` function, which is the core decoding logic, calls `DecodeHookExec`:
       ```go
       if d.config.DecodeHook != nil {
           // We have a DecodeHook, so let's pre-process the input.
           var err error
           input, err = DecodeHookExec(d.config.DecodeHook, inputVal, outVal)
           if err != nil {
               return fmt.Errorf("error decoding '%s': %w", name, err)
           }
       }
       ```
    6. The result of `DecodeHookExec` is assigned back to `input` and used in subsequent decoding steps (`d.decode("", input, reflect.ValueOf(d.config.Result).Elem())`).
    7. **Vulnerability:** If a malicious `DecodeHookFunc` (either intentionally crafted by a developer or due to a vulnerability in a legitimate hook) returns a value with a type that is not expected by the subsequent `decode` logic, type confusion can occur. For example, a hook intended to sanitize strings might mistakenly return an integer or a struct in certain edge cases. The `decode` function might then try to process this unexpected type as if it were the original expected type, leading to incorrect behavior or errors. The `mapstructure` library does not perform runtime type checks on the return value of the decode hook to ensure it's compatible with the expected decoding path.

- Security test case:
    1. Create a vulnerable `DecodeHookFunc` that, under a specific input condition, returns a value of an unexpected type. For example, a hook that should return a string but returns an integer when the input string is "SPECIAL_VALUE".
    2. Define a target struct that expects a string field.
    3. Craft an input map that includes the "SPECIAL_VALUE" for the field that will be processed by the vulnerable decode hook.
    4. Configure `mapstructure` decoder to use the vulnerable `DecodeHookFunc` and decode the malicious input map into the target struct.
    5. Assert that the decoding process does not result in an error (as basic type checks might pass), but the target struct field contains an unexpected value or type (e.g., an integer instead of a string, or a default value due to type mismatch) indicating type confusion.
    6. Demonstrate how this type confusion can be leveraged in a simple application scenario to cause unintended behavior, such as bypassing a validation check that assumes the field is always a string, while it's now an integer due to the hook's unexpected output.
