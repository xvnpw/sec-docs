### Vulnerability List for mapstructure Project

* Vulnerability Name: Potential Type Confusion due to WeaklyTypedInput and Decode Hooks interaction

* Description:
    1. An attacker can craft a malicious input map.
    2. This input map is designed to be decoded into a Go struct using the `mapstructure` library with `WeaklyTypedInput` enabled.
    3. A `DecodeHookFunc` is also configured during the decoding process.
    4. Due to the weakly typed input, the initial type checking might be bypassed.
    5. The `DecodeHookFunc`, expecting a certain type based on the (potentially bypassed) initial type check, might receive a different type than anticipated.
    6. This type mismatch within the `DecodeHookFunc` can lead to unexpected behavior, type confusion, or even vulnerabilities if the hook performs operations based on incorrect type assumptions.

* Impact:
    - Type confusion within the application logic.
    - Potential for unexpected program behavior.
    - In certain scenarios, if the `DecodeHookFunc` interacts with external systems or performs security-sensitive operations based on type assumptions, this vulnerability could be escalated to information disclosure or other more severe impacts depending on the application context.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the `mapstructure` library itself to prevent this specific interaction issue. The library provides `WeaklyTypedInput` and `DecodeHookFunc` as features, but doesn't inherently manage their potentially unsafe compositions.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation within Decode Hooks:** Decode hooks should implement robust type checking and validation of the input `data` they receive, especially when used with `WeaklyTypedInput`. This is currently the responsibility of the user of the library, but the potential for misuse could be highlighted more clearly in documentation and examples.
    - **Documentation Warning:**  Stronger warnings in the documentation about the potential risks of using `WeaklyTypedInput` in conjunction with `DecodeHookFunc` without careful type handling within the hooks.
    - **Example of Safe Decode Hook Usage with WeaklyTypedInput:** Provide examples in documentation and tests demonstrating how to write decode hooks that are resilient to weakly typed input and perform necessary type assertions and error handling.

* Preconditions:
    - Application uses `mapstructure.Decode` or similar functions.
    - `DecoderConfig` is configured with `WeaklyTypedInput: true`.
    - A `DecodeHookFunc` is implemented and used in the `DecoderConfig`.
    - The target struct and decode hook logic are designed in a way that a type mismatch in the hook can lead to exploitable behavior.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`mapstructure.go:DecodeHookExec` Function:** This function is responsible for executing the decode hook. It takes a `DecodeHookFunc`, a `from reflect.Value`, and a `to reflect.Value`.
    ```go
    func DecodeHookExec(
    	raw DecodeHookFunc,
    	from reflect.Value, to reflect.Value) (interface{}, error) {

    	switch f := typedDecodeHook(raw).(type) {
    	case DecodeHookFuncType:
    		return f(from.Type(), to.Type(), from.Interface())
    	case DecodeHookFuncKind:
    		return f(from.Kind(), to.Kind(), from.Interface())
    	case DecodeHookFuncValue:
    		return f(from, to)
    	default:
    		return nil, errors.New("invalid decode hook signature")
    	}
    }
    ```
    - The `DecodeHookExec` function calls the user-provided decode hook (`raw`).
    - If `WeaklyTypedInput` is enabled, the `from` `reflect.Value` might represent a weakly-typed value that has undergone type conversion. However, the decode hook might still be expecting the original type, or make assumptions about the type.
    2. **`mapstructure.go:decode*` Functions:** The various `decode*` functions (e.g., `decodeInt`, `decodeString`, `decodeBool`) handle type conversions when `WeaklyTypedInput` is true. These conversions happen *before* the `DecodeHookFunc` is called.
    ```go
    func (d *Decoder) decode(name string, input interface{}, outVal reflect.Value) error {
        // ...
        if d.config.DecodeHook != nil { // Decode hook is called here
            // We have a DecodeHook, so let's pre-process the input.
            var err error
            input, err = DecodeHookExec(d.config.DecodeHook, inputVal, outVal)
            if err != nil {
                return fmt.Errorf("error decoding '%s': %w", name, err)
            }
        }
        // ...
        switch outputKind { // Type based decoding happens after hook
        // ...
        }
    }
    ```
    - The `decode` function is the core decoding logic. The `DecodeHookExec` is called *before* the type-specific decoding logic (the `switch outputKind` block).
    - This means the `DecodeHookFunc` operates on the potentially weakly-typed `input` after initial weak conversions but before final assignment to the struct field.
    3. **Vulnerability Scenario:**
        - Consider a struct with an integer field and a decode hook expecting an integer.
        - If `WeaklyTypedInput` is enabled and the input map provides a string value for this field, the `decodeInt` function (or similar) might weakly convert the string to an integer *before* the decode hook is called.
        - However, if the decode hook logic assumes the *original* input was an integer (perhaps for specific validation or processing), it could be confused by receiving a string that was weakly converted, leading to unexpected behavior.
        - If the decode hook performs actions based on the assumption of the original input type (e.g., accessing string-specific properties that don't exist on integers after weak conversion), it could lead to panics or vulnerabilities.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Define a vulnerable struct and decode hook:**
    ```go
    type VulnerableStruct struct {
        Value int
    }

    var typeConfusionTriggered bool

    decodeHook := func(from reflect.Type, to reflect.Type, data interface{}) (interface{}, error) {
        if to == reflect.TypeOf(VulnerableStruct{}) {
            // Intentionally incorrect type assertion to simulate vulnerability
            strValue := data.(string) // Expecting string, but could be int due to weak type conversion
            if strValue == "trigger" {
                typeConfusionTriggered = true
            }
        }
        return data, nil
    }
    ```
    2. **Craft a malicious input map:**
    ```go
    input := map[string]interface{}{
        "value": "123", // Intended to be weakly converted to int
    }
    ```
    3. **Configure Decoder with WeaklyTypedInput and the vulnerable decode hook:**
    ```go
    var result VulnerableStruct
    config := &DecoderConfig{
        WeaklyTypedInput: true,
        DecodeHook:      decodeHook,
        Result:           &result,
    }
    decoder, err := NewDecoder(config)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    ```
    4. **Execute Decode:**
    ```go
    err = decoder.Decode(input)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    ```
    5. **Assert vulnerability:** Check if `typeConfusionTriggered` is true, or if the program exhibits unexpected behavior due to the type confusion in the decode hook.
    ```go
    if typeConfusionTriggered {
        fmt.Println("Vulnerability Triggered: Type confusion occurred in decode hook.")
        // Fail the test or report vulnerability
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Vulnerability Not Triggered as expected (or mitigation in place).")
        // Pass the test if mitigation is expected
    }
    ```
    6. **Expected Result:** The test case should demonstrate that even though the input value is a string "123", due to `WeaklyTypedInput`, it gets weakly converted to an integer before reaching the decode hook. If the decode hook incorrectly asserts the type to be a string (as shown in the example), it will panic or exhibit unexpected behavior, demonstrating the type confusion vulnerability.

This vulnerability highlights a potential unsafe interaction between `WeaklyTypedInput` and `DecodeHookFunc`. While not a direct vulnerability in `mapstructure`'s code itself, it represents a high-risk usage pattern that can lead to vulnerabilities in applications using the library if decode hooks are not carefully designed to handle weakly-typed inputs. The missing mitigations focus on better documentation and user guidance to avoid this pitfall.
