## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Harbor Registry Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_harbor_registry_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

This represents the fundamental risk associated with the Harbor Registry, where container images are stored. Compromising the registry can directly lead to the compromise of applications pulling images from it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Image into Registry [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_image_into_registry__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Registry API Vulnerability:** Attackers leverage known security flaws in the Harbor Registry's API to push malicious images without proper authorization or validation. This could involve exploiting known CVEs.
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Compromise Registry Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Brute-force/Credential Stuffing:** Attackers attempt to guess or use lists of known username/password combinations to gain access to legitimate registry accounts.
        *   **Phishing/Social Engineering against Registry Admins:** Attackers manipulate or deceive registry administrators into revealing their credentials through phishing emails, fake login pages, or other social engineering tactics.
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Bypass Image Scanning:**
        *   **Exploit Clair/Trivy Vulnerability:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within the vulnerability scanning tools (Clair or Trivy) to prevent them from correctly identifying malicious components within an image.
        *   **Craft Image to Evade Detection:** Attackers carefully construct container images using obfuscation techniques, packing malicious payloads in ways that are not easily detected by standard vulnerability scanners.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Compromise Registry Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__compromise_registry_credentials__critical_node_.md)

**Brute-force/Credential Stuffing:** Attackers attempt to guess or use lists of known username/password combinations to gain access to legitimate registry accounts.
        *   **Phishing/Social Engineering against Registry Admins:** Attackers manipulate or deceive registry administrators into revealing their credentials through phishing emails, fake login pages, or other social engineering tactics.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Bypass Image Scanning](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__bypass_image_scanning.md)

**Exploit Clair/Trivy Vulnerability:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within the vulnerability scanning tools (Clair or Trivy) to prevent them from correctly identifying malicious components within an image.
        *   **Craft Image to Evade Detection:** Attackers carefully construct container images using obfuscation techniques, packing malicious payloads in ways that are not easily detected by standard vulnerability scanners.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Existing Images](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_existing_images.md)

**[HIGH RISK PATH] Compromise Registry Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:** (See details above) Attackers with compromised registry credentials can modify existing, seemingly trusted images to include malicious payloads.
    *   **Exploit Registry API Vulnerability:** (See details above) Similar to injecting malicious images, API vulnerabilities can be used to alter existing images.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Harbor UI/API Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_harbor_uiapi_weaknesses.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Bypass Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__bypass_authenticationauthorization__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Vulnerability in Authentication Mechanism:** Attackers exploit flaws in how Harbor verifies user identities, potentially allowing them to bypass login requirements. This often involves exploiting known CVEs in Harbor's authentication components.
        *   **Exploit Vulnerability in Authorization Logic:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in how Harbor grants permissions, allowing them to access resources or perform actions they are not authorized for.
        *   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers steal or intercept valid user session identifiers (e.g., cookies) to impersonate legitimate users without needing their credentials.
        *   **Credential Reuse from other breaches:** Attackers leverage usernames and passwords exposed in data breaches from other services, hoping users have reused these credentials for their Harbor accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Harbor Database Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_harbor_database_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Compromise Database Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__compromise_database_credentials__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Misconfiguration (e.g., default credentials):** Attackers exploit default or easily guessable credentials for the underlying Harbor database.
        *   **Brute-force/Dictionary Attack:** Attackers attempt to guess database credentials using automated tools and lists of common passwords.
        *   **Accessing exposed configuration files:** Attackers find and access configuration files that contain database credentials, often due to misconfigurations or lax file permissions.
