# Threat Model Analysis for goharbor/harbor

## Threat: [Weak Default Administrator Credentials](./threats/weak_default_administrator_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to log in to the Harbor administrator account using well-known default credentials (e.g., `admin`/`Harbor12345`). If successful, they gain full administrative access.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the Harbor instance, including the ability to manage users, repositories, images, and configurations. This could lead to data breaches, service disruption, and the injection of malicious content.
*   **Affected Component:** `Core`, `Authentication Module`
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Immediately change the default administrator password during initial setup. Enforce strong password policies for all users.

## Threat: [Insufficiently Restrictive RBAC Policies](./threats/insufficiently_restrictive_rbac_policies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, with access to a low-privileged account, could exploit overly permissive role-based access control (RBAC) configurations to gain access to repositories or perform actions they are not intended to (e.g., deleting images, modifying configurations).
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to container images, potential data loss through deletion, and possible disruption of application deployments.
*   **Affected Component:** `Core`, `Authorization Module`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement the principle of least privilege when assigning roles. Regularly review and audit RBAC policies. Utilize namespaces and projects to further isolate access.

## Threat: [API Key Compromise Leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/api_key_compromise_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could obtain API keys (through various means like exposed configuration files, network interception, or insider threats) and use them to authenticate and interact with the Harbor API, performing actions like pulling, pushing, or deleting images without proper authorization.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to container images, potential data breaches, and the ability to inject malicious images into the registry.
*   **Affected Component:** `API`, `Authentication Module`
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Store API keys securely (e.g., using secrets management tools). Implement short expiration times for API keys. Rotate API keys regularly. Monitor API access for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Injection of Malicious Images via Compromised Credentials](./threats/injection_of_malicious_images_via_compromised_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who has compromised user credentials with push access to a repository could push malicious container images containing malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Deployment of compromised containers in the application environment, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** `Registry`, `Push API`
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for users with push access. Implement vulnerability scanning for pushed images. Utilize content trust and image signing.

## Threat: [Content Trust Compromise via Key Exposure](./threats/content_trust_compromise_via_key_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** If the private keys used for signing images within Harbor's content trust (Notary) are compromised, an attacker could sign malicious images, making them appear trusted and bypassing integrity checks.
*   **Impact:** Deployment of compromised containers that are falsely marked as trusted, leading to potential system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** `Notary`, `Content Trust Module`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Securely store and manage Notary signing keys using hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure key management systems. Implement strict access control for key management. Regularly rotate signing keys.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Image Layers in Storage Backend](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_image_layers_in_storage_backend.md)

*   **Description:** If the storage backend used by Harbor (e.g., object storage) has weak access controls or is misconfigured, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the underlying image layers, potentially exposing sensitive data contained within the images.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data stored within container images.
*   **Affected Component:** `Storage Service`, `Object Storage Integration`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong access control policies on the storage backend. Ensure proper authentication and authorization are required to access image layers. Utilize encryption for data at rest in the storage backend.

## Threat: [Data Breach from Harbor Database Vulnerabilities](./threats/data_breach_from_harbor_database_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the database used by Harbor (e.g., PostgreSQL) could be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive metadata, such as user credentials, repository information, and image details.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive Harbor metadata, potentially leading to further compromise of the registry and the applications using it.
*   **Affected Component:** `Database`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Keep the database software up-to-date with the latest security patches. Implement strong database access controls. Regularly audit database configurations. Consider using database encryption.
