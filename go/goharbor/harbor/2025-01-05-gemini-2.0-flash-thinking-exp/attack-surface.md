# Attack Surface Analysis for goharbor/harbor

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  API endpoints are exposed without proper authentication or authorization checks, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data or actions.
    *   **How Harbor Contributes:** Harbor's Core service exposes a REST API for managing repositories, users, projects, and other configurations. Weak or missing authentication/authorization on these endpoints directly exposes this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could use the API to list all repositories, pull private images, or even delete projects without proper credentials.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the Harbor instance, including access to all container images and sensitive configuration data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure all API endpoints require authentication.
        *   Implement robust role-based access control (RBAC) and enforce the principle of least privilege.
        *   Regularly audit API access logs for suspicious activity.
        *   Utilize strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OIDC).

## Attack Surface: [Container Image Manipulation and Malware Injection](./attack_surfaces/container_image_manipulation_and_malware_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can push malicious container images or manipulate existing images within the registry.
    *   **How Harbor Contributes:** Harbor acts as the central repository for container images. If access controls are weak or vulnerabilities exist in the push process, malicious actors can inject malware.
    *   **Example:** An attacker pushes an image with embedded malware that gets deployed across the organization's infrastructure.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of systems running the malicious containers, potential data breaches, and disruption of services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable content trust (Notary) to ensure image integrity and provenance.
        *   Implement vulnerability scanning (Trivy/Clair) and block the pulling of images with critical vulnerabilities.
        *   Enforce strict access control policies on repositories, limiting who can push images.
        *   Regularly audit image contents and scan for known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Credential Compromise for Harbor Components](./attack_surfaces/credential_compromise_for_harbor_components.md)

*   **Description:**  Credentials used by Harbor components (e.g., database, inter-service communication) are compromised.
    *   **How Harbor Contributes:** Harbor relies on various internal credentials for communication between its services. If these credentials are weak, default, or exposed, attackers can gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the PostgreSQL database credentials used by Harbor, allowing them to directly manipulate the Harbor database.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the Harbor instance, potential data loss or corruption, and ability to manipulate Harbor's functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, unique passwords for all Harbor component credentials.
        *   Rotate credentials regularly.
        *   Store credentials securely using secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
        *   Limit access to credential stores.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Harbor's Core Service or Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_harbor's_core_service_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**  Security vulnerabilities exist in the Harbor Core service code or its underlying dependencies.
    *   **How Harbor Contributes:** As a complex application, Harbor and its dependencies may contain exploitable vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a library used by Harbor's API allows for remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution on the Harbor server, leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Harbor and all its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases.
        *   Implement a robust patching process.
