# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for goharbor/harbor

## Mitigation Strategy: [Mandatory Image Scanning](./mitigation_strategies/mandatory_image_scanning.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Enable vulnerability scanning at the project level within Harbor settings. Navigate to Project Settings -> Vulnerability within the Harbor UI.
    2.  Select and configure a vulnerability scanner integration within Harbor's vulnerability settings (e.g., Trivy, Clair). Ensure the scanner is configured with access to vulnerability databases *through Harbor's integration mechanisms*.
    3.  Define vulnerability severity thresholds for blocking image pushes directly within Harbor's project vulnerability settings. Configure Harbor to reject images based on severity levels (e.g., 'Critical' or 'High').
    4.  Ensure the "auto scan" option is enabled for projects in Harbor. This setting, within the project's vulnerability configuration, automatically triggers scans on image pushes.
    5.  Communicate the Harbor vulnerability scanning policy to developers, emphasizing the Harbor UI and API for checking scan results and remediation guidance *within the Harbor context*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Deployment of vulnerable container images (High Severity): Harbor prevents vulnerable images from being used in projects.
    *   Supply chain attacks via vulnerable base images (High Severity): Harbor scans base images stored within it, reducing supply chain risks.
    *   Exposure to known exploits in deployed applications (High Severity): Harbor's scanning helps prevent deployment of images with exploitable vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Deployment of vulnerable container images: High Risk Reduction - Harbor directly prevents vulnerable image deployment.
    *   Supply chain attacks via vulnerable base images: High Risk Reduction - Harbor provides a mechanism to scan and control base images.
    *   Exposure to known exploits in deployed applications: High Risk Reduction - Harbor acts as a gatekeeper against vulnerable images.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, enabled in 'development' and 'staging' Harbor projects. Trivy scanner integrated and configured in Harbor. Rejection of 'High' and 'Critical' vulnerability images is set in Harbor project settings.
    *   Developer documentation references Harbor UI for vulnerability reports.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Not fully enabled in 'production' Harbor project (currently 'scan only' mode). Transition to blocking mode in Harbor production project settings is needed.
    *   Automated ticketing system integration with Harbor vulnerability reports is partially implemented. Direct integration with Harbor API for vulnerability data to trigger ticketing is still under development.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Enforcement](./mitigation_strategies/role-based_access_control__rbac__enforcement.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define roles based on Harbor's built-in RBAC model (e.g., project admin, developer, guest).
    2.  Utilize Harbor's UI or API to create user groups and assign users within Harbor.
    3.  Grant permissions to groups at the project level *within Harbor's project settings*. Assign Harbor roles to groups for specific projects.
    4.  Regularly review user roles and permissions *directly within Harbor's user management and project settings*.
    5.  Document the RBAC model specifically as it is implemented *within Harbor*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized access to container images (High Severity): Harbor's RBAC restricts access based on defined roles.
    *   Data breaches due to compromised credentials (Medium Severity): Harbor's RBAC limits the scope of access even if credentials are compromised.
    *   Accidental or malicious modification/deletion of images (Medium Severity): Harbor's RBAC controls write access to images.
    *   Privilege escalation (Medium Severity): Harbor's RBAC prevents unauthorized privilege elevation within the registry.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access to container images: High Risk Reduction - Harbor's RBAC is the primary control for image access.
    *   Data breaches due to compromised credentials: Medium Risk Reduction - Harbor limits the impact of compromised accounts.
    *   Accidental or malicious modification/deletion of images: Medium Risk Reduction - Harbor protects image integrity through access control.
    *   Privilege escalation: Medium Risk Reduction - Harbor enforces role-based privileges.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Basic Harbor RBAC roles ('developer', 'operator', 'admin') are defined and used in Harbor.
    *   Developers are assigned 'developer' role in Harbor projects.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Granular Harbor RBAC roles need refinement within Harbor. More specific roles (e.g., 'read-only developer' in Harbor) are needed.
    *   Integration with central identity provider (LDAP/AD) for Harbor user authentication is incomplete. Local Harbor accounts are still in use. Harbor needs to be configured to fully leverage external authentication.
    *   Regular access review process for Harbor users and roles is not formalized. Periodic audits within Harbor's user management are needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Harbor Updates and Patching](./mitigation_strategies/regular_harbor_updates_and_patching.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a schedule for updating the Harbor *instance* to the latest stable version. Follow Harbor's release notes and upgrade guides.
    2.  Subscribe to Harbor security advisories *specifically from the Harbor project* to stay informed about vulnerabilities and patches.
    3.  Test Harbor updates in a non-production Harbor environment (staging instance) before production deployment.
    4.  Implement a rollback plan *specifically for the Harbor upgrade process*.
    5.  Document the Harbor update process and track Harbor versions and patches applied.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of known Harbor vulnerabilities (High Severity): Outdated Harbor instances are vulnerable to known exploits.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks (Medium Severity): Harbor vulnerabilities can be exploited for DoS.
    *   Data breaches due to software flaws in Harbor (High Severity): Harbor vulnerabilities could lead to data breaches.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of known Harbor vulnerabilities: High Risk Reduction - Directly addresses Harbor-specific vulnerabilities.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces DoS risks related to Harbor.
    *   Data breaches due to software flaws in Harbor: High Risk Reduction - Minimizes data breach risks from Harbor software flaws.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Harbor is updated every 6 months, but manually.
    *   Subscription to Harbor security mailing list is active.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More frequent and automated Harbor update schedule is needed.
    *   Automated testing of Harbor updates in a staging Harbor instance is missing. Manual testing is currently used.
    *   Rollback plan for Harbor upgrades is not formally documented.
    *   Formal patch management process for Harbor needs to be established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [TLS/SSL Encryption Enforcement](./mitigation_strategies/tlsssl_encryption_enforcement.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Ensure TLS/SSL is enabled for all Harbor communication: web UI, API, and *Harbor's Docker registry component*.
    2.  Use valid TLS certificates for Harbor, configured within Harbor's installation or configuration files.
    3.  Configure Harbor to enforce HTTPS for web UI and API access *through Harbor's web server configuration*.
    4.  Verify TLS configuration for all Harbor components, including the registry, using tools like `openssl s_client` against Harbor's ports.
    5.  Regularly renew TLS certificates used by Harbor, following Harbor's certificate management procedures.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks (High Severity): Protects Harbor communication channels.
    *   Credential theft (High Severity): Secures credentials transmitted to Harbor.
    *   Data interception and manipulation (High Severity): Encrypts data exchanged with Harbor.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks: High Risk Reduction - Prevents MitM attacks on Harbor traffic.
    *   Credential theft: High Risk Reduction - Protects credentials used to access Harbor.
    *   Data interception and manipulation: High Risk Reduction - Ensures confidentiality and integrity of Harbor data.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, TLS/SSL enabled for Harbor web UI and API using Let's Encrypt certificates configured in Harbor.
    *   HTTPS enforced for Harbor web traffic.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Verification of TLS configuration for Harbor's Docker registry port is needed. Ensure image pull/push to Harbor registry is encrypted.
    *   Automated certificate renewal for Harbor is in place for Let's Encrypt, but monitoring is needed.
    *   Stricter TLS configuration for Harbor (TLS versions, cipher suites) based on best practices should be considered in Harbor's configuration.
