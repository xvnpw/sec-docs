## Deep Analysis of Threat: Weak or Default Credentials

**Threat Actor:**

The threat actor could be:

*   **External Malicious Actors:** Individuals or groups attempting to gain unauthorized access for various purposes, such as data theft, sabotage, or using the registry for malicious image distribution.
*   **Internal Malicious Actors:**  Disgruntled or compromised employees with legitimate access to the network who might attempt to exploit default credentials for unauthorized actions.
*   **Automated Bots:** Scripts and bots designed to scan for and exploit systems with default or weak credentials.

**Attack Vectors in Detail:**

*   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attackers can use automated tools to systematically try various username and password combinations against the Harbor login endpoint. The success of this attack depends on the complexity of user passwords and the presence of account lockout mechanisms.
*   **Credential Stuffing:** Attackers leverage lists of compromised credentials obtained from other breaches and attempt to use them to log in to Harbor. This relies on users reusing passwords across multiple services.
*   **Exploiting Publicly Known Default Credentials:**  Harbor, like many applications, has default credentials set upon initial installation (e.g., `admin/Harbor12345`). If these are not immediately changed, attackers can easily find and exploit them.
*   **Social Engineering:** While less direct, attackers might attempt to trick administrators or users into revealing their credentials, especially if they are using weak or default passwords.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

The core authentication module in Harbor likely interacts with a database or an external identity provider (like LDAP/Active Directory) to verify user credentials.

*   **Default Credentials:** The initial setup of Harbor creates a default administrator account. The security of the entire system hinges on the immediate change of this password. If left unchanged, it presents a trivial entry point.
*   **Password Storage:**  The security of stored passwords is crucial. Harbor should employ strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with salting to protect passwords even if the database is compromised. Weak hashing algorithms or no salting significantly increase the risk of password cracking.
*   **Login Endpoint:** The `/login` endpoint is the primary target for this attack. Its implementation needs to be robust against brute-force attempts. This includes rate limiting, CAPTCHA, and account lockout policies.
*   **Session Management:** Once logged in, a session is established. Weak session management practices could allow attackers who have compromised credentials to maintain access even after the legitimate user changes their password.

**Impact Analysis (Detailed):**

Successful exploitation of weak or default credentials can have severe consequences:

*   **Full Administrative Control:** Gaining access with the default administrator account grants complete control over the Harbor instance. This allows the attacker to:
    *   **Manipulate Images:** Delete, modify, or add malicious images to the registry, potentially impacting downstream applications and creating supply chain vulnerabilities.
    *   **Access Sensitive Data:** View and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information about projects, repositories, and users.
    *   **Create New Users:** Create new administrative accounts for persistent access, even after the original vulnerability is addressed.
    *   **Modify Configurations:** Alter critical settings, potentially disabling security features or creating backdoors.
*   **Supply Chain Compromise:** Malicious images injected into the registry can be pulled by other systems, leading to widespread compromise and significant damage.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers could delete critical images or disrupt the registry's functionality, causing a denial of service for dependent applications.
*   **Reputational Damage:** A security breach of this nature can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode trust.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

The underlying vulnerabilities that enable this threat are:

*   **Presence of Default Credentials:** The existence of pre-configured default credentials with known values is a significant security flaw if not addressed immediately.
*   **Weak Password Policies:**  Lack of enforced password complexity requirements allows users to set easily guessable passwords.
*   **Absence of Account Lockout Policies:** Without account lockout, attackers can repeatedly attempt login without consequence.
*   **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  MFA adds an extra layer of security, making it significantly harder for attackers to gain access even with compromised credentials.
*   **Insufficient Monitoring and Alerting:**  Lack of monitoring for suspicious login attempts can delay detection and response to an attack.

**Existing Mitigations (Evaluation):**

*   **Enforce strong password policies for all Harbor users:** This is a crucial first step. However, the effectiveness depends on the strictness of the policy and how well it is enforced. Users might still choose weak passwords that meet the minimum requirements.
*   **Immediately change default administrator passwords upon installation:** This is a critical mitigation. However, it relies on administrators remembering and prioritizing this step during setup. Automated enforcement or reminders could be beneficial.
*   **Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts:** This significantly hinders brute-force attacks. The effectiveness depends on the lockout threshold and duration. Too aggressive a policy could lead to denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security:** MFA is a highly effective mitigation. Its implementation complexity and user adoption need to be considered.

**Gaps in Mitigation:**

*   **Enforcement of Password Changes:** While strong policies are good, periodic mandatory password changes can further reduce the risk of compromised credentials being used long-term.
*   **Proactive Password Strength Checks:**  Integrating tools that actively check the strength of user-chosen passwords during registration or password changes can prevent weak passwords from being set in the first place.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting for Suspicious Activity:** Implementing robust logging and alerting mechanisms for failed login attempts, especially from unusual locations or IP addresses, can enable faster detection and response.
*   **Integration with Centralized Identity Management:**  Integrating Harbor with a centralized identity provider (like Active Directory or Okta) can enforce consistent password policies and provide a single point of authentication and management.
*   **Security Awareness Training:** Educating users and administrators about the risks of weak passwords and the importance of changing default credentials is crucial.

**Recommendations:**

Based on this analysis, the following recommendations are made to the development team:

1. **Mandatory Default Password Change:**  Implement a mechanism that forces users to change the default administrator password upon the first login. This could involve a guided setup process or a temporary password that expires immediately.
2. **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Implement and enforce strict password complexity requirements (minimum length, character types, etc.). Consider integrating with password strength estimation libraries.
3. **Implement Account Lockout with Intelligent Thresholds:** Implement account lockout policies with appropriate thresholds to prevent brute-force attacks without causing excessive lockouts for legitimate users. Consider using techniques like exponential backoff for lockout durations.
4. **Prioritize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Make MFA a high priority for implementation, especially for administrative accounts. Explore different MFA options and choose one that aligns with the organization's security requirements and user experience.
5. **Implement Robust Logging and Alerting:**  Implement comprehensive logging of authentication attempts, including successes and failures. Set up alerts for suspicious activity, such as multiple failed login attempts from the same IP or unusual login times.
6. **Consider Integration with Centralized Identity Management:** Explore integrating Harbor with existing centralized identity management systems to leverage established security policies and streamline user management.
7. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential weaknesses and validate the effectiveness of implemented security measures.
8. **Security Awareness Training:**  Provide regular security awareness training to users and administrators, emphasizing the importance of strong passwords and the risks associated with default credentials.

By addressing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk associated with the "Weak or Default Credentials" threat and enhance the overall security posture of the Harbor application.
