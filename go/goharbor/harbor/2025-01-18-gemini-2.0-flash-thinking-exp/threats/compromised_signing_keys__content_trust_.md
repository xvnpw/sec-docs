### 4. Deep Analysis of Threat: Compromised Signing Keys (Content Trust)

#### 4.1. Threat Actor and Motivation

*   **Threat Actor:**  The threat actor could be an **external attacker** who has gained unauthorized access to the infrastructure hosting Harbor or Notary. This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities in the system, phishing attacks targeting administrators, or supply chain attacks. Alternatively, the threat actor could be a **malicious insider** with legitimate access to the system but with malicious intent.
*   **Motivation:** The primary motivation for compromising signing keys is to **inject malicious container images into the supply chain**. This allows the attacker to:
    *   **Deploy malware:** Introduce malicious code into the application environment, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Bypass security controls:**  Circumvent security checks that rely on content trust verification, making the malicious images appear legitimate.
    *   **Maintain persistence:**  Embed backdoors or other persistent threats within the container images.
    *   **Damage reputation:**  Compromise the integrity of the application and the organization's reputation.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors

Several attack vectors could lead to the compromise of signing keys:

*   **Direct Access to Key Storage:**
    *   **Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Notary server:**  Unpatched vulnerabilities in the Notary service itself could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the server's file system or database where keys are stored.
    *   **Compromising the underlying infrastructure:**  Gaining access to the virtual machines, containers, or physical servers hosting the Notary service. This could be through OS vulnerabilities, weak credentials, or misconfigurations.
    *   **Database compromise:** If Notary uses a database to store keys (depending on the configuration), a compromise of this database could expose the signing keys.
*   **Access Control Failures:**
    *   **Weak or default credentials:**  Using default or easily guessable passwords for accounts with access to key management systems or the Notary server.
    *   **Insufficient access controls:**  Granting overly broad permissions to users or services that do not require access to signing keys.
    *   **Privilege escalation:**  An attacker with limited access could exploit vulnerabilities to gain elevated privileges and access key storage.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks:**
    *   **Compromising the key generation process:**  If the key generation process itself is vulnerable, an attacker could influence the generation of weak or predictable keys.
    *   **Compromising dependencies:**  Malicious code injected into dependencies used by the Notary service could be used to exfiltrate signing keys.
*   **Social Engineering:**
    *   **Phishing attacks:**  Tricking administrators or developers into revealing credentials or providing access to systems where keys are stored.
    *   **Insider threats:**  A malicious insider with legitimate access could intentionally exfiltrate or misuse signing keys.
*   **Software Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Bugs in key management systems (HSMs/KMS):**  Vulnerabilities in the HSM or KMS used to store the keys could be exploited.
    *   **Bugs in the Harbor core service:**  Although less direct, vulnerabilities in the Harbor core service could potentially be chained with other attacks to gain access to key material or influence content trust verification.

#### 4.3. Technical Details of the Attack

1. **Key Compromise:** The attacker successfully gains access to the private signing keys through one of the attack vectors described above. This could involve obtaining the key files directly, extracting them from memory, or gaining access to the HSM/KMS.
2. **Malicious Image Creation:** The attacker crafts a malicious container image containing malware, backdoors, or other harmful code.
3. **Image Signing:** Using the compromised private key, the attacker signs the malicious image. This signature makes the image appear trusted to Harbor and any downstream systems that rely on content trust verification.
4. **Image Push:** The attacker pushes the signed malicious image to the Harbor registry.
5. **Image Pull and Deployment:** When a user or automated system attempts to pull the image, Harbor verifies the signature using the corresponding public key. Since the malicious image is signed with a valid (but compromised) private key, the verification succeeds.
6. **Execution of Malicious Code:** The malicious container image is deployed and executed, leading to the intended impact of the attacker (e.g., data breach, system compromise).

#### 4.4. Impact Analysis (Detailed)

*   **Direct Impact:**
    *   **Deployment of malicious containers:**  The immediate consequence is the execution of malicious code within the application environment.
    *   **Data breaches:**  Malware within the containers could exfiltrate sensitive data.
    *   **System compromise:**  Attackers could gain control of the systems running the malicious containers.
    *   **Denial of service:**  Malicious containers could consume resources and disrupt application availability.
*   **Indirect Impact:**
    *   **Loss of trust:**  Users and stakeholders will lose trust in the integrity of the container images and the application itself.
    *   **Reputational damage:**  A security breach of this nature can severely damage the organization's reputation.
    *   **Supply chain contamination:**  Compromised images could be pulled and used in other environments, spreading the malicious code.
    *   **Compliance violations:**  Depending on the industry and regulations, a security breach involving compromised signing keys could lead to significant fines and penalties.
    *   **Increased security costs:**  Remediation efforts, incident response, and strengthening security controls will incur significant costs.
    *   **Operational disruption:**  Investigating and recovering from the attack can cause significant disruption to development and operations.

#### 4.5. Detection Strategies

Detecting a compromise of signing keys can be challenging, but the following strategies can help:

*   **Monitoring Key Usage:**
    *   **Audit logging of key access:**  Monitor and log all access attempts to the systems where signing keys are stored (Notary server, HSM/KMS).
    *   **Anomaly detection on signing activity:**  Establish baselines for normal signing activity (e.g., frequency, source IP addresses) and alert on deviations.
    *   **Monitoring API calls to Notary:**  Track API calls related to signing and key management for suspicious patterns.
*   **Integrity Monitoring:**
    *   **File integrity monitoring (FIM):**  Monitor the integrity of key files and directories on the Notary server and HSM/KMS.
    *   **Configuration management:**  Track changes to the configuration of the Notary service and key management systems.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Correlate logs from various sources (Notary, HSM/KMS, operating systems, network devices) to identify suspicious activity.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regularly scan the Notary server and underlying infrastructure for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Threat Intelligence:**  Stay informed about known attack techniques targeting key management systems and content trust frameworks.
*   **Regular Key Rotation:** While not directly a detection method, frequent key rotation limits the window of opportunity for an attacker using a compromised key.

#### 4.6. Analysis of Existing Mitigation Strategies

*   **Securely store and manage signing keys, using hardware security modules (HSMs) or key management systems:** This is a crucial mitigation. HSMs provide a high level of security for key storage, making it significantly harder for attackers to extract the keys. However, the security of the HSM itself needs to be ensured, and proper access controls are still necessary.
*   **Implement strict access controls for managing signing keys:** This is essential to limit the number of individuals and systems that have access to the keys. Regular review of access permissions is necessary to prevent privilege creep.
*   **Regularly rotate signing keys:** Key rotation limits the impact of a compromise. If a key is compromised, it will only be valid for a limited time. The frequency of rotation should be balanced with operational overhead.
*   **Monitor the usage of signing keys for suspicious activity:** This is a detective control that can help identify a compromise in progress or after it has occurred. Effective monitoring requires well-defined baselines and alerting mechanisms.

**Potential Gaps in Existing Mitigations:**

*   **Focus on storage, less on generation:** The mitigations primarily focus on secure storage and management. The security of the key generation process itself should also be considered.
*   **Human factor:**  Social engineering attacks can bypass technical controls. Security awareness training is crucial.
*   **Supply chain vulnerabilities:**  The mitigations don't explicitly address the risk of compromised dependencies or tools used in the key management process.
*   **Internal threats:**  While access controls help, mitigating insider threats requires additional measures like background checks and monitoring of privileged user activity.

#### 4.7. Recommendations

To further strengthen the security posture against compromised signing keys, the following recommendations are proposed:

*   **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all accounts with access to key management systems and the Notary server.
*   **Secure Key Generation:** Implement secure key generation practices, potentially using HSMs for key generation as well.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Notary service, key management systems, and related infrastructure to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
*   **Implement a Key Revocation Process:**  Establish a clear process for revoking compromised keys and distributing the updated revocation list.
*   **Consider Offline Signing:** For highly sensitive environments, consider performing signing operations in an offline environment to minimize the risk of key exposure.
*   **Implement Code Signing for Notary Components:** Ensure the integrity of the Notary service itself by implementing code signing for its binaries.
*   **Strengthen Supply Chain Security:**  Implement measures to verify the integrity of dependencies used by the Notary service and key management tools.
*   **Enhance Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms specifically focused on detecting suspicious key usage and access patterns.
*   **Develop an Incident Response Plan:**  Create a detailed incident response plan specifically for handling a compromised signing key scenario. This should include steps for key revocation, image remediation, and communication.
*   **Regularly Review and Update Security Practices:**  Continuously review and update security practices related to key management based on evolving threats and best practices.

### 5. Conclusion

The threat of compromised signing keys is a critical concern for any application relying on Harbor's content trust framework. A successful attack can have severe consequences, undermining the integrity of the container image supply chain and potentially leading to significant security breaches. While the proposed mitigation strategies are essential, a layered security approach that includes robust preventative and detective controls is necessary to effectively mitigate this risk. Continuous monitoring, regular security assessments, and a proactive approach to security are crucial for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the application.
