### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 4.1 Critical Node: Weak Access Control Policies

**Attack Vector:** Insufficiently configured access controls allow unauthorized users to perform actions like pushing, pulling, or deleting images, or accessing sensitive information.

**Deep Dive:**

This critical node highlights a fundamental security principle: **least privilege**. If access control policies are not properly configured in Harbor, attackers can exploit this weakness in several ways:

* **Anonymous Access:** If anonymous access is enabled or overly permissive, anyone can pull images, potentially including those containing sensitive information or vulnerabilities. In more severe cases, anonymous users might even be able to push malicious images or delete existing ones.
* **Default Credentials:**  Failure to change default credentials for built-in users or service accounts can provide attackers with immediate access.
* **Overly Broad Roles:** Assigning overly permissive roles to users or groups grants them unnecessary privileges. For example, granting "Project Admin" to a user who only needs "Developer" access.
* **Lack of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation:**  Not utilizing Harbor's RBAC features effectively leaves access control decisions ad-hoc and prone to errors.
* **Misconfigured Authentication Backends:** Issues with the configured authentication backend (e.g., LDAP, OIDC) can lead to authentication bypasses or incorrect user mapping.

**Potential Impact:**

* **Supply Chain Attacks:** Attackers can push malicious images containing malware or backdoors, compromising downstream applications and systems that pull these images.
* **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to private repositories can expose sensitive data, intellectual property, or proprietary algorithms embedded within container images.
* **Denial of Service:** Attackers can delete critical images, disrupting application deployments and causing service outages.
* **Reputation Damage:**  A security breach due to weak access controls can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.

**Technical Details (Examples):**

* **Harbor Configuration:** Examining the `harbor.yml` file for settings related to authentication and authorization.
* **Project Settings:** Reviewing the access control policies configured at the project level within the Harbor UI.
* **User and Role Management:** Analyzing the assigned roles and permissions for different users and groups.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Implement Strong RBAC:** Define granular roles and permissions based on the principle of least privilege.
* **Disable Anonymous Access:**  Restrict access to authenticated users only, unless there's a specific and well-justified reason for anonymous access.
* **Change Default Credentials:** Immediately change all default passwords for built-in accounts.
* **Regularly Review Access Policies:** Periodically audit and update access control policies to ensure they remain appropriate.
* **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Implement and enforce strong password requirements for user accounts.
* **Secure Authentication Backend Configuration:**  Properly configure and secure the chosen authentication backend (LDAP, OIDC, etc.).
* **Utilize Security Scanning:** Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities to mitigate the impact of potentially compromised images.

#### 4.2 Critical Node: Exposed Admin Interface

**Attack Vector:** The Harbor administrative interface is publicly accessible or protected by weak credentials, allowing attackers to gain full control over the registry.

**Deep Dive:**

The Harbor administrative interface provides privileged access to manage the entire registry. Exposing this interface to the public internet or protecting it with weak credentials is a critical security flaw.

* **Public Accessibility:** If the Harbor instance is directly exposed to the internet without proper network segmentation or access controls, attackers can attempt to access the admin interface.
* **Default Credentials:**  As mentioned before, using default credentials for the administrator account is a major vulnerability.
* **Weak Passwords:**  Using easily guessable passwords for the administrator account makes it susceptible to brute-force attacks.
* **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Not implementing MFA adds another layer of vulnerability, as attackers only need to compromise a single factor (the password).
* **Unpatched Vulnerabilities:**  Outdated Harbor versions may contain known vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to bypass authentication or gain unauthorized access to the admin interface.

**Potential Impact:**

* **Complete System Compromise:**  Gaining access to the admin interface grants attackers full control over the Harbor instance, including all projects, images, and configurations.
* **Data Manipulation and Deletion:** Attackers can modify or delete any data within the registry, including container images and metadata.
* **User and Role Manipulation:** Attackers can create new administrator accounts, revoke access for legitimate users, and completely lock out administrators.
* **Configuration Changes:** Attackers can modify critical Harbor configurations, potentially introducing further vulnerabilities or disrupting service.

**Technical Details (Examples):**

* **Network Configuration:** Examining firewall rules and network segmentation to determine if the admin interface is publicly accessible.
* **Harbor Configuration:** Checking the `harbor.yml` file for settings related to the admin interface and authentication.
* **User Management:** Reviewing the administrator accounts and their associated credentials.
* **Harbor Version:** Checking the installed Harbor version for known vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Restrict Access to Admin Interface:**  Implement network-level restrictions (firewall rules, VPN) to limit access to the admin interface to authorized networks or individuals.
* **Change Default Administrator Password:**  Immediately change the default password for the administrator account to a strong, unique password.
* **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Enable MFA for all administrator accounts to add an extra layer of security.
* **Keep Harbor Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Harbor to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Use HTTPS with Valid Certificates:** Ensure the admin interface is accessed over HTTPS with valid TLS certificates to protect communication.
* **Consider Using an Identity Provider (IdP):** Integrate with an IdP for centralized authentication and authorization.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in the admin interface.

#### 4.3 Critical Node: Insecure Storage of Secrets/Credentials

**Attack Vector:** Harbor stores sensitive information like database credentials or API keys in plaintext or easily reversible formats, allowing attackers to retrieve and misuse them.

**Deep Dive:**

Storing sensitive information insecurely is a common vulnerability that can have severe consequences. If Harbor stores secrets in plaintext or easily decryptable formats, attackers who gain access to the underlying system can easily retrieve these credentials.

* **Plaintext Storage:** Storing credentials directly in configuration files or databases without any encryption.
* **Weak Encryption:** Using weak or outdated encryption algorithms that can be easily broken.
* **Hardcoded Credentials:** Embedding credentials directly within the application code or container images.
* **Insufficient File System Permissions:**  If configuration files containing secrets have overly permissive file system permissions, unauthorized users can access them.
* **Exposure in Logs or Backups:** Sensitive information might inadvertently be logged or included in backups in plaintext.

**Potential Impact:**

* **Database Compromise:**  If database credentials are compromised, attackers can gain full access to the Harbor database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
* **API Key Misuse:**  Compromised API keys can allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of legitimate users or services, potentially leading to unauthorized access to other systems or resources.
* **Lateral Movement:**  Compromised credentials can be used to gain access to other systems and resources within the infrastructure.

**Technical Details (Examples):**

* **Harbor Configuration Files:** Examining files like `harbor.yml` for stored credentials.
* **Database Inspection:**  Analyzing the Harbor database for stored secrets.
* **Code Review:**  Reviewing the Harbor codebase for hardcoded credentials.
* **File System Permissions:** Checking the permissions of configuration files containing sensitive information.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Utilize Secret Management Tools:**  Employ dedicated secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) to securely store and manage sensitive information.
* **Encrypt Secrets at Rest:**  Ensure that sensitive information stored in configuration files or databases is properly encrypted using strong encryption algorithms.
* **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials:**  Never hardcode credentials directly into the application code or container images.
* **Implement Secure File System Permissions:**  Restrict access to configuration files containing secrets to only authorized users and processes.
* **Rotate Secrets Regularly:**  Implement a policy for regularly rotating sensitive credentials.
* **Secure Logging Practices:**  Avoid logging sensitive information. If necessary, redact or mask sensitive data in logs.
* **Secure Backup Procedures:**  Ensure that backups containing sensitive information are properly encrypted and stored securely.
