### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### **Goal: Leverage Harbor's API to manipulate resources or gain unauthorized access.**

This is the overarching objective of the attacker. Success at this level can lead to significant disruption, data breaches, or the introduction of malicious software into the application deployment pipeline.

#### **Critical Node: Gain Unauthorized Access to Harbor API:**

This is the crucial first step for the attacker. Without valid credentials, most API actions will be blocked.

*   **Attack Vector: Compromise API Keys/Tokens**
    *   **Description:** Attackers aim to obtain valid API keys or tokens that grant them access to the Harbor API. These keys act as authentication credentials, allowing the attacker to impersonate legitimate users or services.
    *   **Technical Details:**
        *   **Storage Vulnerabilities:**  API keys might be stored insecurely in configuration files, environment variables, or databases with weak access controls.
        *   **Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force:** If API key generation or management lacks proper security measures, attackers might attempt to guess or brute-force keys.
        *   **Phishing/Social Engineering:** Attackers could trick legitimate users into revealing their API keys.
        *   **Insider Threats:** Malicious insiders with access to key storage systems could exfiltrate API keys.
        *   **Compromised CI/CD Pipelines:** If CI/CD pipelines use API keys, a compromise of the pipeline could expose these keys.
        *   **Lack of Key Rotation:** Infrequent or absent key rotation increases the window of opportunity for compromised keys to be exploited.
    *   **Potential Impact:**
        *   Full control over the Harbor API within the permissions granted to the compromised key.
        *   Ability to execute subsequent attacks in the attack path.
        *   Potential for lateral movement if the compromised key has broad permissions.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Storage:** Store API keys in dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) with strong access controls and encryption at rest.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant API keys only the necessary permissions required for their intended purpose. Avoid using overly permissive "admin" keys.
        *   **Key Rotation:** Implement a regular key rotation policy to minimize the impact of compromised keys.
        *   **Secure Transmission:** Ensure API key transmission is always over HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping.
        *   **Monitoring and Auditing:** Log API key usage and monitor for suspicious activity, such as access from unusual locations or excessive API calls.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Where applicable, enforce MFA for accessing systems that manage or generate API keys.
        *   **Secret Scanning:** Implement tools to scan code repositories, configuration files, and other potential locations for accidentally exposed API keys.

#### **Critical Node: Modify Image Tags/Manifests via API:**

Once unauthorized API access is gained, attackers can manipulate the core building blocks of containerized applications.

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers with API access alter image tags to point to malicious images or modify image manifests to inject malicious layers, potentially tricking applications into pulling compromised images.
    *   **Description:** Attackers leverage their API access to change the metadata associated with container images. This can involve:
        *   **Tag Manipulation:**  Changing a tag (e.g., `latest`, `v1.0`) to point to a different image, potentially a malicious one.
        *   **Manifest Manipulation:**  Modifying the image manifest, which describes the layers of the image, to inject malicious layers containing backdoors, malware, or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Technical Details:**
        *   **Harbor API Endpoints:** Attackers would target specific Harbor API endpoints responsible for updating image tags and manifests.
        *   **Authorization Bypass:**  Exploiting flaws in Harbor's authorization logic to perform actions they shouldn't be allowed to.
        *   **Lack of Integrity Checks:** If Harbor doesn't perform strong integrity checks on image manifests after updates, malicious modifications might go undetected.
        *   **Registry Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities within the underlying container registry implementation used by Harbor.
    *   **Potential Impact:**
        *   **Supply Chain Compromise:**  Applications pulling images based on the manipulated tags or manifests will unknowingly deploy compromised containers.
        *   **Data Breaches:** Malicious containers could exfiltrate sensitive data.
        *   **System Compromise:**  Injected malware could compromise the host system running the container.
        *   **Denial of Service:**  Malicious layers could consume excessive resources, leading to application downtime.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authorization Controls:** Implement granular access control policies for API endpoints related to tag and manifest manipulation.
        *   **Content Trust/Image Signing:**  Enable and enforce image signing using technologies like Docker Content Trust (Notary) or Sigstore (Cosign) to verify the integrity and authenticity of images.
        *   **Immutable Tags:**  Consider adopting a policy of immutable tags for production environments, preventing accidental or malicious tag overwrites.
        *   **Manifest Verification:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of image manifests before and after updates.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan images for vulnerabilities, including those potentially introduced through manifest manipulation.
        *   **Audit Logging:**  Maintain detailed audit logs of all API actions related to image tags and manifests.
        *   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement systems to detect unusual patterns in API activity related to image manipulation.

#### **Critical Node: Delete Critical Images/Repositories via API:**

This attack aims to disrupt operations and potentially cause data loss.

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers with API access delete important images or repositories, causing disruption to the application deployment process and potentially impacting application availability.
    *   **Description:** Attackers use their unauthorized API access to remove container images or entire repositories from the Harbor registry.
    *   **Technical Details:**
        *   **Harbor API Endpoints:** Attackers would target specific Harbor API endpoints responsible for deleting images and repositories.
        *   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:**  Exploiting weaknesses in Harbor's authorization to delete resources they shouldn't have access to.
        *   **Lack of Soft Delete/Recovery Mechanisms:** If Harbor lacks a "soft delete" feature or robust backup and recovery mechanisms, deleted resources might be permanently lost.
        *   **Accidental Deletion:** While not malicious, inadequate access controls can also lead to accidental deletion by authorized users.
    *   **Potential Impact:**
        *   **Deployment Failures:**  Applications relying on the deleted images will fail to deploy.
        *   **Service Disruption:**  Running applications might be impacted if they need to pull the deleted images.
        *   **Data Loss:**  If images are not backed up, critical application components could be permanently lost.
        *   **Reputational Damage:**  Service outages and data loss can severely damage an organization's reputation.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Authorization Controls:** Implement the principle of least privilege for API endpoints related to deletion operations. Require explicit confirmation or higher-level authorization for deletion actions.
        *   **Soft Delete/Recycle Bin:** Implement a "soft delete" mechanism where deleted images and repositories are moved to a recycle bin for a defined period before permanent deletion.
        *   **Backup and Recovery:** Regularly back up Harbor's data, including images and metadata, to enable recovery from accidental or malicious deletions.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for users or service accounts with permissions to delete images or repositories.
        *   **Audit Logging and Monitoring:**  Thoroughly log and monitor all deletion attempts and actions. Alert on unusual deletion patterns.
        *   **Confirmation Steps:** Implement confirmation steps or multi-person approval workflows for critical deletion operations.
