### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### **Goal: Inject a malicious container image into Harbor that the target application will pull and execute.**

This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success at this stage means the attacker has gained the ability to execute arbitrary code within the target application's environment.

#### **Critical Node: Gain Access to Push Images:**

This is a crucial prerequisite for injecting a malicious image. Without the ability to push images, the attacker cannot introduce their payload into Harbor.

*   **Attack Vector: Compromise Developer/CI Credentials**
    *   **Detailed Analysis:** This is a highly probable attack vector as it targets human weaknesses and commonly used infrastructure. Attackers might employ various techniques:
        *   **Phishing:** Sending deceptive emails or messages to developers or CI/CD system administrators to trick them into revealing their Harbor credentials. This could involve fake login pages or requests for credentials under false pretenses.
        *   **Malware:** Infecting developer workstations or CI/CD servers with keyloggers, spyware, or credential stealers. This malware can silently capture credentials as they are entered.
        *   **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Developer Workstations:**  Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in software running on developer machines (e.g., outdated operating systems, vulnerable applications) to gain access and steal credentials stored locally or in memory.
        *   **Compromising CI/CD Pipelines:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the CI/CD system itself (e.g., insecure plugins, misconfigurations) to gain access to stored credentials or the ability to push images directly.
        *   **Social Engineering:** Manipulating individuals into divulging their credentials through impersonation or other social engineering tactics.
        *   **Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing:** While less likely to succeed against systems with strong password policies and rate limiting, attackers might attempt to guess common passwords or use lists of previously compromised credentials.
    *   **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
        *   Weak password policies.
        *   Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) on Harbor accounts.
        *   Outdated or vulnerable software on developer workstations and CI/CD servers.
        *   Insecure storage of credentials within CI/CD pipelines.
        *   Lack of security awareness training for developers and operations teams.
    *   **Impact:** Successful credential compromise grants the attacker legitimate access to push images, making detection more difficult as the actions appear to originate from authorized users.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce strong password policies and regular password rotation.**
        *   **Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Harbor accounts.**
        *   **Provide comprehensive security awareness training to developers and operations teams, focusing on phishing and social engineering attacks.**
        *   **Secure developer workstations with endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions and keep software up-to-date.**
        *   **Implement secure credential management practices for CI/CD pipelines, such as using secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).**
        *   **Regularly audit access logs and user activity for suspicious behavior.**
        *   **Implement rate limiting and account lockout policies to mitigate brute-force attacks.**

*   **Attack Vector: Exploit Harbor Authentication/Authorization Vulnerability**
    *   **Detailed Analysis:** This involves finding and exploiting weaknesses in Harbor's own security mechanisms. This could include:
        *   **Authentication Bypass:** Discovering a vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass the login process entirely.
        *   **Authorization Bypass:** Exploiting a flaw that allows an attacker to gain privileges they are not authorized for, specifically the ability to push images. This could involve manipulating API requests or exploiting flaws in role-based access control (RBAC).
        *   **SQL Injection:** If Harbor's database interactions are not properly sanitized, attackers could inject malicious SQL queries to manipulate data or gain unauthorized access.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** While less directly related to pushing images, XSS vulnerabilities could be used to steal session cookies or manipulate user actions to indirectly gain access.
        *   **API Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting flaws in Harbor's API endpoints that allow unauthorized actions.
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific versions of Harbor.
    *   **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
        *   Software bugs in Harbor's codebase.
        *   Misconfigurations of Harbor's authentication and authorization settings.
        *   Lack of proper input validation and sanitization.
        *   Outdated Harbor version with known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of an authentication/authorization vulnerability provides the attacker with direct, unauthorized access to push images, potentially bypassing all legitimate access controls.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Harbor updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.**
        *   **Implement a robust vulnerability management program, including regular security scanning and penetration testing of the Harbor instance.**
        *   **Follow secure coding practices during Harbor development and customization.**
        *   **Properly configure Harbor's authentication and authorization settings, adhering to the principle of least privilege.**
        *   **Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.**
        *   **Regularly review and audit Harbor's security configurations.**

*   **Attack Vector: Supply Chain Attack on Base Image/Dependencies**
    *   **Detailed Analysis:** This attack vector targets the upstream components used in building container images. Attackers could compromise:
        *   **Public Base Images:** Injecting malicious code into popular base images hosted on public registries like Docker Hub. When developers pull these images, the malware is unknowingly included in their own images.
        *   **Internal Base Images:** Compromising internally maintained base images within the organization's control.
        *   **Dependencies:** Injecting malicious code into libraries or packages used by the application during the image build process. This could involve compromising package repositories or using typosquatting techniques to trick developers into using malicious packages.
    *   **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
        *   Lack of verification of base image integrity and authenticity.
        *   Reliance on untrusted or unverified dependencies.
        *   Vulnerabilities in the build process that allow for the introduction of malicious code.
        *   Lack of visibility into the components included in base images and dependencies.
    *   **Impact:** This attack is particularly insidious as the malicious code is introduced early in the development lifecycle, making it harder to detect. It can affect multiple applications that rely on the compromised base image or dependency.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use trusted and verified base images from reputable sources.**
        *   **Implement image scanning tools to analyze base images and dependencies for vulnerabilities and malware.**
        *   **Utilize signed images and content trust mechanisms to ensure the integrity and authenticity of images.**
        *   **Maintain an inventory of all dependencies used in container images.**
        *   **Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.**
        *   **Implement a secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) that includes security checks at each stage.**
        *   **Consider using private registries for internal base images and dependencies.**

#### **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Payload into Image:**

Once the attacker has gained the ability to push images, the next step is to introduce the malicious payload.

*   **Attack Vector: Once access to push images is gained, attackers modify an existing image or create a new one containing malicious code, backdoors, or exploits.**
    *   **Detailed Analysis:**  With push access, attackers have several options:
        *   **Modifying Existing Images:**  Pulling a legitimate image, adding malicious components (e.g., a backdoor, a cryptominer, data exfiltration tools), and then pushing the modified image back to Harbor, potentially overwriting the original or creating a new tag.
        *   **Creating New Malicious Images:** Building a completely new image from scratch that contains the malicious payload. This allows for more control over the payload and its execution environment.
        *   **Hiding the Payload:** Attackers may employ techniques to obfuscate the malicious code within the image to avoid detection by basic scanning tools. This could involve encoding, encryption, or steganography.
        *   **Exploiting Build Processes:** If the attacker has compromised developer credentials or CI/CD pipelines, they might inject malicious steps into the image build process itself, ensuring the payload is included during the build.
    *   **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
        *   Lack of image scanning and vulnerability analysis on pushed images.
        *   Insufficient access controls within Harbor that allow overwriting of legitimate images.
        *   Lack of image signing and content trust verification.
    *   **Impact:** This is the point where the malicious code is introduced into the container ecosystem. The impact depends on the nature of the payload, but it could include data theft, system compromise, denial of service, or resource hijacking.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement mandatory image scanning on all images pushed to Harbor.**
        *   **Configure Harbor to prevent overwriting of immutable image tags.**
        *   **Enforce image signing and content trust to verify the integrity and origin of images.**
        *   **Implement strict access controls within Harbor to limit who can push images to specific repositories.**
        *   **Regularly audit image repositories for unexpected or suspicious images.**

#### **Critical Node: Application Pulls and Executes Malicious Image:**

The final stage of the attack involves the target application retrieving and running the compromised image.

*   **Attack Vector: The application, configured to pull images from Harbor, retrieves and runs the compromised image, leading to the execution of the attacker's payload within the container environment.**
    *   **Detailed Analysis:** This relies on the application's configuration to pull images from Harbor. Once the malicious image is present, the application, following its normal deployment process, will pull and execute it. The attacker's payload will then run within the container, potentially gaining access to application data, resources, or the underlying host system, depending on the container's configuration and security context.
    *   **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
        *   Application configured to pull images without verifying their integrity or source.
        *   Lack of runtime security measures to detect and prevent malicious activity within containers.
        *   Insufficient container isolation, allowing the malicious container to impact other containers or the host system.
        *   Hardcoded or easily guessable image tags that the attacker can target.
    *   **Impact:** This is the point of compromise for the target application. The attacker can now execute arbitrary code within the application's environment, leading to significant security breaches.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configure the application to pull images using specific, immutable tags or digests to ensure consistency and prevent pulling unexpected images.**
        *   **Implement runtime security solutions (e.g., Falco, Sysdig Secure) to monitor container behavior and detect malicious activity.**
        *   **Enforce strong container isolation using technologies like namespaces, cgroups, and seccomp profiles.**
        *   **Regularly audit application configurations to ensure they are pulling the correct images.**
        *   **Implement a process for quickly rolling back to known good images in case of a compromise.**
        *   **Consider using a private registry for storing trusted application images.**
