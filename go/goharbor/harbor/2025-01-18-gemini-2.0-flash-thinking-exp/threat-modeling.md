*   **Affected Component:**  Clair (or the configured vulnerability scanner integration), core service image analysis workflow.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the vulnerability scanner (e.g., Clair) up-to-date with the latest vulnerability definitions.
    *   Regularly review and update the vulnerability scanning configuration.
    *   Implement multiple layers of security checks, not solely relying on vulnerability scanning.
    *   Monitor the vulnerability scanning process for errors or anomalies.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Scan Results](./threats/manipulation_of_scan_results.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with access to Harbor's internal data or exploiting vulnerabilities in the scanning process could potentially manipulate or alter vulnerability scan results to hide existing vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**  Organizations might deploy vulnerable images believing they are secure, leading to potential exploitation.
*   **Affected Component:**  Clair database (or the configured vulnerability scanner's data store), core service vulnerability reporting module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure access to the vulnerability scanner's database and API.
    *   Implement integrity checks on scan results.
    *   Regularly audit scan results and the scanning process.
    *   Consider using signed scan results if the vulnerability scanner supports it.

## Threat: [Compromised Signing Keys (Content Trust)](./threats/compromised_signing_keys__content_trust_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the private keys used for signing container images within Harbor's content trust framework (Notary).
*   **Impact:** With compromised signing keys, an attacker can sign malicious images, making them appear trusted and potentially bypassing security checks in downstream systems.
*   **Affected Component:** Notary service, core service content trust verification module.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely store and manage signing keys, using hardware security modules (HSMs) or key management systems.
    *   Implement strict access controls for managing signing keys.
    *   Regularly rotate signing keys.
    *   Monitor the usage of signing keys for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Replication of Malicious Images](./threats/replication_of_malicious_images.md)

*   **Description:** If a Harbor instance contains a malicious image, and replication is configured, this malicious image can be automatically copied to other connected Harbor instances.
*   **Impact:**  Spreads the malicious image across multiple environments, increasing the attack surface and potential impact.
*   **Affected Component:** Core service replication module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement vulnerability scanning and content trust on all Harbor instances involved in replication.
    *   Carefully control which repositories and projects are replicated.
    *   Monitor replication tasks for unexpected activity.

## Threat: [API Vulnerabilities (e.g., Injection, Authentication Bypass)](./threats/api_vulnerabilities__e_g___injection__authentication_bypass_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities exist in Harbor's REST API that could be exploited by attackers to perform unauthorized actions, such as accessing sensitive data, modifying configurations, or bypassing authentication.
