# Attack Surface Analysis for goharbor/harbor

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms to access Harbor's API without valid credentials.
*   **How Harbor Contributes:**  Vulnerabilities in Harbor's authentication logic, such as flaws in token validation, session management, or improper handling of authentication headers.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious API request that exploits a flaw in the token verification process, allowing them to retrieve a list of all repositories without logging in.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data (image metadata, user information, project configurations), potential for data manipulation or deletion, and the ability to perform actions on behalf of legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust and industry-standard authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect).
    *   Regularly audit and patch authentication-related code within Harbor.
    *   Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for Harbor user accounts.
    *   Implement proper session management and invalidate sessions upon logout or inactivity within Harbor.
    *   Ensure proper validation and sanitization of authentication headers and tokens processed by Harbor.

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:**  Exposure of sensitive API endpoints within Harbor without any authentication or authorization requirements.
*   **How Harbor Contributes:**  Incorrect configuration or development practices within the Harbor project that leave certain API endpoints publicly accessible without any access controls.
*   **Example:** An unauthenticated Harbor API endpoint allows anyone to retrieve a list of all users and their email addresses.
*   **Impact:**  Information disclosure, potential for account enumeration within Harbor, and the possibility of exploiting other vulnerabilities through these exposed Harbor endpoints.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement authentication and authorization for all Harbor API endpoints.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining API access controls within Harbor.
    *   Regularly review and audit Harbor API endpoint configurations to ensure proper protection.
    *   Use API gateways or reverse proxies to manage and secure access to Harbor's API.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the UI](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_the_ui.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages served by Harbor, which are then executed in the browsers of other users.
*   **How Harbor Contributes:**  Insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data displayed within the Harbor UI.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into a Harbor repository description. When another user views this repository within Harbor, the script executes, potentially stealing their session cookies.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking of Harbor users, credential theft for accessing Harbor, defacement of the Harbor UI, and redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and output encoding/escaping for all user-supplied data displayed in the Harbor UI.
    *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources when accessing Harbor.
    *   Regularly scan the Harbor UI for XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Image Layer Manipulation/Injection](./attack_surfaces/image_layer_manipulationinjection.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can inject malicious content into container image layers managed by Harbor without proper authorization or detection.
*   **How Harbor Contributes:**  Vulnerabilities in how Harbor handles image uploads, layer verification, or its integration with content trust mechanisms (Notary).
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw in the Harbor image upload process to inject a backdoor into a seemingly legitimate image layer. When this image, managed by Harbor, is pulled and run, the backdoor is executed.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of containerized applications managed by Harbor, potential for data breaches originating from containers pulled from Harbor, and the ability to gain access to systems running containers from Harbor.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable and enforce Content Trust (Notary) within Harbor to ensure the integrity and authenticity of images.
    *   Implement mandatory vulnerability scanning for all images pushed to Harbor and block vulnerable images based on policy.
    *   Regularly audit the image upload and verification processes within Harbor.
    *   Utilize image signing and verification mechanisms integrated with Harbor.

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of Database Credentials](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_database_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers gain access to the credentials used by Harbor to connect to its database.
*   **How Harbor Contributes:**  Storing database credentials in plaintext or using weak encryption within Harbor's configuration, or vulnerabilities within Harbor that allow access to configuration files containing these credentials.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a configuration vulnerability within Harbor to retrieve the database username and password, allowing them to directly access and manipulate the Harbor database.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of Harbor data, including user information, image metadata, and project configurations. Potential for data deletion, modification, or exfiltration from the Harbor database.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store database credentials securely using strong encryption or secrets management solutions, ensuring Harbor utilizes these securely.
    *   Restrict access to configuration files containing database credentials used by Harbor.
    *   Regularly rotate database credentials used by Harbor.
    *   Implement network segmentation to limit access to the database server used by Harbor.
