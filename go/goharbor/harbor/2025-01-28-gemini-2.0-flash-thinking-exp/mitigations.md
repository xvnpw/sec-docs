*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Mandatory Image Scanning
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Vulnerability Scanning in Harbor:** Navigate to Harbor's project settings and enable vulnerability scanning for relevant projects.
    2.  **Configure Harbor Scanner:** Within Harbor's system settings, select and configure a vulnerability scanner (e.g., Trivy, Clair). Ensure proper integration and functionality.
    3.  **Set Harbor Scan Policy:** Define a scan policy at the project or system level in Harbor. This policy should automatically trigger scans upon image push to Harbor.
    4.  **Define Harbor Block Policy (Optional but Recommended):** Configure a vulnerability severity threshold within Harbor's vulnerability policies. Set a policy to prevent pushing or pulling images exceeding this threshold directly within Harbor.
    5.  **Integrate Harbor Scanning API with CI/CD:** Utilize Harbor's vulnerability scanning API in the CI/CD pipeline. Before pushing images to Harbor, trigger a scan via the API and fail the pipeline if vulnerabilities exceed the defined threshold, preventing vulnerable images from being pushed to Harbor in the first place.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable Container Images (High Severity):** Deploying applications with known vulnerabilities present in container images stored in Harbor.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity):** Compromised base images or dependencies introduced through vulnerable layers in container images managed by Harbor.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerable Container Images (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk by proactively identifying and preventing the deployment of vulnerable images stored and managed in Harbor.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk by identifying vulnerabilities in base images and dependencies within Harbor, allowing for remediation before deployment from Harbor.
