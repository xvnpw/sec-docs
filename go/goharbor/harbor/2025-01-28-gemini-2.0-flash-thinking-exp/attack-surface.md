# Attack Surface Analysis for goharbor/harbor

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass (Web UI & API)](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass__web_ui_&_api_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities *within Harbor's* authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to the Harbor UI or Registry API. This allows bypassing login procedures or privilege escalation within Harbor.
*   **Harbor Contribution:** Harbor's *specific implementation* of authentication (local users, LDAP, OIDC integration) and authorization controls for UI and API access is the direct source of this attack surface. Flaws in *Harbor's code* handling authentication or role-based access control are exploited.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Web UI:** An attacker exploits an SQL injection vulnerability *in Harbor's login form* to bypass authentication and gain admin access.
    *   **Registry API:** An attacker finds a flaw in *Harbor's token validation process* of the Registry API, allowing unauthorized image push or pull operations.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Harbor instance, including access to all projects, images, and sensitive data *managed by Harbor*. Attackers can manipulate images, delete projects, and potentially gain further access depending on Harbor's environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Harbor Team):**
        *   Implement rigorous input validation and output encoding *throughout Harbor's codebase*, especially in authentication and authorization modules.
        *   Conduct thorough security testing, including penetration testing and code reviews *specifically targeting Harbor's authentication and authorization logic*.
        *   Follow secure coding practices to prevent common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and command injection *within Harbor's development*.
        *   Keep Harbor's dependencies, *especially authentication-related libraries used by Harbor*, up to date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Users (Harbor Deployers/Administrators):**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for local users *if local authentication is used in Harbor*.
        *   Properly configure and secure integration with external authentication providers (LDAP, OIDC) *as configured within Harbor*.
        *   Regularly review user roles and permissions *within Harbor projects and system settings* to ensure least privilege access.
        *   Monitor *Harbor's authentication logs* for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Image Manifest and Layer Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/image_manifest_and_layer_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in *Harbor's handling* of image manifests and layers to inject malicious content into container images or manipulate image metadata *within Harbor*. This can lead to users unknowingly pulling and running compromised images *from Harbor*.
*   **Harbor Contribution:** Harbor's core function of storing, managing, and serving container images makes *its image handling logic* the direct contributor. Vulnerabilities in *Harbor's Registry API or storage backend code* related to image processing are exploited.
*   **Example:**
    *   An attacker exploits a vulnerability in *Harbor's image layer processing* to inject malicious code into a seemingly legitimate image layer stored in Harbor.
    *   An attacker manipulates the image manifest *within Harbor's storage* to point to malicious layers or alter image metadata, misleading users about images pulled from Harbor.
*   **Impact:** Supply chain compromise *originating from Harbor*. Users pulling images *from the compromised Harbor instance* may unknowingly deploy and run malicious containers, leading to security breaches in their environments.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Harbor Team):**
        *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of image manifests and layers *within Harbor's image processing components* during push and pull operations.
        *   Utilize content addressable storage *in Harbor's backend* to ensure image immutability and integrity.
        *   Implement and enforce content trust mechanisms (e.g., Notary integration) *within Harbor* to verify image signatures and origins.
        *   Regularly audit and review *Harbor's image handling code* for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users (Harbor Users):**
        *   Enable and enforce content trust *if configured and used in Harbor* (Notary integration).
        *   Implement vulnerability scanning for images *stored in Harbor* and before deployment.
        *   Establish processes for verifying the integrity and origin of images *pulled from Harbor*.
        *   Monitor *Harbor's image push and pull logs* for suspicious activities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Harbor is deployed with insecure default configurations *provided by the Harbor installation process*, such as default passwords, exposed management ports, or disabled security features. Attackers can exploit these *Harbor-specific* misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access or compromise the Harbor instance.
*   **Harbor Contribution:** *Harbor's default installation settings and configuration options* directly contribute to this attack surface if not properly secured during deployment. The initial state of *Harbor as delivered* can be insecure if not hardened.
*   **Example:**
    *   Using default administrator credentials *provided in Harbor's initial setup* allows attackers to easily gain administrative access.
    *   Exposing *Harbor's components* (like database port if default network settings are used) directly to the internet without proper firewall rules.
    *   Disabling TLS encryption for communication with *Harbor components by default*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Harbor, data breaches, denial of service, and potential compromise of the underlying infrastructure *hosting Harbor*.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Harbor Team):**
        *   Provide secure default configurations for Harbor *out-of-the-box* and clearly document required post-installation security hardening steps *specific to Harbor*.
        *   Implement security checklists and best practices guides *tailored for Harbor deployment*.
        *   Consider automated security configuration tools or scripts to help users deploy Harbor securely *following Harbor-specific best practices*.
    *   **Users (Harbor Deployers/Administrators):**
        *   **Immediately change all default passwords** upon Harbor installation.
        *   Follow security hardening guides and best practices *specifically for Harbor deployment*.
        *   Properly configure network policies and firewalls to restrict access to *Harbor components*.
        *   Enable TLS encryption for all communication channels *within Harbor*.
        *   Regularly review and audit *Harbor configurations* for security weaknesses.

## Attack Surface: [Database Vulnerabilities due to Harbor Deployment](./attack_surfaces/database_vulnerabilities_due_to_harbor_deployment.md)

*   **Description:** While general database vulnerabilities exist, this focuses on vulnerabilities arising from *how Harbor is deployed and configured with its database (PostgreSQL)*. Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the database setup *related to Harbor's deployment process* can be exploited.
*   **Harbor Contribution:** Harbor's deployment process and configuration instructions influence how the database is set up. Insecure default database configurations *suggested or implied by Harbor's documentation or setup scripts* contribute to this attack surface.
*   **Example:**
    *   *Harbor's deployment guide* might not sufficiently emphasize strong database password requirements, leading to weak credentials.
    *   *Default network configurations in Harbor's deployment* might expose the database port unnecessarily.
    *   Insufficient guidance on database hardening in *Harbor's documentation* can lead to insecure database setups.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data integrity compromise, denial of service, and potential complete compromise of the Harbor instance and potentially the underlying infrastructure if the database server is compromised *due to Harbor-related misconfigurations*.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Harbor Team):**
        *   Provide clear and strong guidance on secure database configuration *specifically for Harbor deployments*.
        *   Include database hardening best practices in *Harbor's documentation and deployment guides*.
        *   Consider providing secure database configuration scripts or tools as part of *Harbor's deployment process*.
    *   **Users (Harbor Deployers/Administrators):**
        *   Secure the PostgreSQL database server with strong passwords and proper access controls *following Harbor's deployment and security recommendations*.
        *   Regularly update PostgreSQL to the latest stable version with security patches *as recommended for Harbor deployments*.
        *   Harden the database server configuration according to security best practices *in the context of Harbor's requirements*.
        *   Restrict network access to the database server to only necessary components *as per Harbor's architecture*.
        *   Implement database monitoring and auditing to detect suspicious activities *related to Harbor's database usage*.
