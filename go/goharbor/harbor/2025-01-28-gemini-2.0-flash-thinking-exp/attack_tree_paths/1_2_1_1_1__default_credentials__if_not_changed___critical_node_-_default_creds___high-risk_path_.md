### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.1.1.1. Default Credentials (if not changed) [CRITICAL NODE - Default Creds] [HIGH-RISK PATH]

#### 4.1. Description of the Attack

This attack path exploits the common security vulnerability of using default credentials that are often pre-configured in software and systems. If administrators fail to change these default credentials during the initial setup or deployment of Harbor, attackers can leverage publicly known default usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access.

In the context of Harbor, this primarily targets the **administrator account**, which typically has extensive privileges and control over the entire Harbor instance, including:

* **Managing projects and repositories:** Creating, deleting, and modifying projects and repositories.
* **User and role management:** Adding, deleting, and modifying user accounts and their roles within Harbor.
* **System configuration:**  Changing Harbor settings, potentially including security configurations.
* **Access to sensitive data:**  Potentially accessing container images and related metadata stored within Harbor.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors

The primary attack vector for exploiting default credentials in Harbor is:

* **Trying known default usernames and passwords for Harbor administrative accounts:** Attackers will attempt to log in to the Harbor web interface or API using commonly known default credentials.

#### 4.3. Prerequisites

For this attack to be successful, the following prerequisites must be met:

* **Default credentials are still in use:** The most critical prerequisite is that the Harbor administrator has not changed the default username and password during or after the initial installation and configuration.
* **Harbor web interface or API is accessible:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the Harbor login page or API endpoint, typically over the network. This implies that Harbor is exposed to the network where the attacker is located (which could be internal or external depending on the Harbor deployment).
* **Knowledge of default credentials:** Attackers must have access to information about the default usernames and passwords used by Harbor. This information is readily available in Harbor documentation, online forums, and security vulnerability databases.

#### 4.4. Steps to Execute the Attack

An attacker would typically follow these steps to attempt to exploit default credentials:

1. **Identify Harbor Instance:** Locate a target Harbor instance. This could be done through network scanning, reconnaissance, or by targeting known Harbor deployments.
2. **Access Harbor Login Interface:** Navigate to the Harbor web interface login page (usually accessible via a web browser) or identify the API endpoint for authentication.
3. **Attempt Login with Default Credentials:**
    * **Username:**  `admin` (This is the most common default username for Harbor administrators)
    * **Password:** `Harbor12345` (This is a well-known default password for Harbor)
    * The attacker will attempt to log in using these credentials through the web interface or API.
4. **Verify Successful Login:** If the login attempt is successful, the attacker will gain access to the Harbor administrative dashboard or API.
5. **Exploit Gained Access:** Once logged in with default credentials, the attacker can perform various malicious actions depending on their objectives (see "Potential Impact" below).

#### 4.5. Potential Impact of Successful Exploitation

Successful exploitation of default credentials can have severe consequences, including:

* **Complete System Compromise:**  Administrative access grants full control over the Harbor instance.
* **Data Breach:**  Attackers can access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive container images, application secrets, and other data stored within Harbor.
* **Malware Injection:**  Attackers can inject malicious container images into repositories, potentially compromising applications that pull images from Harbor.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Compromised Harbor instances can be used to launch supply chain attacks by distributing malicious images to downstream users and systems.
* **Denial of Service:**  Attackers could disrupt Harbor services, delete repositories, or modify configurations to cause instability or downtime.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A security breach due to default credentials can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Failure to secure systems and protect sensitive data can lead to violations of regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS).

#### 4.6. Likelihood of Success

The likelihood of success for this attack path is considered **HIGH** if default credentials are not changed.  Several factors contribute to this high likelihood:

* **Well-known Default Credentials:** Harbor's default credentials (`admin`/`Harbor12345`) are publicly documented and widely known.
* **Common Oversight:**  Administrators may overlook or forget to change default credentials during initial setup, especially in fast-paced deployment environments.
* **Automated Scanning and Exploitation:**  Attackers can easily automate scanning for publicly accessible Harbor instances and attempt login with default credentials using scripts and tools.
* **Low Attack Complexity:**  Exploiting default credentials requires minimal technical skill and effort.

#### 4.7. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the risk of default credential exploitation, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Mandatory Password Change on First Login:**  **[CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION]**  Harbor should enforce a mandatory password change for the default `admin` account upon the first login. This is the most effective preventative measure.
* **Strong Password Policy:** Implement and enforce a strong password policy for all Harbor accounts, including administrator accounts. This policy should include requirements for password complexity, length, and regular password rotation.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and remediate any instances where default credentials might still be in use or where password policies are not being enforced.
* **Security Awareness Training:**  Educate administrators and DevOps teams about the critical importance of changing default credentials and following secure configuration practices.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Avoid granting unnecessary administrative privileges.  Use role-based access control (RBAC) to assign users only the permissions they need.
* **Network Segmentation and Access Control:**  Restrict network access to the Harbor instance to authorized users and networks. Use firewalls and network segmentation to limit exposure.
* **Disable or Remove Default Accounts (If Possible):** While the `admin` account is essential, explore if there are any other default accounts that can be disabled or removed if not needed.

#### 4.8. Detection Methods

While prevention is paramount, implementing detection mechanisms is also crucial to identify and respond to potential attacks.  Consider the following detection methods:

* **Login Attempt Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement monitoring for failed login attempts, especially for the `admin` account.  Set up alerts for:
    * Multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address.
    * Failed login attempts using known default usernames.
    * Successful login from unusual IP addresses or locations (if geo-location tracking is feasible).
* **Account Activity Monitoring:**  Monitor activity logs for the `admin` account for suspicious actions, such as:
    * Unexpected changes to system configurations.
    * Creation of new administrative accounts.
    * Access to sensitive data or repositories that are not typically accessed by the `admin` account.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Integration:**  Integrate Harbor logs with a SIEM system to centralize log management, correlation, and alerting for security events, including suspicious login attempts.
* **Regular Log Review:**  Periodically review Harbor logs manually to identify any anomalies or suspicious patterns that might indicate an attempted or successful attack.

#### 4.9. Real-World Examples

While specific public breaches solely attributed to Harbor default credentials might be less frequently publicized directly, the general issue of default credentials leading to breaches is extremely common across various systems and applications.  The principle remains the same:

* **General Default Credential Exploitation:** Numerous high-profile breaches have occurred due to the exploitation of default credentials in various systems, highlighting the pervasive nature of this vulnerability.
* **Similar Container Registry Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities related to weak or default credentials have been reported in other container registry solutions, demonstrating that this is a relevant concern in the container security landscape.

#### 4.10. Conclusion

The "Default Credentials" attack path for Harbor is a **critical security risk** that must be addressed immediately.  The ease of exploitation, combined with the potentially catastrophic impact of successful compromise, makes this a **high-priority vulnerability**.

**The most crucial action is to ensure that the default `admin` password is changed immediately upon Harbor deployment and that a strong password policy is enforced.**  Implementing the recommended mitigation and detection strategies outlined in this analysis will significantly reduce the risk of exploitation and enhance the overall security posture of the Harbor instance.

**Recommendation to Development Team:**

* **Implement mandatory password change for the default `admin` account in the next Harbor release.** This is the most effective way to prevent this attack vector.
* **Clearly document the importance of changing default credentials in the Harbor installation and configuration guides.**
* **Provide tools or scripts to assist administrators in securely changing default passwords and managing user accounts.**
* **Incorporate security best practices related to default credentials into developer training and security awareness programs.**

By proactively addressing this critical vulnerability, the development team can significantly improve the security of Harbor and protect users from potential attacks exploiting default credentials.
