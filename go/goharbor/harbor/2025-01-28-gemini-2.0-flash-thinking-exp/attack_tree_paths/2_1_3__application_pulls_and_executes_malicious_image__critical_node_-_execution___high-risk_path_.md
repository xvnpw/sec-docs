### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 2.1.3. Application Pulls and Executes Malicious Image

**Attack Tree Path:** 2.1.3. Application Pulls and Executes Malicious Image [CRITICAL NODE - Execution] [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Description:** This attack path focuses on the critical stage where a containerized application, configured to pull images from a Harbor registry, inadvertently pulls and executes a malicious container image. This malicious image, having been previously injected into the registry through other attack paths, now becomes active and can compromise the application's runtime environment and potentially the underlying infrastructure. The "CRITICAL NODE - Execution" designation highlights the severity of this stage, as it represents the point where the attacker's malicious payload is activated. The "HIGH-RISK PATH" indicates the significant potential for damage and compromise associated with successful execution of malicious code within a containerized environment.

**Attack Vectors (Detailed Analysis):**

#### 4.1. Waiting for applications to automatically pull and deploy the injected malicious images.

*   **Mechanism:** This attack vector leverages the common practice of automated application deployments and updates. Modern container orchestration platforms (like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc.) and CI/CD pipelines are often configured to automatically pull the latest image versions from a registry when deploying or updating applications. If a malicious image has been injected into the Harbor registry, replacing a legitimate image or introduced as a new tag, these automated systems will unknowingly pull and deploy the compromised image.

*   **Prerequisites for Successful Exploitation:**
    *   **Successful Malicious Image Injection:** The attacker must have already successfully injected a malicious container image into the target Harbor registry. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
        *   Compromised Harbor administrator or developer credentials.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Harbor registry itself.
        *   Supply chain attacks targeting the image build process.
    *   **Automated Image Pull Configuration:** Target applications must be configured to automatically pull images from the compromised Harbor registry. This is a common practice for continuous deployment and updates.
    *   **Lack of Image Verification:**  The application deployment process must lack robust image verification mechanisms, such as:
        *   Image signing and verification (Docker Content Trust).
        *   Image scanning for vulnerabilities and malware *before* deployment.
        *   Manual review or approval processes for image updates.

*   **Impact of Successful Exploitation:**
    *   **Immediate Execution of Malicious Code:** Upon deployment, the malicious image will be executed within the application's container runtime environment.
    *   **Application Compromise:** The malicious code can perform a wide range of malicious activities within the application's context, including:
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data processed by the application.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Attempting to escalate privileges within the container or the underlying host system.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disrupting the application's functionality or consuming resources to cause a denial of service.
        *   **Lateral Movement:** Using the compromised application as a pivot point to attack other systems within the network.
        *   **Backdoor Installation:** Establishing persistent access to the compromised environment for future attacks.
    *   **Widespread Impact:** If multiple applications are configured to pull images from the compromised registry, a single malicious image injection can lead to widespread compromise across the entire infrastructure.

*   **Example Scenario:**
    1.  An attacker compromises a developer's credentials and gains push access to a repository in Harbor.
    2.  The attacker replaces the legitimate `myapp:latest` image with a malicious image containing a reverse shell.
    3.  A Kubernetes deployment is configured to automatically pull `myapp:latest` for application updates.
    4.  Kubernetes, unaware of the malicious image, pulls and deploys the compromised `myapp:latest` image.
    5.  The malicious image executes, establishing a reverse shell connection to the attacker, granting them control over the application's container and potentially the underlying node.

#### 4.2. Exploiting vulnerabilities within the malicious image to gain control of the application's runtime environment.

*   **Mechanism:** This attack vector relies on the malicious image itself containing exploits targeting vulnerabilities in the application's runtime environment, the container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd), or even the underlying operating system kernel. These exploits are designed to be triggered upon execution of the container, leveraging weaknesses in the software stack to gain unauthorized access or control.

*   **Prerequisites for Successful Exploitation:**
    *   **Successful Malicious Image Injection:**  Similar to the previous vector, a malicious image must be injected into the Harbor registry.
    *   **Vulnerability in Runtime Environment:** The target application's runtime environment, container runtime, or underlying OS must contain exploitable vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be:
        *   Known vulnerabilities in the container runtime (e.g., `runc` vulnerabilities).
        *   Vulnerabilities in libraries or dependencies included in the base image or application image.
        *   Kernel vulnerabilities that can be exploited from within a container.
    *   **Exploit in Malicious Image:** The malicious image must be crafted to contain exploits specifically targeting these vulnerabilities. This requires the attacker to have knowledge of the target environment and relevant exploits.

*   **Impact of Successful Exploitation:**
    *   **Container Escape:** Exploits targeting container runtime vulnerabilities can allow the attacker to escape the container's isolation and gain access to the host operating system.
    *   **Host Compromise:**  Successful container escape can lead to full compromise of the underlying host system, granting the attacker root-level access and control.
    *   **Runtime Environment Takeover:** Exploits targeting vulnerabilities within the application's runtime environment can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's context, potentially gaining control over the application itself.
    *   **Similar Impacts as Vector 4.1:** Data exfiltration, privilege escalation, DoS, lateral movement, backdoor installation, but potentially with a more severe and widespread impact due to host compromise.

*   **Example Scenario:**
    1.  An attacker injects a malicious image into Harbor that contains an exploit for a known vulnerability in the `runc` container runtime.
    2.  An application pulls and executes this malicious image.
    3.  Upon execution, the exploit within the malicious image is triggered.
    4.  The exploit successfully leverages the `runc` vulnerability to escape the container sandbox.
    5.  The attacker gains root access to the host operating system running the container, potentially compromising the entire node and other containers running on it.

**Potential Vulnerabilities in Harbor and Related Components that Enable this Attack Path:**

While this attack path focuses on the *execution* stage, vulnerabilities in Harbor and its surrounding ecosystem can significantly increase the likelihood of malicious image injection, which is a prerequisite for this attack path. These vulnerabilities include:

*   **Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses:** Weak or misconfigured authentication and authorization mechanisms in Harbor can allow unauthorized users to push images, facilitating malicious image injection.
*   **Registry Vulnerabilities:** Vulnerabilities in Harbor's core registry components (e.g., distribution, database, API) could be exploited to directly inject or replace images without proper authentication.
*   **Image Scanning Bypass or Ineffectiveness:** If Harbor's integrated image scanning is bypassed, misconfigured, or uses outdated vulnerability databases, malicious images might not be detected during the upload process.
*   **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities:** Compromised base images or dependencies used in building legitimate images can introduce vulnerabilities that are later exploited by attackers who inject malicious images based on these vulnerable foundations.
*   **Configuration Errors:** Misconfigurations in Harbor's settings, network policies, or access controls can inadvertently create attack vectors for malicious image injection and execution.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively mitigate the risks associated with the "Application Pulls and Executes Malicious Image" attack path, the following security measures should be implemented:
