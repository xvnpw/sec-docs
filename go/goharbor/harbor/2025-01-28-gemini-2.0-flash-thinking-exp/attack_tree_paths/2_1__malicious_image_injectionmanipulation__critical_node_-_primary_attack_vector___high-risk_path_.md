### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1. Malicious Image Injection/Manipulation

This section provides a detailed breakdown of each attack vector within the "Malicious Image Injection/Manipulation" attack path.

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Gaining write access to a Harbor project to upload and manipulate container images.

**Description:** This is the foundational attack vector.  To inject or manipulate images, an attacker must first gain the necessary permissions within Harbor to write to a project. This project could be a target project containing legitimate images or even a newly created project used as a staging area.

**Detailed Steps:**

1.  **Reconnaissance:** The attacker identifies a target Harbor instance and potentially specific projects within it. They may gather information about project names, image tags, and user roles.
2.  **Access Acquisition:** The attacker attempts to gain write access to a Harbor project through various means:
    *   **Credential Compromise:**
        *   **Brute-force/Credential Stuffing:** Attempting to guess weak usernames and passwords or using leaked credentials from previous breaches.
        *   **Phishing:** Tricking legitimate users with write access into revealing their credentials.
        *   **Exploiting Application Vulnerabilities:** Compromising applications that have service accounts or API keys with write access to Harbor.
        *   **Insider Threat:** Malicious or negligent actions by users with existing write access.
    *   **Exploiting Harbor Vulnerabilities:**
        *   Identifying and exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Harbor application itself (e.g., authentication bypass, authorization flaws, injection vulnerabilities).
    *   **Misconfiguration Exploitation:**
        *   Identifying and exploiting overly permissive project roles or public project settings that inadvertently grant write access to unauthorized users.

**Prerequisites for Attacker:**

*   **Target Harbor Instance:**  Knowledge of the Harbor instance's URL and accessibility.
*   **Potential Attack Surface:**  Identification of potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses in Harbor's security posture (e.g., weak passwords, unpatched vulnerabilities, misconfigurations).
*   **Resources:**  Tools and techniques for credential attacks, vulnerability exploitation, or social engineering.

**Technical Details (Harbor Specific):**

*   **Harbor Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Harbor utilizes RBAC to manage permissions. Attackers target gaining roles like `projectadmin` or `developer` within a project, which grant write access.
*   **Authentication Mechanisms:** Harbor supports various authentication methods (local users, LDAP/AD, OIDC). Weaknesses in any of these mechanisms can be exploited.
*   **API Access:** Harbor's API provides programmatic access for image management. Compromised API keys or tokens can grant write access.
*   **UI Access:**  The Harbor UI is used for manual image management. Compromised user credentials provide access through the UI.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **Foundation for further attacks:** Gaining write access is the necessary first step for image injection and manipulation.
*   **Data Breach (Indirect):**  By injecting malicious images, attackers can compromise applications pulling those images, potentially leading to data breaches.
*   **Service Disruption (Indirect):**  Malicious images can cause application failures or instability, leading to service disruption.
*   **Supply Chain Compromise:**  If legitimate images are replaced with malicious ones, the entire software supply chain relying on those images is compromised.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strong Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Enforce Strong Passwords:** Implement password complexity requirements and regular password rotation policies.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Enable MFA for all Harbor users, especially those with administrative or write access.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions. Regularly review and refine project roles.
    *   **Secure API Key Management:**  Rotate API keys regularly, store them securely (e.g., using secrets management tools), and restrict their scope.
*   **Vulnerability Management:**
    *   **Regular Security Patching:**  Keep Harbor and its underlying infrastructure (OS, dependencies) up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regularly scan Harbor and its infrastructure for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct periodic penetration testing to identify and address security weaknesses.
*   **Security Auditing and Monitoring:**
    *   **Audit Logging:**  Enable comprehensive audit logging for all Harbor activities, especially authentication attempts, authorization changes, and image operations.
    *   **Security Monitoring:**  Implement security monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious activities, such as unusual login attempts, unauthorized access, or unexpected image uploads.
*   **Network Security:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Harbor instance within a secure network segment.
    *   **Firewall Rules:**  Implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to Harbor to authorized networks and users.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector: Injecting backdoored images with the same tags as legitimate images to trick applications into pulling malicious versions.

**Description:** Once write access is gained, attackers can replace legitimate images with backdoored versions while maintaining the same tags. This is a highly effective attack as applications pulling images by tag will unknowingly retrieve the malicious image.

**Detailed Steps:**

1.  **Target Image Identification:** The attacker identifies a legitimate image within the compromised project that is actively used by applications. They determine the image name and tags.
2.  **Backdoor Image Creation:** The attacker creates a malicious container image. This image can contain various backdoors, malware, or exploits designed to compromise applications or infrastructure when executed.
3.  **Image Tag Manipulation:** The attacker uses their write access to:
    *   **Push the backdoored image to the Harbor registry.**
    *   **Tag the malicious image with the same tags as the legitimate image.** This effectively overwrites the legitimate image associated with those tags (depending on Harbor configuration and immutability policies).
4.  **Application Compromise:** Applications configured to pull the legitimate image (using the compromised tags) will now pull and execute the backdoored image, leading to compromise.

**Prerequisites for Attacker:**

*   **Write Access to Harbor Project:** Achieved through the previous attack vector (4.1).
*   **Knowledge of Target Image Tags:**  Understanding which image tags are used by applications.
*   **Ability to Create Malicious Images:**  Skills and tools to build container images containing backdoors or malware.

**Technical Details (Harbor Specific):**

*   **Image Tagging:** Harbor allows multiple tags to point to the same image manifest. Attackers exploit this by re-tagging a malicious image with legitimate tags.
*   **Image Layer Immutability (Context Dependent):** While image layers are generally immutable, the *association* of tags to image manifests can be changed.  If Harbor doesn't enforce strict immutability policies on tags or image content verification, this attack is feasible.
*   **Content Trust (Not Enabled by Default):** Harbor supports content trust (image signing), but it's not enabled by default. If content trust is not enforced, there's no cryptographic verification of image integrity.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **Severe Supply Chain Compromise:**  Applications across the organization pulling the compromised image will be affected.
*   **Widespread Code Execution:**  The backdoored image can execute malicious code within the application's environment.
*   **Data Breach:**  Malware within the image can steal sensitive data from applications or the underlying infrastructure.
*   **System Takeover:**  In some cases, the backdoored image could allow attackers to gain control of the host system running the container.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Content Trust / Image Signing:**
    *   **Enable Harbor Content Trust:**  Implement and enforce image signing using Notary or similar technologies. This ensures that only signed images from trusted publishers are accepted.
    *   **Image Verification at Pull Time:**  Configure applications to verify image signatures before pulling them from Harbor.
*   **Immutable Tags (Policy Enforcement):**
    *   **Implement Policies to Prevent Tag Overwriting:**  Configure Harbor or implement external policies to prevent or strictly control the overwriting of tags, especially for production images.
    *   **Use Content-Addressable Identifiers (Digests):**  Encourage or enforce pulling images by digest (e.g., `image@sha256:…`) instead of tags in production deployments. Digests are immutable and uniquely identify image content.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning of Images:**
    *   **Mandatory Image Scanning:**  Integrate vulnerability scanning into the Harbor workflow and enforce policies that prevent vulnerable images from being pushed or deployed.
    *   **Regular Scanning of Existing Images:**  Periodically scan images in Harbor to detect newly discovered vulnerabilities.
*   **Access Logging and Monitoring (Detection):**
    *   **Monitor Image Push and Tagging Events:**  Alert on unusual image push activities, especially tag manipulations of critical images.
    *   **Analyze Audit Logs:**  Regularly review audit logs for suspicious image management operations.
*   **Image Provenance and Transparency:**
    *   **Establish Clear Image Provenance Tracking:**  Implement processes to track the origin and build process of container images.
    *   **Supply Chain Security Practices:**  Adopt secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) practices for building and managing container images.

#### 4.3. Attack Vector: Uploading new malicious images and attempting to trick applications into pulling them.

**Description:**  Attackers, having gained write access, can upload entirely new malicious images to Harbor. They then attempt to trick applications or developers into using these malicious images instead of legitimate ones. This attack relies on social engineering, misconfiguration, or lack of proper image source verification.

**Detailed Steps:**

1.  **Malicious Image Creation:** The attacker creates a malicious container image, similar to vector 4.2.
2.  **Malicious Image Upload:** The attacker uploads the malicious image to the compromised Harbor project. They may choose a name that is similar to legitimate images or appears plausible.
3.  **Deception and Misdirection:** The attacker attempts to trick applications or developers into using the malicious image through various methods:
    *   **Social Engineering:**  Convincing developers or operations teams to use the malicious image through phishing, misleading documentation, or internal communication channels.
    *   **Configuration Manipulation:**  Exploiting misconfigurations in application deployment pipelines or infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to point to the malicious image.
    *   **Namespace Confusion:**  Uploading images with names that could be easily confused with legitimate images in other namespaces or projects.
    *   **Exploiting Lack of Image Source Verification:**  If applications do not strictly verify the source registry and image name, they might be vulnerable to pulling the malicious image if it's presented as a valid option.

**Prerequisites for Attacker:**

*   **Write Access to Harbor Project:** Achieved through the previous attack vector (4.1).
*   **Ability to Create Malicious Images:** Skills and tools to build container images containing backdoors or malware.
*   **Social Engineering Skills (Optional but Helpful):**  Ability to manipulate or deceive individuals or systems.
*   **Knowledge of Application Deployment Processes (Helpful):** Understanding how applications are deployed and configured to pull images.

**Technical Details (Harbor Specific):**

*   **Image Naming Conventions:**  Attackers can leverage similar image names to confuse users.
*   **Project Visibility and Access Control:**  If projects are not properly secured, malicious images might be discoverable and potentially used by unintended parties.
*   **Lack of Image Whitelisting/Blacklisting (Application Side):**  If applications don't have strict policies on allowed image sources, they are more vulnerable to this attack.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **Application Compromise:**  Applications pulling and running the malicious image will be compromised.
*   **Data Breach:**  Malware within the image can steal sensitive data.
*   **Service Disruption:**  Malicious images can cause application failures or instability.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  If the organization is tricked into using and distributing malicious images, it can suffer reputational damage.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strict Image Source Policies in Applications:**
    *   **Image Whitelisting:**  Configure applications to only pull images from explicitly whitelisted registries and repositories.
    *   **Registry and Repository Verification:**  Implement checks in application deployment pipelines to verify the source registry and repository of images being used.
*   **Developer Security Training:**
    *   **Security Awareness Training:**  Educate developers and operations teams about the risks of using untrusted container images and the importance of verifying image sources.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Promote secure coding practices that include verifying image sources and using digests instead of tags.
*   **Image Naming Conventions and Namespace Management:**
    *   **Clear Naming Conventions:**  Establish and enforce clear naming conventions for container images to reduce the risk of confusion.
    *   **Namespace Isolation:**  Use Harbor projects and namespaces to logically separate images and control access.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning of Images (Proactive Defense):**
    *   **Scan All Uploaded Images:**  Mandatory vulnerability scanning of all images uploaded to Harbor, even new ones.
    *   **Policy Enforcement:**  Prevent the use of images with critical vulnerabilities.
*   **Access Logging and Monitoring (Detection):**
    *   **Monitor Image Pull Requests:**  Monitor and log image pull requests, especially for newly uploaded images or images from unusual projects.
    *   **Alert on Suspicious Image Usage:**  Alert on applications attempting to pull images from unexpected or untrusted projects.
