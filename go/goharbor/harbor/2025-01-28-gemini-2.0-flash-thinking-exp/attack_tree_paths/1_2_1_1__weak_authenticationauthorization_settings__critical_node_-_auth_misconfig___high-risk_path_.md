### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.1.1. Weak Authentication/Authorization Settings [CRITICAL NODE - Auth Misconfig]

This attack path, categorized as a **CRITICAL NODE** due to **Auth Misconfiguration** and labeled as a **HIGH-RISK PATH**, highlights the severe security implications of inadequate authentication and authorization settings in a Harbor registry.  If an attacker successfully exploits these weaknesses, they can gain unauthorized access, potentially leading to:

*   **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive container images, Helm charts, and other artifacts stored in the registry.
*   **Supply Chain Compromise:**  Tampering with container images, injecting malware, or replacing legitimate images with malicious ones, leading to widespread downstream impact on applications using these images.
*   **Denial of Service:** Disrupting registry operations, deleting repositories, or locking out legitimate users.
*   **Reputation Damage:** Loss of trust and credibility for the organization hosting the Harbor registry.

Let's analyze each attack vector in detail:

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Attempting to use default credentials if they have not been changed.

**Description:**

Many systems, including Harbor, are initially deployed with default administrative credentials (username/password). If administrators fail to change these default credentials during or immediately after installation, attackers can easily discover and exploit them. Default credentials are often publicly known or easily guessable.

**Exploitation Scenario:**

1.  **Discovery:** An attacker identifies a publicly accessible Harbor instance (e.g., through port scanning or web application reconnaissance).
2.  **Credential Guessing:** The attacker attempts to log in to the Harbor UI or API using common default credentials for Harbor, such as `admin/Harbor12345` (or similar variations documented in older versions or online resources).
3.  **Successful Login:** If the default credentials have not been changed, the attacker gains administrative access to the Harbor registry.
4.  **Malicious Actions:** With administrative access, the attacker can perform a wide range of malicious actions, including:
    *   Creating new administrative accounts for persistent access.
    *   Modifying access control policies.
    *   Pulling and pushing images to any repository.
    *   Deleting repositories and projects.
    *   Exposing sensitive data.

**Impact Assessment:**

*   **Confidentiality:** **HIGH**. Complete access to all data within the Harbor registry.
*   **Integrity:** **HIGH**. Ability to modify or delete any data, including container images and configurations.
*   **Availability:** **HIGH**. Ability to disrupt registry operations and potentially cause a denial of service.

**Likelihood Assessment:**

*   **MEDIUM to HIGH**. While security awareness is increasing, default credentials are still a common oversight, especially in rapid deployments or less mature environments. Automated scanning tools can easily identify instances with default credentials.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Mandatory Password Change on First Login:**  Implement a system that forces administrators to change the default password immediately upon their first login to the Harbor UI or API.
*   **Strong Password Policy Enforcement:**  Enforce a strong password policy that requires complex passwords, minimum length, and regular password rotation for all user accounts, including administrative accounts.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and remediate any instances of default credentials or weak password configurations.
*   **Security Awareness Training:**  Educate administrators and DevOps teams about the critical importance of changing default credentials and implementing strong password policies.
*   **Automated Configuration Management:** Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Terraform) to automate the deployment and configuration of Harbor, ensuring that default passwords are never used in production environments.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector: Exploiting weak password policies to crack user passwords.

**Description:**

Even if default credentials are changed, weak password policies can still leave user accounts vulnerable to password cracking attacks. Weak password policies might allow:

*   Short passwords.
*   Simple passwords based on dictionary words or common patterns.
*   Lack of password complexity requirements (e.g., mixed case, numbers, special characters).
*   No password expiration or rotation requirements.

**Exploitation Scenario:**

1.  **User Enumeration (Optional):** An attacker might attempt to enumerate valid usernames in Harbor (e.g., through brute-forcing login attempts or exploiting information leaks).
2.  **Password Cracking:** The attacker obtains a list of usernames (if enumerated) or assumes common usernames (e.g., developers, operators). They then employ password cracking techniques, such as:
    *   **Brute-force attacks:** Trying all possible password combinations.
    *   **Dictionary attacks:** Using lists of common passwords and dictionary words.
    *   **Rainbow table attacks:** Using pre-computed hashes to quickly reverse password hashes.
    *   **Credential stuffing:** Using leaked credentials from other breaches to attempt login.
3.  **Successful Password Crack:** If a user account has a weak password, the attacker is likely to successfully crack it.
4.  **Unauthorized Access:** With compromised user credentials, the attacker gains access to Harbor with the privileges associated with that user account. This could range from read-only access to administrative privileges, depending on the compromised user's role.
5.  **Malicious Actions:** Depending on the compromised user's privileges, the attacker can perform actions such as:
    *   Pulling sensitive images.
    *   Pushing malicious images (if write access is granted).
    *   Modifying project settings (if sufficient privileges).
    *   Potentially escalating privileges if vulnerabilities exist.

**Impact Assessment:**

*   **Confidentiality:** **MEDIUM to HIGH**. Access to data depends on the compromised user's privileges. Administrative account compromise leads to high impact.
*   **Integrity:** **MEDIUM to HIGH**. Ability to modify data depends on the compromised user's privileges. Administrative account compromise leads to high impact.
*   **Availability:** **LOW to MEDIUM**. Potential for disruption depends on the compromised user's privileges and attacker actions.

**Likelihood Assessment:**

*   **MEDIUM**. Weak password policies are still prevalent in many organizations. Password cracking tools are readily available and effective against weak passwords. Credential stuffing attacks are also increasingly common.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Implement and strictly enforce strong password policies within Harbor's authentication system. This should include:
    *   Minimum password length (e.g., 12-16 characters or more).
    *   Password complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).
    *   Regular password expiration and rotation (e.g., every 90 days).
    *   Password history to prevent password reuse.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for all user accounts, especially administrative accounts. MFA adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords, making it significantly harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.
*   **Account Lockout Policies:** Implement account lockout policies to automatically lock accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts, mitigating brute-force attacks.
*   **Password Complexity Audits:** Regularly audit user passwords to identify and enforce password complexity requirements. Tools can be used to assess password strength.
*   **Security Awareness Training:** Educate users about the importance of strong passwords and the risks of using weak or reused passwords.

#### 4.3. Attack Vector: Bypassing or manipulating insecure Access Control Lists (ACLs) to gain unauthorized access.

**Description:**

Harbor uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage authorization. Insecurely configured or implemented ACLs (Access Control Lists) or RBAC policies can create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to bypass authorization controls and gain unauthorized access to resources or actions. This can occur due to:

*   **Overly Permissive Roles:** Assigning overly broad roles to users or groups, granting them more privileges than necessary (Principle of Least Privilege violation).
*   **Misconfigured Project Roles:** Incorrectly configured project roles, allowing unintended users access to projects or repositories.
*   **Vulnerabilities in RBAC Implementation:** Potential software vulnerabilities in Harbor's RBAC implementation that could be exploited to bypass authorization checks.
*   **ACL Manipulation:** In some cases, if vulnerabilities exist, attackers might be able to directly manipulate ACL configurations to grant themselves unauthorized access.

**Exploitation Scenario:**

1.  **Reconnaissance:** An attacker analyzes Harbor's RBAC configuration, potentially through:
    *   Observing user interface elements and available actions.
    *   Analyzing API responses and error messages.
    *   Exploiting information disclosure vulnerabilities.
2.  **Identify Weaknesses:** The attacker identifies weaknesses in the ACL configuration, such as overly permissive roles or misconfigured project permissions.
3.  **Exploitation:** The attacker attempts to exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access. This could involve:
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** If a user has some access, they might try to exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to escalate their privileges to a higher role (e.g., project admin to system admin).
    *   **ACL Manipulation (Advanced):** In rare cases, if vulnerabilities exist, an attacker might attempt to directly manipulate the underlying ACL storage or configuration to grant themselves unauthorized access.
    *   **Role Assumption (Misconfiguration):** Exploiting misconfigurations where roles are incorrectly assigned or inherited, leading to unintended access.
4.  **Unauthorized Access:**  The attacker gains unauthorized access to resources or actions they should not be permitted to perform based on their intended role.
5.  **Malicious Actions:**  Depending on the level of unauthorized access gained, the attacker can perform malicious actions similar to those described in previous attack vectors, such as data breaches, supply chain compromise, or denial of service.

**Impact Assessment:**

*   **Confidentiality:** **MEDIUM to HIGH**. Impact depends on the level of unauthorized access gained and the sensitivity of the accessed resources.
*   **Integrity:** **MEDIUM to HIGH**. Impact depends on the level of unauthorized access and the ability to modify data.
*   **Availability:** **LOW to MEDIUM**. Potential for disruption depends on the level of unauthorized access and attacker actions.

**Likelihood Assessment:**

*   **MEDIUM**. Misconfigurations in RBAC systems are common, especially in complex environments.  The likelihood of vulnerabilities in RBAC implementations depends on the software's security posture and patching practices.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege when assigning roles and permissions in Harbor. Grant users only the minimum necessary privileges required to perform their tasks.
*   **Regular RBAC Review and Audits:**  Regularly review and audit Harbor's RBAC configuration to identify and correct any overly permissive roles, misconfigurations, or unintended access paths.
*   **Role Granularity:** Utilize Harbor's granular role-based access control features to define specific roles with limited permissions instead of relying on broad, overly permissive roles.
*   **Project-Based Access Control:** Leverage Harbor's project-based access control to isolate resources and limit access to specific projects based on user roles and responsibilities.
*   **Security Hardening Guides:** Follow Harbor's security hardening guides and best practices for configuring RBAC and access control policies.
*   **Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Scanning:** Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify potential weaknesses in Harbor's RBAC implementation and configuration.
*   **Stay Updated and Patch Regularly:** Keep Harbor updated with the latest security patches to address any known vulnerabilities in the RBAC system or other components.
