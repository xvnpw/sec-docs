## Deep Analysis: Authentication and Authorization Bypass (Web UI & API) in Harbor

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Authentication and Authorization Bypass (Web UI & API)" attack surface in Harbor, a cloud-native registry for container images and artifacts. It outlines the objective, scope, methodology, and a detailed breakdown of this critical attack surface, along with elaborated mitigation strategies.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Authentication and Authorization Bypass (Web UI & API)" attack surface in Harbor. This includes:

*   **Identifying potential vulnerabilities:**  Delving into the technical details of Harbor's authentication and authorization mechanisms to pinpoint weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers.
*   **Understanding attack vectors:**  Analyzing how attackers might attempt to bypass authentication or authorization controls in both the Web UI and Registry API.
*   **Assessing the impact:**  Evaluating the potential consequences of a successful bypass, including data breaches, system compromise, and operational disruption.
*   **Recommending enhanced mitigation strategies:**  Providing actionable and detailed recommendations for both the Harbor development team and Harbor users to strengthen security posture and minimize the risk of exploitation.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following aspects of Harbor related to Authentication and Authorization Bypass:

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Authentication and Authorization Bypass (Web UI & API)

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the "Authentication and Authorization Bypass" attack surface, categorized by Web UI and Registry API.

#### 4.1 Web UI Authentication Bypass

**4.1.1 Potential Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection in Login Forms:**  As highlighted in the example, SQL injection vulnerabilities in the login form are a classic attack vector. If Harbor's login form directly constructs SQL queries using user-provided input (username, password) without proper sanitization and parameterization, attackers can inject malicious SQL code. This could allow them to:
    *   Bypass authentication entirely by crafting SQL injection payloads that always evaluate to true.
    *   Retrieve user credentials from the database.
    *   Modify user roles or permissions.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Login Pages or Error Messages:**  While less directly related to bypass, XSS vulnerabilities on login pages can be used to steal user credentials. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript that captures keystrokes or redirects users to a phishing site after successful login. XSS in error messages might reveal sensitive information about the authentication process, aiding in further attacks.
*   **Broken Authentication and Session Management:**
    *   **Weak Password Policies:**  If Harbor allows weak passwords or does not enforce password complexity, brute-force attacks become more feasible.
    *   **Predictable Session IDs:**  If session IDs are generated using weak algorithms or are predictable, attackers could potentially hijack valid user sessions.
    *   **Session Fixation:**  Vulnerabilities where attackers can force a user to use a session ID known to the attacker, allowing session hijacking after successful login.
    *   **Lack of Session Timeout or Inactivity Timeout:**  Leaving sessions active indefinitely increases the window of opportunity for session hijacking.
    *   **Insecure Session Storage:**  If session data is stored insecurely (e.g., in cookies without `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags, or in local storage), it becomes vulnerable to theft.
*   **Authentication Logic Flaws:**
    *   **Logic Errors in Authentication Checks:**  Flaws in the code that verifies user credentials against the database or external authentication providers (LDAP, OIDC). This could involve incorrect conditional statements, missing checks, or race conditions.
    *   **Bypass through HTTP Parameter Manipulation:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities where authentication checks can be bypassed by manipulating HTTP parameters or headers.
    *   **Insecure Deserialization (if applicable):** If session management or authentication tokens involve deserialization of objects, insecure deserialization vulnerabilities could allow arbitrary code execution or authentication bypass.
*   **Misconfiguration of External Authentication Providers (LDAP/OIDC):**  Incorrectly configured LDAP or OIDC integrations can introduce vulnerabilities. For example:
    *   **Weak LDAP Bind Credentials:**  Using weak or default credentials for the Harbor service account connecting to LDAP.
    *   **Open OIDC Registration:**  If OIDC registration is not properly restricted, attackers could create accounts and gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Incorrect OIDC Client Configuration:**  Misconfigured OIDC client settings in Harbor could lead to token leakage or bypass.

**4.1.2 Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Exploitation of Web UI:** Attackers directly interact with the Harbor Web UI, targeting login forms, session management mechanisms, and authentication endpoints.
*   **Phishing Attacks:**  Attackers could create phishing websites mimicking the Harbor login page to steal user credentials.
*   **Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force Attacks:**  Using lists of compromised credentials or automated tools to attempt to guess passwords for valid Harbor accounts.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:**  If HTTPS is not properly enforced or if SSL/TLS configurations are weak, attackers could intercept login credentials in transit.

**4.1.3 Impact of Successful Bypass (Web UI):**

*   **Full Administrative Access:**  Bypassing authentication could grant attackers administrative privileges, allowing them to:
    *   Manage all projects and repositories.
    *   Modify system settings.
    *   Create, delete, and modify users and roles.
    *   Access sensitive configuration data.
*   **Data Breach:**  Access to all container images and artifacts stored in Harbor, potentially including sensitive data, secrets, and intellectual property.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Manipulation of container images could lead to supply chain attacks, injecting malware or vulnerabilities into downstream applications that rely on these images.
*   **Reputation Damage:**  Compromise of a critical infrastructure component like a container registry can severely damage an organization's reputation and trust.

#### 4.2 Registry API Authentication and Authorization Bypass

**4.2.1 Potential Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Token Validation Flaws:**  As mentioned in the example, vulnerabilities in Harbor's token validation process for the Registry API are critical. This could include:
    *   **Weak Token Generation Algorithms:**  Using predictable or easily guessable token generation methods.
    *   **Insufficient Token Signature Verification:**  Failing to properly verify the digital signature of tokens, allowing attackers to forge valid tokens.
    *   **Token Reuse Vulnerabilities:**  Allowing tokens to be reused beyond their intended scope or lifetime.
    *   **Token Leakage:**  Accidental exposure of tokens in logs, error messages, or insecure storage.
*   **Broken Access Control (RBAC) in API Endpoints:**
    *   **Vertical Privilege Escalation:**  Exploiting flaws to gain access to API endpoints or operations that should be restricted to higher-privileged roles (e.g., project admin gaining system admin privileges).
    *   **Horizontal Privilege Escalation:**  Accessing resources or data belonging to other projects or users without proper authorization.
    *   **Inconsistent Authorization Checks:**  Discrepancies in authorization enforcement across different API endpoints or operations.
    *   **Bypass through API Parameter Manipulation:**  Manipulating API request parameters to circumvent authorization checks.
*   **API Key Management Issues:**
    *   **Insecure Storage of API Keys:**  Storing API keys in plaintext or easily accessible locations.
    *   **Lack of API Key Rotation:**  Not regularly rotating API keys, increasing the risk of compromise if a key is leaked.
    *   **Overly Permissive API Key Scopes:**  Granting API keys broader permissions than necessary, increasing the potential impact of key compromise.
*   **Rate Limiting and Brute-Force Attacks on API Authentication:**  Insufficient rate limiting on API authentication endpoints could allow attackers to brute-force API keys or tokens.
*   **Vulnerabilities in Underlying Authentication Libraries:**  If Harbor relies on third-party libraries for token generation or validation, vulnerabilities in these libraries could be exploited.

**4.2.2 Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct API Exploitation:**  Attackers directly interact with the Harbor Registry API, sending crafted requests to bypass authentication or authorization checks.
*   **Token Theft/Leakage:**  Obtaining valid API tokens through various means, such as:
    *   Compromising developer workstations or CI/CD pipelines where tokens might be stored.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in other systems that interact with the Harbor API.
    *   Social engineering attacks to trick users into revealing tokens.
*   **Replay Attacks:**  Reusing captured API requests with valid tokens to gain unauthorized access.

**4.2.3 Impact of Successful Bypass (Registry API):**

*   **Unauthorized Image Push/Pull:**  Attackers can push malicious images to repositories or pull sensitive images without proper authorization.
*   **Image Manipulation and Tampering:**  Attackers can modify or delete container images, potentially disrupting deployments and introducing vulnerabilities.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Access to container images may lead to the exfiltration of sensitive data, secrets, or intellectual property.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks (API Focused):**  Injecting malicious images through the API can directly compromise the container image supply chain.
*   **Project and Repository Manipulation:**  Attackers could delete projects, repositories, or modify repository settings if authorization bypass grants sufficient privileges.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies (Elaborated)

Building upon the initial mitigation strategies, here are more detailed recommendations for both the Harbor development team and users:

**5.1 Developers (Harbor Team):**

*   **Rigorous Input Validation and Output Encoding:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries:**  **Mandatory** use of parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Implement robust input validation for all user-provided data, including usernames, passwords, API keys, and any data submitted through forms or API requests. Validate data type, format, length, and allowed characters.
    *   **Output Encoding:**  Properly encode output data before rendering it in web pages or API responses to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding, URL encoding).
*   **Thorough Security Testing:**
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing by experienced security professionals, specifically targeting authentication and authorization mechanisms in both the Web UI and API. Include both automated and manual testing techniques.
    *   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**  Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically identify potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase, especially in authentication and authorization modules.
    *   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Utilize DAST tools to scan the running Harbor application for vulnerabilities, simulating real-world attacks against authentication and authorization endpoints.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Implement mandatory peer code reviews for all code changes, with a strong focus on security aspects, particularly in authentication and authorization logic. Security experts should be involved in these reviews.
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Employ fuzzing techniques to test the robustness of authentication and authorization components by providing unexpected or malformed inputs.
*   **Secure Coding Practices:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Design authentication and authorization systems based on the principle of least privilege. Grant users and API keys only the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Secure Session Management:**
        *   Generate strong, unpredictable session IDs using cryptographically secure random number generators.
        *   Implement `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for session cookies to prevent client-side script access and transmission over insecure channels.
        *   Enforce session timeouts and inactivity timeouts.
        *   Consider using server-side session storage for enhanced security.
    *   **Secure Password Handling:**
        *   **Never store passwords in plaintext.** Use strong, salted, and iterated hashing algorithms (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt, scrypt).
        *   Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, expiration).
        *   Implement password reset mechanisms securely.
    *   **Secure API Key Management:**
        *   Generate strong, unpredictable API keys.
        *   Provide mechanisms for API key rotation.

        *   Store API keys securely (e.g., encrypted at rest).
    *   **Robust Error Handling:**  Implement proper error handling that does not reveal sensitive information about the authentication process or system internals. Log errors securely for debugging purposes.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct periodic security audits of the entire Harbor codebase and infrastructure to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Management and Updates:**
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):**  Utilize SCA tools to track and manage third-party libraries and dependencies used by Harbor, especially authentication-related libraries.
    *   **Regular Dependency Updates:**  Keep all dependencies, including authentication libraries, up to date with the latest security patches. Implement a process for promptly addressing security vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning of Dependencies:**  Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability databases and tools.

**5.2 Users (Harbor Deployers/Administrators):**

*   **Enforce Strong Password Policies (Local Users):**
    *   Configure Harbor to enforce strong password complexity requirements (minimum length, character types).
    *   Encourage or enforce regular password changes.
    *   Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for local users if supported by Harbor or through external authentication providers.
*   **Secure External Authentication Provider Integration (LDAP, OIDC):**
    *   **LDAP/Active Directory:**
        *   Use strong bind credentials for the Harbor service account connecting to LDAP/AD.
        *   Secure LDAP communication using LDAPS (LDAP over SSL/TLS).
        *   Regularly review and audit LDAP/AD configurations related to Harbor integration.
    *   **OIDC:**
        *   Properly configure OIDC client settings in Harbor, ensuring correct client IDs, secrets, and redirect URIs.
        *   Restrict OIDC registration if necessary to prevent unauthorized account creation.
        *   Use reputable and secure OIDC providers.
*   **Regularly Review User Roles and Permissions (RBAC):**
    *   Implement the principle of least privilege when assigning roles and permissions within Harbor projects and system settings.
    *   Regularly review user roles and permissions to ensure they are still appropriate and necessary.
    *   Remove or disable accounts that are no longer needed.
    *   Audit user activity and access logs to detect suspicious behavior.
*   **Monitor Harbor Authentication Logs:**
    *   Enable and regularly monitor Harbor's authentication logs for suspicious activity, such as:
        *   Failed login attempts from unusual locations or IP addresses.
        *   Account lockouts.
        *   Unexpected changes in user roles or permissions.
        *   API access from unauthorized sources.
    *   Integrate Harbor logs with a centralized security information and event management (SIEM) system for enhanced monitoring and alerting.
*   **Keep Harbor Up-to-Date:**  Regularly update Harbor to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes. Follow Harbor's security advisories and release notes.
*   **Secure Harbor Deployment Environment:**
    *   Harden the underlying operating system and infrastructure where Harbor is deployed.
