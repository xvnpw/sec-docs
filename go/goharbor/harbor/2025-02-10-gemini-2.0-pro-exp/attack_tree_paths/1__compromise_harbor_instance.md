# Deep Analysis of Harbor Attack Tree Path: Admin Account Takeover

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Admin Account Takeover" path within the broader "Compromise Harbor Instance" attack tree.  We aim to:

*   Identify specific vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could lead to a successful brute-force or phishing attack against a Harbor administrator account.
*   Assess the likelihood and impact of these attacks, considering Harbor's built-in security features and common deployment practices.
*   Propose concrete mitigation strategies and recommendations to reduce the risk of administrator account compromise.
*   Evaluate the detectability of such attacks and suggest improvements to monitoring and logging.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the following attack path:

*   **Compromise Harbor Instance** -> **Admin Account Takeover** -> **Brute Force Admin Password** / **Phishing/Social Engineering**

We will consider the following aspects within this scope:

*   Harbor's authentication mechanisms (local database, LDAP/AD integration, OIDC).
*   Harbor's password policy enforcement and configuration options.
*   Harbor's rate limiting and account lockout features.
*   Common phishing and social engineering techniques targeting administrators.
*   Harbor's logging and auditing capabilities related to authentication events.
*   The interaction of Harbor with underlying infrastructure (e.g., network security, host security).
*   The human element: administrator awareness and training.

We will *not* cover other attack vectors against Harbor, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in the application code itself, supply chain attacks, or attacks against the underlying database or infrastructure *unless* they directly contribute to the success of the chosen attack path.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following methods:

1.  **Documentation Review:**  We will thoroughly review the official Harbor documentation, including security best practices, configuration guides, and release notes.
2.  **Code Review (Targeted):**  We will examine relevant sections of the Harbor codebase (available on GitHub) to understand the implementation of authentication, password handling, rate limiting, and logging.  This will be a *targeted* review, focusing on the specific attack path, not a full code audit.
3.  **Vulnerability Database Research:** We will search public vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD) for any known vulnerabilities related to Harbor's authentication mechanisms.
4.  **Threat Modeling:** We will use threat modeling principles to identify potential weaknesses and attack scenarios.
5.  **Best Practice Analysis:** We will compare Harbor's security features and configuration options against industry best practices for authentication and access control.
6.  **Penetration Testing (Conceptual):** While a full penetration test is outside the scope of this *document*, we will conceptually outline how a penetration tester might attempt to exploit the identified vulnerabilities.  This will inform our risk assessment and mitigation recommendations.
7. **Expert Knowledge:** Leveraging experience in cybersecurity, particularly in application security, container security, and authentication protocols.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

### 2.1.  Admin Account Takeover

This is the critical node in our attack path.  Gaining administrative access to Harbor provides the attacker with complete control over the registry.  This includes the ability to:

*   Push malicious images.
*   Delete legitimate images.
*   Modify user permissions.
*   Exfiltrate sensitive data (e.g., image metadata, user credentials).
*   Configure webhooks to trigger external actions.
*   Potentially pivot to other systems if Harbor is integrated with them (e.g., Kubernetes clusters).

### 2.2. Brute Force Admin Password (1.1.1)

**Detailed Analysis:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Weak or default administrator passwords, combined with insufficient rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms, make Harbor vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
*   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker uses a tool like Hydra or Medusa to systematically try common passwords and variations against the Harbor login endpoint.  They might target the default `admin` account or attempt to enumerate other administrator usernames.
*   **Harbor's Defenses:**
    *   **Password Policy:** Harbor allows administrators to configure password complexity requirements (minimum length, character types).  A strong password policy significantly reduces the effectiveness of brute-force attacks.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Harbor *should* implement rate limiting to restrict the number of login attempts from a single IP address or user within a given time period.  This is crucial to prevent automated brute-forcing.  We need to verify the effectiveness and configurability of this feature.
    *   **Account Lockout:** After a certain number of failed login attempts, Harbor *should* lock the account, preventing further attempts until an administrator unlocks it.  This is another essential defense.  We need to confirm its presence and configuration options.
    *   **CAPTCHA:** While not a primary defense, a CAPTCHA can add an extra layer of protection against automated attacks. Harbor may or may not implement this.
    *   **2FA/MFA:** Two-factor or multi-factor authentication, if enabled, makes brute-force attacks significantly harder, even with a weak password. Harbor supports OIDC, which can be used to integrate with MFA providers.
*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Examine the authentication logic in `src/core/service/auth` (and related directories) to understand how password validation, rate limiting, and account lockout are implemented.
    *   Check for configuration parameters related to these features in `src/common/config`.
    *   Look for any potential bypasses or weaknesses in the rate limiting or lockout mechanisms.
*   **Vulnerability Database Check:** Search for CVEs related to "Harbor brute force" or "Harbor authentication bypass."
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce a strong password policy:**  Require a minimum length (e.g., 12 characters), a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
    *   **Enable and configure rate limiting:**  Set a low threshold for login attempts per IP address and user.
    *   **Enable and configure account lockout:**  Lock accounts after a small number of failed attempts (e.g., 3-5).
    *   **Implement 2FA/MFA:**  This is the strongest defense against brute-force attacks.  Integrate Harbor with an OIDC provider that supports MFA.
    *   **Monitor login logs:**  Regularly review Harbor's logs for suspicious login activity, such as a high number of failed attempts from a single IP address.
    *   **Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can provide additional protection against brute-force attacks by filtering malicious traffic.
    *   **Regularly update Harbor:** Ensure you are running the latest version of Harbor to benefit from security patches.
    * **Disable default admin account:** If possible, create a new admin account with a strong, unique password and disable the default `admin` account.

* **Detection:**
    * **Failed Login Attempts:** Monitor Harbor's logs for a high volume of failed login attempts, especially targeting the administrator account.
    * **IP Address Blocking:** Track IP addresses that are repeatedly blocked due to rate limiting or account lockout.
    * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate Harbor's logs with a SIEM system to correlate authentication events with other security data and detect anomalies.

### 2.3. Phishing/Social Engineering (1.1.2)

**Detailed Analysis:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Human susceptibility to deception.  Administrators, like all users, can be tricked into revealing their credentials through phishing emails, malicious websites, or other social engineering tactics.
*   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker crafts a convincing phishing email that appears to be from a legitimate source, such as a Harbor update notification, a security alert, or a request from a colleague.  The email contains a link to a fake Harbor login page that harvests the administrator's credentials.  Alternatively, the attacker might use social engineering techniques to trick the administrator into revealing their password over the phone or through other communication channels.
*   **Harbor's Defenses:** Harbor itself has limited direct defenses against phishing.  The primary defenses lie in user awareness and security training. However, 2FA/MFA provides a strong layer of protection even if credentials are stolen.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Security Awareness Training:**  Regularly train administrators (and all users) on how to identify and avoid phishing attacks.  This should include:
        *   Recognizing suspicious email addresses, links, and attachments.
        *   Verifying the authenticity of websites before entering credentials.
        *   Being wary of unsolicited requests for sensitive information.
        *   Reporting suspicious emails and incidents.
    *   **Email Security Gateway:** Implement an email security gateway that filters out phishing emails and blocks malicious links.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** As with brute-force attacks, MFA is a critical defense.  Even if an attacker obtains the administrator's password through phishing, they will still need the second factor to gain access.
    *   **Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC), Sender Policy Framework (SPF), and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM):** Implement these email authentication protocols to help prevent email spoofing and improve the detection of phishing emails.
    *   **Web Content Filtering:** Use web content filtering to block access to known phishing websites.
    * **Incident Response Plan:** Have a clear incident response plan in place to handle successful phishing attacks, including steps to reset compromised accounts and contain the damage.

* **Detection:**
    * **User Reporting:** Encourage users to report suspicious emails and potential phishing attempts.
    * **Email Security Gateway Logs:** Monitor logs from the email security gateway for blocked phishing emails and malicious links.
    * **Web Proxy Logs:** Monitor web proxy logs for access to known phishing websites.
    * **Unusual Login Activity:** Monitor Harbor's logs for unusual login activity, such as logins from unexpected locations or at unusual times. This could indicate a compromised account.
    * **Phishing Simulation Campaigns:** Conduct regular phishing simulation campaigns to test user awareness and identify areas for improvement.

## 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

The "Admin Account Takeover" path represents a significant threat to Harbor security.  Both brute-force and phishing attacks can lead to complete compromise of the registry.  While Harbor provides some built-in defenses, a multi-layered approach is essential to mitigate the risk.

**Key Recommendations:**

1.  **Strong Password Policy:** Enforce a robust password policy for all users, especially administrators.
2.  **Rate Limiting and Account Lockout:**  Enable and configure these features to prevent brute-force attacks.
3.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  This is the *most critical* recommendation.  Implement MFA for all administrator accounts.
4.  **Security Awareness Training:**  Regularly train administrators on how to identify and avoid phishing attacks.
5.  **Monitor Logs:**  Actively monitor Harbor's logs for suspicious login activity and integrate them with a SIEM system.
6.  **Keep Harbor Updated:**  Regularly update Harbor to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
7.  **Email and Web Security:** Implement email security gateways and web content filtering to block phishing attempts.
8. **Disable Default Admin:** If possible, disable the default `admin` account after creating a new, strongly-secured administrative account.
9. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.

By implementing these recommendations, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of administrator account takeover and protect their Harbor registry from compromise.
