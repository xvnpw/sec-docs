# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for goharbor/harbor

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Harbor](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_harbor.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update Harbor

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Monitor:** Subscribe to Harbor's release announcements (GitHub, mailing lists). Set up calendar reminders to check for new releases (e.g., monthly).
        2.  **Test:** Before updating production, deploy the new Harbor version to a staging environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.  This staging environment should also be a Harbor instance.
        3.  **Backup:** Back up the current Harbor database and configuration files *using Harbor's supported methods* before applying any updates.
        4.  **Update:** Follow the official Harbor upgrade instructions (specific to your deployment method - Docker Compose, Helm, etc.).
        5.  **Verify:** After the update, thoroughly test all core *Harbor functionalities* (pushing, pulling, scanning, replication, user management, project creation, etc.).
        6.  **Rollback (if necessary):** If issues arise, have a documented rollback plan to revert to the previous version using the backups *and Harbor's rollback procedures*.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities (Critical):** Exploits targeting known vulnerabilities *in Harbor itself* could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.
        *   **Authentication Bypass (Critical):** Vulnerabilities *within Harbor's authentication logic* could allow attackers to bypass authentication.
        *   **Data Disclosure (High):** Vulnerabilities *in Harbor's data handling* could lead to the exposure of sensitive information.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High):** Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities *specific to Harbor's services* to make it unavailable.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **RCE:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (assuming timely updates).
        *   **Authentication Bypass:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
        *   **Data Disclosure:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **DoS:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Updates are performed, but not on a strict schedule. Testing is done in a basic staging environment.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** A formal, documented update process. Automated vulnerability scanning of the Harbor *application* itself is missing. Rollback plan is not fully documented *using Harbor's specific methods*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Properly Configure Replication Rules (Harbor-to-Harbor or Harbor-to-External)](./mitigation_strategies/properly_configure_replication_rules__harbor-to-harbor_or_harbor-to-external_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Properly Configure Replication Rules (Harbor-to-Harbor or Harbor-to-External)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Needs:** Determine precisely which images/repositories need to be replicated and to which target registries *using Harbor's replication feature*.
        2.  **Create Specific Rules:** Within the *Harbor UI or API*, create individual replication rules for each specific need. Avoid using wildcard rules.
        3.  **Use Filters:** Utilize *Harbor's built-in filters* (tag, label, repository name) within each rule to further restrict the scope.
        4.  **Test Replication:** After creating a rule, *use Harbor's interface* to test it and ensure it replicates only the intended images.
        5.  **Regular Audit:** Schedule regular audits (e.g., quarterly) of all replication rules *within the Harbor UI*.
        6.  **Secure Target:** If replicating to another Harbor instance, ensure *that instance* is also securely configured. If replicating to an external registry, ensure credentials used by *Harbor's replication mechanism* are strong.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Leakage (High):** Overly broad *Harbor replication rules* could expose sensitive images.
        *   **Unauthorized Access (High):** Replication to an insecure target registry *via a misconfigured Harbor rule* could allow access.
        *   **Compliance Violations (Medium):** Replicating images to non-compliant environments *using Harbor's replication* could violate regulations.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **Compliance Violations:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic replication rules are in place within Harbor, but they are not granular enough.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Use of *Harbor's built-in filters* within replication rules. Regular audits of rules *within Harbor*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Securely Configure and *Utilize* Harbor's Notary Integration (Content Trust)](./mitigation_strategies/securely_configure_and_utilize_harbor's_notary_integration__content_trust_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Securely Configure and *Utilize* Harbor's Notary Integration (Content Trust)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Enable Notary:** Ensure Notary integration is enabled *within Harbor's configuration*.
        2.  **Secure Communication:** Configure TLS for all communication between Harbor and the Notary server *as specified in Harbor's documentation*.
        3.  **Harbor Configuration:** In Harbor, configure content trust settings to *require* signed images for specific projects or repositories.  This is a *critical Harbor-specific setting*.
        4.  **Policy Enforcement:** Actively *use Harbor's UI or API* to enforce policies that prevent the pulling or deployment of unsigned images.
        5. **Regularly check signing status:** Use Harbor's UI or API to check the signing status.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Critical):** A compromised Notary server could allow signing of malicious images, but *Harbor's enforcement of signed images* mitigates this.
        *   **Image Tampering (Critical):** *Harbor's reliance on Notary signatures* prevents the use of tampered images.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (when Harbor is configured to *require* signatures).
        *   **Image Tampering:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Notary is enabled in Harbor, but enforcement of signed images is not consistent.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent enforcement of signed images *via Harbor's project/repository settings*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robot Account Permissions (Principle of Least Privilege *within Harbor*)](./mitigation_strategies/robot_account_permissions__principle_of_least_privilege_within_harbor_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Robot Account Permissions (Principle of Least Privilege *within Harbor*)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Tasks:** Determine the specific tasks each robot account needs to perform *within Harbor* (push, pull, scan).
        2.  **Create Specific Accounts:** *Within the Harbor UI or API*, create a separate robot account for each distinct task.
        3.  **Grant Minimal Permissions:** Assign only the necessary *Harbor-specific permissions* to each robot account. Avoid project/system admin roles.
        4.  **Regular Review:** Schedule regular reviews (e.g., quarterly) of robot account permissions *using Harbor's interface*.
        5.  **Disable Unused Accounts:** Immediately disable any robot accounts that are no longer needed *within Harbor*.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access (High):** An overly permissive *Harbor robot account* could be compromised.
        *   **Data Modification (High):** A compromised *Harbor robot account* with write access could push malicious images.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium):** A compromised *Harbor robot account* with excessive permissions could be misused.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **Data Modification:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Robot accounts are used, but some have broader permissions than necessary *within Harbor*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Strict adherence to the principle of least privilege *for Harbor permissions*. Regular review *within Harbor*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Vulnerability Scanning Configuration and Remediation *Using Harbor's Integrated Scanners*](./mitigation_strategies/vulnerability_scanning_configuration_and_remediation_using_harbor's_integrated_scanners.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Vulnerability Scanning Configuration and Remediation *Using Harbor's Integrated Scanners*

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Select Scanner:** Choose a supported vulnerability scanner *from Harbor's list of integrated scanners* (e.g., Trivy, Clair).
        2.  **Update Database:** Ensure the scanner's vulnerability database is regularly updated (ideally, automated *through Harbor's configuration*).
        3.  **Configure Scanning:** Configure Harbor to automatically scan images upon push or on a schedule *using Harbor's settings*.
        4.  **Set Thresholds:** Define severity thresholds (e.g., Critical, High) *within Harbor* that will block deployments.
        5.  **Remediate:** Establish a process for reviewing scan results *from Harbor's UI or API* and remediating vulnerabilities.
        6.  **Notifications:** Configure *Harbor's notification system* (email, webhooks) to alert about scan results.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Deployment of Vulnerable Images (Critical):** *Harbor's scanning and blocking capabilities* prevent deployment of vulnerable images.
        *   **Zero-Day Exploits (High):** While scanning can't catch all zero-days, *Harbor's integration with scanners* reduces the exposure window.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Deployment of Vulnerable Images:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (with effective remediation and *Harbor's blocking enabled*).
        *   **Zero-Day Exploits:** Risk reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Vulnerability scanning is enabled with Trivy *within Harbor*, but the database update is manual. No blocking thresholds are configured *in Harbor*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Automated vulnerability database updates *through Harbor*. Deployment blocking based on severity *within Harbor*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Monitor Harbor's Audit Logging](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_monitor_harbor's_audit_logging.md)

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent use of secret tokens *in Harbor's webhook configuration*. Scope limitation *within Harbor*. Regular review. Input validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Harbor Configuration File (`harbor.yml` or Helm Values) *Specifically for Harbor Settings*](./mitigation_strategies/secure_harbor_configuration_file___harbor_yml__or_helm_values__specifically_for_harbor_settings.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Harbor Configuration File (`harbor.yml` or Helm Values) *Specifically for Harbor Settings*

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Review Settings:** Carefully review all settings in *Harbor's configuration file*, focusing on *Harbor-specific* security parameters (e.g., `secretkey_path`, database connection strings, external URLs, authentication settings).
        2.  **Secrets Management:** Avoid hardcoding secrets directly in *Harbor's configuration file*. Use environment variables or a secrets management solution *as supported by Harbor*.
        3.  **Validation:** After making changes, validate *Harbor's configuration file* to ensure it is syntactically correct *for Harbor*.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Misconfiguration (High):** Incorrect *Harbor-specific* settings can expose Harbor.
        *   **Credential Exposure (High):** Hardcoded secrets in *Harbor's configuration* could be exposed.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Misconfiguration:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **Credential Exposure:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic configuration file security is in place.
