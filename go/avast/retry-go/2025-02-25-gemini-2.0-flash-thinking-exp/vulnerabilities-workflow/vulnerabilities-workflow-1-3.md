Based on the provided instructions, the vulnerability report you provided should be included in the updated list. Let's review why it meets the inclusion criteria and does not fall under the exclusion criteria:

**Exclusion Criteria Check:**

- **Caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns when using project from PROJECT FILES:** This vulnerability is caused by the design of the library itself, specifically the `WrapContextErrorWithLastError` option. It's not about developers using the library in an explicitly insecure way in *their* application code.  The issue lies within the library's code.
- **Only missing documentation to mitigate:** The report suggests code-level mitigations like sanitizing errors or changing default behavior. It's not solely a documentation issue; code changes are needed to mitigate the vulnerability effectively.
- **Deny of service vulnerabilities:** This is an information disclosure vulnerability, not a denial of service vulnerability.

**Inclusion Criteria Check:**

- **Are valid and not already mitigated:** The report clearly describes a valid vulnerability with a detailed explanation, source code analysis, and a security test case. It explicitly states "Currently Implemented Mitigations: None".
- **Has vulnerability rank at least: high:** The vulnerability rank is stated as "High".

Since the vulnerability meets the inclusion criteria and does not fall under the exclusion criteria, it should be included in the updated list.

Here is the vulnerability report in markdown format as requested, which is the same as the original report because it should be included:

### Vulnerability List:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Information Disclosure via Wrapped Context Error

- **Description:**
    When using infinite retries (`Attempts(0)`) along with a context and the `WrapContextErrorWithLastError(true)` option, the library wraps the context cancellation error with the last error returned by the retried function. If this last error contains sensitive information, it could be unintentionally exposed to an attacker when the context is cancelled or times out. An attacker could intentionally trigger a context cancellation (e.g., by causing a timeout in a request) to potentially retrieve sensitive information contained within the last error returned by the retried function.

- **Impact:**
    Information Disclosure. Sensitive information that might be present in the error returned by the retried function could be leaked to an attacker. This information could include internal paths, database connection strings, or other sensitive data depending on what the retried function does and what errors it might return.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The `WrapContextErrorWithLastError` option explicitly enables this wrapping behavior.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    The library should provide an option to sanitize or suppress the last error when wrapping the context error. Alternatively, the default behavior could be changed to not include the last error, or to only include it under very specific and clearly documented circumstances.  Users should be explicitly warned about the potential risks of exposing the last error when using `WrapContextErrorWithLastError(true)`.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. The application uses the `retry-go` library with `Do` or `DoWithData` functions.
    2. The retry logic is configured with `Attempts(0)` for infinite retries.
    3. A `context.Context` is provided to the `retry.Do` function using `retry.Context()`.
    4. The `WrapContextErrorWithLastError(true)` option is enabled.
    5. The retried function can return errors that may contain sensitive information.
    6. An external attacker can somehow trigger a context cancellation or timeout (e.g., by sending a request that takes longer than the context timeout).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In `/code/retry.go`, the `DoWithData` function handles the case where `config.attempts == 0` (infinite retries).
    2. Inside the infinite loop, there is a `select` statement that checks for context cancellation:
    ```go
    select {
    case <-config.timer.After(delay(config, n, err)):
    case <-config.context.Done():
        if config.wrapContextErrorWithLastError {
            return emptyT, Error{config.context.Err(), lastErr}
        }
        return emptyT, config.context.Err()
    }
    ```
    3. When `config.context.Done()` channel is closed (context is cancelled), and `config.wrapContextErrorWithLastError` is true, the function returns `Error{config.context.Err(), lastErr}`.
    4. The `Error` type in `/code/retry.go` is a slice of errors. When `Error.Error()` method is called, it iterates through the errors and formats them into a string:
    ```go
    func (e Error) Error() string {
        logWithNumber := make([]string, len(e))
        for i, l := range e {
            if l != nil {
                logWithNumber[i] = fmt.Sprintf("#%d: %s", i+1, l.Error())
            }
        }

        return fmt.Sprintf("All attempts fail:\n%s", strings.Join(logWithNumber, "\n"))
    }
    ```
    5. In the case of context cancellation with `WrapContextErrorWithLastError(true)`, the `Error` will contain two errors: the context error (e.g., `context.Canceled` or `context.DeadlineExceeded`) and the `lastErr` from the retried function.
    6. The `Error()` method will then include the string representation of both errors in the final error message, potentially exposing sensitive information from `lastErr`.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a simple HTTP server that uses the `retry-go` library.
    2. Configure the `retry.Do` function with:
        - `Attempts(0)` for infinite retries.
        - `Context` with a timeout (e.g., 1 second).
        - `WrapContextErrorWithLastError(true)`.
        - A retryable function that simulates a function that might return sensitive information in its error. For example, this function could intentionally return an error message containing a secret key if a certain condition is met (for testing purposes). In a real-world scenario, this sensitive information could be part of a genuine error from a backend service.
    3. Make an HTTP request to an endpoint that triggers the `retry.Do` function. Ensure that the retried function fails and returns an error containing simulated sensitive information. Make sure the context timeout is shorter than the time it takes for the retry to succeed (to force a context timeout).
    4. Observe the error message returned by the HTTP server when the context times out.
    5. Verify that the error message contains both the context timeout error and the error from the retried function, including the simulated sensitive information.

    **Example Code Snippet (Illustrative - Not Directly Runnable Test Case):**

    ```go
    package main

    import (
        "context"
        "errors"
        "fmt"
        "net/http"
        "time"

        "github.com/avast/retry-go/v4"
    )

    func main() {
        http.HandleFunc("/test", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(r.Context(), 100*time.Millisecond)
            defer cancel()

            _, err := retry.Do(
                func() error {
                    // Simulate a function that might return sensitive info in error
                    return errors.New("Failed to connect to database with password: SECRET_PASSWORD")
                },
                retry.Attempts(0),
                retry.Context(ctx),
                retry.WrapContextErrorWithLastError(true),
            )

            if err != nil {
                w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
                w.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf("Error: %s", err.Error()))) // Error message potentially exposed in response
                return
            }

            w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
            w.Write([]byte("Success"))
        })

        fmt.Println("Server listening on :8080")
        http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
    }
    ```

    **Expected Outcome of Test Case:**
    When accessing `/test` endpoint, the server should return a 500 error. The response body should contain an error message similar to: "Error: All attempts fail:\n#1: context deadline exceeded\n#2: Failed to connect to database with password: SECRET_PASSWORD". This demonstrates that the sensitive information "SECRET_PASSWORD" from the retried function's error is exposed in the final error message due to `WrapContextErrorWithLastError(true)`.
