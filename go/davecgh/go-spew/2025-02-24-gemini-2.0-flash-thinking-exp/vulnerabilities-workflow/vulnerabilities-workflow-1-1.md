## Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Information Exposure via Unhandled Panic in Stringer/Error Interfaces
- Description:
    1. An attacker cannot directly trigger this vulnerability in `go-spew` library itself, as it's a library and doesn't handle external input directly.
    2. However, if a developer uses `go-spew` to dump data structures in a web application (as suggested in the README example for debugging purposes), and the dumped data structure contains a type that panics within its `Stringer` or `Error` interface method, `go-spew`'s panic handling mechanism might expose sensitive information.
    3. Specifically, `go-spew`'s `catchPanic` function, when recovering from a panic during `Stringer` or `Error` method invocation, uses `fmt.Fprintf(w, "%v", err)` to write the panic error to the output writer.
    4. If the panic error message itself contains sensitive information (e.g., internal server paths, database connection strings, or other secrets inadvertently included in error messages), and the developer does not properly sanitize the output of `go-spew` (e.g., by escaping HTML in a web context as suggested in the README, but failing to sanitize the panic error message itself), this sensitive information could be exposed to an external attacker.
    5. For instance, if a custom type's `Stringer` method attempts to access a nil pointer and panics, the panic message might include the memory address `0x0` or other memory details which while not directly exploitable, could aid in information gathering. More critically, if a panic is triggered due to a logic error that reveals internal configuration or data paths within the error string, this information could be leaked.
- Impact: Information Exposure. Sensitive information contained within panic error messages from `Stringer` or `Error` interfaces could be exposed to an attacker if the developer using `go-spew` does not sanitize the output appropriately. This information could potentially aid in further attacks or compromise the application's security.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The `catchPanic` function in `common.go` attempts to handle panics from `Stringer` and `Error` methods gracefully, preventing the application using `go-spew` from crashing due to panics within these methods.
    - The README.md provides a debugging example for web applications and explicitly warns developers to use `html.EscapeString()` for safety reasons when displaying spew output in HTML.
    - However, `html.EscapeString()` as suggested in README example will escape HTML entities in the *dumped value*, but it will *not* sanitize the panic error message itself if the panic message contains sensitive data. Developers might incorrectly assume that using `html.EscapeString()` as suggested is sufficient to sanitize all output from `go-spew`, including panic messages.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - `go-spew` itself lacks specific sanitization or redaction of panic error messages. It directly outputs the error message from the recovered panic.
    - The documentation could be improved to explicitly warn about the potential for sensitive information leakage through panic error messages and advise developers to sanitize or redact `go-spew`'s output, specifically considering panic scenarios and the content of panic error messages, beyond just HTML escaping.
- Preconditions:
    1. A developer uses `go-spew` to dump data structures in a publicly accessible application, typically for debugging purposes in development environments, but potentially mistakenly in production.
    2. The dumped data structure contains a type that has a `Stringer` or `Error` interface implementation that can panic under certain conditions.
    3. The panic error message generated by Go runtime contains sensitive information.
    4. The developer does not properly sanitize or redact the output from `go-spew`, including the panic error messages, before displaying it in a context accessible to an attacker (e.g., web page source code, logs).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/spew/common.go`
    - Function: `catchPanic(w io.Writer, v reflect.Value)`
    ```go
    func catchPanic(w io.Writer, v reflect.Value) {
    	if err := recover(); err != nil {
    		w.Write(panicBytes) // Writes "(PANIC="
    		fmt.Fprintf(w, "%v", err) // Writes the panic error message AS IS
    		w.Write(closeParenBytes) // Writes ")"
    	}
    }
    ```
    - The `catchPanic` function recovers from panics.
    - It writes `(PANIC=` to the output writer `w`.
    - Critically, it uses `fmt.Fprintf(w, "%v", err)` to write the recovered panic error `err` directly to the writer without any sanitization. The `%v` verb in `fmt.Fprintf` will use default formatting for the error, which typically includes the full panic message.
    - It finishes by writing `)`.
    - File: `/code/spew/common.go`
    - Function: `handleMethods(cs *ConfigState, w io.Writer, v reflect.Value) (handled bool)`
    ```go
    func handleMethods(cs *ConfigState, w io.Writer, v reflect.Value) (handled bool) {
        // ...
        switch iface := v.Interface().(type) {
        case error:
            defer catchPanic(w, v) // catchPanic is deferred for error interface
            // ...
            w.Write([]byte(iface.Error())) // Writes error string if no ContinueOnMethod
            // ...
        case fmt.Stringer:
            defer catchPanic(w, v) // catchPanic is deferred for Stringer interface
            // ...
            w.Write([]byte(iface.String())) // Writes stringer string if no ContinueOnMethod
            // ...
        }
        return false
    }
    ```
    - `handleMethods` uses `defer catchPanic(w, v)` to handle panics that might occur when calling `iface.Error()` or `iface.String()`. This ensures that if these methods panic, `catchPanic` will be executed to recover and write the panic information.
    - The key issue is that the panic error message `err` in `catchPanic` is not sanitized before being written to the output.
    - File: `/code/spew/format_test.go`
    - Function: `addPanicFormatterTests()`
    ```go
    func addPanicFormatterTests() {
    	// Type that panics in its Stringer interface.
    	v := panicer(127)
    	nv := (*panicer)(nil)
    	pv := &v
    	vAddr := fmt.Sprintf("%p", pv)
    	pvAddr := fmt.Sprintf("%p", &pv)
    	vt := "spew_test.panicer"
    	vs := "(PANIC=test panic)127" // Expected output includes panic message
    	addFormatterTest("%v", v, vs)
    	// ... (rest of the tests)
    }
    ```
    - This test case in `format_test.go` explicitly tests the panic handling and confirms that the panic message is included in the output, demonstrating the current behavior.
    - File: `/code/spew/doc.go`
    - Section: `Errors`
    > Since it is possible for custom Stringer/error interfaces to panic, spew detects them and handles them internally by printing the panic information inline with the output.

    - The documentation explicitly states that panic information is printed inline, confirming the intended behavior which leads to the potential information exposure vulnerability.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a Go web application that imports `github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew`.
    2. Define a custom struct with a `Stringer` interface that panics and includes sensitive information in the panic message. For example:
        ```go
        type SensitiveStringer struct {
            Path string
        }

        func (s SensitiveStringer) String() string {
            if s.Path == "" {
                panic("Sensitive path information: /internal/config/secrets.json")
            }
            return "SensitiveStringer with path: " + s.Path
        }
        ```
    3. In a web handler, create an instance of this struct and use `spew.Sdump` to dump it. Do *not* sanitize the output beyond the `html.EscapeString()` example in README, which will not sanitize the panic error message.
        ```go
        func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html")
            sensitiveData := SensitiveStringer{} // Trigger panic in Stringer
            dumpOutput := spew.Sdump(sensitiveData)
            fmt.Fprintf(w, "<!--\n%s\n-->", html.EscapeString(dumpOutput))
        }
        ```
    4. Run the web application.
    5. Access the web application through a browser or `curl`.
    6. Inspect the HTML source code of the webpage.
    7. Observe that the comment section contains the output of `spew.Sdump`. Within this output, find the panic error message.
    8. Verify that the sensitive information "Sensitive path information: /internal/config/secrets.json" from the panic message is present in the HTML source code, despite using `html.EscapeString()` on the overall `spew.Sdump` output. This demonstrates that the panic error message itself is not sanitized and can lead to information exposure.
