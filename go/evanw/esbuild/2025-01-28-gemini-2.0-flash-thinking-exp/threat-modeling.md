# Threat Model Analysis for evanw/esbuild

## Threat: [Compromised `esbuild` npm Package](./threats/compromised__esbuild__npm_package.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the official `esbuild` npm package. They could inject malicious code into the package. When developers install `esbuild`, this malicious code executes during the build process, potentially injecting malware into the bundled application or developer systems.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Arbitrary code execution on developer machines and build servers via malicious build scripts.
        *   Injection of malicious code into the application's frontend, leading to client-side vulnerabilities for users.
        *   Data exfiltration from development environments.
    *   **Affected esbuild component:** npm package distribution
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize package integrity checks (`npm integrity` or `yarn check --integrity`).
        *   Regularly audit dependencies using security scanning tools.
        *   Consider using a private npm registry or mirroring the public registry for tighter control.
        *   Monitor npm advisory databases for reported vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious or Vulnerable Plugins/Loaders](./threats/malicious_or_vulnerable_pluginsloaders.md)

*   **Description:**  Developers might use malicious or vulnerable `esbuild` plugins or loaders. When `esbuild` executes these during the build, the malicious code within the plugin/loader can execute arbitrary code, potentially compromising the build process or injecting malicious content.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Arbitrary code execution during the build process via malicious plugin code.
        *   Modification of build artifacts, potentially injecting malicious code into the application.
        *   Data exfiltration from developer environments or build servers.
    *   **Affected esbuild component:** Plugin/Loader system
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and audit all plugins and loaders before use.
        *   Only use plugins/loaders from trusted sources with active maintenance and security considerations.
        *   Keep plugins/loaders updated to their latest versions.
        *   Implement a review process for new plugins/loaders.

## Threat: [Configuration Misuse Leading to Information Exposure (Source Maps in Production)](./threats/configuration_misuse_leading_to_information_exposure__source_maps_in_production_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might misconfigure `esbuild` to generate source maps for production builds. If deployed, attackers can access these source maps to reconstruct the original source code, revealing sensitive logic and potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of application source code, revealing business logic and potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Exposure of API keys, secrets, or other sensitive information embedded in the source code.
        *   Increased attack surface due to easier reverse engineering and vulnerability discovery.
    *   **Affected esbuild component:** Configuration system, source map generation
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly disable source map generation for production builds in `esbuild` configuration.
        *   Implement deployment pipeline checks to prevent source map deployment to production environments.
        *   Regularly review build configurations to ensure source maps are disabled in production.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion during Build](./threats/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion_during_build.md)

*   **Description:**  Maliciously crafted input code or specific `esbuild` configurations could cause excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) during the build process. This can lead to denial of service for build servers and developer machines, disrupting development and deployment pipelines.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Inability to build and deploy the application, causing development and deployment delays.
        *   Disruption of development workflows and CI/CD pipelines.
        *   Potential downtime if builds are required for critical updates.
    *   **Affected esbuild component:** Core bundling engine, resource handling
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement resource limits for build processes in CI/CD environments.
        *   Monitor resource usage during builds to detect anomalies and potential attacks.
        *   Be cautious about processing untrusted or excessively large codebases.
        *   Optimize build configurations and code structure to minimize resource consumption.

## Threat: [Bugs in `esbuild`'s Code Generation or Optimization Leading to Output Vulnerabilities](./threats/bugs_in__esbuild_'s_code_generation_or_optimization_leading_to_output_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs in `esbuild`'s core code generation or optimization logic could introduce subtle vulnerabilities into the bundled JavaScript code. These bugs might create exploitable conditions in the final application, even if the original source code was secure.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Introduction of vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, logic flaws, etc.) in the application's frontend code due to `esbuild` bugs.
        *   Exploitable bugs in the bundled application leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected esbuild component:** Code generation, optimization, transformation engine
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest `esbuild` versions to benefit from bug fixes.
        *   Thoroughly test the bundled application, including security testing and penetration testing.
        *   Report any suspected bugs in `esbuild`'s output to the maintainers.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools on the bundled output to detect potential code-level vulnerabilities introduced by the build process.
