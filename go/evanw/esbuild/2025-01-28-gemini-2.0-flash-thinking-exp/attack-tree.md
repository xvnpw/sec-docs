## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Supply Chain Vulnerabilities in esbuild or Dependencies (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_supply_chain_vulnerabilities_in_esbuild_or_dependencies__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the software supply chain to inject malicious code or vulnerabilities into esbuild's dependencies. This can affect any application using esbuild.
* **Breakdown:**
    * **Compromise esbuild Dependencies (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        * **Identify vulnerable dependency of esbuild (direct or transitive) (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers scan esbuild's dependency tree to find known vulnerabilities in direct or transitive dependencies.
        * **Exploit known vulnerability in dependency (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Once a vulnerable dependency is found, attackers exploit the known vulnerability (e.g., arbitrary code execution, prototype pollution) to compromise the application.
        * **Malicious dependency injection/substitution (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
            * **Dependency Confusion Attack (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers upload a malicious package to a public repository (like npm) with the same name as an internal/private package used by the application. Build tools might mistakenly download the public malicious package.
            * **Typosquatting Attack (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers register package names that are very similar to legitimate packages (e.g., with typos) hoping developers will mistakenly install the malicious package.
* **Critical Nodes:**
    * **Dependency has known security flaw (e.g., prototype pollution, arbitrary code execution) - Impact: Critical:**  Vulnerabilities like arbitrary code execution in dependencies can lead to complete application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Input Manipulation during Build Process (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_input_manipulation_during_build_process__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate inputs to the esbuild build process to inject malicious code or alter the build output.
* **Breakdown:**
    * **Malicious Code Injection via User-Controlled Input (Indirect) (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        * **Application uses user input to dynamically construct build paths or configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH):** If the application uses user-provided data to construct file paths for entry points, plugins, loaders, or configuration files, attackers can exploit path traversal vulnerabilities to include malicious files in the build process.
        * **User input influences entry points, plugins, or loaders (HIGH-RISK PATH):**  If user input can control which files are used as entry points, or which plugins/loaders are loaded, attackers can inject malicious code by providing paths to malicious files or plugins.
        * **Path traversal vulnerability allows including malicious files in build (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities allows attackers to include files from outside the intended project directory, potentially injecting malicious code into the build.
* **Critical Nodes:**
    * **Impact: Significant (Code Injection):** Successful input manipulation can lead to code injection during the build process, compromising the build environment and potentially the deployed application.
    * **Impact: Significant (Control over build process):** Gaining control over entry points, plugins, or loaders allows attackers to manipulate the entire build process.
    * **Impact: Significant (File Inclusion, Code Execution):** Path traversal can lead to arbitrary file inclusion and code execution during the build.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Plugins or Loaders (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_plugins_or_loaders__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in custom or third-party esbuild plugins and loaders used by the application.
* **Breakdown:**
    * **Application uses custom or third-party esbuild plugins/loaders (HIGH-RISK PATH):**  Using plugins and loaders extends esbuild's functionality but also increases the attack surface.
    * **Plugin/Loader contains vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Plugins and loaders, especially less scrutinized ones, might contain security vulnerabilities like code execution flaws, path traversal, or other issues.
    * **Plugin/Loader has code execution flaws, path traversal, or other security issues:** Vulnerabilities in plugins/loaders can be triggered during the build process when esbuild executes the plugin/loader code.
* **Critical Nodes:**
    * **Impact: Significant (Plugin/Loader Code Execution):** Vulnerabilities in plugins/loaders can lead to code execution within the build process, potentially compromising the build environment and the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Configuration Weaknesses (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_configuration_weaknesses__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations in the build process or esbuild setup to gain access to sensitive information or compromise the build environment.
* **Breakdown:**
    * **Insecure Build Process Configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        * **Build process exposes sensitive information or allows unauthorized access (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Misconfigurations can lead to sensitive information being exposed in build logs, artifacts, or through insecure access controls to the build environment.
        * **Build artifacts (e.g., `.map` files, unminified bundles) are publicly accessible (HIGH-RISK PATH):**  Publicly accessible build artifacts like `.map` files can reveal source code, making reverse engineering and finding vulnerabilities easier for attackers.
        * **Build scripts or configuration files contain secrets (API keys, credentials) (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Hardcoding secrets in build scripts or configuration files is a common mistake that can lead to credential theft if these files are exposed or accessed by attackers.
* **Critical Nodes:**
    * **Impact: Significant to Critical (Credential Theft):** Exposing secrets like API keys or credentials can have critical impact, allowing attackers to access sensitive resources or systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Output Manipulation (Less Directly esbuild, but related to build output) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_output_manipulation__less_directly_esbuild__but_related_to_build_output___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the build output *after* esbuild has completed its work but before deployment, aiming to tamper with the final application artifacts.
* **Breakdown:**
    * **Tampering with Build Artifacts Post-esbuild (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        * **Attacker gains access to build output directory after esbuild completes (HIGH-RISK PATH):** If the build output directory is not properly secured, attackers can gain unauthorized access.
        * **Modify bundled JavaScript files to inject malicious code (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Once access is gained, attackers can directly modify the bundled JavaScript files to inject malicious code into the application.
        * **Replace legitimate assets with malicious ones before deployment (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers can replace legitimate assets (like images, scripts, or other files) in the build output directory with malicious versions before the application is deployed.
* **Critical Nodes:**
    * **Impact: Critical (Post-Build Compromise):** Gaining access to the build output directory and tampering with artifacts can lead to complete compromise of the deployed application.
    * **Impact: Critical (Malicious Code Injection in Output):** Injecting malicious code directly into the bundled JavaScript files results in direct execution of attacker-controlled code in the application.
    * **Impact: Critical (Asset Replacement):** Replacing legitimate assets with malicious ones can lead to various attacks, including serving malicious content to users.
