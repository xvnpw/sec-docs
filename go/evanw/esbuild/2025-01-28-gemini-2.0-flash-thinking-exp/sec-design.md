**Data Flow Description (Enhanced):**

1. **Input & Configuration (A, L) to CLI/API (B):** User provides input files, entry points, and configuration via CLI arguments, API calls, or configuration files.
2. **Configuration Loading (B to C):** CLI/API loads and parses configuration files (`esbuild.config.js`, `package.json`). Configuration parameters are validated.
3. **Configuration Influence (C to D, E, G, H, I, K):** Configuration settings influence all stages of the bundling process: parsing, resolving, bundling, optimization, code generation, and plugin behavior.
4. **Parsing (B, C to D):** CLI/API initiates parsing of entry point files using the Parser component. Configuration settings (e.g., target environment, language features) affect parsing behavior.
5. **Resolving (D, C to E):** Parser identifies import statements, triggering the Resolver. Configuration (e.g., module paths, aliases) guides module resolution.
6. **File System Access (E to F and back to D):** Resolver uses File System Access to locate module files. Resolved files are then parsed (loop back to Parser). This recursive process continues until all dependencies are resolved and parsed.
7. **Bundling (D, C to G):** Parsed modules (ASTs) are passed to the Bundler. Configuration (e.g., code splitting settings, bundle formats) dictates bundling strategy.
8. **Optimization (G, C to H):** Bundler output is passed to the Optimizer. Configuration (e.g., minification level, optimization flags) controls optimization techniques.
9. **Code Generation (H, C to I):** Optimized AST is passed to the Code Generator. Configuration (e.g., output format, sourcemap options) determines code generation.
10. **Output Writing (I, B to J):** Code Generator produces output files. CLI/API handles writing these files to the file system via File System Access.
11. **Plugin System Interaction (B, C, K to D, E, G, H, I, F):** Plugins, configured via CLI/API and configuration, can intercept and modify data flow at various stages. Plugins can influence parsing, resolving, bundling, optimization, code generation, and even file system access.

* **External Tool Integration:** Go's `os/exec` package for executing external commands (used sparingly and with security considerations).

## 6. Deployment Model (Clarified)

`esbuild` deployment remains primarily client-side, but with nuances:

* **Standalone Executable (Cross-Platform):**  Compiled Go binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux.  Users download and execute directly.  Self-contained, requiring no external dependencies beyond the OS.
* **npm Package (Node.js Integration):**  Distributed via npm, enabling integration into Node.js projects and build tools (e.g., npm scripts, yarn scripts, build systems like Webpack, Rollup, Parcel).  Leverages Node.js environment for execution.
* **Programmatic API (Library):**  Usable as a library within other JavaScript/Node.js tools and applications.  Imported and used programmatically.
* **CI/CD Environments:**  Deployed and executed in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) to automate build processes.  Can be used as a standalone executable or via npm package within CI environments.

`esbuild` is not designed as a server-side service. It's a build-time tool executed on the developer's machine or in build environments.

## 7. Security Considerations (Expanded and Categorized)

This section provides a more detailed and categorized analysis of security considerations for threat modeling.

**7.1. Input Validation & Configuration Security:**

* **Threat:** Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE), Configuration Injection, Denial of Service (DoS).
