# Attack Surface Analysis for evanw/esbuild

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Injection via Input Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_injection_via_input_files.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in `esbuild`'s parsers (JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, etc.) could allow attackers to inject malicious code by crafting specially crafted input files.
*   **esbuild Contribution:** `esbuild`'s core functionality relies on parsing and processing various file types. Bugs in these parsers directly create this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript file that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in `esbuild`'s JavaScript parser. When `esbuild` processes this file during the build, it executes arbitrary code on the build server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Code execution on the build server.
    *   Data exfiltration from the build environment.
    *   Compromise of the build pipeline and potentially deployed application.
    *   Denial of Service of the build process.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep esbuild Updated:** Regularly update `esbuild` to the latest version to benefit from parser bug fixes and security patches.
    *   **Input Sanitization (if applicable):** If any part of the build process involves processing user-provided content that ends up as input to `esbuild`, sanitize or validate this input.
    *   **Secure Build Environment:** Isolate the build environment to limit the impact of potential code execution. Use containerization and least privilege principles.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Input Paths](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_input_paths.md)

*   **Description:** Improper handling of file paths by `esbuild` or its plugins could allow attackers to access files outside the intended project directory during the build process using path traversal techniques.
*   **esbuild Contribution:** `esbuild` works with file paths to locate input files, dependencies, and output directories. Incorrect path handling in `esbuild` or plugins can lead to this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A plugin used with `esbuild` incorrectly handles a user-provided configuration option that includes a file path. An attacker manipulates this configuration to include a path like `../../sensitive/config.json`, causing the plugin (and potentially `esbuild`) to read and expose this sensitive file during the build.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure of sensitive files on the build server.
    *   Potential for further exploitation if exposed files contain credentials or configuration details.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (can escalate to high depending on the sensitivity of accessible files).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Carefully Review Plugin Code and Configurations:**  Thoroughly examine the code and configurations of any `esbuild` plugins, especially those that handle file paths.
    *   **Restrict File System Access:** Configure `esbuild` and plugins to operate within a restricted file system scope. Use configuration options or operating system-level permissions to limit access.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization for Paths (in Plugins):** If developing plugins, rigorously validate and sanitize any file paths received as input to prevent traversal attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Using third-party `esbuild` plugins introduces the risk of supply chain attacks or vulnerabilities within the plugin code itself.
*   **esbuild Contribution:** `esbuild`'s plugin architecture encourages extending its functionality with external code, inherently creating a dependency on plugin security.
*   **Example:** A popular but compromised `esbuild` plugin is used in a project. This plugin contains malicious code that exfiltrates environment variables from the build server to an attacker-controlled server during the build process.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Supply chain compromise leading to code execution on the build server.
    *   Data exfiltration.
    *   Compromise of the build pipeline.
    *   Vulnerabilities introduced into the built application if the plugin affects the output code.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (can escalate to high depending on plugin permissions and impact).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Plugin Vetting and Auditing:** Carefully vet and audit all third-party plugins before use. Check plugin reputation, maintainer activity, and code quality.
    *   **Dependency Scanning for Plugins:** Use dependency scanning tools to check plugins and their dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Plugins:**  Configure plugins with the minimum necessary permissions and access. Avoid plugins that request excessive permissions.
    *   **Consider Plugin Alternatives or Custom Implementations:**  Evaluate if plugin functionality can be achieved through built-in `esbuild` features or by developing a custom, in-house plugin with stricter security controls.
