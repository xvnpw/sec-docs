# Project Design Document: esbuild

## BUSINESS POSTURE

esbuild is a JavaScript bundler and minifier. It's designed to be extremely fast. The primary business goals and priorities for esbuild are:

*   Goal: Significantly reduce build times for JavaScript/TypeScript projects.
*   Goal: Provide a simpler, easier-to-configure alternative to existing bundlers (Webpack, Parcel, Rollup).
*   Goal: Minimize dependencies to reduce installation size and complexity.
*   Goal: Offer a command-line interface and a JavaScript API for flexible integration.
*   Priority: Performance is the absolute top priority.
*   Priority: Correctness (accurate bundling) is crucial.
*   Priority: Maintainability and ease of contribution are important for long-term sustainability.

Based on these, the most important business risks are:

*   Risk: Performance regressions could undermine the core value proposition.
*   Risk: Bundling errors (incorrect output) could break production applications.
*   Risk: Security vulnerabilities in esbuild or its dependencies could expose users to supply chain attacks.
*   Risk: Lack of essential features (compared to competitors) could limit adoption.
*   Risk: Difficulty of use or configuration could deter potential users.

## SECURITY POSTURE

*   security control: The project uses Go, which offers some memory safety advantages over C/C++. (Inherent to the language choice).
*   security control: The project appears to have a relatively small number of external dependencies, reducing the attack surface. (Observed from the repository).
*   security control: The project uses automated tests. (Observed from the repository).
*   security control: The project uses linters. (Observed from the repository).
*   accepted risk: The project does not appear to have formal security audits or penetration testing. This is acceptable given the project's nature (a build tool, not a network-facing service) and likely resource constraints, but should be revisited periodically.
*   accepted risk: The project does not currently implement any specific supply chain security measures (e.g., SLSA, SBOM generation). This is a moderate risk, given the increasing prevalence of supply chain attacks.

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

*   security control: Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation during the build process.
*   security control: Integrate a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool into the CI/CD pipeline to scan for vulnerabilities in the Go code.
*   security control: Consider using a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., Dependabot or Snyk) to identify and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   security control: Implement code signing for released binaries to ensure authenticity and integrity.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable, as esbuild is a command-line tool.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable, as esbuild operates on local files based on the user's existing file system permissions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   esbuild must correctly handle various forms of JavaScript and TypeScript syntax, including potentially malicious or malformed code.  This is crucial to prevent code injection vulnerabilities.
    *   File paths provided to esbuild should be validated to prevent directory traversal attacks.
    *   Configuration files (if used) should be parsed securely to prevent injection of malicious options.
*   Cryptography:
    *   If esbuild implements any features involving cryptography (e.g., content hashing), it must use strong, well-vetted cryptographic libraries and algorithms.
    *   Any downloaded dependencies or plugins should be verified using checksums or digital signatures.

### DEPLOYMENT

esbuild is distributed as a pre-compiled executable for various platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).  It can also be installed via npm.  Therefore, there are several deployment scenarios:

1.  **Direct Download:** Users download the pre-compiled executable from the official website or GitHub releases.
2.  **npm Installation:** Users install esbuild as a global or local npm package.
3.  **Build from Source:** Users clone the repository and build esbuild themselves.

We'll describe the *Direct Download* scenario in detail, as it's the most common and security-relevant.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Rapid and reliable JavaScript/TypeScript bundling.
    *   Providing a fast and efficient build tool for web development.

*   Data to Protect:
    *   Source code of esbuild itself (low sensitivity, but important for integrity).
    *   User's source code (variable sensitivity, depending on the user's project).  esbuild processes this code but does not store it persistently.
    *   Dependencies (low sensitivity, but important for supply chain security).

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   Questions:
    *   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., for specific industries) that esbuild needs to consider?
    *   What is the expected scale of esbuild usage (number of users, projects, etc.)? This can influence the priority of certain security measures.
    *   What is the process for handling security vulnerability reports?
    *   Are there plans to add features that might introduce new security considerations (e.g., remote code execution, plugin systems)?
    *   Does esbuild collect any telemetry or usage data?

*   Assumptions:
    *   Business Posture: We assume a relatively small team with limited resources, prioritizing speed and simplicity.
    *   Security Posture: We assume a "best effort" approach to security, with a focus on preventing major vulnerabilities rather than achieving formal security certifications.
    *   Design: We assume that esbuild will remain primarily a command-line tool, with the JavaScript API serving as a secondary interface. We assume no network-facing components.
    *   Users have basic security hygiene on their development machines (e.g., running antivirus software).
    *   Users are responsible for the security of their own source code and dependencies.
    *   The primary threat model is supply chain attacks and vulnerabilities within esbuild itself that could lead to code execution or information disclosure.
    *   esbuild does not handle sensitive data directly (e.g., passwords, API keys) *except* potentially as part of the user's source code, which it processes but does not store.
