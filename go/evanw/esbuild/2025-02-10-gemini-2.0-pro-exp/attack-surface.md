# Attack Surface Analysis for evanw/esbuild

## Attack Surface: [Insecure `define` Replacements](./attack_surfaces/insecure__define__replacements.md)

*   **Description:**  Substitution of global identifiers with constant expressions, potentially exposing sensitive data.
*   **esbuild Contribution:** `esbuild`'s `define` feature provides the mechanism for this substitution. This is a *direct* feature of `esbuild`.
*   **Example:**
    ```javascript
    // esbuild config
    {
      define: {
        'process.env.SECRET_API_KEY': '"YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"' // INSECURE!
      }
    }
    ```
    This embeds the API key directly into the bundled JavaScript.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure (API keys, secrets, internal feature flags), Potential Privilege Escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** hardcode secrets in `define`.
    *   Use environment variables loaded securely at *runtime*.  `define` should only reference the variable name, *not* its value:  `define: { 'process.env.API_KEY': 'process.env.API_KEY' }`.
    *   Employ a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
    *   Implement code reviews and automated static analysis to detect hardcoded secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_plugins.md)

*   **Description:**  Third-party `esbuild` plugins that contain malicious code or known vulnerabilities.
*   **esbuild Contribution:** `esbuild`'s plugin API allows for extensibility, but also introduces a vector for untrusted code. This is a *direct* feature of `esbuild`.
*   **Example:**  A plugin claiming to optimize images but actually exfiltrates build artifacts or injects a backdoor.  Or, a legitimate plugin with a known vulnerability in one of its dependencies.
*   **Impact:** Code Injection, Supply Chain Attack, Data Exfiltration, Denial of Service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use only plugins from trusted, reputable sources.
    *   Thoroughly vet plugin source code before use.
    *   Pin plugin versions to specific, audited releases.
    *   Regularly update plugins and their dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
    *   Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify vulnerable dependencies.
    *   Implement a strict plugin approval process.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured `external` Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured__external__dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrectly marking modules as `external`, leading to runtime loading from potentially untrusted sources.
*   **esbuild Contribution:** The `external` option in `esbuild`'s configuration controls which modules are bundled. This is a *direct* feature of `esbuild`.
*   **Example:**
    ```javascript
    // esbuild config
    {
      external: ['my-internal-security-module'] // Incorrect!
    }
    ```
    If `my-internal-security-module` is *not* a truly external dependency (e.g., a Node.js built-in), it might be loaded from an attacker-controlled location at runtime.
*   **Impact:** Code Injection, Supply Chain Attack.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review and validate the `external` configuration.  Ensure only *truly* external dependencies are listed.
    *   Use a lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) for consistent dependency resolution.
    *   If loading external modules at runtime, use a CDN with Subresource Integrity (SRI) where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Loader Misconfiguration or Vulnerable Custom Loaders](./attack_surfaces/loader_misconfiguration_or_vulnerable_custom_loaders.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured loaders or the use of custom loaders with security flaws.
*   **esbuild Contribution:** esbuild's loader system determines how different file types are processed. This is a direct feature of esbuild.
*   **Example:** A custom loader designed to handle a specific file format but contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code when processing a maliciously crafted file. Or, misconfiguring the `text` loader to execute arbitrary code embedded within a text file.
*   **Impact:** Code Injection, Data Exfiltration, Denial of Service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and validate loader configurations.
    *   Avoid using custom loaders from untrusted sources.
    *   If using custom loaders, rigorously audit their code for security vulnerabilities.
    *   Ensure loaders are correctly configured for the intended file types.
    *   Regularly update loaders to their latest versions.
