# Threat Model Analysis for evanw/esbuild

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Execution](./threats/malicious_plugin_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Execution

    *   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious esbuild plugin to a public registry (e.g., npm) or compromises a legitimate plugin.  When a developer installs and uses this plugin, the attacker's code executes *within the esbuild build process*. The attacker's code could inject malicious JavaScript or CSS into the bundled output, steal environment variables, modify build settings, or exfiltrate source code *during the build*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of the application built with esbuild (e.g., XSS, data theft, defacement).
        *   Exposure of sensitive information (API keys, credentials) from the build environment.
        *   Modification of the build process, leading to further vulnerabilities.
        *   Potential lateral movement within the build infrastructure *if the build process has elevated privileges*.
    *   **Affected Component:** esbuild plugin API (`onResolve`, `onLoad`, `onStart`, `onEnd` hooks), plugin loading mechanism.  This is *directly* within esbuild's control.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Plugin Vetting:** Thoroughly review the source code (if available) of all plugins before installation.  Check the author's reputation, download statistics, and any reported security issues.
        *   **Dependency Pinning:** Use `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` to lock down plugin versions to known-good releases.
        *   **Private Registry/Proxy:** Use a private npm registry or proxy to control the source and versions of plugins.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically audit all dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **SCA Tools:** Employ Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to automatically identify vulnerable dependencies.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the build process (and therefore esbuild and its plugins) with the least necessary privileges.
        *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):** Explore sandboxing techniques to isolate plugin execution (e.g., using WebAssembly or other sandboxing technologies). This is a more complex but potentially very effective mitigation.

## Threat: [Compromised Upstream Dependency](./threats/compromised_upstream_dependency.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Upstream Dependency

    *   **Description:** A legitimate dependency *of* esbuild itself, or a dependency of an esbuild plugin, is compromised at the source.  This is a supply chain attack. The attacker modifies the dependency to include malicious code, which is then pulled in *during the esbuild build process*. This is distinct from a general build environment compromise because the vulnerability is within a package that esbuild *directly* uses or that a plugin *directly* uses.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to "Malicious Plugin Execution," but the attack vector is through a transitive dependency.  This can be harder to detect. The malicious code executes *as part of* esbuild's or its plugin's operation.
    *   **Affected Component:** esbuild's dependency resolution mechanism, any part of esbuild or its plugins that relies on the compromised dependency. This is a direct consequence of how esbuild and its plugins are built and packaged.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Same mitigations as "Malicious Plugin Execution."
        *   **Dependency Monitoring:** Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to esbuild and *all* of its transitive dependencies.
        *   **Dependency Freezing (Advanced):** Consider using techniques like `npm shrinkwrap` (though it has limitations) or other methods to create a completely locked-down dependency tree.  This is a trade-off between security and maintainability.

## Threat: [esbuild Configuration Tampering](./threats/esbuild_configuration_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** esbuild Configuration Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the build environment and modifies the esbuild configuration (e.g., `esbuild.config.js`, command-line flags). The attacker could disable source maps, disable minification, change output paths to include malicious files, or inject arbitrary code via configuration options (e.g., using the `define` option to inject malicious JavaScript) *directly into the build process controlled by esbuild*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Introduction of vulnerabilities into the built application.
        *   Exposure of source code (if source maps are enabled and deployed).
        *   Reduced performance (if minification is disabled).
        *   Potential for code execution *within the context of the esbuild process*.
    *   **Affected Component:** esbuild configuration file parsing, command-line argument parsing, build process execution. These are all *core* esbuild components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Configuration Storage:** Store esbuild configuration files in a secure, version-controlled repository (e.g., Git).
        *   **Access Control:** Implement strict access controls on the build environment and configuration files.
        *   **Configuration Auditing:** Regularly audit build configurations for unauthorized changes.
        *   **Configuration Management:** Use a configuration management system (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to enforce desired configurations and detect drift.
        *   **Code Signing:** Sign build artifacts to ensure their integrity and detect tampering. This helps detect if the *output* of esbuild has been altered after the build.

## Threat: [Tampering with esbuild Binary](./threats/tampering_with_esbuild_binary.md)

* **Threat:** Tampering with esbuild Binary

    * **Description:** An attacker replaces the legitimate esbuild binary with a modified version that introduces malicious behavior. This could happen through a compromised download, a supply chain attack on the package manager, or direct access to the build environment. The key is that the *esbuild tool itself* is compromised.
    * **Impact:**
        * Complete compromise of the build process.
        * Injection of arbitrary malicious code into built applications.
        * Exfiltration of sensitive data.
    * **Affected Component:** The esbuild executable itself.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Trusted Sources:** Install esbuild only from trusted sources (e.g., the official npm registry).
        * **Checksum Verification:** If available, verify the integrity of the downloaded esbuild binary using checksums (e.g., SHA-256 sums) provided by the esbuild developers.
        * **Package Manager Integrity Checks:** Use a package manager that performs integrity checks (e.g., npm with `package-lock.json` or yarn with `yarn.lock`). These files contain hashes of the downloaded packages.
        * **Binary Signing (Ideal, but not common for esbuild):** Ideally, esbuild would be digitally signed, allowing verification of its authenticity. However, this is not a standard practice for Node.js packages.
        * **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Use a File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system to detect unauthorized changes to the esbuild binary.
