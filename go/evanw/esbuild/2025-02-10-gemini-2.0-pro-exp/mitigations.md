# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for evanw/esbuild

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Plugin Selection and Vetting](./mitigation_strategies/careful_plugin_selection_and_vetting.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Careful Plugin Selection and Vetting**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Plugin Approval Process:** Before adding any `esbuild` plugin, require a review process. This could involve a designated team member or a security review checklist.
    2.  **Source Code Review:** Download the plugin's source code (not just the installed package) from its repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
    3.  **Dependency Analysis:** Examine the plugin's `package.json` to identify its dependencies. Recursively review these dependencies, applying the same vetting process.
    4.  **Code Inspection:**
        *   Look for obfuscated code (minified code without source maps is a red flag).
        *   Identify any network requests (using `fetch`, `http`, `https` modules). Understand their purpose and destination.
        *   Check for file system access (using `fs` module). Ensure it's limited to the expected scope.
        *   Search for dynamic code evaluation (e.g., `eval`, `new Function`). These are highly dangerous.
        *   Look for any interaction with the environment (e.g., accessing environment variables).
    5.  **Reputation Check:** Search for information about the plugin author and any reported issues or vulnerabilities.
    6.  **Documentation Review:** Read the plugin's documentation carefully. Look for clear explanations of its functionality and security considerations.
    7.  **Small Scope Preference:** Favor plugins with a limited, well-defined purpose. Avoid "kitchen sink" plugins that do too much.
    8.  **Regular Audits:** Periodically repeat this process for existing plugins, especially after updates.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection (Severity: Critical):** Prevents plugins from injecting arbitrary code into the build output, which could lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the server or in users' browsers.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of plugins stealing sensitive data (e.g., API keys, environment variables) during the build process.
    *   **Build System Compromise (Severity: High):** Limits the ability of a malicious plugin to compromise the build server itself (e.g., installing backdoors, modifying system files).
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Severity: Critical):** Mitigates the risk of compromised dependencies within the plugin introducing vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Build System Compromise:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Moderately reduces the risk (further mitigated by dependency pinning).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** We have a basic checklist for new plugins, but it's not consistently enforced. Code reviews are *sometimes* performed, but not always thoroughly.  The checklist is in the `docs/security/build_process.md` file.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Formal Approval Process:** No formal approval process or designated security reviewer for plugins.
    *   **Recursive Dependency Analysis:** We don't consistently analyze the dependencies of plugins.
    *   **Regular Audits:** No scheduled audits of existing plugins.
    *   **Automated Checks:** No automated tools are used to assist with code analysis.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Sanitization of `define` and `inject`](./mitigation_strategies/strict_sanitization_of__define__and__inject_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Strict Sanitization of `define` and `inject`**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid User Input:** The primary strategy is to *avoid* using user-supplied data directly in `esbuild`'s `define` or `inject` options.
    2.  **Trusted Sources:** Use environment variables, configuration files, or build-time constants instead.
    3.  **Whitelist Approach:** If user input is *absolutely necessary*, use a strict whitelist. Define a set of allowed values and reject anything that doesn't match.
    4.  **Input Validation:** Validate the input against the whitelist *before* passing it to `esbuild`.
    5.  **Type Checking:** Ensure the input is of the expected data type (e.g., string, number, boolean).
    6.  **Context-Specific Sanitization:** If the input is used in a specific context (e.g., as a JavaScript identifier), apply appropriate sanitization for that context.  However, this is complex and error-prone; avoid it if possible.
    7.  **Avoid `eval` and `new Function`:** Never use `eval` or `new Function` to process user input, even indirectly through `define` or `inject`.
    8.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the sanitization and validation logic with various inputs, including edge cases and potential attack vectors.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Code Injection (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary JavaScript code through user-supplied values passed to `esbuild`'s `define` or `inject`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Injection:** Significantly reduces the risk if implemented correctly.  However, incorrect sanitization can still lead to vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** We primarily use environment variables for `define`, but there's one instance where a build script takes a version string from a Git tag. This is validated to be a semantic version string, but it's not a strict whitelist.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Whitelist for Version String:** The version string input should be checked against a whitelist of allowed characters (e.g., digits, periods, and hyphens) and a maximum length.
    *   **Formal Review of `define` Usage:** A comprehensive review of all `define` and `inject` usage is needed to ensure no other potential vulnerabilities exist.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable or Restrict Source Maps in Production](./mitigation_strategies/disable_or_restrict_source_maps_in_production.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Disable or Restrict Source Maps in Production**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Source Maps:** For production builds, use the `--sourcemap=false` flag or set `sourcemap: false` in your `esbuild` configuration.
    2.  **External Source Maps (If Needed):** If source maps are required for debugging, use `--sourcemap=external`.  This creates separate `.map` files.  *Crucially, this is still an `esbuild`-specific configuration.*
    3. **Linked Source Maps (If Needed):** If you need to link map files, use `--sourcemap=linked`.
    4.  **Inline Source Maps (Avoid):** Avoid using `--sourcemap=inline` in production, as this embeds the source map directly in the JavaScript file.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Source Code Exposure (Severity: Medium to High):** Prevents attackers from accessing your original source code, which could reveal sensitive information, intellectual property, or potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Source Code Exposure:** Eliminates the risk if source maps are disabled. Significantly reduces the risk if external source maps are used (combined with server-side restrictions, which are *not* `esbuild`-specific).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Fully Implemented:** We disable source maps in production builds (`--sourcemap=false`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dedicated Output Directory](./mitigation_strategies/dedicated_output_directory.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Dedicated Output Directory**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dedicated `outdir`:** Configure `esbuild` using the `outdir` option to output to a dedicated directory (e.g., `dist`, `build`, `public`).  Alternatively, use `outfile` for single-file outputs.
    2.  **Separate from Source:** This directory should be *completely separate* from your source code directory.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Sensitive File Exposure (Severity: High):**  By using a dedicated output directory *specified within the `esbuild` configuration*, you reduce the risk of accidentally including sensitive files in the build output that might then be deployed.  This is a direct consequence of how `esbuild` is configured.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sensitive File Exposure:** Significantly reduces the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Fully Implemented:** We use a dedicated `dist` directory for output, configured via the `outdir` option in our `esbuild` configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None.
