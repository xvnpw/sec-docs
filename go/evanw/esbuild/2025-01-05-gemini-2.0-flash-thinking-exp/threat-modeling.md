# Threat Model Analysis for evanw/esbuild

## Threat: [Configuration File Tampering Leading to Malicious Code Injection](./threats/configuration_file_tampering_leading_to_malicious_code_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to the build environment could modify the `esbuild` configuration file (e.g., `esbuild.config.js`). They could alter build settings to inject malicious code during the bundling process, potentially through custom plugins or by manipulating entry points and output paths, directly leveraging `esbuild`'s configuration mechanisms.

**Impact:** Deployment of compromised application with backdoors, malware, or code that exfiltrates sensitive data.

**Affected esbuild Component:** Configuration Loading Module, Plugin System, Entry Point Resolution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure access to the build environment and configuration files with strong authentication and authorization.
*   Implement version control for configuration files and track changes.
*   Use file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications.
*   Consider storing sensitive configuration separately and securely.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Malicious Input Files Processed by esbuild](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_malicious_input_files_processed_by_esbuild.md)

**Description:** An attacker could provide maliciously crafted input files (JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, etc.) that exploit vulnerabilities within `esbuild`'s parsing or transformation logic. This might involve specially crafted syntax, excessively large files, or files designed to trigger bugs in `esbuild`'s internal processing, directly targeting `esbuild`'s core functionality.

**Impact:** Denial of service during the build process, potential for remote code execution on the build server if `esbuild` has exploitable vulnerabilities in its handling of specific file structures.

**Affected esbuild Component:** Parser Modules (JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS), Transformer Modules.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize or validate external inputs to the build process where feasible.
*   Keep `esbuild` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
*   Monitor `esbuild` issue trackers and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
*   Implement resource limits for the build process to mitigate denial-of-service attacks.

## Threat: [Unintended or Vulnerable Code Generation/Transformation by esbuild Bugs](./threats/unintended_or_vulnerable_code_generationtransformation_by_esbuild_bugs.md)

**Description:** Bugs or unexpected behavior within `esbuild`'s code generation or transformation logic could inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities into the final bundled application. This could involve incorrect code optimizations, flawed code injection for features like hot reloading, or improper handling of edge cases leading to exploitable patterns in the output, stemming directly from flaws in `esbuild`'s code.

**Impact:** Introduction of various types of vulnerabilities in the final application, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), injection flaws, or logic errors.

**Affected esbuild Component:** Code Generation Modules, Transformer Modules, Optimizer Modules.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly test the built application for security vulnerabilities using static and dynamic analysis tools.
*   Monitor `esbuild` issue trackers for reported bugs and security vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using a stable, well-tested version of `esbuild`.
*   Report any suspected bugs or unexpected behavior to the `esbuild` maintainers.

## Threat: [Compromised esbuild Distribution Package](./threats/compromised_esbuild_distribution_package.md)

**Description:** The `esbuild` package itself on the distribution platform (e.g., npm) could be compromised. A malicious actor could inject backdoors or malware into the package, which would then be used by developers during their build process, directly affecting the `esbuild` library being used.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code during the build process, potentially compromising the entire application and build environment.

**Affected esbuild Component:** Entire `esbuild` codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or package signing if available.
*   Use reputable package managers and consider using a private registry for internal dependencies.
*   Monitor for unexpected changes in `esbuild` package releases.
