# Attack Surface Analysis for evanw/esbuild

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code in Input Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_in_input_files.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Code in Input Files
    *   **Description:** The application bundles and executes code from various source files and dependencies. If any of these contain malicious logic, it will be included in the final application.
    *   **How esbuild Contributes:** `esbuild`'s core function is to aggregate these files into a single bundle. It doesn't inherently scan for or prevent the inclusion of malicious code.
    *   **Example:** A developer unknowingly includes a compromised npm package that contains code to exfiltrate user data once the application is deployed. `esbuild` bundles this malicious code along with the legitimate application code.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, data breaches, unauthorized access, malware distribution to users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet all third-party dependencies before inclusion.
        *   Utilize software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Implement code review processes for all source code.
        *   Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Use sandboxing or containerization to limit the impact of compromised code.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Import/Require Statements](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_importrequire_statements.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal via Import/Require Statements
    *   **Description:** An attacker could potentially manipulate module resolution paths to access files outside the intended project directory during the build process.
    *   **How esbuild Contributes:** `esbuild` resolves `import` and `require` statements based on configured module resolution rules. If these rules or the input paths are not carefully controlled, it could be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A malicious dependency includes a postinstall script that uses `esbuild` with a dynamically constructed import path based on an environment variable controlled by an attacker, allowing it to read arbitrary files from the build server.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files on the build server, potential for code injection during the build process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamic construction of import paths in build scripts.
        *   Use relative paths where possible for local modules.
        *   Restrict file system access for the build process.
        *   Monitor build logs for suspicious file access attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Injection via Build Scripts](./attack_surfaces/configuration_injection_via_build_scripts.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Configuration Injection via Build Scripts
    *   **Description:** If the `esbuild` command or configuration is built dynamically based on untrusted input, an attacker could inject malicious flags or file paths.
    *   **How esbuild Contributes:** `esbuild`'s command-line interface and configuration options allow for various settings. If these are constructed without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A build script takes a user-provided output directory name without validation and uses it directly in the `esbuild` command, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary output path, potentially overwriting sensitive files.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary file write/overwrite, code injection during the build process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamic construction of `esbuild` commands based on user input.
        *   Sanitize and validate all external input used in build scripts.
        *   Use configuration files or environment variables for `esbuild` settings instead of direct user input.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Plugin Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** `esbuild` supports a plugin system. Malicious or poorly written plugins can introduce arbitrary code execution during the build process or compromise the integrity of the bundled output.
    *   **How esbuild Contributes:** `esbuild` executes plugin code during the build process, granting them access to the file system and build context.
    *   **Example:** A developer installs a seemingly useful `esbuild` plugin that secretly injects malicious code into the bundled output or exfiltrates environment variables during the build.
    *   **Impact:** Code injection, data exfiltration, build server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit all `esbuild` plugins before using them.
        *   Only install plugins from trusted sources.
        *   Monitor plugin activity and resource usage during the build process.
