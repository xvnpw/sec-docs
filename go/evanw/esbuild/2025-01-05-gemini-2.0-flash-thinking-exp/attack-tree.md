# Attack Tree Analysis for evanw/esbuild

Objective: Execute Arbitrary Code within the Application's Context by Exploiting esbuild Weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* Compromise Application via esbuild Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]
    * OR - Exploit Vulnerabilities in esbuild's Core Functionality
        * OR - Malicious Input Processing
            * AND - Code Injection via Malicious Input Files [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]
                * Step 1: Craft a JavaScript, CSS, or other supported file that, when processed by esbuild, introduces malicious code into the final bundle. This could exploit parsing vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.
                * Step 2: The injected code executes within the application's context when the bundle is loaded.
    * OR - Vulnerabilities in Dependency Handling [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]
        * AND - Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in esbuild's Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH]
            * Step 1: Identify a known vulnerability in a direct or transitive dependency of esbuild.
            * Step 2: Trigger the vulnerable code path through specific input or configuration, potentially leading to code execution or other security breaches during the build process.
    * OR - Exploit Vulnerabilities in esbuild's Plugin System [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]
        * AND - Installing a Malicious Plugin [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]
            * Step 1: Convince a developer to install a malicious esbuild plugin (e.g., through social engineering, typosquatting in plugin repositories).
            * Step 2: The malicious plugin executes arbitrary code during the build process, potentially compromising the application or the build environment.
        * AND - Exploiting Vulnerabilities within a Legitimate Plugin [HIGH RISK PATH]
            * Step 1: Identify a vulnerability in a commonly used esbuild plugin (e.g., insecure file handling, command injection).
            * Step 2: Craft input or configure the build process to trigger the vulnerability in the plugin, leading to code execution or other malicious outcomes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection via Malicious Input Files [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_via_malicious_input_files__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in esbuild's parsing logic for JavaScript, CSS, or other supported file types.
* **Step 1:** Craft a JavaScript, CSS, or other supported file that, when processed by esbuild, introduces malicious code into the final bundle. This could involve:
    * Exploiting bugs in the parser that allow for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript.
    * Crafting input that leads to unexpected code generation or manipulation by esbuild.
    * Utilizing features of the supported languages in unintended ways that result in malicious code execution.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    * **Impact:** Critical
    * **Effort:** Moderate to High
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult
* **Step 2:** The injected code executes within the application's context when the bundle is loaded. This means the malicious code will run with the same privileges and access as the application itself.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    * **Impact:** Critical
    * **Effort:** Trivial
    * **Skill Level:** Novice
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in esbuild's Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_esbuild's_dependencies__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Leveraging publicly known security flaws in libraries that esbuild depends on (directly or indirectly).
* **Step 1:** Identify a known vulnerability in a direct or transitive dependency of esbuild. This involves:
    * Monitoring security advisories for esbuild's dependencies.
    * Using vulnerability scanning tools on the project's dependencies.
    * Exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities (more advanced and less likely).
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (Can range from minor to critical)
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate
* **Step 2:** Trigger the vulnerable code path through specific input or configuration, potentially leading to code execution or other security breaches during the build process. This might involve:
    * Providing specific input files or command-line arguments that trigger the vulnerable code.
    * Configuring esbuild in a way that utilizes the vulnerable dependency function.
    * Relying on the vulnerable dependency being used in a default or common configuration.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Varies
    * **Effort:** Low to Moderate
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Installing a Malicious Plugin [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/installing_a_malicious_plugin__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Tricking developers into installing a deliberately malicious esbuild plugin.
* **Step 1:** Convince a developer to install a malicious esbuild plugin (e.g., through social engineering, typosquatting in plugin repositories). This can be achieved by:
    * Creating a plugin with a similar name to a popular or expected plugin (typosquatting).
    * Social engineering developers into installing a plugin from an untrusted source.
    * Compromising a legitimate plugin author's account and pushing a malicious update.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    * **Impact:** Critical
    * **Effort:** Low to Moderate
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate
* **Step 2:** The malicious plugin executes arbitrary code during the build process, potentially compromising the application or the build environment. Once installed, a malicious plugin has full access to the build process and can:
    * Inject malicious code into the final bundle.
    * Steal sensitive environment variables or credentials.
    * Modify build artifacts.
    * Compromise the build server itself.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    * **Impact:** Critical
    * **Effort:** Trivial
    * **Skill Level:** Novice
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities within a Legitimate Plugin [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerabilities_within_a_legitimate_plugin__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Taking advantage of security flaws in otherwise legitimate esbuild plugins.
* **Step 1:** Identify a vulnerability in a commonly used esbuild plugin (e.g., insecure file handling, command injection). This requires:
    * Reviewing the plugin's source code for potential vulnerabilities.
    * Monitoring security advisories for the plugin.
    * Discovering zero-day vulnerabilities in the plugin.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (Can range from moderate to critical)
    * **Effort:** Moderate to High
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult
* **Step 2:** Craft input or configure the build process to trigger the vulnerability in the plugin, leading to code execution or other malicious outcomes. This involves:
    * Providing specific input or configuration that exploits the identified vulnerability.
    * Understanding how the plugin processes input and how to manipulate it.
    * Potentially requiring knowledge of the plugin's internal workings.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    * **Impact:** Varies
    * **Effort:** Low to Moderate
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult
