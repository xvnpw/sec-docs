# Attack Surface Analysis for evanw/esbuild

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Dynamically Constructed esbuild Commands/Configuration](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_dynamically_constructed_esbuild_commandsconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** The application dynamically constructs `esbuild` command-line arguments or configuration options based on user input without proper sanitization.
    *   **How esbuild Contributes:** If the application uses user input to control how `esbuild` is invoked, it creates an opportunity for command injection directly through `esbuild`'s execution.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to specify custom output directories for the build. If this input is not sanitized and directly used in the `esbuild` command, an attacker could inject malicious commands like `"; rm -rf /"` into the output path.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Full compromise of the build server, potential data loss, and the ability to inject malicious code into the build output.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamically constructing `esbuild` commands or configuration based on user input whenever possible.
        *   If dynamic construction is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious commands.
        *   Use parameterized commands or configuration options where available.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for the user running the build process.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal in Input/Output Paths](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_in_inputoutput_paths.md)

*   **Description:** The application allows user-controlled input to define input or output paths for `esbuild`, potentially allowing access to files outside the intended project directory.
    *   **How esbuild Contributes:** `esbuild` directly uses the provided input and output paths to read and write files. If these paths are not properly validated before being passed to `esbuild`, attackers can manipulate them.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to specify the output directory. An attacker could provide a path like `../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to overwrite system files using `esbuild`'s file writing capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** High. Potential for reading sensitive files, overwriting critical files, or injecting malicious files into unexpected locations through `esbuild`'s file system interactions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid allowing user-controlled input to directly define input or output paths for `esbuild`.
        *   If user input is necessary, use allowlists of permitted directories or file extensions.
        *   Canonicalize paths to resolve symbolic links and relative paths before passing them to `esbuild`.
        *   Ensure the build process runs with the minimum necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Third-Party esbuild Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_third-party_esbuild_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses a third-party `esbuild` plugin that contains malicious code.
    *   **How esbuild Contributes:** `esbuild`'s plugin architecture allows third-party code to execute directly within the `esbuild` build process, granting it significant capabilities.
    *   **Example:** A seemingly helpful plugin for optimizing images during the build process actually contains code that exfiltrates environment variables or injects malicious scripts into the output bundle during the `esbuild` build.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Full compromise of the build environment, injection of malicious code into the application by the plugin during the `esbuild` process, exfiltration of secrets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet third-party plugins before using them. Check their source code, reputation, and maintainership.
        *   Prefer plugins from well-known and trusted sources.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools that can also analyze plugin dependencies for vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a process for reviewing and approving new plugins before they are added to the project.
        *   Consider developing custom plugins internally if the risk associated with third-party plugins is too high.

## Attack Surface: [Accidental Inclusion of Sensitive Files in Bundle](./attack_surfaces/accidental_inclusion_of_sensitive_files_in_bundle.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured `esbuild` settings or glob patterns lead to the inclusion of sensitive files (e.g., `.env` files, private keys) in the final bundle.
    *   **How esbuild Contributes:** `esbuild` directly controls which files are included in the output bundle based on its configuration. Misconfigurations in `esbuild`'s settings are the direct cause of this issue.
    *   **Example:** An `esbuild` configuration includes a broad glob pattern like `**/*` which inadvertently instructs `esbuild` to include `.env` files containing API keys in the final JavaScript bundle.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Exposure of sensitive credentials or private keys due to `esbuild` bundling them, potentially leading to immediate compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure `esbuild`'s entry points and include/exclude patterns.
        *   Use specific and restrictive glob patterns to avoid accidentally including sensitive files.
        *   Implement checks during the build process to verify that sensitive files are not included in the output bundle.
        *   Regularly review the contents of the generated bundles.
