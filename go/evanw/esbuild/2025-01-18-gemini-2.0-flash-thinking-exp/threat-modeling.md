# Threat Model Analysis for evanw/esbuild

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Input Files](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_input_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript or TypeScript code into the application's source files. `esbuild` would then bundle this malicious code into the final application. This directly involves `esbuild`'s core functionality of processing input files.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser, leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** Parser, Bundler

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust code review processes.
*   Secure developer environments and workstations.
*   Utilize static analysis tools to detect potential malicious code.
*   Implement strong access controls for source code repositories.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Parsing Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious JavaScript or TypeScript code that exploits a vulnerability in `esbuild`'s parsing logic. This directly involves a core component of `esbuild`.

**Impact:** Build process failure, potential compromise of the build environment.

**Affected Component:** Parser

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep `esbuild` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Monitor `esbuild`'s issue tracker and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Exposed Source Maps](./threats/information_disclosure_via_exposed_source_maps.md)

**Description:** If source maps are generated by `esbuild` and inadvertently deployed to production environments, attackers can access the original, unminified source code. This is a direct consequence of `esbuild`'s sourcemap generation feature.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive application logic and potential vulnerabilities, making it easier for attackers to understand and exploit the application.

**Affected Component:** Code Generator, Sourcemap Generator

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure source maps are only generated for development and debugging purposes.
*   Implement strict controls to prevent source maps from being deployed to production.
*   Configure web servers to block access to source map files in production.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Vulnerable Plugins](./threats/code_injection_via_vulnerable_plugins.md)

**Description:** If using `esbuild` plugins, vulnerabilities in those plugins could be exploited to inject malicious code into the generated bundles during the build process. This directly involves `esbuild`'s plugin system.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser, leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities. Potential compromise of the build environment.

**Affected Component:** Plugin System

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly vet and audit any `esbuild` plugins used.
*   Keep plugins updated to their latest versions.
*   Consider the security implications of using third-party plugins.
*   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of injected scripts.
