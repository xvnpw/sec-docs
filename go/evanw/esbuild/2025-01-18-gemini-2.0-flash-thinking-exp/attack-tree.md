## Attack Tree Path: [1. Malicious Code in Entry Points [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__malicious_code_in_entry_points__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code directly into one of the application's entry point files. When esbuild processes these files, the malicious code is included in the final bundled output.
* **Impact:** This allows for direct execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the application's context, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized actions, or complete application takeover.
* **Why High-Risk:** The likelihood is medium as it can occur through developer error, supply chain compromise of a dependency whose code is directly included, or even a sophisticated attacker gaining access to the codebase. The impact is critical due to the potential for immediate and severe compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploiting Loader Plugins [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploiting_loader_plugins__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This path involves exploiting esbuild's loader plugin functionality, which allows for custom processing of different file types.
* **Sub-Vectors:**
    * **Malicious Loader Plugin [CRITICAL NODE]:** An attacker introduces a custom or third-party loader plugin that is intentionally designed to inject malicious code or manipulate the build process in a harmful way.
        * **Impact:**  A malicious plugin can execute arbitrary code during the build, modify the output bundle, or exfiltrate sensitive information from the build environment. The impact is critical due to the potential for complete build process compromise.
    * **Vulnerability in Existing Loader Plugin [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability within a legitimate loader plugin used by the application. This vulnerability can be leveraged to inject malicious code or manipulate the build process.
        * **Impact:** Similar to a malicious plugin, a vulnerable plugin can be exploited to inject code, modify the output, or compromise the build environment. The impact is critical.
* **Why High-Risk:** The likelihood of using third-party plugins or the existence of vulnerabilities in them is medium. The impact of successful exploitation is critical, making this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Esbuild Process (Less Likely) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__remote_code_execution__rce__in_esbuild_process__less_likely___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits a hypothetical vulnerability within the esbuild's core Go codebase that allows for the execution of arbitrary code on the machine running the build process.
* **Impact:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete control over the build server, allowing them to modify the build output, access sensitive information, or use the server for further attacks. The impact is critical.
* **Why Critical:** While the likelihood is very low due to the nature of Go and the project's maturity, the potential impact of gaining RCE on the build server is critically severe.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Esbuild [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__supply_chain_attacks_targeting_esbuild__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on compromising the esbuild tool itself or its dependencies.
* **Sub-Vectors:**
    * **Compromised Esbuild Dependency [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** A dependency used by esbuild (written in Go) is compromised, and malicious code is included in the esbuild binary.
        * **Impact:** This results in a backdoored version of esbuild being used, potentially injecting malicious code into every application built with it. The impact is critical and widespread.
    * **Compromised Esbuild Installation Source [CRITICAL NODE]:** The official esbuild repository or distribution channels are compromised, and a backdoored version of esbuild is distributed to users.
        * **Impact:** Similar to a compromised dependency, this leads to widespread distribution of a malicious tool, affecting all new installations and potentially existing ones if updates are forced. The impact is critical and widespread.
* **Why High-Risk:** The likelihood of a dependency being compromised is low to medium, and the likelihood of official sources being compromised is very low. However, the potential impact of a successful supply chain attack is critically severe, affecting potentially numerous applications. This makes it a high-risk path that requires significant preventative measures.
