# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Ensure observability of infrastructure and applications.
  - Provide reliable monitoring and alerting to detect and resolve issues quickly.
  - Enable performance analysis and capacity planning.
  - Support root cause analysis and troubleshooting.
  - Facilitate proactive issue detection and prevention.
- Business Risks:
  - Data integrity and availability of monitoring data. If monitoring system is down or data is corrupted, it impacts ability to detect and resolve production issues.
  - Unauthorized access to monitoring data. Sensitive metrics might be exposed if access control is not properly implemented.
  - Performance impact of monitoring system on monitored applications. If monitoring system consumes too many resources, it can degrade performance of monitored applications.
  - Incorrect or delayed alerts. False positives can cause alert fatigue, false negatives can lead to undetected issues.
  - Security vulnerabilities in monitoring system itself can be exploited to gain access to monitored infrastructure.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review process for contributions (described in project's CONTRIBUTING.md).
  - security control: Static analysis and linters used during development (likely integrated in CI, not explicitly documented in security context).
  - security control: Community security reporting and vulnerability disclosure process (described in project's SECURITY.md).
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community for security vulnerability discovery and patching.
  - accepted risk: Limited formal security testing and penetration testing.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning tools in CI/CD pipeline (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning).
  - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits.
  - security control: Formalize security incident response plan and procedures.
  - security control: Enhance supply chain security measures, including dependency management and artifact signing.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Implement authentication for access to Prometheus UI and API.
    - Requirement: Support secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, mutual TLS).
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to metrics, alerts, and configuration based on user roles.
    - Requirement: Enforce least privilege principle for all users and services interacting with Prometheus.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Implement robust input validation for all user inputs, especially PromQL queries, to prevent injection attacks.
    - Requirement: Sanitize and encode output data to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the UI.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use TLS/HTTPS for all communication channels to encrypt data in transit (between exporters, Prometheus server, Alertmanager, UI, etc.).
    - Requirement: Consider encryption for sensitive data at rest, if applicable (e.g., secrets management for authentication).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Monitoring infrastructure and application availability and performance.
  - Alerting on critical issues and service disruptions.
  - Capacity planning and performance analysis.
  - Incident response and troubleshooting.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - Metrics data: Operational data, performance metrics, system resource utilization. Generally considered technical data, but can reveal sensitive information about system architecture, performance bottlenecks, and potentially business activity patterns. Sensitivity level: Medium.
  - Alert data: Information about system failures and anomalies. Can contain details about incidents and potential security issues. Sensitivity level: Medium to High depending on the context of alerts.
  - Configuration data: Prometheus configuration, alerting rules, recording rules, scrape configurations. Can contain sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and internal network details if not properly managed. Sensitivity level: High if secrets are not properly managed.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific compliance requirements for the project (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)?
  - What is the organization's risk appetite regarding open-source software and security vulnerabilities?
  - Are there specific security tools or technologies already in use within the organization that should be integrated with Prometheus?
  - What are the expected user roles and access requirements for Prometheus (operators, developers, business users)?
  - Are there any specific data retention requirements for metrics data?
- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to ensure system observability and reliability.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Security is important but balanced with the need for rapid development and community contributions typical of open-source projects. The deployment environment is assumed to be security-conscious and will implement recommended security controls.
  - DESIGN: Prometheus is deployed in a Kubernetes environment. Standard exporters are used for collecting metrics. Grafana is used for visualization. Authentication and authorization are required for accessing Prometheus UI and API. TLS/HTTPS is used for all communication channels.
