# Attack Surface Analysis for prometheus/prometheus

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated HTTP API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_http_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** Prometheus's HTTP API is exposed without authentication by default, allowing unrestricted access to its functionalities.
*   **Prometheus Contribution:** Prometheus, by default, starts its HTTP API without requiring any authentication, making it inherently open to access on the network.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network uses `curl` to query the `/targets` endpoint, revealing details about monitored systems and potentially internal network topology. They then access `/metrics` to exfiltrate sensitive application performance data and system metrics.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, service disruption (DoS), potential configuration manipulation (if enabled), information disclosure, unauthorized monitoring data access.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Authentication:** Configure authentication for the Prometheus HTTP API. Options include:
        *   **Basic Authentication:** Simple username/password based authentication.
        *   **OAuth 2.0:** Integrate with an OAuth 2.0 provider for more robust authentication and authorization.
        *   **Reverse Proxy Authentication:** Utilize a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) to handle authentication before requests reach Prometheus.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict network access to the Prometheus server using firewalls or network policies, allowing access only from trusted networks or IP ranges.

## Attack Surface: [PromQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/promql_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Improper handling of user-supplied input when constructing PromQL queries can lead to PromQL injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to manipulate query logic.
*   **Prometheus Contribution:** Prometheus's powerful query language, PromQL, becomes a potential attack vector if applications using Prometheus dynamically construct queries based on user input without proper sanitization.
*   **Example:** A dashboard application takes user input to filter metrics. If this input is directly embedded into a PromQL query string without escaping or parameterization, an attacker could inject malicious PromQL to bypass intended filters and retrieve data they shouldn't have access to, or craft a resource-intensive query causing a DoS.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, Denial of Service (DoS), information disclosure, unauthorized access to metrics data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user inputs before incorporating them into PromQL queries.
    *   **Parameterized Queries or Query Builders:** Utilize libraries or methods that allow for parameterized PromQL queries or use query builder tools to construct queries programmatically, avoiding direct string concatenation of user input.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Query Scope):** Design applications to limit the scope of PromQL queries based on user roles and permissions, preventing users from querying data outside their authorized domain.
    *   **Query Analysis and Limits:** Implement mechanisms to analyze and potentially limit the resource consumption of PromQL queries to mitigate DoS attacks from overly complex or malicious queries.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or No TLS/SSL Encryption](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_no_tlsssl_encryption.md)

*   **Description:**  Lack of proper TLS/SSL encryption for HTTP communication with Prometheus exposes sensitive data in transit to eavesdropping and interception.
*   **Prometheus Contribution:** Prometheus communicates over HTTP, and if TLS/SSL is not correctly configured or disabled, all data exchanged (metrics data, API requests, UI interactions) is transmitted in plaintext.
*   **Example:** Network traffic between a Prometheus server and a Grafana dashboard displaying sensitive business metrics is intercepted. An attacker can capture this traffic and read the plaintext metrics data, gaining insights into business performance or sensitive operational details.
*   **Impact:** Data interception, information disclosure, potential credential theft if authentication is also transmitted over unencrypted channels.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable and Enforce TLS/SSL:** Configure Prometheus to use TLS/SSL for all HTTP communication. Enforce HTTPS for accessing the Web UI and API.
    *   **Strong TLS Configuration:** Use strong TLS cipher suites and protocols. Ensure proper certificate management, including using certificates signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or properly managing self-signed certificates.
    *   **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):** Enable HSTS to instruct browsers to always connect to Prometheus over HTTPS, preventing downgrade attacks and ensuring secure connections from web browsers.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  Using Prometheus with default configurations without proper hardening leaves known security vulnerabilities exposed and exploitable.
*   **Prometheus Contribution:** Prometheus, for ease of initial setup, ships with default configurations that are not optimized for security in production environments, requiring explicit hardening by users.
*   **Example:** Deploying Prometheus in a production environment without changing the default configuration, which includes an unauthenticated API and potentially disabled TLS, directly exposes it to attacks like unauthorized API access and data interception.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the specific insecure default setting exploited, including data exfiltration, DoS, information disclosure, and unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Harden Configuration:**  Thoroughly review and harden the default Prometheus configuration before deploying it in production. This includes:
        *   **Enabling Authentication:** As described in point 1.
        *   **Configuring TLS/SSL:** As described in point 3.
        *   **Reviewing and Restricting Access Control:** Ensure appropriate access controls are in place for configuration files and data directories.
        *   **Disabling Unnecessary Features:** Disable any Prometheus features that are not required and could potentially increase the attack surface.
    *   **Security Baselines and Templates:**  Develop and utilize secure configuration baselines or templates for Prometheus deployments to ensure consistent security settings across all environments.
    *   **Regular Configuration Audits:** Periodically review the Prometheus configuration to identify and remediate any potential security misconfigurations or deviations from security best practices.
