# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for prometheus/prometheus

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Authentication and Authorization for Prometheus Access](./mitigation_strategies/implement_authentication_and_authorization_for_prometheus_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose an Authentication Method:** Select an authentication method supported by Prometheus or its ecosystem.  This often involves configuring a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) in front of Prometheus to handle authentication using methods like Basic Authentication, OAuth 2.0, or integration with an external identity provider.
    2.  **Configure Prometheus Authentication via Reverse Proxy:** Configure the chosen reverse proxy to handle authentication. This typically involves setting up authentication middleware or modules within the reverse proxy configuration. The reverse proxy will then forward authenticated requests to Prometheus.
    3.  **Implement Authorization Rules (via Reverse Proxy or Authorization Service):** If finer-grained access control is needed, configure authorization rules within the reverse proxy or integrate with a dedicated authorization service.  These rules determine which authenticated users or roles can access specific Prometheus functionalities or data.
    4.  **Enforce HTTPS/TLS for Prometheus Access:** Configure the reverse proxy and Prometheus to use HTTPS/TLS for all communication, ensuring that authentication credentials and data are encrypted in transit.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Metrics Data: Severity: High
    *   Unauthorized Access to Prometheus Configuration: Severity: High
    *   Data Exfiltration: Severity: High
    *   Denial of Service (via configuration changes or malicious queries): Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Metrics Data: Significantly reduces risk by preventing anonymous access to sensitive monitoring data.
    *   Unauthorized Access to Prometheus Configuration: Significantly reduces risk by preventing unauthorized modification of monitoring setup.
    *   Data Exfiltration: Significantly reduces risk by limiting who can access and potentially exfiltrate monitoring data.
    *   Denial of Service (via configuration changes or malicious queries): Moderately reduces risk by limiting who can make configuration changes and execute queries.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Basic Authentication is implemented for the Prometheus web UI via an Nginx reverse proxy.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Authorization rules are not implemented. All authenticated users have full access.
    *   Authentication is not enforced for the Prometheus API endpoints used by other services for remote read/write.
    *   OAuth 2.0 or integration with a central identity provider is not implemented for more robust authentication management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Carefully Review and Sanitize Exposed Metrics](./mitigation_strategies/carefully_review_and_sanitize_exposed_metrics.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Metric Review Process:** Before deploying new application versions or changes to metric exports, conduct a security review of all exposed metrics.
    2.  **Identify Sensitive Metrics:**  Categorize metrics based on sensitivity. Identify metrics that could potentially expose internal business logic, performance bottlenecks that could be exploited, or any data resembling PII.
    3.  **Apply Metric Relabeling and Filtering in Prometheus Configuration:** Use Prometheus's `metric_relabel_configs` within scrape job configurations in `prometheus.yml` to modify or drop sensitive metrics or labels *before* they are stored in Prometheus.
        *   **Rename Labels:** Rename labels that might be too descriptive or revealing.
        *   **Drop Labels:** Remove labels that contain sensitive information or contribute to high cardinality without providing essential monitoring value.
        *   **Filter Metrics:** Use `metric_relabel_configs` to drop entire metrics based on label values or metric names if they are deemed too sensitive.
    4.  **Aggregate and Generalize Metrics at Exporter Level (if possible):**  Encourage developers to aggregate or generalize metrics at the exporter level itself, before they even reach Prometheus, to reduce granularity and minimize the risk of exposing detailed sensitive data.
    5.  **Regularly Audit Metrics:** Periodically review the exposed metrics and relabeling configurations in Prometheus to ensure they remain appropriate and do not inadvertently expose new sensitive information as the application evolves.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure via Metrics: Severity: Medium to High (depending on the sensitivity of exposed data)
    *   Exposure of Business Logic: Severity: Medium
    *   Internal System Details Leakage: Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure via Metrics: Significantly reduces risk by preventing the exposure of sensitive data through metrics.
    *   Exposure of Business Logic: Moderately reduces risk by obscuring detailed internal workings.
    *   Internal System Details Leakage: Moderately reduces risk by limiting the granularity of exposed system information.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Basic metric review is performed by developers before deployment, but no formal process or automated checks are in place. Relabeling is used in some scrape jobs to rename generic labels.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalized metric review process with security team involvement.
    *   Automated checks or linters to identify potentially sensitive metrics in Prometheus configuration.
    *   Systematic use of relabeling to sanitize metrics across all scrape jobs in Prometheus configuration.
    *   Guidance and training for developers on secure metric design and utilizing Prometheus relabeling.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Query Limits and Resource Controls in Prometheus](./mitigation_strategies/implement_query_limits_and_resource_controls_in_prometheus.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Query Timeout in Prometheus:** Set appropriate `query.timeout` in the Prometheus configuration (`prometheus.yml`) to limit the maximum execution time for queries.
    2.  **Configure Query Concurrency Limit in Prometheus:** Set `query.max-concurrency` in the Prometheus configuration to limit the number of concurrent queries Prometheus will execute.
    3.  **Configure Query Memory Limits (Experimental Feature):** Explore and potentially utilize the experimental `query.max-samples` and `query.max-bytes-per-sample` flags in Prometheus to limit the memory usage of queries. Be aware of the experimental nature of these features.
    4.  **Prometheus Operator Resource Management (if applicable):** If using Prometheus Operator in Kubernetes, leverage resource requests and limits within the Prometheus CRD (Custom Resource Definition) for managing Prometheus resource consumption at the container level.
    5.  **Educate Users on Query Optimization:** Provide guidelines and training to users who write Prometheus queries on best practices for query optimization, emphasizing the impact of inefficient queries on Prometheus performance.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion from Malicious Queries: Severity: High
    *   Performance Degradation of Prometheus and potentially impacting monitoring data collection: Severity: Medium
    *   Accidental DoS from poorly written queries: Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion from Malicious Queries: Significantly reduces risk by limiting the impact of resource-intensive queries.
    *   Performance Degradation of Prometheus and potentially impacting monitoring data collection: Significantly reduces risk by preventing resource monopolization by Prometheus queries.
    *   Accidental DoS from poorly written queries: Moderately reduces risk by providing safeguards against inefficient queries.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Query timeout is configured in `prometheus.yml`. Resource limits are set for the Prometheus container in Kubernetes (via Operator).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Query concurrency limit is not explicitly configured in `prometheus.yml`.
    *   Experimental query memory limit features are not explored or implemented.
    *   No formal guidelines or training for users on Prometheus query optimization.
    *   Monitoring of Prometheus resource usage *related to queries* to proactively identify potential query-induced resource issues.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Prometheus Configuration and Storage](./mitigation_strategies/secure_prometheus_configuration_and_storage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict Access to Prometheus Configuration Files:** Use file system permissions on the server hosting Prometheus to restrict read and write access to the `prometheus.yml` configuration file and any other configuration files used by Prometheus.
    2.  **Secure Storage Backend for Prometheus Data:** If using persistent storage for Prometheus data (e.g., local disk, network storage), ensure the storage backend itself is properly secured. This is less about Prometheus configuration and more about the underlying infrastructure, but important for data integrity.
    3.  **Configuration Validation Process using `promtool`:** Implement a process to validate Prometheus configuration files *before* deploying changes to Prometheus. Use the `promtool check config` command-line tool (provided with Prometheus) to catch syntax errors and potential misconfigurations in `prometheus.yml`. Integrate this validation into your CI/CD pipeline.
    4.  **Immutable Infrastructure for Prometheus Configuration Deployment:** Manage Prometheus configuration as code and deploy changes using immutable infrastructure principles. Store configuration in version control and deploy *new* Prometheus instances with updated configurations rather than modifying existing configurations in place. This improves auditability and reduces the risk of accidental or malicious configuration changes.
    5.  **Secrets Management for Prometheus Configuration:** Avoid storing sensitive credentials (e.g., API keys, passwords) directly in the `prometheus.yml` file. If Prometheus needs to authenticate to scrape targets or use remote write, utilize secrets management solutions (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets, HashiCorp Vault) to securely manage and inject these secrets into Prometheus configuration, typically as environment variables or mounted files referenced in `prometheus.yml`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Modification of Prometheus Configuration: Severity: High
    *   Data Tampering or Deletion (indirectly, by securing configuration): Severity: Medium
    *   Exposure of Sensitive Credentials in Prometheus Configuration: Severity: High
    *   Configuration Drift and Inconsistency: Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Modification of Prometheus Configuration: Significantly reduces risk by preventing unauthorized changes to monitoring setup.
    *   Data Tampering or Deletion (indirectly, by securing configuration): Moderately reduces risk by ensuring configuration integrity.
    *   Exposure of Sensitive Credentials in Prometheus Configuration: Significantly reduces risk by promoting secure secrets management *within Prometheus configuration*.
    *   Configuration Drift and Inconsistency: Moderately reduces risk by using immutable infrastructure and version control for Prometheus configuration.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - File system permissions are used to restrict access to `prometheus.yml`. Configuration is version controlled. Basic validation might be done manually.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal configuration validation process using `promtool` integrated into CI/CD.
    *   Immutable infrastructure principles are not fully implemented for Prometheus configuration *deployment process*.
    *   Secrets management solution is not consistently used for Prometheus configuration. Credentials might be directly embedded in configuration in some cases.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Prometheus and Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_prometheus_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Prometheus Update Cadence:** Define a regular schedule for updating the Prometheus server binary itself to the latest stable versions (e.g., monthly or quarterly).
    2.  **Monitor Prometheus Security Advisories:** Subscribe to the Prometheus security mailing list, monitor the Prometheus GitHub repository for security advisories specifically related to Prometheus server, and use vulnerability databases to stay informed about reported vulnerabilities in Prometheus.
    3.  **Vulnerability Scanning for Prometheus Container Image in CI/CD:** Integrate vulnerability scanning tools into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan the Prometheus container image for known vulnerabilities *before* deployment. This focuses on vulnerabilities within the Prometheus binary and its direct dependencies within the container.
    4.  **Patch Management Process for Prometheus:** Establish a process for promptly applying security patches and updates to the Prometheus server binary when vulnerabilities are identified. Prioritize critical and high-severity vulnerabilities in Prometheus itself.
    5.  **Test Prometheus Updates in Non-Production Environment:** Before deploying updates to production Prometheus instances, thoroughly test them in a non-production environment to ensure compatibility, stability, and that the update process itself doesn't introduce issues.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Prometheus Server: Severity: High (if critical vulnerabilities exist) to Medium (for less severe vulnerabilities)
    *   Compromise of Prometheus instance due to outdated Prometheus software: Severity: Medium to High

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Prometheus Server: Significantly reduces risk by mitigating known vulnerabilities *in Prometheus itself*.
    *   Compromise of Prometheus instance due to outdated Prometheus software: Significantly reduces risk by keeping the Prometheus server software up-to-date and patched.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Prometheus is updated periodically, but no formal schedule or automated vulnerability scanning *specifically for Prometheus* is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal update cadence and schedule *for Prometheus server*.
    *   Subscription to security advisories and proactive monitoring for vulnerabilities *in Prometheus*.
    *   Automated vulnerability scanning integrated into CI/CD, specifically targeting the Prometheus container image.
    *   Formal patch management process *for Prometheus server updates*.
