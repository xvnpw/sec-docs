## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Prometheus Misconfiguration -> Unauthenticated Access to Prometheus UI/API [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_prometheus_misconfiguration_-_unauthenticated_access_to_prometheus_uiapi__high-risk_path___c_a876cc4d.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Prometheus service is deployed or configured without authentication enabled, allowing anyone with network access to reach the Prometheus UI and API without providing credentials.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium/High
*   **Impact:** High
    *   Full control over Prometheus instance.
    *   Ability to view all collected metrics, potentially including sensitive information.
    *   Capability to modify Prometheus configuration (if configuration API is enabled and accessible, which is less common but possible).
    *   Potential to cause Denial of Service (DoS) by manipulating queries or scrape configurations.
    *   Reconnaissance opportunities to understand application architecture and identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   Requires only network connectivity to the Prometheus service and a web browser or command-line tool to access the UI/API.
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low
    *   Basic web browsing skills are sufficient.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
    *   Network monitoring can easily detect unauthenticated access to Prometheus ports.
    *   Access logs (if enabled) will show unauthenticated requests.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce Authentication and Authorization:**  Implement authentication and authorization for Prometheus UI and API access. Use strong passwords or certificate-based authentication. Consider using reverse proxies like `nginx` or `Traefik` for authentication.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate Prometheus within a secure network segment, limiting access from untrusted networks.
    *   **Regular Configuration Audits:**  Periodically review Prometheus configuration to ensure authentication is enabled and correctly configured.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Prometheus Exporters & Targets -> Use Prometheus for Reconnaissance [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_prometheus_exporters_&_targets_-_use_prometheus_for_reconnaissance__high-risk_path___critica_e941fc4c.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Attacker gains access to the Prometheus UI/API (potentially through unauthenticated access or compromised credentials) and uses the collected metrics to gather information about the target application and infrastructure.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if Prometheus is accessible)
*   **Impact:** Low/Medium
    *   Information gathering about application architecture, services, dependencies, and performance characteristics.
    *   Identification of potential vulnerable endpoints or services based on exposed metrics.
    *   Gathering insights into application behavior that can be used to plan further attacks.
*   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   Requires access to the Prometheus UI/API and basic knowledge of navigating the Prometheus interface and querying metrics.
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low
    *   Basic web browsing skills and familiarity with Prometheus UI are sufficient.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
    *   Access logs will show API requests and UI access, but distinguishing reconnaissance activity from legitimate monitoring usage can be more challenging without deeper analysis of query patterns.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce Authentication and Authorization (as above):**  Restricting access to Prometheus UI/API is the primary mitigation.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  If possible, implement granular authorization to limit what metrics users can access, although this is complex in Prometheus.
    *   **Minimize Sensitive Data in Metrics:**  Avoid exposing highly sensitive or overly detailed information in Prometheus metrics that could aid reconnaissance.
    *   **Network Segmentation (as above):** Limit network access to Prometheus.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Points with Other Systems -> Alertmanager Misconfiguration -> Unauthenticated Access [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_points_with_other_systems_-_alertmanager_misconfiguration_-_unauthenticated_acce_4a10ee04.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Alertmanager, if used, is misconfigured to allow unauthenticated access to its UI and API.
*   **Likelihood:** Low/Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
    *   Ability to view and manipulate alerting configurations.
    *   Potential to disable critical alerts, masking real security incidents.
    *   Possibility to create misleading alerts, causing alert fatigue and distraction.
    *   Potential to abuse alerting channels (e.g., spamming email or Slack).
*   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   Similar to Prometheus unauthenticated access, requires only network connectivity and a web browser or command-line tool.
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low
    *   Basic web browsing skills are sufficient.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
    *   Network monitoring and access logs can easily detect unauthenticated access.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce Authentication and Authorization for Alertmanager:**  Enable authentication and authorization for Alertmanager UI and API.
    *   **Network Segmentation (as above):** Isolate Alertmanager within a secure network segment.
    *   **Regular Configuration Audits for Alertmanager:** Periodically review Alertmanager configuration.

*   **Attack Vector:** Grafana, if used for visualizing Prometheus data, is misconfigured to allow unauthenticated access to dashboards and data sources.
*   **Likelihood:** Low/Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
    *   Ability to view dashboards and access metric data visualized in Grafana.
    *   Potential information disclosure if dashboards contain sensitive information.
    *   Capability to modify dashboards, potentially causing confusion or misleading information.
    *   Depending on Grafana configuration and data source permissions, potential to access underlying data sources beyond Prometheus (less common in typical Prometheus setups, but possible).
*   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   Similar to Prometheus and Alertmanager unauthenticated access.
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low
    *   Basic web browsing skills are sufficient.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
    *   Network monitoring and access logs can easily detect unauthenticated access.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce Authentication and Authorization for Grafana:** Enable authentication and authorization for Grafana.
    *   **Network Segmentation (as above):** Isolate Grafana within a secure network segment.
    *   **Regular Configuration Audits for Grafana:** Periodically review Grafana configuration and dashboard permissions.
    *   **Dashboard Security:**  Review dashboards to ensure they do not inadvertently expose sensitive information. Implement dashboard permissions to control access.
