    *   **Severity:** High (if critical vulnerabilities exist) to Medium (for less severe vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation Impact:** **Significantly reduces risk**. Regularly updating Prometheus directly addresses this threat by patching known vulnerabilities. The impact is directly proportional to the frequency and effectiveness of updates.
*   **Compromise of Prometheus instance due to outdated Prometheus software:**
    *   **Severity:** Medium to High
    *   **Mitigation Impact:** **Significantly reduces risk**.  Keeping Prometheus up-to-date minimizes the attack surface and reduces the likelihood of successful exploitation of outdated software.

The mitigation strategy directly and effectively addresses these threats by focusing on preventing and remediating vulnerabilities in the Prometheus server itself.

#### 4.3. Currently Implemented vs. Missing Implementation

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Prometheus is updated periodically, but no formal schedule or automated vulnerability scanning *specifically for Prometheus* is in place.
    *   This indicates a reactive approach to updates rather than a proactive, systematic one. While periodic updates are better than no updates, they leave gaps in security coverage.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Formal update cadence and schedule *for Prometheus server*.**
        *   This is a crucial missing piece. Without a formal cadence, updates are likely to be inconsistent and potentially delayed, increasing the window of vulnerability.
    *   **Subscription to security advisories and proactive monitoring for vulnerabilities *in Prometheus*.**
        *   This lack of proactive monitoring means the team might be unaware of critical vulnerabilities until they are widely publicized or exploited.
    *   **Automated vulnerability scanning integrated into CI/CD, specifically targeting the Prometheus container image.**
        *   The absence of automated scanning in CI/CD means vulnerabilities might be introduced into production without detection during the build and deployment process.
    *   **Formal patch management process *for Prometheus server updates*.**
        *   Without a formal process, patching might be ad-hoc, inefficient, and potentially inconsistent, leading to delays in remediation and increased risk.

The "Missing Implementation" section highlights critical gaps that need to be addressed to fully realize the benefits of the "Regularly Update Prometheus and Dependencies" mitigation strategy.
