# Threat Model Analysis for prometheus/prometheus

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Metrics Access](./threats/unauthenticated_metrics_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthenticated Metrics Access
*   **Description:** Attacker gains access to the Prometheus web UI or API without providing credentials. They can then query and view all collected metrics data. This is possible if authentication is not configured on the Prometheus server, allowing direct access to the exposed endpoint.
*   **Impact:** **Confidentiality Breach**. Exposure of sensitive operational data, performance metrics, and potentially business-critical information. Attackers can gain insights into system vulnerabilities, business performance, and internal processes.
*   **Affected Prometheus Component:** Prometheus Server (Web UI, API)
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable authentication and authorization for Prometheus web UI and API.
    *   Use strong authentication mechanisms like OAuth 2.0 or integrate with existing identity providers.
    *   Implement network segmentation to restrict access to Prometheus from trusted networks only.
    *   Use a reverse proxy with authentication in front of Prometheus.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Metrics](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_metrics.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Metrics
*   **Description:** Developers unintentionally collect and store sensitive information within Prometheus metrics. This could include API keys, passwords in logs that are scraped, or business secrets exposed as metric labels or values. Attackers can discover this sensitive data by querying Prometheus through the web UI or API.
*   **Impact:** **Confidentiality Breach**. Direct exposure of sensitive data through Prometheus queries and dashboards. This can lead to account compromise, data breaches, and further attacks.
*   **Affected Prometheus Component:** Prometheus Server (Storage, Query Engine), Data Collection (Scraping)
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review all collected metrics and identify potentially sensitive data.
    *   Implement metric relabeling rules in Prometheus to remove or redact sensitive information before storage.
    *   Avoid logging sensitive data in applications that are scraped by Prometheus.
    *   Educate developers about secure metric design and data handling.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Configuration Changes](./threats/unauthorized_configuration_changes.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Configuration Changes
*   **Description:** Attacker gains unauthorized access to Prometheus configuration endpoints (if enabled and exposed) or directly modifies the `prometheus.yml` file on the server. They can alter scrape configurations, alerting rules, and other settings. This could be done through exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations allowing access to the configuration reload endpoint or the server's filesystem.
*   **Impact:** **Integrity and Availability Impact**. Disruption of monitoring, false alerts, missed alerts, and potentially manipulation of reported metrics through altered scrape targets. Can lead to delayed incident response and inaccurate system understanding.
*   **Affected Prometheus Component:** Prometheus Server (Configuration Reload Endpoint, Configuration Files)
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable configuration reloading endpoints if not strictly necessary.
    *   Secure configuration reloading endpoints with authentication and authorization if required.
    *   Implement strict file system permissions for `prometheus.yml` and other configuration files.
    *   Use configuration management tools with access control and audit logging for managing Prometheus configuration.

## Threat: [High Cardinality Metric Exhaustion](./threats/high_cardinality_metric_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** High Cardinality Metric Resource Exhaustion
*   **Description:**  Accidental or intentional creation of metrics with extremely high cardinality (large number of unique label combinations). This leads to excessive memory usage and performance degradation in the Prometheus server. This can be caused by using unbounded labels like user IDs or request paths without proper aggregation in metric definitions or scraping configurations.
*   **Impact:** **Availability Impact**. Prometheus becomes slow or unresponsive, potentially crashing due to out-of-memory errors. This can lead to complete monitoring outage and data loss.
*   **Affected Prometheus Component:** Prometheus Server (Storage, Query Engine)
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully design metrics and avoid unbounded labels.
    *   Implement metric relabeling to reduce cardinality by aggregating or dropping high-cardinality labels.
    *   Monitor metric cardinality and set up alerts for metrics with unexpectedly high cardinality.
    *   Educate developers about the impact of high cardinality metrics and best practices for metric design.
