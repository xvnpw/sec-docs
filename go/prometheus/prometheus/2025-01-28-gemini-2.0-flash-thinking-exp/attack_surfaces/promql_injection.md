### 4. Deep Analysis of PromQL Injection Attack Surface

#### 4.1. Understanding PromQL Injection in Detail

PromQL Injection occurs when an attacker can manipulate the logic of a PromQL query by injecting malicious code through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being incorporated into the query string.

**How it Works:**

1.  **User Input Incorporation:** Applications often need to filter or customize Prometheus metrics based on user requests. This typically involves taking user input (e.g., from a web form, API parameter, or configuration file) and embedding it into a PromQL query string.
2.  **String Concatenation (Vulnerable Practice):**  The most common and vulnerable approach is to directly concatenate user input into the PromQL query string. For example:

    ```python
    metric_name = request.GET.get('metric') # User input
    query = f'rate({metric_name}[5m])' # Direct concatenation - VULNERABLE!
    ```

3.  **Lack of Sanitization:** If the application does not sanitize or validate the `metric_name` input, an attacker can inject malicious PromQL code.
4.  **Query Execution:** The application then sends this constructed query to the Prometheus server for execution.
5.  **Exploitation:**  The Prometheus server executes the crafted query, including the injected malicious PromQL, potentially leading to unintended consequences.

**Example of a Simple Injection:**

Imagine a dashboard application that allows users to filter metrics based on a label value. The application constructs a PromQL query like this:

```
up{instance="$instance"}
```

Where `$instance` is replaced with user input.

A malicious user could input:

```
" or on(instance) vector(1) #
```

The resulting query becomes:

```
up{instance="" or on(instance) vector(1) # "}
```

This injected code effectively bypasses the intended filter.  The `#` character comments out the rest of the original query, and `on(instance) vector(1)` always returns a vector, effectively making the `instance` label filter irrelevant. This could allow the attacker to see metrics for *all* instances, not just the intended one.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors and Scenarios

PromQL Injection can be exploited through various attack vectors, depending on how user input is incorporated into PromQL queries within the application.

*   **Web Interfaces (Dashboards, APIs):**
    *   **Form Fields:**  User input from web forms used to filter metrics, define query parameters, or customize dashboards.
    *   **URL Parameters:**  Input passed through URL query parameters in API requests or dashboard links.
    *   **API Request Bodies (JSON, XML):** Input provided in the body of API requests, especially in applications that allow users to define custom queries or filters through APIs.

*   **Configuration Files:**
    *   Applications that read configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON) where users can define metric filters or query templates. If these configurations are not properly validated, they can be manipulated to inject PromQL.

*   **Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs):**
    *   CLIs that accept user input to construct and execute PromQL queries.

**Real-world Scenarios:**

1.  **Dashboard Data Exfiltration:** A dashboard application allows users to filter metrics by service name. An attacker injects PromQL to bypass the service name filter and retrieve metrics for sensitive services they are not authorized to view, such as database metrics or internal application performance data.

2.  **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker injects a resource-intensive PromQL query that consumes excessive CPU and memory on the Prometheus server, causing performance degradation or even crashing the server, impacting monitoring and alerting capabilities. Examples of resource-intensive queries include:
    *   Queries with very large time ranges without proper aggregation.
    *   Queries using functions like `histogram_quantile` or `topk` on high-cardinality metrics without appropriate filtering.
    *   Nested subqueries that exponentially increase query complexity.

3.  **Information Disclosure through Error Messages:**  In some cases, even if the injection doesn't directly exfiltrate data, crafted PromQL injection attempts might trigger error messages from Prometheus that reveal internal information about the metric schema, label names, or even internal system configurations.

4.  **Bypassing Rate Limiting or Access Controls:**  Applications might implement rate limiting or access control based on certain metric filters. PromQL injection could be used to bypass these controls by manipulating the query logic to circumvent the intended restrictions.

#### 4.3. Impact Assessment (Detailed)

The impact of a successful PromQL Injection attack can be significant and varies depending on the application and the attacker's objectives.

*   **Data Exfiltration and Confidentiality Breach:**
    *   Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive metrics data that they should not be able to view. This could include performance metrics of critical systems, business-sensitive data exposed as metrics, or even security-related metrics.
    *   The severity depends on the sensitivity of the exposed data and the potential damage caused by its disclosure.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   Maliciously crafted PromQL queries can overload the Prometheus server, leading to performance degradation, service disruption, and potentially complete server crashes.
    *   This can disrupt monitoring and alerting capabilities, making it difficult to detect and respond to real system issues.
    *   In critical infrastructure or production environments, DoS can have severe consequences.

*   **Information Disclosure (Beyond Data Exfiltration):**
    *   Error messages or unexpected query results can reveal information about the metric schema, label names, internal system architecture, or even Prometheus server configurations.
    *   This information can be valuable for attackers to plan further attacks or gain a deeper understanding of the target system.

*   **Unauthorized Access and Privilege Escalation (Indirect):**
    *   While PromQL Injection itself doesn't directly grant system-level access, it can be used to bypass application-level access controls and gain access to data or functionalities that are intended to be restricted.
    *   In some scenarios, if the application uses Prometheus data to make authorization decisions, manipulating the data through injection could indirectly lead to privilege escalation within the application's context.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

Preventing PromQL Injection requires a multi-layered approach focusing on secure coding practices and robust input handling.

1.  **Input Sanitization and Validation (Strongly Recommended):**

    *   **Principle:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs *before* incorporating them into PromQL queries. Treat all user input as potentially malicious.
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   **Allowlisting:** Define a strict allowlist of acceptable characters, formats, and values for user inputs. Reject any input that does not conform to the allowlist. For example, if expecting a metric name, validate that it only contains alphanumeric characters and underscores.
        *   **Input Type Validation:**  Validate the data type of the input. If expecting a number, ensure it is indeed a number and within an acceptable range.
        *   **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to enforce specific input patterns and constraints.
        *   **Escaping (Context-Aware):**  If direct string concatenation is unavoidable (though highly discouraged), carefully escape user input to prevent it from being interpreted as PromQL syntax. However, escaping can be complex and error-prone for PromQL due to its syntax. **Parameterization or Query Builders are preferred over escaping.**

    *   **Example (Python - Basic Allowlisting):**

        ```python
        def sanitize_metric_name(metric_name):
            allowed_chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + "_"
            sanitized_name = "".join(c for c in metric_name if c in allowed_chars)
            if sanitized_name != metric_name:
                logging.warning(f"Metric name sanitized: '{metric_name}' -> '{sanitized_name}'")
            return sanitized_name

        metric_name = request.GET.get('metric')
        sanitized_metric_name = sanitize_metric_name(metric_name)
        query = f'rate({sanitized_metric_name}[5m])'
        ```

2.  **Parameterized Queries or Query Builders (Best Practice):**

    *   **Principle:**  Avoid direct string concatenation of user input into PromQL queries. Utilize libraries or methods that support parameterized queries or query builders.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Security:** Parameterization inherently prevents injection by treating user input as data, not code.
        *   **Readability and Maintainability:**  Query builders often lead to more readable and maintainable code compared to complex string manipulation.
        *   **Reduced Error Risk:**  Less prone to syntax errors and escaping mistakes.

    *   **Example (Conceptual Query Builder - Python-like):**

        ```python
        # Hypothetical Query Builder Library
        query_builder = PromQLQueryBuilder()
        query = query_builder.rate(
            query_builder.metric(
                "up",
                labels={"instance": user_provided_instance} # Parameterized label value
            ),
            duration="5m"
        )
        promql_query = query.build() # Generates the PromQL string securely
        ```

    *   **Note:** While a dedicated PromQL query builder library might not be as prevalent as for SQL, the principle of programmatically constructing queries instead of string concatenation is crucial.  You can achieve similar results by using templating engines carefully or by building your own helper functions to construct query components.

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege (Query Scope Limitation):**

    *   **Principle:** Design applications to limit the scope of PromQL queries based on user roles, permissions, and the context of the application.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC within the application to define user roles and the metrics they are authorized to access.
        *   **Query Scoping:**  Programmatically restrict the queries that users can generate to only access metrics relevant to their role or the specific application context. For example, if a user is only supposed to view metrics for a specific service, enforce this constraint in the query construction logic.
        *   **Predefined Queries:**  Instead of allowing users to construct arbitrary queries, offer a set of predefined, parameterized queries that cover common use cases. This limits the attack surface significantly.

4.  **Query Analysis and Limits (DoS Mitigation):**

    *   **Principle:** Implement mechanisms to analyze and potentially limit the resource consumption of PromQL queries to mitigate DoS attacks.
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   **Query Complexity Analysis:**  Analyze the complexity of incoming PromQL queries (e.g., number of series, functions used, time range). Reject or rate-limit queries that exceed predefined complexity thresholds.
        *   **Query Timeout:**  Set timeouts for Prometheus query execution. This prevents excessively long-running queries from consuming resources indefinitely.
        *   **Resource Limits in Prometheus:**  Configure resource limits within Prometheus itself (e.g., `query.max-concurrency`, `query.timeout`) to protect the server from resource exhaustion.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Application Level):**  Implement rate limiting at the application level to restrict the number of queries a user or IP address can send within a given time frame.

5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF) (Defense in Depth):**

    *   **Principle:** Deploy a WAF to detect and block potentially malicious PromQL injection attempts.
    *   **Capabilities:**
        *   **Signature-Based Detection:** WAFs can be configured with signatures to detect common PromQL injection patterns.
        *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Some WAFs can detect anomalous query patterns that might indicate injection attempts.
        *   **Input Validation (WAF Level):**  WAFs can perform input validation and sanitization as an additional layer of defense.
    *   **Limitations:** WAFs are not a foolproof solution and can be bypassed. They should be used as part of a defense-in-depth strategy, not as the primary mitigation.

#### 4.5. Detection and Monitoring

Detecting PromQL Injection attempts can be challenging but is crucial for timely response.

*   **Logging and Auditing:**
    *   **Log All PromQL Queries:**  Log all PromQL queries executed by the application, including the source of the query (user, API client, etc.).
    *   **Audit Logs:**  Maintain audit logs of user actions related to query construction and execution.
    *   **Analyze Logs for Anomalies:**  Regularly analyze logs for suspicious query patterns, unusual characters in queries, or queries that deviate from expected patterns.

*   **Monitoring Prometheus Query Performance:**
    *   **Monitor Prometheus Server Metrics:**  Track Prometheus server metrics related to query execution time, CPU usage, and memory consumption.
    *   **Alert on Performance Anomalies:**  Set up alerts for significant increases in query execution time or resource usage, which could indicate DoS attacks or complex injected queries.

*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**
    *   Integrate application logs and Prometheus server metrics into a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and analysis.
    *   Use SIEM rules to detect potential PromQL injection attempts based on log patterns and performance anomalies.

*   **Penetration Testing and Security Audits:**
    *   Regularly conduct penetration testing and security audits to specifically test for PromQL Injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Simulate attack scenarios to identify weaknesses in input validation and query construction logic.

### 5. Conclusion and Recommendations
