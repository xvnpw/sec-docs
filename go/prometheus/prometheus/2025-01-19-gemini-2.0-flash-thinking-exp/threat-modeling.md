# Threat Model Analysis for prometheus/prometheus

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Scraping](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_excessive_scraping.md)

**Description:** A misconfigured or malicious Prometheus instance could be configured to scrape targets at an extremely high frequency. This overwhelms the target applications, but also puts excessive load on the Prometheus server itself, consuming its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and potentially causing it to become unresponsive or crash, leading to a denial of service of the monitoring system.

**Impact:** Unavailability of the Prometheus monitoring system, loss of real-time metrics data, and inability to monitor applications, potentially leading to undetected issues and delayed incident response.

**Affected Component:**
*   Scrape Manager (responsible for scheduling and executing scrapes)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully configure scrape intervals in Prometheus to avoid overwhelming targets and the Prometheus server itself.
*   Implement rate limiting on the Prometheus server's scraping activity.
*   Monitor the resource usage of the Prometheus server and alert on unusual spikes.
*   Implement safeguards in target applications to handle excessive requests.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource-Intensive Queries](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource-intensive_queries.md)

**Description:** A malicious actor or even a poorly written PromQL query by a legitimate user can consume significant resources (CPU, memory) on the Prometheus server. Repeated execution of such queries can lead to a denial of service, making the monitoring system unresponsive for other users and processes.

**Impact:** Unavailability of the Prometheus monitoring system, preventing the monitoring of applications and potentially delaying incident response.

**Affected Component:**
*   Query Engine

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement query timeouts and resource limits in Prometheus.
*   Educate users on writing efficient PromQL queries.
*   Monitor Prometheus query performance and identify resource-intensive queries.
*   Implement rate limiting on query execution.

## Threat: [Tampering with Alerting Rules](./threats/tampering_with_alerting_rules.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the Prometheus configuration files could modify the alerting rules. This could involve disabling critical alerts, creating misleading alerts, or changing notification destinations, directly within Prometheus's configuration.

**Impact:** Failure to detect critical issues, delayed incident response, or being misled by false alerts, leading to potential operational disruptions or security breaches going unnoticed.

**Affected Component:**
*   Configuration Loading
*   Alerting

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict access controls on the Prometheus configuration files.
*   Use version control for configuration changes and implement code review processes.
*   Implement monitoring and alerting on changes to the Prometheus configuration.

## Threat: [Compromise of Prometheus Configuration Files](./threats/compromise_of_prometheus_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** The Prometheus configuration file (`prometheus.yml`) contains sensitive information such as target endpoints, scrape intervals, and potentially credentials for remote storage or Alertmanager. If this file is compromised, an attacker gains significant control over the Prometheus instance, allowing them to manipulate its behavior.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Prometheus instance, allowing attackers to manipulate monitoring data, disrupt alerting, redirect metrics, and potentially gain access to credentials for other systems.

**Affected Component:**
*   Configuration Loading

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the Prometheus configuration file with appropriate file system permissions (read-only for the Prometheus user).
*   Store sensitive credentials securely using secrets management tools instead of directly in the configuration file.
*   Implement access controls to restrict who can modify the configuration file.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on Prometheus Binaries or Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_prometheus_binaries_or_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Compromised Prometheus binaries or dependencies could introduce malicious code directly into the Prometheus installation. This could happen if the official distribution channels are compromised or if vulnerabilities in dependencies are exploited.

**Impact:** Potentially complete compromise of the Prometheus instance, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code, steal monitoring data, disrupt operations, or use the Prometheus server as a foothold for further attacks.

**Affected Component:**
*   Entire Prometheus Instance

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Download Prometheus binaries from official sources and verify their integrity using checksums.
*   Regularly update Prometheus and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   Consider using signed binaries where available.
