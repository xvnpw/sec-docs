Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Prometheus, with high or critical risk severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Unauthenticated `/metrics` Endpoint (Pull-based Scraping)
    *   **Description:** The `/metrics` endpoint, when exposed without authentication, allows anyone with network access to retrieve all metrics collected by Prometheus from the application.
    *   **How Prometheus Contributes:** Prometheus's core functionality relies on exposing this endpoint for scraping. By default, it often lacks authentication.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the application's network and queries `http://<application-ip>:<application-port>/metrics`, revealing internal performance metrics, business logic indicators, and potentially sensitive information like queue sizes or error rates.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, enabling reconnaissance for further attacks, understanding application internals, potentially revealing vulnerabilities or business secrets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement authentication and authorization for the `/metrics` endpoint. This can be done at the application level or using a reverse proxy.
        *   Restrict network access to the `/metrics` endpoint to only authorized Prometheus servers. Use firewalls or network segmentation.
        *   Carefully consider what metrics are exposed and avoid including highly sensitive data in metric labels or values.

*   **Attack Surface:** Unauthenticated `/remote_write` Endpoint (Push-based Ingestion)
    *   **Description:**  If the `/remote_write` endpoint is exposed without authentication, attackers can push arbitrary metrics to the Prometheus instance.
    *   **How Prometheus Contributes:** Prometheus provides this endpoint to receive metrics pushed from other systems.
    *   **Example:** An attacker pushes a large volume of fake metrics to the `/remote_write` endpoint, overwhelming the Prometheus server and potentially causing storage issues or performance degradation. They could also inject misleading metrics to disrupt monitoring and alerting.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) on the Prometheus server, data pollution, incorrect alerting, masking of real issues.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement authentication and authorization for the `/remote_write` endpoint.
        *   Restrict network access to the `/remote_write` endpoint to only authorized push gateways or applications.
        *   Implement rate limiting or validation on incoming metrics.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Prometheus Configuration
    *   **Description:**  Prometheus configuration files can contain sensitive information like credentials for scraping targets or alerting integrations. If these files are not properly secured, they can be compromised.
    *   **How Prometheus Contributes:** Prometheus relies on configuration files to define its behavior, including scraping targets and alerting rules.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the `prometheus.yml` file and finds credentials for a database being scraped by Prometheus. They can then use these credentials to access the database directly.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, manipulation of scraping targets, disruption of monitoring and alerting.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the Prometheus configuration files with appropriate file system permissions.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in the configuration file. Use secret management solutions or environment variables.
        *   Regularly review and audit the Prometheus configuration.
