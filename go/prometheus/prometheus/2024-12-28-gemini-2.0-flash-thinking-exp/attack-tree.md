**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Exploit Data Collection Vulnerabilities -> Inject Malicious Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker aims to inject fabricated or manipulated metric data into Prometheus. This can be achieved by compromising legitimate metric exporters or by directly sending malicious metrics through unsecured channels like the Push Gateway.
* **Impact:**  Successful injection of malicious metrics can lead to misleading application monitoring, triggering false alerts, and potentially influencing application behavior if the application logic relies on these metrics.

**2. Compromise Exporter and Send Malicious Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises a legitimate exporter application (which collects and exposes metrics from the target application) and uses it as a conduit to send malicious metrics to Prometheus.
* **Impact:**  Similar to the general "Inject Malicious Metrics" scenario, this can lead to misleading monitoring, false alerts, and potential manipulation of application behavior.

**3. Abuse Push Gateway to Send Malicious Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages an unsecured or poorly secured Prometheus Push Gateway to directly push malicious metrics to the Prometheus server.
* **Impact:**  This bypasses the normal scraping process and allows for direct injection of arbitrary metrics, leading to misleading monitoring and potential application manipulation.

**4. PromQL Injection:**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how PromQL queries are constructed and executed, often by injecting malicious code or commands through unsanitized user input.
* **Impact:** Successful PromQL injection can lead to information disclosure (accessing sensitive metrics), denial of service (executing resource-intensive queries), and potentially remote code execution if vulnerabilities exist in the query processing logic.

**5. Access Sensitive Metrics via Missing Authentication/Authorization on Prometheus API:**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits the lack of proper authentication and authorization on the Prometheus API to directly access and retrieve sensitive metric data.
* **Impact:** This can expose confidential application metrics, revealing business logic, performance characteristics, security vulnerabilities, or even user-related data.

**6. Suppress Real Alerts via Manipulating Metrics:**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates metric data in a way that prevents it from reaching the thresholds defined in alerting rules, effectively suppressing real alerts.
* **Impact:** This can lead to delayed detection of critical issues, security breaches, or system failures, potentially causing significant damage or downtime.

**7. Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities:**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker targets vulnerabilities in how Prometheus configuration is managed and accessed. This can involve gaining unauthorized access to sensitive configuration files or exploiting unsecured configuration reload endpoints.
* **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to the exposure of sensitive information (API keys, credentials), the ability to redirect metric scraping to attacker-controlled endpoints, disable alerting mechanisms, and potentially gain control over the Prometheus server itself.

**8. Access Sensitive Configuration Files via Exploit File System Permissions:**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits weak file system permissions on the Prometheus server to gain unauthorized access to configuration files.
* **Impact:** This can expose sensitive information like API keys, credentials, and internal network details, which can be used for further attacks.

**9. Modify Prometheus Configuration via Exploit Unsecured Configuration Reload Endpoint:**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits an unsecured or unauthenticated configuration reload endpoint to inject malicious configuration changes into the Prometheus server.
* **Impact:** This allows the attacker to manipulate Prometheus's behavior, potentially redirecting metric scraping, disabling alerts, or exposing sensitive information.

**10. Exploit Known CVEs in Prometheus:**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific version of Prometheus being used.
* **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but it can range from denial of service to remote code execution, potentially leading to full compromise of the Prometheus server and potentially the application it monitors.

**11. Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits previously unknown vulnerabilities (zero-days) in Prometheus.
* **Impact:** Similar to exploiting known CVEs, the impact can be severe, potentially leading to full compromise of the Prometheus server and the monitored application.

This focused view highlights the most critical areas of risk and provides a clear understanding of the attack vectors that pose the greatest threat to the application when using Prometheus. The development team should prioritize addressing these specific vulnerabilities and implementing the corresponding security measures.
