# Threat Model Analysis for prometheus/prometheus

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure via Prometheus UI/API](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_via_prometheus_uiapi.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure via Prometheus UI/API

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the *Prometheus* web UI or API and retrieves sensitive information that Prometheus has scraped from targets, even if the targets themselves are secured. This assumes the attacker has network access to the Prometheus server and exploits a lack of authentication/authorization on the Prometheus server itself.
    *   **Impact:**  Leakage of confidential data (API keys, credentials, PII, internal network details) that Prometheus has collected. This can lead to further compromise, reputational damage, and legal consequences.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Prometheus server (web UI, API, storage engine). Specifically, the HTTP endpoints exposed by the Prometheus server (`/metrics`, API endpoints).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if sensitive data is exposed) or High (if less sensitive, but still internal, data is exposed).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Deploy a reverse proxy with strong authentication and authorization *in front of Prometheus*.
        *   Use TLS encryption for all communication with the Prometheus server (API access).
        *   Implement network segmentation to restrict access to the Prometheus server.
        *   Disable the admin API if not needed (`--web.enable-admin-api=false`).
        *   Disable remote write receiver if not needed (`--web.enable-remote-write-receiver=false`).

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Excessive Metrics (Prometheus Server Overload)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_excessive_metrics__prometheus_server_overload_.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Excessive Metrics (Prometheus Server Overload)

    *   **Description:** An attacker (or a misconfigured application, *but the impact is directly on Prometheus*) sends a large volume of metrics, or metrics with high cardinality, directly to the *Prometheus server*. This overwhelms Prometheus's internal processing capabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Prometheus server becomes unresponsive, leading to monitoring outages, data loss, and potential cascading failures in dependent systems *that rely on Prometheus*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Prometheus server (storage engine, query engine, scraping mechanism). Specifically, the time series database (TSDB) and the components responsible for handling incoming data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `sample_limit` *within Prometheus* to restrict the number of samples ingested.
        *   Set resource limits (CPU, memory) *for the Prometheus server process*.
        *   Use `metric_relabel_configs` *within Prometheus* to limit label count and value length on *incoming* data.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Malicious Queries (Against Prometheus API)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_malicious_queries__against_prometheus_api_.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Malicious Queries (Against Prometheus API)

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends complex or resource-intensive PromQL queries to the *Prometheus server's* API. This directly impacts the Prometheus server's query engine.
    *   **Impact:**  Prometheus server becomes unresponsive, leading to monitoring outages.  Potentially impacts other services relying on Prometheus for alerting or autoscaling *because Prometheus itself is down*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Prometheus server (query engine, API). Specifically, the PromQL evaluation engine and the API endpoints that handle queries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure query timeouts (`--query.timeout`) *within Prometheus*.
        *   Implement query limits (via reverse proxy or custom middleware *protecting the Prometheus API*).
        *   Restrict access to the Prometheus API (authentication/authorization *on the Prometheus server*).

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack during Scraping (Prometheus as the Victim)](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_during_scraping__prometheus_as_the_victim_.md)

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack during Scraping (Prometheus as the Victim)

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication *between Prometheus and a target*, modifying the metrics being scraped *before they reach Prometheus*. This focuses on Prometheus being the recipient of falsified data.
    *   **Impact:**  Prometheus receives and stores incorrect monitoring data, leading to false alerts, missed alerts, and a distorted view of the system's state. This directly impacts the integrity of *Prometheus's data*.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Prometheus server (scraping mechanism). Specifically, the HTTP client used by Prometheus for scraping.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use TLS (HTTPS) for scraping targets, with proper certificate validation *configured within Prometheus*.
        *   Consider certificate pinning *within Prometheus's scrape configuration*.

## Threat: [Data Tampering (Direct File System Access to Prometheus Data)](./threats/data_tampering__direct_file_system_access_to_prometheus_data_.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Tampering (Direct File System Access to Prometheus Data)

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains direct access to the *Prometheus server's* file system and modifies the time series data stored in the TSDB. This is a direct attack on the Prometheus data store.
    *   **Impact:**  Monitoring data *within Prometheus* is corrupted, leading to incorrect alerts, unreliable historical data analysis, and compromised integrity of the monitoring system.
    *   **Affected Component:** Prometheus server (storage engine - TSDB). Specifically, the files and directories where the time series data is stored.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict file system permissions on the Prometheus data directory *on the server hosting Prometheus*.
        *   Implement regular backups of the Prometheus data.
        *   Use file integrity monitoring tools *on the Prometheus server*.
        *   Harden the operating system of the *Prometheus server itself*.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack (Compromised Prometheus Binary/Dependency)](./threats/supply_chain_attack__compromised_prometheus_binarydependency_.md)

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack (Compromised Prometheus Binary/Dependency)

    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the *Prometheus binary itself* or one of *its* dependencies before it is downloaded and installed. This is a direct threat to the integrity of the Prometheus software.
    *   **Impact:**  The compromised binary or dependency could contain malicious code that exfiltrates data collected *by Prometheus*, disrupts *Prometheus's* monitoring, or provides the attacker with a backdoor into the system *via the compromised Prometheus instance*.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Potentially all components of the Prometheus server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Download binaries only from official Prometheus sources.
        *   Verify checksums of downloaded Prometheus binaries.
        *   Maintain an SBOM for Prometheus and its dependencies.
        *   Regularly update Prometheus and its dependencies.
        *   Use a trusted package manager and verify package signatures *for Prometheus*.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution via Remote Write (Directly on Prometheus)](./threats/remote_code_execution_via_remote_write__directly_on_prometheus_.md)

* **Threat:** Remote Code Execution via Remote Write (Directly on Prometheus)

    * **Description:** If remote write is enabled *on the Prometheus server*, an attacker could send crafted data to the Prometheus server, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in *Prometheus's remote write receiver* to achieve remote code execution *on the Prometheus server itself*.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the *Prometheus server*, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code, access data stored *by Prometheus*, and potentially pivot to other systems.
    * **Affected Component:** Prometheus server (remote write receiver - `web.enable-remote-write-receiver`).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Disable remote write if not needed (`--web.enable-remote-write-receiver=false`) *on the Prometheus server*.
        * If remote write is required, ensure the receiver is properly secured with authentication and authorization (typically through a reverse proxy *protecting Prometheus*).
        * Regularly update Prometheus to patch any vulnerabilities in the remote write receiver.
        * Implement network segmentation to limit access to the *Prometheus* remote write endpoint.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Administrative Actions (Against Prometheus Itself)](./threats/unauthorized_administrative_actions__against_prometheus_itself_.md)

* **Threat:** Unauthorized Administrative Actions (Against Prometheus Itself)

    * **Description:** If the admin API is enabled and not properly secured *on the Prometheus server*, an attacker could use it to perform destructive actions, such as deleting time series data *from Prometheus* or shutting down the *Prometheus server*.
    * **Impact:** Loss of monitoring data *within Prometheus*, disruption of *Prometheus's* monitoring services.
    * **Affected Component:** Prometheus server (admin API - `web.enable-admin-api`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Disable the admin API if not needed (`--web.enable-admin-api=false`) *on the Prometheus server*.
        * If the admin API is required, secure it with strong authentication and authorization (typically through a reverse proxy *protecting Prometheus*).
        * Implement network segmentation to limit access to the *Prometheus* admin API endpoint.
