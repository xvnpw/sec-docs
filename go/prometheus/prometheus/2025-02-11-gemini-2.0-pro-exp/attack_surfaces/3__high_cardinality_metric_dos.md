# Deep Analysis: High Cardinality Metric Denial of Service (DoS) in Prometheus

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "High Cardinality Metric DoS" attack surface, identify its root causes, assess its potential impact, and propose comprehensive mitigation strategies.  This analysis aims to provide actionable guidance for developers and operations teams to prevent and respond to this specific type of attack.  We will go beyond the basic description and delve into the technical details of how Prometheus handles high cardinality and how attackers can exploit this.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Prometheus Server:**  The core component responsible for scraping, storing, and querying metrics.  We will not cover remote storage solutions in detail, but will acknowledge their potential role in mitigation.
*   **Client-side Metric Generation:**  How applications expose metrics that can lead to high cardinality.
*   **Prometheus Configuration:**  Configuration options that directly impact cardinality and mitigation strategies.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The assumed capabilities of an attacker, ranging from unintentional misconfiguration to deliberate malicious actions.
* **Impact on Prometheus itself:** We will not cover the impact on the monitored application.

### 1.3 Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Technical Deep Dive:**  Examine the internal workings of Prometheus's Time Series Database (TSDB) and how it handles high cardinality.
2.  **Attack Scenario Analysis:**  Develop realistic attack scenarios to illustrate how high cardinality can be exploited.
3.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Review relevant Prometheus configuration options and their impact on cardinality.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:**  Assess the effectiveness and trade-offs of various mitigation strategies.
5.  **Best Practice Recommendations:**  Provide concrete recommendations for developers and operations teams.
6. **Review of Prometheus Documentation and Source Code:** To ensure accuracy and identify subtle nuances.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1 Technical Deep Dive: Prometheus TSDB and Cardinality

Prometheus's TSDB is optimized for time-series data, but it has inherent limitations regarding cardinality.  Here's a breakdown:

*   **Time Series Identification:**  A time series is uniquely identified by its metric name and a set of key-value pairs called labels.  For example: `http_requests_total{method="GET", path="/api/users"}`.
*   **Inverted Index:**  Prometheus uses an inverted index to efficiently query time series based on labels.  This index maps label values to the series IDs that contain them.
*   **Chunking:**  Time series data is stored in chunks, each covering a specific time range.
*   **High Cardinality Impact:**
    *   **Index Size:**  High cardinality dramatically increases the size of the inverted index.  This leads to slower queries and increased memory consumption.
    *   **Chunk Creation:**  A large number of unique time series results in a large number of chunks, increasing storage overhead and potentially exceeding file descriptor limits.
    *   **Memory Usage:**  Prometheus loads index and chunk metadata into memory.  High cardinality can lead to excessive memory usage, potentially causing Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors and crashes.
    *   **Compaction:**  The TSDB periodically compacts chunks to improve efficiency.  High cardinality can make compaction significantly slower and more resource-intensive.
    * **WAL (Write-Ahead Log):** The WAL can grow significantly with high cardinality, leading to longer startup times after a crash.

### 2.2 Attack Scenario Analysis

**Scenario 1: Unintentional High Cardinality (Developer Error)**

*   **Description:** A developer instruments an application to track request latency, using a request ID (UUID) as a label.
*   **Mechanism:** Each request generates a unique time series.  Over time, this creates millions of unique series, overwhelming Prometheus.
*   **Attacker Profile:**  Unintentional; a developer unaware of Prometheus's cardinality limitations.

**Scenario 2: Intentional DoS Attack (Malicious Actor)**

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts HTTP requests to a monitored application, manipulating a label value to generate a unique series for each request.
*   **Mechanism:** The attacker sends requests with a rapidly changing `user_id` label (e.g., incrementing a counter or using random strings).  This bypasses any rate limiting on the application itself but floods Prometheus.
*   **Attacker Profile:**  Malicious; an attacker with knowledge of the application's metrics and Prometheus's vulnerabilities.
* **Example:**
    *   **Normal Request:** `GET /api/resource` (metric: `http_requests_total{path="/api/resource"}`)
    *   **Attack Request 1:** `GET /api/resource?id=123` (metric: `http_requests_total{path="/api/resource", id="123"}`)
    *   **Attack Request 2:** `GET /api/resource?id=456` (metric: `http_requests_total{path="/api/resource", id="456"}`)
    *   ...and so on, creating a new time series for each unique `id` value.

**Scenario 3: `honor_labels` Abuse**

* **Description:** The attacker controls labels sent to Prometheus, and `honor_labels` is enabled.
* **Mechanism:** The attacker sends metrics with rapidly changing label values, bypassing any relabeling rules that might have been in place *before* the scrape.
* **Attacker Profile:** Malicious; an attacker with the ability to inject metrics directly into the scrape target.

### 2.3 Configuration Analysis

Several Prometheus configuration options are crucial for mitigating high cardinality:

*   **`relabel_configs` (Scrape Config):**  Applied *before* the scrape, these rules can modify or drop labels *before* they reach Prometheus.  This is the **first line of defense**.
    *   **`action: drop`:**  Drops the entire metric if a label matches a specific condition.
    *   **`action: labeldrop`:**  Drops a specific label.
    *   **`action: labelmap`:**  Renames labels.
    *   **`action: replace`:**  Replaces the value of a label.  Useful for aggregating high-cardinality labels into a single value.
    *   **`regex`:**  Uses regular expressions to match label names and values.

*   **`metric_relabel_configs` (Scrape Config):**  Applied *after* the scrape, but *before* storage.  This is a **second line of defense**, useful for handling labels that weren't caught by `relabel_configs`.  It has the same actions as `relabel_configs`.

*   **`sample_limit` (Scrape Config):**  Limits the number of samples that can be ingested from a single scrape target.  This prevents a single misconfigured target from overwhelming Prometheus.

*   **`global.scrape_sample_limit` (Global Config):**  Limits the total number of samples that can be ingested across all targets.  This provides a global safety net.

*   **`honor_labels` (Scrape Config):**  If set to `true`, Prometheus will use the labels provided by the target, *overriding* any conflicting labels set by the Prometheus server (e.g., `instance`, `job`).  **This is dangerous if the target is untrusted.**  If set to `false` (default), Prometheus-added labels take precedence.

* **TSDB Retention Settings:** While not directly mitigating the *immediate* impact of a high-cardinality burst, shorter retention periods (`storage.tsdb.retention.time`) can help limit the long-term storage impact.

### 2.4 Mitigation Strategy Evaluation

| Strategy                     | Effectiveness | Trade-offs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Relabeling (`relabel_configs`, `metric_relabel_configs`)** | **High**      | Requires careful configuration and understanding of the application's metrics.  Can be complex to manage with many targets and metrics.  May require ongoing maintenance as the application evolves.  `metric_relabel_configs` can impact query performance if overused. |
| **Metric Design**            | **High**      | Requires developer education and buy-in.  May require code changes to existing applications.  Doesn't protect against malicious actors who can bypass application-level controls.                                                                                                                |
| **Limits (`sample_limit`, `global.scrape_sample_limit`)** | **Medium**     | Can prevent a single target or a small number of targets from overwhelming Prometheus.  Doesn't address the root cause of high cardinality.  May drop legitimate metrics if limits are set too low.                                                                        |
| **`honor_labels: false`**    | **High**      | Prevents attackers from injecting malicious labels via the scrape target.  May break legitimate use cases where the target needs to provide specific labels.                                                                                                                                     |
| **Alerting on Cardinality** | **Medium**     |  Doesn't prevent the attack, but provides early warning.  Requires setting appropriate thresholds and defining effective alert rules.  Can be noisy if not configured correctly.  Example: `count by(__name__)` can be used to track the number of unique time series.                               |
| **Rate Limiting (External)** | **Medium**     | Can be implemented at the network level (e.g., firewall, load balancer) or within the application itself.  Helps prevent attackers from sending a large number of requests that generate high-cardinality metrics.  Doesn't address unintentional high cardinality.                               |
| **Remote Write**             | **Medium**     | Offloads storage and querying to a remote system (e.g., Thanos, Cortex).  Can improve scalability and resilience, but adds complexity.  Doesn't prevent the initial ingestion of high-cardinality data, but can help manage the impact.                                                              |

### 2.5 Best Practice Recommendations

1.  **Educate Developers:**  Provide clear guidelines on metric design and labeling best practices.  Emphasize the importance of avoiding unbounded label values.  Include this in onboarding and regular training.
2.  **Implement Robust Relabeling:**  Use `relabel_configs` and `metric_relabel_configs` extensively to drop or aggregate high-cardinality labels.  Regularly review and update these rules.
3.  **Set Appropriate Limits:**  Configure `sample_limit` and `global.scrape_sample_limit` to prevent excessive ingestion of samples.  Start with conservative values and adjust as needed.
4.  **Disable `honor_labels` (Unless Absolutely Necessary):**  Set `honor_labels` to `false` to prevent attackers from injecting malicious labels.  If you *must* use `honor_labels`, ensure the target is completely trusted.
5.  **Monitor Cardinality:**  Create alerts to detect sudden increases in the number of time series.  Use metrics like `prometheus_tsdb_head_series` and `count by(__name__)`.
6.  **Regularly Review Metrics:**  Periodically audit the metrics exposed by your applications to identify and address potential cardinality issues.
7.  **Consider Remote Write (for Scalability):**  If you anticipate high cardinality or require long-term storage, consider using a remote write solution.
8. **Test Thoroughly:** Before deploying any changes to your Prometheus configuration or application instrumentation, test them thoroughly in a non-production environment.  Use load testing to simulate high-cardinality scenarios.
9. **Document Everything:** Clearly document your relabeling rules, metric design guidelines, and alerting thresholds. This will make it easier to maintain and troubleshoot your monitoring system.
10. **Use Recording Rules:** For frequently used, complex, or expensive queries that involve high-cardinality metrics, create recording rules. This precomputes the results and stores them as a new time series, reducing query load.
