Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Sensitive Data Exposure via Prometheus UI/API" threat, tailored for a development team using Prometheus:

## Deep Analysis: Sensitive Data Exposure via Prometheus UI/API

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1. Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the attack vectors related to sensitive data exposure through the Prometheus UI and API.
*   Identify specific vulnerabilities within a typical Prometheus deployment that could lead to this threat.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies and recommend concrete implementation steps for the development team.
*   Provide actionable guidance to prevent this threat from materializing.
*   Establish a clear understanding of residual risk after mitigations are applied.

**1.2. Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the Prometheus server component, including:

*   **Prometheus Web UI:** The user interface accessible via a web browser.
*   **Prometheus API:**  The HTTP API used for querying data, managing alerts, and other administrative tasks.
*   **Network Configuration:** How the Prometheus server is exposed to the network.
*   **Configuration Flags:**  Prometheus server configuration options related to security.
*   **Interaction with Reverse Proxies:**  How a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache, Envoy) can be used for security.
*   **Interaction with other security tools:** How other security tools (e.g. firewalls) can be used for security.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Security of the targets being scraped by Prometheus (this is a separate threat).
*   Compromise of the underlying host operating system.
*   Physical security of the server.
*   Vulnerabilities within Prometheus dependencies (other than direct configuration issues).

**1.3. Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Re-examine the initial threat model entry to ensure a complete understanding of the threat's context.
2.  **Attack Surface Analysis:**  Identify all potential entry points an attacker could use to access the Prometheus UI/API.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Explore known vulnerabilities and common misconfigurations that could lead to data exposure.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:**  Assess the effectiveness of each proposed mitigation strategy, considering practical implementation challenges.
5.  **Implementation Guidance:**  Provide specific, actionable steps for the development team to implement the chosen mitigations.
6.  **Residual Risk Assessment:**  Identify any remaining risks after mitigations are in place.
7.  **Documentation Review:** Analyze Prometheus official documentation.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1. Attack Surface Analysis:**

The primary attack surface consists of the HTTP(S) endpoints exposed by the Prometheus server:

*   **`/` (and sub-paths):**  The main web UI, providing access to graphs, alerts, configuration, and the expression browser.
*   **`/graph`:**  Endpoint for rendering graphs.
*   **`/api/v1/*`:**  The core API endpoints for querying data, managing alerts, etc.  Examples include:
    *   `/api/v1/query`:  Execute a PromQL query.
    *   `/api/v1/query_range`:  Execute a PromQL query over a time range.
    *   `/api/v1/targets`:  Retrieve information about configured targets.
    *   `/api/v1/labels`: Retrieve list of all labels.
    *   `/api/v1/label/<label_name>/values`: Retrieve all values for label.
    *   `/api/v1/series`: Retrieve series that matches certain label sets.
    *   `/api/v1/status/config`: Retrieve configuration.
    *   `/api/v1/status/flags`: Retrieve flags.
*   **`/metrics`:**  The endpoint where Prometheus exposes *its own* metrics (this is often scraped by another Prometheus instance, but could also leak information about the Prometheus server itself).
*   **`/admin/tsdb/*`:** Administrative API endpoints (if enabled).  These can be *very* dangerous if exposed without authentication.  Examples:
    *   `/admin/tsdb/delete_series`:  Delete time series data.
    *   `/admin/tsdb/snapshot`:  Create a snapshot of the data.
    *   `/admin/tsdb/clean_tombstones`: Remove deleted data.
*  **`/-/reload`:** Reload configuration.
*  **`/-/quit`:** Quit prometheus.

An attacker with network access to these endpoints, without proper authentication/authorization, can:

1.  **Directly Query Sensitive Data:**  Use the `/api/v1/query` or `/api/v1/query_range` endpoints to execute arbitrary PromQL queries and retrieve any data stored in Prometheus.
2.  **Enumerate Targets:**  Use the `/api/v1/targets` endpoint to discover all targets being monitored, potentially revealing internal network structure and services.
3.  **Access Configuration:**  Use the `/api/v1/status/config` endpoint to view the Prometheus configuration, which might contain sensitive information (although ideally, sensitive data should be managed through environment variables or secrets, not directly in the config file).
4.  **Manipulate Data (if admin API is enabled):**  Use the `/admin/tsdb/*` endpoints to delete data or create snapshots, potentially disrupting monitoring or causing data loss.
5.  **Cause Denial of Service:**  Submit complex or resource-intensive queries to overload the Prometheus server.
6.  **Reload or Quit Prometheus:** Use `/reload` or `/quit` endpoints to disrupt monitoring.

**2.2. Vulnerability Analysis:**

The core vulnerability is the **lack of authentication and authorization** on the Prometheus server's HTTP endpoints.  This is the default configuration.  Other contributing factors include:

*   **Misconfigured Reverse Proxy:**  If a reverse proxy is used, but is misconfigured (e.g., incorrect authentication settings, improper routing), it can be bypassed.
*   **Network Misconfiguration:**  The Prometheus server might be exposed to a wider network than intended (e.g., exposed to the public internet instead of a private network).
*   **Outdated Prometheus Version:**  Older versions might contain known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases.  While the core issue is lack of authentication, specific vulnerabilities in older versions could exacerbate the problem.
*   **Enabled Admin API:**  The admin API (`--web.enable-admin-api`) provides powerful capabilities that should be disabled if not explicitly needed.
*   **Enabled Remote Write Receiver:** The remote write receiver (`--web.enable-remote-write-receiver`) allows external systems to push metrics into Prometheus. If enabled without proper authentication and authorization, it could be used to inject malicious data or overwrite existing metrics.

**2.3. Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:**

Let's evaluate the proposed mitigation strategies:

*   **Deploy a reverse proxy with strong authentication and authorization *in front of Prometheus*.**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Highly effective.  This is the recommended approach.  A reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache, Envoy, etc.) can handle authentication (basic auth, OAuth 2.0, mTLS) and authorization (restricting access to specific endpoints or based on user roles) before requests reach the Prometheus server.
    *   **Implementation Challenges:**  Requires configuring the reverse proxy correctly, managing user accounts and credentials, and potentially integrating with an existing identity provider.
    *   **Recommendation:**  This is the **primary and most crucial mitigation**.

*   **Use TLS encryption for all communication with the Prometheus server (API access).**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Essential for protecting data in transit.  Prevents eavesdropping on the network.  Does *not* prevent unauthorized access if an attacker has network connectivity.
    *   **Implementation Challenges:**  Requires obtaining and configuring TLS certificates.  Can be simplified with tools like Let's Encrypt.
    *   **Recommendation:**  **Mandatory**, even with a reverse proxy.  Always use HTTPS.

*   **Implement network segmentation to restrict access to the Prometheus server.**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Reduces the attack surface by limiting the number of hosts that can reach the Prometheus server.  A good defense-in-depth measure.
    *   **Implementation Challenges:**  Requires careful network planning and configuration (firewalls, VLANs, etc.).
    *   **Recommendation:**  **Highly recommended** as a complementary measure to the reverse proxy.

*   **Disable the admin API if not needed (`--web.enable-admin-api=false`).**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Eliminates a significant attack vector if the admin API is not required.
    *   **Implementation Challenges:**  None, simply set the flag.
    *   **Recommendation:**  **Mandatory** unless the admin API is absolutely necessary and properly secured.

*   **Disable remote write receiver if not needed (`--web.enable-remote-write-receiver=false`).**
    *   **Effectiveness:** Prevents unauthorized data injection if the remote write receiver is not required.
    *   **Implementation Challenges:** None, simply set the flag.
    *   **Recommendation:** **Mandatory** unless the remote write receiver is absolutely necessary and properly secured (with authentication and authorization).

**2.4. Implementation Guidance (for Development Team):**

1.  **Reverse Proxy Setup (Nginx Example):**

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name prometheus.example.com;

        ssl_certificate /path/to/your/certificate.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/private_key.pem;

        location / {
            # Authentication (Basic Auth Example)
            auth_basic "Prometheus Access";
            auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;

            # Proxy to Prometheus
            proxy_pass http://localhost:9090;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
    ```

    *   **Create an `.htpasswd` file:**  `htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd <username>` (and follow prompts to set a password).
    *   **Replace placeholders:**  Update `server_name`, certificate paths, and the `proxy_pass` URL (if Prometheus is not running on localhost:9090).
    *   **Consider OAuth 2.0/OIDC:**  For more robust authentication, integrate with an identity provider using OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect (OIDC).  This is more complex but provides better security and user management.
    *   **Authorization:**  Use Nginx's `allow` and `deny` directives within the `location` block to further restrict access based on IP address or other criteria.  You can also use more advanced authorization modules if needed.

2.  **Prometheus Configuration:**

    *   **`--web.enable-admin-api=false`:**  Add this flag to the Prometheus startup command.
    *   **`--web.enable-remote-write-receiver=false`:** Add this flag to the Prometheus startup command.
    *   **`--web.external-url=<external_url>`:** Set external url to match reverse proxy address.
    *   **`--web.route-prefix=<prefix>`:** If you want to host Prometheus on a subpath (e.g., `prometheus.example.com/prometheus`), set this flag and adjust the Nginx `proxy_pass` accordingly.

3.  **TLS Configuration (Prometheus - Optional, but recommended if not using a reverse proxy for TLS):**

    *   **`--web.config.file=web-config.yml`:**  Use a web configuration file to specify TLS settings.
    *   **`web-config.yml` example:**

        ```yaml
        tls_server_config:
          cert_file: /path/to/prometheus.crt
          key_file: /path/to/prometheus.key
        ```

4.  **Network Segmentation:**

    *   **Firewall Rules:**  Configure firewall rules (e.g., using `iptables`, `ufw`, or a cloud provider's firewall) to allow access to the Prometheus server (port 9090 or the reverse proxy's port) only from trusted sources (e.g., your monitoring network, specific IP addresses).
    *   **VLANs:**  If possible, place the Prometheus server in a separate VLAN to isolate it from other network segments.

5. **Regular Updates:** Keep Prometheus and reverse proxy up to date.

**2.5. Residual Risk Assessment:**

Even with all the above mitigations in place, some residual risk remains:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  A previously unknown vulnerability in Prometheus, the reverse proxy, or their dependencies could be exploited.
*   **Compromise of Reverse Proxy:**  If the reverse proxy itself is compromised, the attacker could bypass authentication and gain access to Prometheus.
*   **Misconfiguration:**  Errors in the configuration of the reverse proxy, firewall, or Prometheus itself could create vulnerabilities.
*   **Insider Threat:**  A malicious or negligent insider with legitimate access to the network could still access Prometheus data.
*   **Credential Theft:** If credentials used for authentication are stolen (e.g., through phishing), the attacker could gain access.

**2.6. Monitoring and Auditing:**

*   **Monitor Reverse Proxy Logs:**  Regularly review the reverse proxy's access logs for suspicious activity (e.g., failed login attempts, unusual IP addresses, unexpected requests).
*   **Audit Prometheus Configuration:**  Periodically review the Prometheus configuration and network settings to ensure they are correct and secure.
*   **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Alerting:** Configure alerts in Prometheus to detect unusual query patterns or access attempts.

### 3. Conclusion

The threat of sensitive data exposure via the Prometheus UI/API is a serious concern. By implementing a reverse proxy with strong authentication and authorization, using TLS encryption, implementing network segmentation, and disabling unnecessary features (admin API, remote write receiver), the risk can be significantly reduced.  Continuous monitoring, auditing, and keeping software up-to-date are crucial for maintaining a secure Prometheus deployment. The development team should prioritize the implementation of these mitigations and establish a process for ongoing security review.
