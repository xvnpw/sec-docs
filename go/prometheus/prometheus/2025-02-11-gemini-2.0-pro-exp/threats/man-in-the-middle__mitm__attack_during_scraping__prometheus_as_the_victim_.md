# Deep Analysis: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack during Scraping (Prometheus as Victim)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack vector targeting Prometheus's scraping process.  We aim to:

*   Understand the precise mechanisms by which a MitM attack can be executed in this context.
*   Identify the specific vulnerabilities within Prometheus and its configuration that could be exploited.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies and identify potential gaps.
*   Provide concrete recommendations for hardening Prometheus against this threat.
*   Determine the residual risk after implementing mitigations.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the scenario where Prometheus is the *victim* of a MitM attack during the scraping of metrics from a target.  This means the attacker is intercepting and potentially modifying the data *sent by the target to Prometheus*.  We are *not* considering MitM attacks where Prometheus is the attacker (e.g., intercepting traffic between two other services).  The scope includes:

*   Prometheus server's scraping mechanism (HTTP client).
*   Prometheus configuration related to scraping (TLS settings, target addresses).
*   Network infrastructure between Prometheus and its targets.
*   Target exporter's security posture (only insofar as it impacts the MitM attack on Prometheus).

We explicitly *exclude* attacks targeting the Prometheus UI, API, or internal components *other than* the scraping mechanism.  We also exclude attacks that do not involve manipulating the scraped metrics data in transit.

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Threat Modeling Review:**  Re-examine the initial threat model entry to ensure a complete understanding of the threat.
*   **Code Review (Targeted):**  Examine relevant sections of the Prometheus codebase (primarily the HTTP client and scraping logic) to identify potential vulnerabilities and understand how TLS is implemented.  This is not a full code audit, but a focused review.
*   **Configuration Analysis:**  Analyze example Prometheus configurations and best practice guides to identify common misconfigurations that could increase vulnerability.
*   **Network Analysis:**  Consider typical network topologies and how they might facilitate or hinder MitM attacks.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  Search for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) or attack techniques related to MitM attacks against HTTP clients or TLS implementations.
*   **Mitigation Verification:**  Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies (TLS, certificate pinning) through theoretical analysis and, if possible, practical testing in a controlled environment.
*   **Residual Risk Assessment:**  Determine the remaining risk after implementing the mitigations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1. Attack Scenario Breakdown

A successful MitM attack against Prometheus's scraping process would typically involve the following steps:

1.  **Attacker Positioning:** The attacker gains a privileged network position between the Prometheus server and the target exporter. This could be achieved through:
    *   **ARP Spoofing:**  On a local network, the attacker could use ARP spoofing to redirect traffic intended for the target to the attacker's machine.
    *   **DNS Spoofing/Poisoning:**  The attacker could manipulate DNS records to point the target's hostname to the attacker's IP address.
    *   **Rogue Access Point:**  In a wireless environment, the attacker could set up a rogue access point that mimics the legitimate network.
    *   **Compromised Router/Switch:**  The attacker could compromise a network device along the path between Prometheus and the target.
    *   **BGP Hijacking:** (Less likely, but possible for targets on different networks) The attacker could manipulate BGP routing to intercept traffic.

2.  **Interception:** Once in a privileged position, the attacker intercepts the HTTP(S) requests from Prometheus to the target.

3.  **TLS Interception (if HTTPS is used, but improperly configured):**
    *   **Invalid Certificate:** If Prometheus is configured to *not* validate certificates (e.g., `insecure_skip_verify: true`), the attacker can present a self-signed or otherwise invalid certificate, and Prometheus will accept it.
    *   **Compromised CA:** If the attacker has compromised a Certificate Authority (CA) trusted by Prometheus, they can issue a valid certificate for the target's domain.
    *   **Weak Cipher Suites:** If Prometheus and the target negotiate a weak cipher suite, the attacker might be able to break the encryption.

4.  **Data Modification:** The attacker modifies the metrics data returned by the target before forwarding it to Prometheus.  This could involve:
    *   **Changing values:**  Altering numerical values to report false readings.
    *   **Adding/Removing metrics:**  Introducing spurious metrics or suppressing legitimate ones.
    *   **Injecting malicious data:**  Potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in Prometheus's parsing of the metrics data (though this is outside the primary scope of *this* MitM threat).

5.  **Forwarding to Prometheus:** The attacker forwards the modified data to Prometheus, which processes it as if it came directly from the target.

### 2.2. Vulnerabilities and Exploitation

The primary vulnerability lies in the potential for Prometheus to accept manipulated data due to insufficient verification of the target's identity and the integrity of the communication channel.  Specific vulnerabilities include:

*   **Lack of TLS (HTTP Scraping):** If scraping is performed over plain HTTP, the attack is trivial.  The attacker simply intercepts and modifies the data.
*   **Disabled TLS Certificate Validation (`insecure_skip_verify: true`):** This is a *critical* misconfiguration.  It completely bypasses the security provided by TLS, allowing the attacker to present any certificate.
*   **Missing or Incorrect `ca_file` Configuration:** If Prometheus is configured to use a specific CA file (`ca_file`), but the file is missing, incorrect, or doesn't contain the necessary CA certificates, validation will fail (or, worse, default to a potentially insecure system-wide trust store).
*   **Weak TLS Configuration:**  Using outdated TLS versions (e.g., TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1) or weak cipher suites can make the connection vulnerable to decryption.
*   **Lack of Certificate Pinning:** While TLS with proper certificate validation provides strong security, certificate pinning adds an extra layer of defense.  Without pinning, an attacker who compromises a trusted CA could still perform a MitM attack.
* **Vulnerable Target Exporter:** While the focus is on Prometheus, a vulnerable target exporter could be compromised and used as a launching point for a MitM attack. For example, if the exporter itself is susceptible to command injection, an attacker could modify the metrics it serves *before* they even reach the network.

### 2.3. Mitigation Strategy Analysis

The proposed mitigation strategies are:

*   **Use TLS (HTTPS) for scraping targets, with proper certificate validation *configured within Prometheus*.**
    *   **Effectiveness:** This is the *most crucial* mitigation.  Properly configured TLS provides confidentiality and integrity for the communication channel, preventing the attacker from reading or modifying the data in transit.  "Proper certificate validation" is key, meaning `insecure_skip_verify: false` (the default) and a correctly configured `ca_file` or reliance on the system's trust store (if appropriate).
    *   **Gaps:**  This mitigation relies on the target exporter also supporting and correctly configuring TLS.  It also doesn't protect against a compromised CA.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS for *all* scrape targets.
        *   Explicitly set `insecure_skip_verify: false` in the Prometheus configuration to avoid accidental misconfiguration.
        *   Use a dedicated CA for monitoring infrastructure, if feasible, and configure Prometheus to use the corresponding `ca_file`.
        *   Regularly audit TLS configurations on both Prometheus and the target exporters.
        *   Use a tool like `sslscan` or `testssl.sh` to verify the TLS configuration of target exporters.
        *   Configure Prometheus to use only strong cipher suites and TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or 1.3).

*   **Consider certificate pinning *within Prometheus's scrape configuration*.**
    *   **Effectiveness:** Certificate pinning adds a significant layer of security by verifying that the presented certificate matches a pre-defined certificate or public key.  This protects against attacks involving compromised CAs.
    *   **Gaps:**  Pinning can be complex to manage, especially in dynamic environments.  Incorrectly configured pinning can lead to service outages if certificates are rotated without updating the pin.  It also requires careful planning and operational procedures.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   Implement certificate pinning if the risk of CA compromise is deemed high and the operational overhead is acceptable.
        *   Use a robust mechanism for managing and updating pins (e.g., a configuration management system).
        *   Thoroughly test pin updates before deploying them to production.
        *   Consider using HPKP (HTTP Public Key Pinning) headers on the target exporter side, although this is being deprecated in favor of Certificate Transparency Expect-CT. Prometheus itself doesn't directly interact with HPKP headers during scraping. The pinning needs to be configured within Prometheus's scrape configuration.

### 2.4. Residual Risk

Even with TLS and certificate pinning implemented, some residual risk remains:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  There's always the possibility of undiscovered vulnerabilities in TLS implementations, Prometheus's HTTP client, or the target exporter.
*   **Compromised Target Exporter:** If the target exporter itself is compromised, the attacker can manipulate the metrics *before* they are sent to Prometheus, bypassing network-level mitigations.
*   **Compromised Prometheus Server:** If the Prometheus server itself is compromised, the attacker could disable or modify the security configurations.
*   **Sophisticated Attacks:**  Highly sophisticated attackers might find ways to bypass even strong security measures (e.g., through supply chain attacks).
*   **Operational Errors:**  Mistakes in configuration or key management can still create vulnerabilities.

### 2.5. Further Recommendations

*   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate Prometheus and its targets on a dedicated monitoring network to limit the attack surface.
*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Deploy an IDS to detect suspicious network activity, such as ARP spoofing or DNS anomalies.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the entire monitoring infrastructure, including Prometheus, target exporters, and network devices.
*   **Least Privilege:**  Run Prometheus and the target exporters with the least necessary privileges.
*   **Monitoring of Prometheus:** Monitor Prometheus itself for unusual behavior, such as configuration changes or unexpected errors.
*   **Alerting on TLS Errors:** Configure Prometheus to alert on TLS handshake errors or certificate validation failures. This can provide early warning of a potential MitM attack.
* **Target Exporter Hardening:** Ensure target exporters are hardened and follow security best practices. This includes keeping them up-to-date, using secure configurations, and limiting their exposure.

## 3. Conclusion

The MitM attack during scraping poses a significant risk to the integrity of Prometheus's monitoring data.  However, by implementing TLS with proper certificate validation and considering certificate pinning, the risk can be substantially reduced.  Continuous monitoring, regular security audits, and a defense-in-depth approach are essential to minimize the residual risk and maintain the security of the monitoring infrastructure. The most important takeaway is to *never* use `insecure_skip_verify: true` in a production environment.
