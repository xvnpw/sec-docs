Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Unauthorized Administrative Actions (Against Prometheus Itself)" threat, structured as requested:

# Deep Analysis: Unauthorized Administrative Actions Against Prometheus

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Unauthorized Administrative Actions" threat against a Prometheus server, identify specific attack vectors, evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigations, and recommend additional security measures if necessary.  We aim to provide actionable guidance to the development team to ensure the Prometheus deployment is robust against this threat.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the Prometheus server's administrative API (`web.enable-admin-api`).  It encompasses:

*   **Attack Vectors:**  How an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the admin API.
*   **Impact Analysis:**  The specific consequences of successful exploitation, beyond the general description.
*   **Mitigation Effectiveness:**  Evaluating the strength and limitations of the proposed mitigation strategies.
*   **Residual Risk:**  Identifying any remaining risks after implementing the mitigations.
*   **Recommendations:**  Providing concrete steps to minimize the threat.
*   **Vulnerabilities:** Known CVE if any.

The scope *excludes* threats related to data ingestion, querying, or other non-administrative aspects of Prometheus. It also excludes threats against client applications *scraping* Prometheus.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Documentation Review:**  Examine the official Prometheus documentation, security advisories, and best practice guides.
2.  **Code Review (Targeted):**  Focus on the code related to the admin API's handling of authentication and authorization (if accessible and relevant).  This is *not* a full code audit, but a targeted review to understand the implementation details.
3.  **Threat Modeling Principles:**  Apply threat modeling principles (e.g., STRIDE, DREAD) to systematically identify potential attack vectors.
4.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Search for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) related to the Prometheus admin API.
5.  **Best Practice Comparison:**  Compare the proposed mitigations against industry best practices for securing APIs and network services.
6.  **Scenario Analysis:**  Develop realistic attack scenarios to illustrate how the threat could be exploited.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1. Attack Vectors

An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the Prometheus admin API through several vectors:

*   **Direct Network Access (No Authentication):** If the admin API is enabled (`--web.enable-admin-api=true`) and no authentication/authorization mechanism is in place (e.g., a reverse proxy with authentication), an attacker with network access to the Prometheus server's port (default: 9090) can directly interact with the API.  This is the most straightforward and severe attack vector.
*   **Bypassing Reverse Proxy Authentication:** If a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache, Envoy) is used for authentication, vulnerabilities in the reverse proxy itself, misconfigurations, or credential leaks could allow an attacker to bypass the authentication layer.  Examples include:
    *   **Misconfigured Authentication Rules:**  Incorrectly configured `location` blocks in Nginx or similar directives in other proxies might expose the admin API unintentionally.
    *   **Vulnerable Reverse Proxy Software:**  Exploitable vulnerabilities in the reverse proxy software could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Leaked Credentials:**  Compromised credentials for the reverse proxy's authentication mechanism (e.g., Basic Auth, OAuth) would grant the attacker access.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  If another application running on the same network as Prometheus is vulnerable to SSRF, an attacker might be able to use that vulnerability to send requests to the Prometheus admin API from the trusted internal network, bypassing external firewall rules.
*   **Compromised Host:** If the host running the Prometheus server is compromised through any other means (e.g., SSH vulnerability, malware), the attacker gains full control and can directly access the admin API.
*   **Insider Threat:** A malicious or negligent insider with network access to the Prometheus server could directly access the unprotected admin API.

### 2.2. Impact Analysis

The impact of successful exploitation goes beyond the general description:

*   **Data Loss (Complete or Selective):**  An attacker can use the `/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series` endpoint to delete specific time series data or even wipe the entire TSDB.  This can lead to:
    *   **Loss of Historical Data:**  Irreversible loss of valuable historical monitoring data, hindering trend analysis and post-incident investigations.
    *   **Alerting Gaps:**  Deletion of data can prevent alerts from firing, leading to undetected outages or performance issues.
    *   **Compliance Violations:**  Loss of monitoring data may violate regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
*   **Service Disruption (Shutdown):**  The `/api/v1/admin/quit` endpoint allows an attacker to gracefully shut down the Prometheus server.  The `/-/quit` endpoint (if exposed) can also achieve this. This results in:
    *   **Complete Monitoring Blindness:**  No new metrics are collected, and existing alerts stop functioning.
    *   **Delayed Incident Response:**  Without monitoring, incidents may go unnoticed or be detected much later, increasing their impact.
*   **Configuration Manipulation (Limited):** While the admin API doesn't directly allow full configuration changes, an attacker might be able to influence behavior through endpoints like `/api/v1/admin/tsdb/clean_tombstones`, which could impact data retention.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Data loss or service disruption due to a security breach can damage the organization's reputation and erode trust.
* **Snapshot creation:** An attacker can create snapshot of current data using `/api/v1/admin/tsdb/snapshot` and download it.

### 2.3. Mitigation Effectiveness

Let's evaluate the proposed mitigations:

*   **Disable the admin API (`--web.enable-admin-api=false`):**  This is the **most effective** mitigation if the admin API is not required. It completely eliminates the attack surface.  However, it also prevents legitimate administrative actions that might be needed.
*   **Secure with Authentication/Authorization (Reverse Proxy):**  This is a strong mitigation *if implemented correctly*.  A properly configured reverse proxy with strong authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0, mutual TLS) and authorization (e.g., role-based access control) significantly reduces the risk.  However, it introduces complexity and relies on the security of the reverse proxy itself.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  This is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.  By limiting network access to the Prometheus server (and its admin API endpoint) to only authorized systems and users, you reduce the attack surface even if other security controls fail.  This can be achieved through firewalls, VLANs, or network policies in a containerized environment.  However, network segmentation alone is not sufficient; it must be combined with authentication/authorization.

### 2.4. Residual Risk

Even with all proposed mitigations in place, some residual risk remains:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  Undiscovered vulnerabilities in Prometheus, the reverse proxy, or the underlying operating system could still be exploited.
*   **Compromised Credentials (Reverse Proxy):**  If the credentials used for authentication at the reverse proxy are compromised, the attacker gains access.
*   **Insider Threat (with Network Access):**  A malicious insider with legitimate network access and knowledge of the reverse proxy configuration could still potentially bypass security controls.
*   **SSRF (from Trusted Network):**  If another application within the trusted network segment is vulnerable to SSRF, it could still be used to attack the Prometheus admin API, even with network segmentation.
*   **Misconfiguration:** Human error in configuring the reverse proxy, firewall rules, or other security components can create vulnerabilities.

### 2.5. Recommendations

1.  **Disable Admin API if Possible:**  If the administrative API is not strictly necessary for your operational needs, disable it using `--web.enable-admin-api=false`. This is the simplest and most secure option.

2.  **Robust Reverse Proxy Configuration:** If the admin API is required:
    *   **Use a Well-Vetted Reverse Proxy:**  Choose a reputable and actively maintained reverse proxy (Nginx, HAProxy, Envoy).
    *   **Strong Authentication:**  Implement strong authentication, preferably using OAuth 2.0 or mutual TLS (mTLS). Avoid basic authentication if possible.
    *   **Fine-Grained Authorization:**  Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to specific admin API endpoints based on user roles.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Regularly audit the reverse proxy configuration for misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider using a WAF in front of the reverse proxy to provide additional protection against common web attacks.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the admin API endpoints to mitigate brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts.

3.  **Strict Network Segmentation:**
    *   **Dedicated Network Segment:**  Place the Prometheus server in a dedicated network segment with restricted access.
    *   **Firewall Rules:**  Implement strict firewall rules to allow only necessary traffic to the Prometheus server and its admin API port.
    *   **Microsegmentation (Containerized Environments):**  Use network policies in Kubernetes or other container orchestration platforms to isolate the Prometheus pod and limit its network access.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the Prometheus process runs with the least privileges necessary. Avoid running it as root.

5.  **Regular Security Updates:**  Keep Prometheus, the reverse proxy, the operating system, and all other related software up to date with the latest security patches.

6.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Monitor access logs for the Prometheus server and the reverse proxy. Configure alerts for suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts or access to sensitive API endpoints.

7.  **Security Hardening Guides:** Follow security hardening guides for the operating system and the reverse proxy.

8.  **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in the Prometheus deployment.

9. **Input validation:** Even though administrative API is not supposed to be exposed, it is good practice to validate all input.

10. **Audit Logging:** Enable and monitor audit logs for all actions performed via the admin API. This helps in detecting and investigating any unauthorized access or activity.

### 2.6 Vulnerabilities

*   **CVE-2022-46146:** While not directly related to the *admin* API, this CVE highlights the importance of securing all exposed endpoints. It involved an issue where the tracing endpoint could lead to a denial-of-service. This underscores the need for a holistic approach to security, even for seemingly less critical components.
*   **CVE-2021-29622:** The /api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series and /api/v1/admin/tsdb/clean_tombstones APIs did not previously require authentication. This was addressed, and now authentication is mandatory if the admin API is enabled. This emphasizes the importance of staying up-to-date with security patches.

It's crucial to regularly check for new CVEs related to Prometheus and its dependencies.

## 3. Conclusion

The "Unauthorized Administrative Actions" threat against Prometheus is a serious concern that requires a multi-layered approach to mitigation. Disabling the admin API is the most effective solution if feasible. If the API is required, a combination of a properly configured reverse proxy with strong authentication and authorization, strict network segmentation, and ongoing security monitoring is essential to minimize the risk. Regular security audits, penetration testing, and staying informed about new vulnerabilities are crucial for maintaining a secure Prometheus deployment.
