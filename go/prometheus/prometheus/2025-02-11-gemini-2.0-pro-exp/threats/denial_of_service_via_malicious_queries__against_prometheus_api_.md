# Deep Analysis: Denial of Service via Malicious Queries (Against Prometheus API)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Denial of Service via Malicious Queries" threat against the Prometheus API, identify specific attack vectors, evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigations, and recommend additional security measures to enhance the resilience of the Prometheus deployment.  We aim to go beyond the surface-level description and delve into the technical details.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the Prometheus server's API and query engine.  It encompasses:

*   **PromQL Query Structure:**  Understanding how malicious queries can be crafted.
*   **Prometheus Server Internals:**  How the query engine processes queries and where bottlenecks might occur.
*   **API Endpoint Vulnerability:**  Analyzing the specific API endpoints used for querying.
*   **Mitigation Effectiveness:**  Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed mitigations.
*   **Network and Infrastructure Context:** Considering how network configuration and infrastructure choices impact the threat.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** How authentication and authorization can be used to limit access.
*   **Rate Limiting and Resource Quotas:** How to limit the impact of an attack.

This analysis *excludes* threats targeting other parts of the Prometheus ecosystem (e.g., exporters, Alertmanager, Pushgateway) *unless* they directly contribute to the DoS attack on the Prometheus API.

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Threat Modeling Review:**  Re-examining the initial threat model entry for completeness and accuracy.
*   **Code Review (Targeted):**  Examining relevant sections of the Prometheus source code (specifically the query engine and API handling) to understand internal mechanisms and potential vulnerabilities.  This is not a full code audit, but a focused review.
*   **Documentation Review:**  Thoroughly reviewing the official Prometheus documentation, including best practices, configuration options, and security recommendations.
*   **Experimentation (Controlled Environment):**  Setting up a test Prometheus instance and simulating malicious query attacks to observe the server's behavior and the effectiveness of mitigations.  This is crucial for practical validation.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  Searching for known vulnerabilities or exploits related to Prometheus query DoS.
*   **Best Practices Analysis:**  Comparing the current setup against industry best practices for securing API endpoints and mitigating DoS attacks.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1. Attack Vectors and Query Analysis

An attacker can craft malicious PromQL queries in several ways to cause a denial of service:

*   **High Cardinality Queries:**  Queries that select a massive number of time series.  This can be achieved by:
    *   Using broad label matchers (e.g., `{__name__=~".+"}`) that match nearly all metrics.
    *   Exploiting metrics with high cardinality labels (e.g., labels that include unique IDs or timestamps).
    *   Combining multiple high-cardinality metrics in a single query.
    *   Example: `{job=~".*", instance=~".*", __name__=~".+"}`

*   **Long Time Range Queries:**  Queries that request data over a very long time range (e.g., weeks or months) without aggregation.  This forces Prometheus to load and process a large amount of data from storage.
    *   Example: `my_metric[1y]` (without any aggregation function).

*   **Complex Aggregations:**  Queries that use computationally expensive aggregation functions (e.g., `histogram_quantile`, `topk`, `bottomk`) on a large number of time series.
    *   Example: `histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (le, job))` (if `http_requests_total` has high cardinality).

*   **Rate/Range Vector Combinations:**  Using `rate()` or other range vector functions with very short ranges and then aggregating over a long period. This can lead to a large number of intermediate calculations.
    *   Example: `sum(rate(my_metric[1s])[1h:1s])`

*   **Chained Subqueries:**  Deeply nested subqueries can increase the computational complexity exponentially.

*   **Regex Abuse:** Using complex or inefficient regular expressions in label matchers. Prometheus uses the RE2 regex engine, which is generally safe against ReDoS, but extremely broad regexes can still cause performance issues.

### 2.2. Prometheus Server Internals (Query Engine)

The Prometheus query engine works in the following simplified steps:

1.  **Parsing:** The PromQL query is parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
2.  **Planning:** The query planner determines the most efficient way to execute the query, considering available indexes and data.
3.  **Execution:** The query engine retrieves the relevant time series data from the storage engine (TSDB).
4.  **Evaluation:** The query engine applies the specified functions and aggregations to the data.
5.  **Result:** The results are returned to the client.

Bottlenecks can occur at any of these stages:

*   **Parsing:**  Extremely complex or deeply nested queries can take a long time to parse.
*   **Planning:**  Queries with many possible execution paths can overwhelm the planner.
*   **Execution:**  Retrieving a massive number of time series from storage is I/O-bound and can be slow.
*   **Evaluation:**  Complex aggregations on large datasets are CPU-bound.

### 2.3. API Endpoint Vulnerability

The primary API endpoints vulnerable to this threat are:

*   `/api/v1/query`:  For instant queries (returning a single data point at a specific time).
*   `/api/v1/query_range`:  For range queries (returning a series of data points over a time range).
*   `/api/v1/series`: Returns list of time series that match certain label sets. Can be abused to discover high cardinality series.
*   `/api/v1/labels`: Returns list of label names.
*   `/api/v1/label/<label_name>/values`: Returns list of label values for given label name.

These endpoints are all susceptible to malicious queries.  The `/api/v1/query` and `/api/v1/query_range` endpoints are the most direct targets, as they are used for executing PromQL queries. `/api/v1/series`, `/api/v1/labels` and `/api/v1/label/<label_name>/values` can be used for reconnaissance to craft even more devastating queries.

### 2.4. Mitigation Effectiveness and Recommendations

Let's analyze the proposed mitigations and provide recommendations:

*   **`--query.timeout` (Prometheus Configuration):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Good.  This is a *critical* first line of defense.  It prevents a single query from consuming resources indefinitely.
    *   **Recommendation:**  Set this to a reasonable value (e.g., 30s, 60s) based on your expected query complexity and performance requirements.  *Too short* a timeout will interrupt legitimate queries; *too long* a timeout will be ineffective against DoS.  Monitor for timeout errors to fine-tune this value.

*   **Query Limits (Reverse Proxy/Middleware):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Excellent.  This allows for fine-grained control over query complexity *before* the query reaches the Prometheus server.
    *   **Recommendation:**  Implement a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Envoy) or a custom middleware in front of the Prometheus API.  This proxy/middleware should:
        *   **Limit Query Length:**  Reject queries exceeding a maximum character length.
        *   **Limit Time Range:**  Reject queries with a time range exceeding a maximum duration.
        *   **Limit Cardinality (Advanced):**  This is more complex, but ideally, the proxy could analyze the query and estimate its cardinality (number of time series) *before* sending it to Prometheus.  This requires parsing the PromQL query.  There are libraries (e.g., `promql-parser` in Go) that can help with this.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of queries per client (IP address or API key) per time unit.  This prevents attackers from flooding the server with many smaller, but still harmful, queries. Use token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms.
        *   **Resource Quotas:**  Implement per-user or per-tenant resource quotas (CPU, memory, query time) if you have a multi-tenant Prometheus setup.

*   **Restrict Access (Authentication/Authorization):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Essential.  This prevents unauthorized users from accessing the Prometheus API at all.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   **Authentication:**  Implement authentication using a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx with HTTP Basic Auth, OAuth 2.0/OIDC) or a dedicated authentication service.  Prometheus itself does *not* have built-in authentication.
        *   **Authorization:**  Implement authorization to control which users/services can access which metrics or perform which types of queries.  This can be done using a policy engine (e.g., OPA - Open Policy Agent) integrated with the reverse proxy.  For example, you might allow only certain services to query high-cardinality metrics.

* **Additional Recommendations:**
    * **Monitoring and Alerting:** Set up alerts for:
        - High query latency.
        - Increased query timeouts.
        - High CPU/memory usage on the Prometheus server.
        - Increased error rates on the Prometheus API.
        - Rate limit exhaustion.
    * **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider using a WAF to filter out malicious traffic at the network edge.  A WAF can help block common attack patterns and provide an additional layer of defense.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your Prometheus deployment, including penetration testing, to identify and address vulnerabilities.
    * **Keep Prometheus Updated:** Regularly update Prometheus to the latest version to benefit from security patches and performance improvements.
    * **TSDB Configuration:** Tune the TSDB configuration (e.g., chunk size, retention period) to optimize performance and reduce the impact of long-range queries.
    * **Separate Read and Write Paths (Advanced):** For very large deployments, consider using a separate read replica of Prometheus for querying, while the main instance handles ingestion. This can improve query performance and resilience.
    * **Disable Unused API Endpoints:** If you are not using certain API endpoints (e.g., the admin endpoints), disable them to reduce the attack surface.
    * **Input Validation:** While PromQL parsing itself provides some level of input validation, consider adding additional validation at the reverse proxy level to reject obviously malformed queries before they reach the parser.

### 2.5. Conclusion
The "Denial of Service via Malicious Queries" threat against the Prometheus API is a serious concern. By combining query timeouts, request limits at reverse proxy, robust authentication/authorization, and proactive monitoring, the risk can be significantly mitigated. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are crucial for maintaining a secure and resilient Prometheus deployment. The most effective defense is a layered approach, combining multiple mitigation strategies to address different aspects of the threat.
