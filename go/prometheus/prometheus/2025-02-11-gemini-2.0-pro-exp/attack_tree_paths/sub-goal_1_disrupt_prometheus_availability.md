# Deep Analysis of Prometheus Attack Tree Path: Configuration Tampering

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**  To thoroughly analyze the attack path leading to disruption of Prometheus availability via configuration tampering, specifically focusing on unauthenticated access to the configuration and disabling alerting rules.  This analysis aims to identify vulnerabilities, assess risks, propose mitigation strategies, and improve the overall security posture of a Prometheus deployment.

**Scope:** This analysis focuses on the following attack tree path:

*   **Sub-Goal 1: Disrupt Prometheus Availability**
    *   **1.2 Configuration Tampering [HR][CN]**
        *   **1.2.1 Unauthenticated Access to Configuration [HR]**
        *   **1.2.2 Disable Alerting Rules [HR]**

The analysis will consider the Prometheus server itself, its configuration file (typically `prometheus.yml`), and the network environment in which it operates.  It *excludes* attacks targeting the underlying operating system, container runtime (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), or physical infrastructure, *except* where those directly contribute to the in-scope attack path.  We also exclude attacks that do not involve configuration tampering (e.g., DDoS, resource exhaustion *without* configuration changes).

**Methodology:**

1.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Identify potential weaknesses in the Prometheus deployment and configuration that could allow an attacker to achieve the sub-goals in the attack path. This includes examining default configurations, common misconfigurations, and known vulnerabilities.
2.  **Risk Assessment:**  Evaluate the likelihood and impact of each attack step, considering factors like attacker skill level, effort required, and detection difficulty.  We will use a qualitative risk assessment approach (High, Medium, Low).
3.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Propose specific, actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities and reduce the overall risk.  These will include preventative, detective, and responsive controls.
4.  **Threat Modeling:** Consider realistic attack scenarios and how an attacker might exploit the identified vulnerabilities.
5.  **Best Practices Review:** Compare the current (or hypothetical) Prometheus deployment against established security best practices for Prometheus and general system hardening.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

### Sub-Goal 1: Disrupt Prometheus Availability

This is the overarching goal of the attacker.  By disrupting Prometheus's availability, the attacker can blind the organization to critical system and application metrics, potentially masking other malicious activities or causing operational outages.

### 1.2 Configuration Tampering [HR][CN] (High Risk, Critical Node)

This node represents the attacker's ability to modify the Prometheus configuration file.  This is a *critical* node because it enables a wide range of subsequent attacks, including:

*   Disabling monitoring and alerting.
*   Modifying scrape targets to point to malicious endpoints.
*   Changing scrape intervals to overload the system or reduce monitoring effectiveness.
*   Injecting malicious configuration directives.

The `[HR]` and `[CN]` likely refer to "High Risk" and "Critical Node," respectively, which aligns with the assessment.

#### 1.2.1 Unauthenticated Access to Configuration [HR] (High Risk)

**Description:**  The attacker can access and modify the `prometheus.yml` file without needing to authenticate.  This is a fundamental security failure.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Misconfigured File Permissions:** The `prometheus.yml` file might have overly permissive file system permissions (e.g., world-readable or writable).  This is a common error on Linux/Unix systems.
*   **Exposed Configuration Management Interface:** If Prometheus is managed through a web interface or API (e.g., a custom dashboard or configuration management tool), that interface might be exposed without authentication or with weak default credentials.
*   **Network Exposure:** The Prometheus server might be directly accessible on a public network without any network-level access controls (firewall, security groups).
*   **Container Misconfiguration:** If running in a container (Docker, Kubernetes), the configuration file might be mounted as a volume with incorrect permissions or exposed through an insecure container configuration.
*   **Version Control System Exposure:** The configuration file might be accidentally committed to a public code repository (e.g., GitHub) without proper redaction of sensitive information.
* **Lack of Principle of Least Privilege:** The Prometheus process itself might be running with excessive privileges (e.g., as `root`), allowing any compromise of the process to immediately grant access to the configuration file.

**Risk Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:**  High (if misconfigured) / Low (if properly secured).  The likelihood depends heavily on the deployment environment and adherence to security best practices.  Default configurations are often insecure.
*   **Impact:** Very High.  Complete control over the configuration allows the attacker to disable monitoring, manipulate data, and potentially pivot to other systems.
*   **Effort:** Low.  If the file is accessible, modification is trivial.
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner.  Basic file system manipulation skills are sufficient.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (if misconfigured) / Hard (if properly secured).  Misconfigurations are easily detectable with basic security scans.  However, if the system is properly secured, detecting unauthorized access might require more sophisticated intrusion detection systems.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Preventative:**
    *   **Strict File Permissions:** Set the `prometheus.yml` file permissions to the most restrictive possible setting (e.g., `600` or `400` on Linux/Unix, owned by the Prometheus user).
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for any web interface or API used to manage Prometheus configuration.  Use strong, unique passwords and consider multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Prometheus server on a private network or within a secure network segment.  Use firewalls and security groups to restrict access to only authorized clients.
    *   **Secure Container Configuration:**  Use read-only mounts for the configuration file within containers.  Avoid exposing the configuration file directly.
    *   **Secrets Management:**  Store sensitive configuration values (e.g., API keys, passwords) in a secure secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets) and inject them into the configuration at runtime.  *Never* hardcode secrets in the `prometheus.yml` file.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Prometheus process with the minimum necessary privileges.  Create a dedicated user account for Prometheus and avoid running it as `root`.
    *   **Configuration Management Tools:** Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet, SaltStack) to enforce secure configurations and prevent manual, error-prone changes.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scans to identify and remediate misconfigurations.

*   **Detective:**
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Implement FIM to monitor the `prometheus.yml` file for unauthorized changes.  Tools like OSSEC, Tripwire, or AIDE can be used.
    *   **Audit Logging:**  Enable audit logging on the operating system and any relevant applications to track access to the configuration file.
    *   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Deploy an IDS to detect suspicious network activity and potential attempts to access the Prometheus server.

*   **Responsive:**
    *   **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop and maintain an incident response plan that includes procedures for handling unauthorized access to the Prometheus configuration.
    *   **Configuration Backup and Restore:**  Regularly back up the Prometheus configuration file to a secure location.  Ensure you have a process for quickly restoring a known-good configuration in case of tampering.

#### 1.2.2 Disable Alerting Rules [HR] (High Risk)

**Description:** The attacker modifies the Prometheus configuration to disable critical alerting rules. This prevents Prometheus from sending notifications about system issues, security events, or even the attacker's own actions.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Direct Modification of `prometheus.yml`:**  If the attacker has gained unauthenticated access to the configuration file (as described in 1.2.1), they can simply comment out or delete alerting rules.
*   **Exploitation of Configuration Management Vulnerabilities:** If a configuration management system is used, the attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in that system to push malicious configuration changes.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker might trick an administrator into disabling alerting rules, perhaps by claiming they are causing excessive noise or false positives.

**Risk Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:** High (if misconfigured) / Low (if properly secured).  The likelihood is directly tied to the success of 1.2.1.
*   **Impact:** High.  Disabling alerts can lead to significant delays in detecting and responding to incidents, potentially exacerbating the impact of other attacks.
*   **Effort:** Low.  Modifying the configuration file to disable alerts is a simple task.
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner.  Basic text editing skills are sufficient.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (if config auditing is in place) / Hard (if no auditing).  If FIM or configuration auditing is in place, changes to alerting rules will be detected.  Without auditing, detection is much more difficult.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Preventative:**  All the preventative measures listed for 1.2.1 apply here as well.  Preventing unauthorized access to the configuration file is the primary defense.
*   **Detective:**
    *   **Configuration Auditing:**  Implement a system to regularly audit the Prometheus configuration and compare it against a known-good baseline.  This can be done using configuration management tools, custom scripts, or specialized security tools.
    *   **Alert on Alerting Rule Changes:**  Configure Prometheus to alert on changes to its own alerting rules.  This can be achieved by creating a rule that monitors the `prometheus_rule_group_rules` metric and triggers an alert if the number of rules changes unexpectedly.  This is a crucial "canary" alert.
    *   **Regular Alert Testing:**  Periodically test alerting rules to ensure they are functioning correctly.  This can help detect if rules have been disabled or misconfigured.

*   **Responsive:**
    *   **Incident Response Plan:**  Include procedures for investigating and remediating disabled alerting rules in the incident response plan.
    *   **Configuration Rollback:**  Have a mechanism to quickly roll back to a previous, known-good configuration if alerting rules are found to be disabled.

## 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

The attack path analyzed presents a significant risk to any Prometheus deployment.  Unauthenticated access to the configuration file is a critical vulnerability that enables a wide range of attacks, including disabling alerting rules.  The primary mitigation strategy is to prevent unauthorized access through strict file permissions, authentication, network segmentation, and secure configuration management practices.  Robust detective controls, such as file integrity monitoring, configuration auditing, and alerting on alerting rule changes, are essential for detecting and responding to attacks.  A well-defined incident response plan is crucial for minimizing the impact of any successful attack.  Regular security audits and vulnerability scans should be conducted to proactively identify and address weaknesses. By implementing these recommendations, organizations can significantly improve the security posture of their Prometheus deployments and reduce the risk of disruption.
