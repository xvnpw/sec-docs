# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for prometheus/prometheus

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Metric Naming, Labeling Conventions, and Data Sanitization (with Prometheus Relabeling)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_metric_naming__labeling_conventions__and_data_sanitization__with_prometheus_relabeling_.md)

1.  **Define Naming Conventions:** (As before - this is a *precursor* to effective Prometheus configuration) Create a document outlining clear and consistent naming conventions for metrics and labels. Avoid sensitive information.
2.  **Develop Sanitization Functions:** (As before - application-level sanitization is still crucial) Create reusable functions to sanitize metric values *before* exposure.
3.  **Implement Sanitization in Exporters:** (As before) Integrate sanitization functions into your custom Prometheus exporters.
4.  **Code Reviews:** (As before) Enforce conventions and sanitization during code reviews.
5.  **Training:** (As before) Educate developers on secure metric handling.
6.  **Automated Checks (Optional):** (As before) Consider linters or static analysis.
7.  **Metric Relabeling (Prometheus - *This is the direct Prometheus part*):**
    *   Use `metric_relabel_configs` in your Prometheus configuration (`prometheus.yml`) to perform final sanitization and filtering *after* the application-level steps. This acts as a safety net.
    *   Use `source_labels` to select the labels to operate on (e.g., `[__name__, label1, label2]`).
    *   Use `regex` to define a regular expression that matches the sensitive data or unwanted metrics.
    *   Use `action` to specify what to do:
        *   `drop`:  Discard the entire metric if it matches the regex.  Use this for metrics that are inherently sensitive or high-cardinality.
        *   `replace`: Replace the matched portion of the label value with a replacement string (using `replacement`).  Use this for redaction.
        *   `labeldrop`: Remove a specific label.
        *   `labelmap`:  Rename labels based on a regex.
        *   `keepequal`: Keep only metrics where two source labels are equal.
        *   `dropequal`: Drop metrics where two source labels are equal.
    *   *Example:*
        ```yaml
        metric_relabel_configs:
          - source_labels: [__name__]
            regex: 'my_sensitive_metric.*'
            action: drop  # Drop metrics starting with "my_sensitive_metric"
          - source_labels: [label_with_pii]
            regex: '(.*)@(.*)'  # Match email addresses
            action: replace
            replacement: 'redacted'  # Replace with "redacted"
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information in Metrics:** (Severity: **High**)
    *   **Data Leakage:** (Severity: **High**)
    *   **Compliance Violations:** (Severity: **High**)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information in Metrics:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low** (with thorough implementation, including application-level *and* Prometheus-level sanitization).
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [ *Example: Basic naming conventions are documented. `metric_relabel_configs` are used to drop one specific high-cardinality metric.* ] **<-- Replace with your project's details**

*   **Missing Implementation:** [ *Example: Need comprehensive `metric_relabel_configs` to handle various types of sensitive data and potential high-cardinality issues. Need to review all existing metrics.* ] **<-- Replace with your project's details**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sample and Target Limits, and Cardinality Control (within Prometheus)](./mitigation_strategies/sample_and_target_limits__and_cardinality_control__within_prometheus_.md)

1.  **Sample Limits:**
    *   Configure `sample_limit` in the `scrape_configs` section of your `prometheus.yml`.
    *   Set a reasonable limit on the number of samples Prometheus will accept from each target per scrape.  This prevents a single target from overwhelming Prometheus with a massive number of data points.
    *   *Example:*
        ```yaml
        scrape_configs:
          - job_name: 'my-app'
            sample_limit: 10000  # Limit to 10,000 samples per scrape
        ```
2. **Target Limits:**
    *   Configure `target_limit` in the `scrape_configs` section of your `prometheus.yml`.
    *   Set a reasonable limit on the number of targets Prometheus will scrape per job.
    *   *Example:*
        ```yaml
        scrape_configs:
          - job_name: 'my-app'
            target_limit: 50
        ```
3.  **Cardinality Limits (using `metric_relabel_configs` and `relabel_configs`):**
    *   This is the *most crucial* part for preventing cardinality explosions.
    *   Use `relabel_configs` (applied *before* scraping) to modify labels *before* the scrape happens.  This is useful for dropping labels that are known to cause high cardinality.
    *   Use `metric_relabel_configs` (applied *after* scraping, but *before* ingestion) to drop or aggregate high-cardinality metrics.
    *   Identify metrics with a large number of unique label combinations.
    *   Use `regex` to match the problematic metrics or labels.
    *   Use `action: drop` to discard the entire metric.
    *   Use `action: replace` with aggregation functions (e.g., summing values) to reduce cardinality.
    *   *Example (Dropping a high-cardinality label):*
        ```yaml
        relabel_configs:
          - source_labels: [user_id]  # Assuming 'user_id' is a high-cardinality label
            action: labeldrop
        ```
    *   *Example (Dropping an entire high-cardinality metric):*
        ```yaml
        metric_relabel_configs:
          - source_labels: [__name__]
            regex: 'my_high_cardinality_metric.*'
            action: drop
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** (Severity: **High**)
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: **High**)
    *   **Performance Degradation:** (Severity: **Medium**)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [ *Example: `sample_limit` is set to a default value. No `relabel_configs` or `metric_relabel_configs` are used for cardinality control.* ] **<-- Replace with your project's details**

*   **Missing Implementation:** [ *Example: Need to analyze metrics for high cardinality and implement appropriate `relabel_configs` and `metric_relabel_configs` to drop or aggregate them. Need to set `target_limit`.*] **<-- Replace with your project's details**

## Mitigation Strategy: [TLS Encryption and Target Authentication (within Prometheus Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/tls_encryption_and_target_authentication__within_prometheus_configuration_.md)

1.  **TLS Encryption:**
    *   **Generate Certificates:** (As before - this is a prerequisite) Generate TLS certificates.
    *   **Configure Prometheus:**
        *   Set `scheme: https` in the `scrape_configs` for each target that requires TLS.
        *   Use the `tls_config` block within `scrape_configs` to specify the paths to the CA certificate (`ca_file`), client certificate (`cert_file`), and client key (`key_file`).
        *   *Example:*
            ```yaml
            scrape_configs:
              - job_name: 'my-secure-app'
                scheme: https
                tls_config:
                  ca_file: /path/to/ca.crt
                  cert_file: /path/to/client.crt
                  key_file: /path/to/client.key
            ```
2.  **Target Authentication:**
    *   **Choose an Authentication Method:** Select `bearer_token`, `basic_auth`, or `client_certs`.
    *   **Configure Prometheus:**
        *   Use the appropriate configuration option within `scrape_configs`:
            *   `bearer_token`: Provide the bearer token directly.
            *   `bearer_token_file`: Provide the path to a file containing the bearer token.
            *   `basic_auth`: Provide `username` and `password`.
            *   `client_certs`: (Already covered under TLS configuration - client certificates provide both encryption and authentication).
        *   *Example (Basic Auth):*
            ```yaml
            scrape_configs:
              - job_name: 'my-authenticated-app'
                basic_auth:
                  username: myuser
                  password: mypassword
            ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised Scrape Targets Returning Malicious Data:** (Severity: **Medium**)
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** (Severity: **High**)
    *   **Unauthorized Scraping:** (Severity: **Medium**)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised Scrape Targets Returning Malicious Data:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low-Medium**.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.
    *   **Unauthorized Scraping:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [ *Example: `scheme: https` is used for one target, but no TLS certificates are configured. No authentication is used.* ] **<-- Replace with your project's details**

*   **Missing Implementation:** [ *Example: Need to generate and configure TLS certificates for all targets using HTTPS. Need to implement `basic_auth` or `bearer_token` for all targets.* ] **<-- Replace with your project's details**
