# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for prometheus/prometheus

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Basic Authentication for Prometheus UI and API](./mitigation_strategies/implement_basic_authentication_for_prometheus_ui_and_api.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate Password File:** Use `htpasswd` utility (or similar) on the Prometheus server to create a password file. Command example: `htpasswd -c /etc/prometheus/users <username>`. Repeat for each authorized user.
    2.  **Edit Prometheus Configuration:** Open the Prometheus configuration file (`prometheus.yml`).
    3.  **Configure `basic_auth_users`:** Within the `web` section of the configuration, add the `basic_auth_users` block.
    4.  **Specify Users and Passwords:**  List usernames and their corresponding hashed passwords (obtained from the password file) under `basic_auth_users`. Example:

        ```yaml
        web:
          basic_auth_users:
            prometheus_user: $2y$10$xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx # Hashed password
            admin_user: $2y$10$yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy # Hashed password
        ```
    5.  **Restart Prometheus:** Restart the Prometheus service for the changes to take effect.
    6.  **Test Authentication:** Access the Prometheus UI or API in a browser or using `curl`. You should be prompted for credentials.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Prometheus UI (High Severity):** Prevents anyone without credentials from accessing the Prometheus web interface, viewing metrics, configurations, and potentially sensitive information exposed through dashboards.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Prometheus API (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from querying the Prometheus API, potentially gaining access to all collected metrics data, which could include sensitive operational details.
        *   **Data Exfiltration via UI/API (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers exfiltrating metrics data if they gain network access to the Prometheus instance, as they would need valid credentials.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Prometheus UI:** High risk reduction. Effectively blocks unauthorized access via the web interface by requiring authentication configured directly within Prometheus.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Prometheus API:** High risk reduction. Effectively blocks unauthorized access via the API by requiring authentication configured directly within Prometheus.
        *   **Data Exfiltration via UI/API:** Medium risk reduction. Makes data exfiltration significantly harder as authentication is enforced by Prometheus itself.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in the Staging Prometheus instance. Configuration is in `prometheus-staging.yml` under the `web` section, using a password file.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Not yet implemented in the Production Prometheus instance. Production Prometheus currently relies solely on network segmentation for access control, lacking authentication configured within Prometheus itself.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Metric Relabeling to Remove Sensitive Labels](./mitigation_strategies/implement_metric_relabeling_to_remove_sensitive_labels.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Labels:** Review the metrics being scraped by Prometheus and identify labels that might contain sensitive or unnecessary information.
    2.  **Edit Prometheus Configuration:** Open the Prometheus configuration file (`prometheus.yml`).
    3.  **Configure `metric_relabel_configs`:** Within the `scrape_config` for the relevant job(s), add the `metric_relabel_configs` section.
    4.  **Define Relabeling Rules:** Use relabeling actions like `drop`, `labeldrop`, or `labelmap` within `metric_relabel_configs` to remove or modify labels based on regular expressions or label names.
        *   `action: drop`: Drops the entire metric if conditions are met.
        *   `action: labeldrop`: Removes specific labels from metrics.
        *   `action: labelmap`: Renames labels, potentially masking sensitive names.
    5.  **Example Relabeling Rules:**

        ```yaml
        scrape_configs:
          - job_name: 'example-app'
            static_configs:
              - targets: ['example-app:8080']
            metric_relabel_configs:
              - source_labels: [__name__]
                regex: 'http_request_.*'
                action: labeldrop # Remove labels from http_request metrics
                  names: ['user_id', 'session_id'] # Drop labels named user_id and session_id
              - source_labels: [path]
                regex: '/sensitive/.*'
                action: drop # Drop metrics with paths starting with /sensitive/
        ```
    6.  **Restart Prometheus:** Restart Prometheus to apply the relabeling configuration.
    7.  **Verify Relabeling:** Query Prometheus to confirm that the sensitive labels are being removed or modified as configured.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Metrics (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents accidental or intentional exposure of sensitive information that might be included as metric labels and stored in Prometheus.
        *   **Information Disclosure through Metrics (Medium to High Severity):** Reduces the risk of information disclosure via Prometheus metrics to unauthorized users who might gain access to the Prometheus UI or API.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Metrics:** High risk reduction. Effectively removes sensitive labels from metrics *within Prometheus's storage*, preventing their persistence and potential exposure.
        *   **Information Disclosure through Metrics:** High risk reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of information disclosure through metrics *served by Prometheus* as sensitive labels are removed before storage and querying.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic relabeling is used in the Staging Prometheus instance (`prometheus-staging.yml`) to remove high-cardinality labels and some potentially revealing internal path information.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  A comprehensive review of metrics across all jobs is needed to identify all potentially sensitive labels.  More extensive `metric_relabel_configs` need to be implemented in both Staging and Production Prometheus configurations to sanitize metrics effectively *within Prometheus itself*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Prometheus](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_prometheus.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Prometheus Releases:** Regularly check the Prometheus GitHub repository (`https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases`) and the Prometheus community channels for new releases and security announcements.
    2.  **Establish Update Schedule:** Define a schedule for reviewing and applying Prometheus updates (e.g., monthly or after critical security releases).
    3.  **Test Updates in Staging:** Before updating Production Prometheus, thoroughly test new versions in the Staging environment to ensure compatibility, stability, and no regressions.
    4.  **Apply Updates to Production:**  Follow a documented procedure to update the Production Prometheus instance, ensuring minimal downtime.
    5.  **Verify Update:** After updating, verify the Prometheus version and functionality in both Staging and Production environments.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Prometheus (High Severity):** Protects against exploitation of publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities *within the Prometheus software itself*.  These vulnerabilities could potentially allow unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial of service.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Prometheus:** High risk reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known Prometheus vulnerabilities by ensuring the software is patched and up-to-date.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** We have a process for monitoring Prometheus releases and manually updating the Staging instance.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated update process for both Staging and Production Prometheus instances is missing.  Production updates are currently performed infrequently and manually.  Need to implement a more proactive and automated update strategy.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting for Scrape Requests (via `scrape_interval` and `scrape_timeout`)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_for_scrape_requests__via__scrape_interval__and__scrape_timeout__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `scrape_configs`:** Examine the `scrape_configs` in your `prometheus.yml` file.
    2.  **Adjust `scrape_interval`:** Increase the `scrape_interval` value in `scrape_configs` to reduce the frequency of scraping targets. A longer interval means Prometheus will scrape metrics less often, reducing load.
    3.  **Set `scrape_timeout`:** Configure `scrape_timeout` in `scrape_configs` to limit the maximum time Prometheus will wait for a scrape request to complete. Shorter timeouts can prevent Prometheus from being blocked by slow or unresponsive targets.
    4.  **Example Configuration:**

        ```yaml
        scrape_configs:
          - job_name: 'example-app'
            scrape_interval: 30s # Scrape every 30 seconds (increased from default)
            scrape_timeout: 10s  # Timeout after 10 seconds
            static_configs:
              - targets: ['example-app:8080']
        ```
    5.  **Monitor Prometheus Performance:** After adjusting these settings, monitor Prometheus resource usage (CPU, memory) and query performance to ensure it remains stable and responsive.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Prometheus (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of Prometheus being overwhelmed by excessive scrape requests, either accidentally (e.g., misconfigured exporters) or intentionally (DoS attack).
        *   **Resource Exhaustion on Prometheus (Medium Severity):** Prevents excessive scrape load from causing resource exhaustion (CPU, memory) on the Prometheus server, which could lead to performance degradation or instability.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Prometheus:** Medium risk reduction. Makes it harder to DoS Prometheus through scrape requests by limiting the frequency and duration of scrapes *configured within Prometheus*.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion on Prometheus:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the likelihood of resource exhaustion caused by scrape overload *managed by Prometheus's scrape settings*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Default `scrape_interval` and `scrape_timeout` are used in both Staging and Production Prometheus configurations.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  No specific tuning of `scrape_interval` or `scrape_timeout` has been performed to actively rate-limit scrape requests.  We should review the scrape intervals for all jobs and consider increasing them where appropriate to reduce load on Prometheus, especially for less critical metrics.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Optimize Prometheus Query Performance (Encourage Efficient PromQL)](./mitigation_strategies/optimize_prometheus_query_performance__encourage_efficient_promql_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **PromQL Training:** Provide training to users who write PromQL queries on best practices for writing efficient queries.
    2.  **Query Review:**  Establish a process for reviewing complex or potentially expensive PromQL queries before they are deployed in dashboards or alerts.
    3.  **Avoid High Cardinality Queries:** Educate users about the performance impact of high cardinality queries (queries that select or aggregate across a large number of series). Encourage them to filter and aggregate data effectively.
    4.  **Use Aggregation Functions:** Promote the use of PromQL aggregation functions (e.g., `sum`, `avg`, `rate`, `increase`) to reduce the amount of data processed by queries.
    5.  **Optimize Dashboard Queries:** Review dashboards and alerts for inefficient queries and optimize them.
    6.  **PromQL Linters/Analyzers (Future):** Explore and potentially integrate PromQL linters or analyzers (if available) to automatically detect and flag potentially inefficient queries.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Prometheus (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of Prometheus being overloaded by poorly written, computationally expensive PromQL queries, potentially leading to DoS.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion on Prometheus (Medium Severity):** Prevents resource exhaustion (CPU, memory) on the Prometheus server caused by inefficient queries, which can degrade performance for all users.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Prometheus:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the likelihood of DoS caused by query overload *through promoting efficient PromQL usage*.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion on Prometheus:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the likelihood of resource exhaustion caused by inefficient queries *by encouraging optimized query practices*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** No formal implementation. Best practices for PromQL are generally followed by experienced users, but no formal training or review process exists.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal PromQL training for users, a query review process for complex queries, and proactive optimization of dashboard and alert queries are missing.  Exploring PromQL linters/analyzers would be a future improvement.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Cardinality of Metrics (Mitigation within Prometheus Scope)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_cardinality_of_metrics__mitigation_within_prometheus_scope_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Metric Cardinality:** Analyze the cardinality of metrics stored in Prometheus. Identify metrics with excessively high cardinality (large number of unique label combinations). Prometheus UI and API can be used to inspect metric cardinality.
    2.  **Apply Relabeling for Cardinality Reduction:** Use `metric_relabel_configs` in `prometheus.yml` to reduce cardinality:
        *   **Drop High Cardinality Labels:** Use `labeldrop` to remove high-cardinality labels that are not essential for monitoring.
        *   **Replace High Cardinality Labels with Aggregated Labels:** Use `labelmap` and `replace` actions to replace high-cardinality labels with aggregated or bucketed labels.
        *   **Drop High Cardinality Metrics:** Use `drop` action to completely drop metrics that are inherently high cardinality and not essential.
    3.  **Example Cardinality Reduction Relabeling:**

        ```yaml
        scrape_configs:
          - job_name: 'example-app'
            static_configs:
              - targets: ['example-app:8080']
            metric_relabel_configs:
              - regex: 'request_id'
                action: labeldrop # Drop the high-cardinality 'request_id' label
              - source_labels: [http_status_code]
                regex: '(.*)'
                target_label: http_status_bucket
                replacement: '$1' # Keep status code, but rename label
                action: replace
        ```
    4.  **Monitor Cardinality Reduction:** After applying relabeling, monitor the cardinality of metrics in Prometheus to verify that the reduction is effective.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Prometheus (Medium Severity):** High cardinality metrics can significantly increase Prometheus resource usage and query times, potentially leading to DoS if cardinality becomes excessive. Limiting cardinality mitigates this risk.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion on Prometheus (Medium Severity):** High cardinality consumes significant storage, memory, and CPU resources in Prometheus. Reducing cardinality prevents resource exhaustion and improves performance.
        *   **Performance Degradation of Prometheus (Medium Severity):** High cardinality can slow down Prometheus query performance and overall responsiveness. Limiting cardinality improves performance.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Prometheus:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the risk of DoS caused by high cardinality metrics *through configuration within Prometheus*.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion on Prometheus:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the likelihood of resource exhaustion caused by high cardinality *managed by Prometheus's relabeling*.
        *   **Performance Degradation of Prometheus:** Medium risk reduction. Improves Prometheus performance by reducing the load from high cardinality metrics *through Prometheus-level configuration*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic relabeling is used in Staging to remove some high-cardinality labels, but no systematic cardinality analysis or reduction strategy is in place.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to perform a comprehensive cardinality analysis of metrics in both Staging and Production Prometheus.  Develop and implement relabeling rules in `prometheus.yml` to actively reduce cardinality for identified high-cardinality metrics.  This should be an ongoing monitoring and optimization process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Prometheus Configuration Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_prometheus_configuration_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Control Access to `prometheus.yml`:** Restrict access to the `prometheus.yml` configuration file and any related configuration files (e.g., password files, rule files) to only authorized personnel (e.g., operations team, security team). Use file system permissions to enforce access control.
    2.  **Version Control Configuration:** Store the `prometheus.yml` and related configuration files in a version control system (e.g., Git). This allows for tracking changes, auditing modifications, and rolling back to previous configurations if needed.
    3.  **Configuration Review Process:** Implement a review process for any changes to the Prometheus configuration before they are applied to Production. This can involve code reviews or approval workflows in the version control system.
    4.  **Secrets Management (for sensitive config):** Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys) directly in `prometheus.yml`. Use secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) to securely manage sensitive configuration data and inject them into Prometheus as environment variables or mounted volumes.
    5.  **Immutable Configuration (Infrastructure as Code):** Ideally, manage Prometheus configuration as code using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible). This promotes consistency, repeatability, and auditability of configuration changes.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure through Configuration (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing and viewing the Prometheus configuration, which might contain sensitive information or reveal system details.
        *   **Unauthorized Modification of Configuration (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from modifying the Prometheus configuration, which could lead to service disruption, data corruption, or security breaches.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Low to Medium Severity):** Secure configuration management practices can reduce the risk of supply chain attacks by ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the Prometheus configuration.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure through Configuration:** Medium risk reduction. Protects sensitive information potentially present in the configuration files by controlling access.
        *   **Unauthorized Modification of Configuration:** Medium to High risk reduction. Prevents unauthorized changes to Prometheus configuration through access control, version control, and review processes.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Low to Medium risk reduction. Improves configuration integrity and auditability, making it harder for malicious actors to tamper with the configuration unnoticed.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** `prometheus.yml` is stored in version control (Git). Basic file system permissions are in place on the Prometheus servers.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal configuration review process is not fully implemented. Secrets management is not consistently used for sensitive configuration data in `prometheus.yml`. Infrastructure-as-Code for Prometheus configuration is partially implemented but could be improved.
