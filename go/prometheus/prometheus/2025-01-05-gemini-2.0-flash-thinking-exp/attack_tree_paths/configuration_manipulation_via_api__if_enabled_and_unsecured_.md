## Deep Analysis: Configuration Manipulation via API (If Enabled and Unsecured) - Prometheus

This analysis delves into the attack path "Configuration Manipulation via API (If Enabled and Unsecured)" within the context of a Prometheus deployment. We will explore the technical details, potential impacts, mitigation strategies, and detection methods associated with this vulnerability.

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

This attack leverages the Prometheus HTTP API, specifically its endpoints that allow for modifying the server's configuration. The core vulnerability lies in the absence or inadequacy of security controls on these configuration endpoints. If an attacker can successfully authenticate (or if no authentication is required) to these endpoints, they gain the ability to fundamentally alter Prometheus's behavior.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

Prometheus offers various API endpoints for managing its configuration. While the specific endpoints available might vary slightly depending on the Prometheus version, key areas of concern include:

* **`/api/v1/status/config` (GET & Potentially PUT/POST in some versions/configurations):** This endpoint allows retrieval of the current Prometheus configuration. In certain configurations or older versions, it might also allow for updating the configuration. If write access is granted without proper authorization, an attacker can completely rewrite the `prometheus.yml` equivalent.
* **`/api/v1/status/flags` (GET & Potentially POST in some versions/configurations):** This endpoint displays the command-line flags Prometheus was started with. Similar to the config endpoint, some configurations might allow modification of these flags, potentially leading to significant changes in Prometheus's behavior.
* **`/api/v1/rules` (POST/DELETE):** While primarily for managing recording and alerting rules, unauthorized access could allow attackers to add malicious rules or delete critical ones.
* **Potentially other custom endpoints (if any):**  If custom extensions or integrations expose configuration-related endpoints, these could also be targets.

**How the Attack Works:**

1. **Discovery:** The attacker first needs to identify if the Prometheus API is exposed and accessible. This can be done through network scanning, reconnaissance of the application's architecture, or discovering exposed API documentation.
2. **Authentication Bypass (or Lack Thereof):** The crucial step is gaining access to the configuration endpoints. This could happen if:
    * **No Authentication is Enabled:** The easiest scenario for the attacker. The API is open to anyone who can reach it.
    * **Weak or Default Credentials:**  If basic authentication is used with default or easily guessable credentials.
    * **Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanism itself.
    * **Compromised Credentials:**  Using legitimate credentials obtained through other means (e.g., phishing, credential stuffing).
3. **Configuration Manipulation:** Once authenticated (or bypassing authentication), the attacker can leverage the configuration API endpoints to make malicious changes.

**Potential Impacts:**

The consequences of successful configuration manipulation can be severe and far-reaching:

* **Changing Scraping Configurations:**
    * **Targeting New Systems:**  Attackers can add new scrape targets, potentially including internal systems or sensitive infrastructure not intended for monitoring. This allows them to gather data about these systems.
    * **Redirecting Scraping:**  They could modify existing scrape configurations to point to attacker-controlled endpoints, diverting valuable monitoring data.
    * **Excluding Critical Targets:**  Removing or modifying scrape configurations for critical systems can blind administrators to issues and ongoing attacks.
* **Altering Alerting Rules:**
    * **Disabling Critical Alerts:**  Attackers can disable alerts that would normally trigger on malicious activity, allowing their actions to go unnoticed.
    * **Creating False Positives:**  Flooding administrators with false alerts can mask genuine security incidents and cause alert fatigue.
    * **Redirecting Alert Notifications:**  Modifying alert receivers to send notifications to attacker-controlled channels.
* **Disabling Monitoring Altogether:**  The most direct impact is disabling Prometheus entirely by removing all scrape targets or modifying core configurations to prevent data collection.
* **Modifying Global Configuration:**  Changing settings like storage parameters, retention policies, or even the remote write configuration can have significant long-term impacts on monitoring capabilities and data availability.
* **Introducing Malicious Rules:**  Adding recording rules that generate misleading metrics or alerting rules that trigger on legitimate activity can further obfuscate malicious actions.
* **Exfiltrating Configuration Data:** Even without write access, reading the configuration can reveal valuable information about the monitored infrastructure, network topology, and potential vulnerabilities.

**Prerequisites for Successful Exploitation:**

* **Prometheus API Enabled:** The HTTP API must be enabled in the Prometheus configuration. By default, it is usually enabled.
* **Configuration Endpoints Accessible:** The specific endpoints allowing configuration changes must be exposed and reachable by the attacker.
* **Lack of Proper Security Controls:**  This is the core vulnerability. The absence or inadequacy of authentication, authorization, and access control mechanisms on the configuration endpoints.

**Attack Steps (Detailed):**

1. **Identify Prometheus Instance:** Discover the target Prometheus instance's IP address and port.
2. **Enumerate API Endpoints:** Use tools or manual inspection to identify available API endpoints, focusing on those related to configuration (e.g., `/api/v1/status/config`, `/api/v1/rules`).
3. **Test Authentication:** Attempt to access configuration endpoints without credentials or with default/common credentials. If successful, the vulnerability is confirmed.
4. **Craft Malicious Configuration Changes:** Based on the desired impact, create the necessary changes to the configuration data (e.g., in YAML format for `prometheus.yml` or JSON for API calls).
5. **Send Malicious Requests:** Use tools like `curl`, `wget`, or custom scripts to send HTTP requests (PUT, POST, or DELETE depending on the endpoint) containing the malicious configuration data to the targeted API endpoints.
6. **Verify Changes:** Confirm that the configuration changes have been successfully applied by querying the `/api/v1/status/config` endpoint or observing the behavior of Prometheus.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Disable the API if Not Required:** The most effective mitigation if configuration changes are not routinely performed via the API.
* **Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization:**
    * **TLS Client Authentication:** Require clients to present valid certificates for authentication.
    * **API Keys:** Implement API key-based authentication, ensuring keys are securely generated, stored, and rotated.
    * **OAuth 2.0 or Similar:** Integrate with an identity provider for robust authentication and authorization.
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Implement granular permissions to restrict which users or applications can access and modify configuration endpoints.
* **Network Segmentation and Firewalls:**  Restrict access to the Prometheus API to only authorized networks or specific IP addresses.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to users and applications interacting with the API. Avoid granting blanket administrative access.
* **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate any data received through the API to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
* **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks on authentication mechanisms.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular audits of the Prometheus configuration and API security settings.
* **Stay Updated:**  Keep Prometheus updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements.
* **Secure Configuration Management:**  Manage Prometheus configuration securely, potentially using configuration management tools with version control and access control.

**Detection Methods:**

* **Monitoring API Access Logs:**  Analyze Prometheus API access logs for suspicious activity, such as:
    * Unauthenticated access attempts to configuration endpoints.
    * Access from unexpected IP addresses or user agents.
    * Frequent or unusual requests to configuration endpoints.
    * Changes in request patterns or data sizes.
* **Configuration Change Monitoring:** Implement monitoring of the Prometheus configuration file (`prometheus.yml`) for unauthorized modifications. Tools like `inotify` or configuration management systems can be used for this.
* **Alerting on Configuration Changes:**  Set up alerts that trigger when changes are detected in the Prometheus configuration.
* **Monitoring Prometheus Metrics:**  Track metrics related to configuration reloading and potential errors during the process.
* **Anomaly Detection:**  Employ anomaly detection techniques on API access patterns to identify unusual behavior.
* **Regular Configuration Reviews:** Periodically review the Prometheus configuration to ensure it aligns with intended settings and security policies.

**Complexity and Skill Level:**

Exploiting this vulnerability ranges in complexity depending on the security measures in place:

* **Low Complexity:** If the API is enabled without any authentication, the attack is straightforward and requires basic knowledge of HTTP requests.
* **Medium Complexity:** If basic authentication is used with weak or default credentials, the attacker might need to perform credential guessing or brute-force attacks.
* **High Complexity:** If strong authentication mechanisms are in place, the attacker would need to find and exploit vulnerabilities in the authentication process or compromise legitimate credentials.

**Real-World Relevance:**

This attack path is highly relevant and poses a significant risk in real-world deployments. Many organizations may overlook the security implications of the Prometheus API, especially in internal or development environments. The potential for widespread disruption and data compromise makes this a critical vulnerability to address.

**Conclusion:**

The "Configuration Manipulation via API (If Enabled and Unsecured)" attack path highlights a critical security weakness in Prometheus deployments. Failing to secure the API endpoints that control Prometheus's configuration can grant attackers significant control over the monitoring system, allowing them to disrupt operations, hide malicious activity, and potentially gain further access to the monitored infrastructure. Implementing robust authentication, authorization, and network security controls is paramount to mitigating this risk and ensuring the integrity and reliability of the Prometheus monitoring system. Development teams must prioritize securing the Prometheus API as a fundamental aspect of their cybersecurity strategy.
