# Threat Model Analysis for prometheus/prometheus

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Excessive Metric Endpoint Requests](./threats/denial_of_service_via_excessive_metric_endpoint_requests.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods Prometheus with requests to scrape numerous or computationally expensive metric endpoints. This can overwhelm the Prometheus server's resources (CPU, memory, network), leading to performance degradation or complete unavailability.
*   **Impact:** Monitoring outages, delayed or missed alerts, inability to query metrics for troubleshooting or analysis.
*   **Affected Component:** Prometheus scrape target handling, HTTP server.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on metric endpoints within Prometheus configuration (if feasible, though often managed at the exporter level).
    *   Carefully design exporter metrics to avoid excessive cardinality (while this is primarily an exporter concern, Prometheus suffers the impact).
    *   Configure scrape intervals appropriately within Prometheus.
    *   Monitor Prometheus server resource usage and set up alerts for resource exhaustion.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Prometheus API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_prometheus_api.md)

*   **Description:** If the Prometheus API is exposed without proper authentication and authorization, an attacker can query sensitive metric data, manipulate Prometheus configurations (if the relevant flags are enabled), or potentially cause denial of service through resource-intensive queries.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential configuration changes leading to monitoring disruption or security vulnerabilities, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Prometheus API, HTTP server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement authentication and authorization for the Prometheus API.** Options include basic authentication, OAuth 2.0, or integration with an identity provider.
    *   Restrict access to the Prometheus API to authorized users and applications only.
    *   Disable or restrict access to API endpoints that allow configuration changes if not strictly necessary.

## Threat: [PromQL Injection](./threats/promql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If user-supplied input is directly incorporated into PromQL queries without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious PromQL code. This could allow them to extract sensitive information beyond what they are authorized to see or cause denial of service by crafting resource-intensive queries.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Prometheus query engine, PromQL parser.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never directly incorporate user input into PromQL queries without proper sanitization and validation.**
    *   Use parameterized queries or a query builder library to construct PromQL queries safely.
    *   Implement strict input validation on any user-provided data used in queries.

## Threat: [Alert Tampering via Compromised Alertmanager Connection](./threats/alert_tampering_via_compromised_alertmanager_connection.md)

*   **Description:** If the connection between Prometheus and Alertmanager is compromised (e.g., using unencrypted HTTP), an attacker can intercept and modify alert notifications or prevent them from being sent.
*   **Impact:** Delayed or missed critical alerts, leading to delayed incident response and potential service disruptions.
*   **Affected Component:** Prometheus alerting functionality, remote write to Alertmanager.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Ensure secure communication (HTTPS) between Prometheus and Alertmanager.**
    *   Implement authentication and authorization for communication with Alertmanager.

## Threat: [Compromised Prometheus Configuration File](./threats/compromised_prometheus_configuration_file.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `prometheus.yml` configuration file. This allows them to reconfigure Prometheus to scrape malicious targets, expose sensitive data by changing remote write configurations, or disrupt monitoring by altering scrape configurations or alerting rules.
*   **Impact:**  Wide-ranging impact, including data breaches, monitoring outages, and potential for further system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Prometheus configuration loading and management.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure access to the Prometheus configuration file with strong file system permissions.**
    *   Store the configuration file securely and consider encrypting it at rest.
    *   Use version control for the configuration file to track changes and enable rollback.
    *   Implement configuration management practices and automate deployments.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Prometheus Server Host](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_prometheus_server_host.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the host machine running the Prometheus server. This provides them with broad capabilities, including accessing stored data, manipulating configurations, and potentially pivoting to other systems on the network.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the monitoring system and potential for further lateral movement within the infrastructure.
*   **Affected Component:** Entire Prometheus instance and underlying operating system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure the host running Prometheus with strong access controls, regular security patching, and a hardened operating system configuration.**
    *   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a compromised Prometheus server.
    *   Use intrusion detection and prevention systems to monitor for suspicious activity.
    *   Regularly audit the security of the Prometheus server host.
