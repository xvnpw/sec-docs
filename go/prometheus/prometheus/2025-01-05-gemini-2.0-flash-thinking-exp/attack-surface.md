# Attack Surface Analysis for prometheus/prometheus

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access to Metrics and API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access_to_metrics_and_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Prometheus, by default, does not enforce authentication or authorization on its `/metrics` endpoint and API.
    *   **How Prometheus Contributes:**  Prometheus's core function is to expose collected metrics via HTTP. Without configuration, this exposure is open to anyone who can reach the Prometheus instance.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the same network or with internet access to the Prometheus instance can directly query `/metrics` and obtain sensitive operational data about the application and infrastructure. They could also use API endpoints to query, manipulate, or delete data.
    *   **Impact:**  **High**
        *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposure of sensitive performance data, resource utilization, and potentially business-critical metrics.
        *   **Integrity Compromise:**  Manipulation or deletion of metrics data, leading to inaccurate monitoring and alerting.
        *   **Availability Disruption:**  Potential for DoS via API abuse or data deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement authentication and authorization using features like Basic Auth, OAuth 2.0 proxy, or mutual TLS.
        *   Restrict network access to the Prometheus instance using firewalls or network policies.
        *   Consider using a service mesh or internal network to limit access.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Metric Ingestion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_metric_ingestion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can send a large volume of metrics directly to Prometheus, potentially overwhelming its storage and processing capabilities.
    *   **How Prometheus Contributes:** Prometheus is designed to ingest time-series data. If not properly configured and protected, it can become a target for DoS attacks by flooding it with metrics.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could simulate numerous devices or applications sending a high volume of metrics with high cardinality (many unique label combinations), consuming significant resources and potentially crashing Prometheus.
    *   **Impact:** **High**
        *   **Availability Disruption:**  Prometheus becomes unresponsive, leading to a loss of monitoring and alerting capabilities.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  High CPU, memory, and disk usage can impact the performance of the host system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on metric ingestion.
        *   Configure limits on the number of time series and samples Prometheus can handle.
        *   Use remote write with buffering and backpressure mechanisms.
        *   Implement proper resource allocation and monitoring for the Prometheus instance.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information due to Unauthenticated Access](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_due_to_unauthenticated_access.md)

*   **Description:**  Because Prometheus defaults to no authentication, any sensitive information exposed by scrape targets becomes accessible to anyone who can reach the Prometheus instance.
    *   **How Prometheus Contributes:** Prometheus's lack of default authentication directly exposes the data it collects from exporters. While the exporter originates the data, Prometheus's configuration determines its accessibility.
    *   **Example:** An exporter inadvertently exposes database connection strings or API keys as metric labels. With unauthenticated access to Prometheus, an attacker can easily query and retrieve this sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** **High**
        *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposure of sensitive credentials or internal system information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement authentication and authorization for Prometheus.
        *   Carefully review the metrics exposed by all exporters and avoid including sensitive information.
        *   Secure the deployment and configuration of exporters independently.

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Configuration](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** If the configuration reload endpoint of Prometheus is accessible without proper authorization, attackers could modify Prometheus's operational parameters.
    *   **How Prometheus Contributes:** Prometheus allows for dynamic reloading of its configuration. If this endpoint is exposed and unprotected, it becomes a direct point of control over Prometheus's behavior.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could modify the `prometheus.yml` configuration to disable scraping targets, change alerting rules, or even point remote write to a malicious endpoint, all without needing any credentials by default.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**
        *   **Availability Disruption:** Disabling scraping leads to a complete loss of monitoring data.
        *   **Integrity Compromise:**  Altering alerting rules can mask real issues.
        *   **Confidentiality Breach:**  Pointing remote write to a malicious endpoint could leak sensitive metrics data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable the remote configuration reload endpoint if not strictly necessary.
        *   Implement authentication and authorization for the configuration reload endpoint.
        *   Secure the file system permissions for the `prometheus.yml` configuration file.
