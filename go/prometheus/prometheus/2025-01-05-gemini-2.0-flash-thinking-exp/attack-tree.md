## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized Access to Prometheus API](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_access_to_prometheus_api.md)

* Lack of Authentication/Authorization: If Prometheus API endpoints are exposed without any form of authentication or authorization, attackers can directly access them. This allows them to perform any action the API permits, such as reading metrics, modifying configurations (if enabled), or causing denial of service.
* Credential Theft: Attackers can steal valid credentials used to access the Prometheus API. This can be achieved through various means, including phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities in other systems, or finding exposed credentials in configuration files or code repositories. With valid credentials, attackers can bypass authentication and perform authorized actions maliciously.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exfiltration via API](./attack_tree_paths/data_exfiltration_via_api.md)

Once an attacker gains unauthorized access to the Prometheus API (through lack of authentication or stolen credentials), they can use API endpoints to extract potentially sensitive data collected by Prometheus. This data could include performance metrics, business metrics, or even information about the application's internal state, which could be valuable for further attacks or for competitive intelligence.

## Attack Tree Path: [Configuration Manipulation via API (If Enabled and Unsecured)](./attack_tree_paths/configuration_manipulation_via_api__if_enabled_and_unsecured_.md)

If the Prometheus API allows configuration changes and these endpoints are not properly secured, attackers can modify Prometheus's settings. This could involve changing scraping configurations to target new systems, altering alerting rules to hide malicious activity, or even disabling monitoring altogether.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Prometheus Itself](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_prometheus_itself.md)

* Known CVEs in Prometheus: Like any software, Prometheus can have security vulnerabilities. Publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) have readily available exploit code, making them relatively easy to exploit for attackers with basic skills. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution, allowing complete control over the Prometheus instance and potentially the underlying infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Host/Container Running Prometheus](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_hostcontainer_running_prometheus.md)

This path involves directly attacking the server or container where Prometheus is running. This can be achieved through:
    * Exploiting OS Vulnerabilities: If the operating system of the host machine has unpatched vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them to gain access.
    * Container Escape: In containerized deployments, attackers might try to escape the container to access the host system and gain control over Prometheus.
    * Weak Access Controls: Weak or default passwords, open ports, or misconfigured firewalls can provide attackers with entry points to the host or container.

## Attack Tree Path: [Credential Theft for Prometheus Access](./attack_tree_paths/credential_theft_for_prometheus_access.md)

This involves stealing credentials that grant access to the Prometheus server or its underlying infrastructure. This can include:
    * Weak Passwords: If Prometheus or the underlying system uses weak or default passwords, they can be easily cracked through brute-force attacks.
    * Exposed Credentials in Configuration: Sensitive credentials might be accidentally stored in configuration files, environment variables, or code repositories, making them accessible to attackers.
    * Lateral Movement from Other Compromised Systems: If other systems in the network are compromised, attackers might use those as a stepping stone to access the Prometheus server by stealing stored credentials or leveraging existing access.

## Attack Tree Path: [API Abuse](./attack_tree_paths/api_abuse.md)

The "API Abuse" node is critical because it represents a central point where various malicious actions can be initiated if the Prometheus API is not properly secured. Successful exploitation of this node can lead to data breaches, configuration manipulation, and denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Prometheus Infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_prometheus_infrastructure.md)

The "Compromise Prometheus Infrastructure" node is critical because it signifies a fundamental breach of the environment where Prometheus operates. If an attacker gains access to the underlying infrastructure, they have a wide range of options for further exploitation, including directly accessing the Prometheus instance, its data, and potentially pivoting to other systems within the network. This level of access bypasses many application-level security controls.
