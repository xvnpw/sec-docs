## Deep Dive Analysis: Denial of Service (DoS) via Metric Ingestion on Prometheus

This analysis provides a detailed examination of the "Denial of Service (DoS) via Metric Ingestion" attack surface for an application utilizing Prometheus. We will delve into the technical aspects, potential attack vectors, impact, and mitigation strategies, offering actionable insights for the development team.

**1. Deeper Dive into the Attack Mechanism:**

The core vulnerability lies in Prometheus's fundamental design: accepting and processing time-series data. While this is its strength, it also creates an avenue for abuse. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability aims to overwhelm Prometheus with a volume of metrics exceeding its processing and storage capacity.

**Key Technical Aspects:**

* **Ingestion Endpoint:** Prometheus exposes an `/api/v1/write` endpoint (or similar, depending on configuration and remote write setup) that accepts metric data in various formats (e.g., Protocol Buffers, text-based exposition format). This endpoint is the primary target for the attack.
* **Time Series Data Structure:** Each metric is identified by a metric name and a set of key-value labels. The combination of the metric name and label set defines a unique time series.
* **Cardinality:** High cardinality refers to a large number of unique time series. Attackers often exploit this by sending metrics with rapidly changing or unique labels, causing Prometheus to create a vast number of new time series. This strains memory and disk I/O.
* **Sample Rate:** The frequency at which metrics are sent also contributes to the load. A high sample rate for a large number of time series can quickly overwhelm the ingestion pipeline.
* **Storage Engine (TSDB):** Prometheus stores data in a custom time-series database (TSDB). Ingesting and indexing a massive influx of data can lead to write amplification and disk I/O bottlenecks.
* **Query Engine:** While the direct attack targets ingestion, a struggling Prometheus under DoS will also impact its ability to respond to queries, further disrupting monitoring and alerting.

**2. Elaborating on How Prometheus Contributes:**

Prometheus's architecture, while efficient for normal operation, has inherent characteristics that make it susceptible to this type of DoS:

* **Open Ingestion Endpoint:** By design, Prometheus needs to accept metrics from various exporters and push gateways. This necessitates an open endpoint, which can be targeted.
* **Dynamic Time Series Creation:** Prometheus automatically creates new time series when it encounters new metric names or label combinations. This flexibility is powerful but can be exploited by sending metrics with arbitrary labels.
* **Limited Built-in Protection:** While Prometheus offers configuration options for limiting resource usage, it doesn't have robust, out-of-the-box DoS protection mechanisms like sophisticated rate limiting or anomaly detection on ingestion.

**3. Detailed Attack Scenarios and Examples:**

Beyond the basic example, let's consider more specific attack scenarios:

* **Spoofed Exporters:** An attacker could simulate numerous legitimate exporters, each sending a moderate but still significant volume of metrics. This can be harder to detect initially compared to a single source flooding the system.
* **High Cardinality Attack:** The attacker sends metrics with rapidly changing labels (e.g., a unique session ID or timestamp in a label). This forces Prometheus to create an enormous number of unique time series, rapidly consuming memory and disk space. Example: `http_requests_total{user_session="unique_id_123"}` where `unique_id` changes with every metric.
* **High Sample Rate Attack:**  The attacker sends a large number of metrics for existing time series at an extremely high frequency. This can overwhelm the ingestion pipeline and CPU resources.
* **Combined Attack:**  A combination of high cardinality and high sample rate can be particularly devastating.
* **Exploiting Push Gateway:** If a Push Gateway is used, an attacker could flood the Push Gateway, which in turn overwhelms Prometheus when it scrapes the gateway.

**4. Impact Assessment - Deeper Dive:**

The "High" impact rating is accurate. Let's elaborate on the consequences:

* **Availability Disruption (Critical):**
    * **Monitoring Blind Spot:** The primary function of Prometheus – monitoring – is completely lost. This means critical issues within the monitored applications and infrastructure may go unnoticed, potentially leading to cascading failures or security breaches.
    * **Alerting Failure:**  Alerts based on Prometheus data will cease to function, leaving operations teams unaware of critical problems.
    * **Dependent Systems Impact:** Applications and dashboards relying on Prometheus data will become unavailable or display stale information, impacting observability and troubleshooting efforts.
* **Resource Exhaustion (Severe):**
    * **CPU Saturation:**  Processing a large volume of metrics, especially with high cardinality, consumes significant CPU resources. This can impact other processes running on the same host.
    * **Memory Pressure:**  Storing and indexing a large number of time series demands substantial memory. Excessive memory usage can lead to swapping, further degrading performance, or even out-of-memory errors, causing Prometheus to crash.
    * **Disk I/O Bottleneck:**  Writing a large volume of data to disk can saturate the disk I/O, slowing down Prometheus and potentially affecting other applications sharing the same storage.
    * **Disk Space Exhaustion:**  Uncontrolled metric ingestion can rapidly fill up the available disk space, leading to data loss and system instability.
* **Operational Overhead:**
    * **Recovery Efforts:**  Recovering from a DoS attack can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring manual intervention to clear data, restart services, and investigate the attack.
    * **Reputational Damage:**  If the system being monitored by Prometheus experiences outages due to the DoS attack, it can lead to reputational damage and loss of customer trust.

**5. Detailed Analysis of Mitigation Strategies:**

Let's expand on the suggested mitigation strategies with more technical detail:

* **Implement Rate Limiting on Metric Ingestion:**
    * **Mechanism:**  Limit the number of metrics accepted per unit of time from specific sources or in total.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **Reverse Proxy:** Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) in front of Prometheus to implement connection limits, request rate limiting, and potentially even inspect request payloads for anomalies.
        * **Prometheus Configuration (Limited):** While Prometheus doesn't have built-in granular rate limiting per source, you can configure limits on the number of samples accepted per write request (`--web.max-request-size`). This offers some basic protection but isn't as flexible as external solutions.
        * **Network Firewalls:**  Implement firewall rules to restrict access to the Prometheus ingestion endpoint to known and trusted sources.
    * **Considerations:**  Carefully configure the rate limits to avoid blocking legitimate traffic. Monitoring the rate limiting effectiveness is crucial.

* **Configure Limits on the Number of Time Series and Samples Prometheus Can Handle:**
    * **Mechanism:**  Set hard limits on the resources Prometheus can consume.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **`--storage.tsdb.max-samples-per-send`:** Limits the number of samples in a single remote write request.
        * **`--storage.tsdb.no-lockfile`:**  While not directly a limit, disabling the lock file can sometimes improve performance under heavy load, but it has implications for data consistency in case of crashes. Use with caution.
        * **Resource Limits (OS Level):** Utilize operating system-level resource limits (e.g., `ulimit` on Linux) to restrict the resources available to the Prometheus process. This provides a last line of defense against runaway resource consumption.
    * **Considerations:**  Setting these limits too low can impact the ability to monitor legitimate metrics. Regularly review and adjust these limits based on monitoring needs and resource availability.

* **Use Remote Write with Buffering and Backpressure Mechanisms:**
    * **Mechanism:**  Offload metric ingestion to intermediary components that can handle temporary spikes in traffic and provide backpressure to prevent overwhelming Prometheus.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **Prometheus Agent (e.g., `prometheus/client_golang` with remote write):**  Exporters can be configured to buffer metrics and retry sending if the remote write endpoint is unavailable or overloaded.
        * **Message Queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ):**  Exporters can send metrics to a message queue, which acts as a buffer. A dedicated service can then consume from the queue and forward metrics to Prometheus at a manageable rate.
        * **Dedicated Remote Write Receivers (e.g., Thanos Receive, Mimir):** These solutions are designed to handle high-volume metric ingestion and provide features like deduplication, downsampling, and horizontal scaling.
    * **Considerations:**  Introducing additional components adds complexity to the architecture. Ensure proper configuration and monitoring of these intermediary systems.

* **Implement Proper Resource Allocation and Monitoring for the Prometheus Instance:**
    * **Mechanism:**  Ensure Prometheus has sufficient resources to handle expected load and monitor its resource usage to detect anomalies.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **Adequate Hardware:** Provision sufficient CPU, memory, and disk I/O based on the anticipated metric volume and cardinality.
        * **Resource Monitoring:**  Monitor Prometheus's own metrics (e.g., `prometheus_tsdb_head_samples_appended_total`, `process_cpu_seconds_total`, `process_resident_memory_bytes`) to track resource consumption and identify potential bottlenecks. Use tools like Grafana to visualize these metrics.
        * **Alerting on Resource Usage:**  Set up alerts to notify operations teams when Prometheus's resource usage exceeds predefined thresholds, allowing for proactive intervention.
        * **Regular Capacity Planning:**  Periodically assess the growth of metric volume and cardinality and adjust resource allocation accordingly.

**6. Additional Mitigation and Prevention Strategies:**

Beyond the provided list, consider these crucial aspects:

* **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure the Prometheus ingestion endpoint with authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized metric submissions. This could involve API keys, mutual TLS, or integration with an identity provider.
* **Input Validation:** While difficult to implement perfectly for arbitrary metrics, consider mechanisms to validate the structure and basic sanity of incoming metrics to prevent malformed data from causing issues.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection on incoming metric streams to identify unusual patterns that might indicate a DoS attack. This could involve analyzing the rate of new time series, the overall ingestion rate, or the characteristics of label values.
* **Rate Limiting at the Source:** Encourage or enforce rate limiting at the source of metric generation (e.g., within exporters or applications) to prevent them from overwhelming Prometheus in the first place.
* **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Prometheus instance within a secure network segment to limit exposure to potential attackers.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Prometheus configuration and infrastructure to identify potential vulnerabilities.

**7. Detection and Monitoring During an Attack:**

Even with preventative measures, detecting an ongoing DoS attack is crucial for timely response:

* **Increased Ingestion Rate:** Monitor metrics like `prometheus_remote_storage_sent_bytes_total` or `prometheus_http_requests_total` for the `/api/v1/write` endpoint. A sudden and significant spike indicates a potential attack.
* **High Cardinality Indicators:** Look for rapid increases in metrics like `prometheus_tsdb_head_series`, `prometheus_tsdb_reloads_total`, and `prometheus_tsdb_symbol_table_size_bytes`.
* **Resource Saturation:** Observe Prometheus's resource usage metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O). Sustained high utilization is a key indicator.
* **Error Logs:** Examine Prometheus's logs for errors related to ingestion failures, out-of-memory conditions, or disk write errors.
* **Alerting System Failures:** If the alerting system itself starts failing due to Prometheus being overloaded, this is a strong sign of a DoS attack.
* **Network Traffic Analysis:** Analyze network traffic to the Prometheus instance for unusual patterns, such as a large number of connections from a single source or a sudden surge in bandwidth usage.

**8. Conclusion:**

The "Denial of Service (DoS) via Metric Ingestion" attack surface presents a significant risk to applications relying on Prometheus for monitoring and alerting. A multi-layered approach combining rate limiting, resource management, remote write strategies, security best practices, and robust monitoring is essential for mitigating this risk. By understanding the technical details of the attack and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly improve the resilience and availability of their monitoring infrastructure. Continuous monitoring and proactive security measures are crucial for defending against this type of attack.
