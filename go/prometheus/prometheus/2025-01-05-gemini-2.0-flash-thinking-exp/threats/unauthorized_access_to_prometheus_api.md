## Deep Analysis: Unauthorized Access to Prometheus API

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Unauthorized Access to Prometheus API" threat, identified within the threat model for an application utilizing Prometheus. This analysis aims to provide the development team with a comprehensive understanding of the threat, its potential impact, and detailed mitigation strategies.

**1. Threat Deep Dive:**

The core of this threat lies in the inherent exposure of the Prometheus HTTP API. By default, Prometheus listens on a specified port (typically 9090) and serves its API without any built-in authentication or authorization mechanisms. This design choice prioritizes ease of initial setup and data collection within trusted environments. However, when deployed in less secure or shared environments, this open API becomes a significant vulnerability.

**Understanding the Exposed API:**

The Prometheus API offers a wide range of functionalities, categorized into:

* **Querying Metrics:** This allows retrieval of time-series data collected by Prometheus. Attackers can leverage this to gain insights into system performance, application behavior, and potentially sensitive business metrics being monitored.
* **Service Discovery:**  Endpoints like `/service-discovery` can reveal the targets Prometheus is scraping, potentially exposing the infrastructure landscape.
* **Target Management:**  Endpoints related to targets can reveal information about the systems being monitored.
* **Rule Management:**  While often requiring specific flags to be enabled, endpoints for managing recording and alerting rules could be abused to disrupt monitoring or trigger false alarms.
* **Admin & TSDB Operations:**  Endpoints like `/api/v1/status/config`, `/api/v1/admin/tsdb/clean_tombstones`, and others, if enabled, allow for configuration changes, data manipulation, and even potential denial-of-service attacks by overloading the database.
* **Remote Write:** If remote write is enabled and exposed without authentication, attackers could inject malicious or misleading metrics into the system, potentially skewing monitoring data and triggering false alerts or masking real issues.

**Why is this a Critical Threat?**

The "Critical" severity assigned to this threat is justified due to the potential for significant damage across multiple dimensions:

* **Information Disclosure:**  Exposed metrics can reveal sensitive information about application performance, resource utilization, business KPIs, and even security-related metrics. This data can be used for competitive advantage, extortion, or planning further attacks.
* **Monitoring Disruption:**  Manipulating configuration or injecting false data can lead to inaccurate monitoring, making it difficult to detect real issues and potentially delaying critical responses.
* **Security Vulnerabilities:**  Configuration changes could introduce vulnerabilities, such as altering scrape configurations to target internal services or injecting malicious targets.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Resource-intensive queries can overload the Prometheus server, making it unavailable for legitimate users and potentially impacting the monitoring of critical systems. Manipulation of TSDB operations could also lead to data corruption or instability.

**2. Attack Vectors:**

An attacker can exploit the lack of authentication through various attack vectors:

* **Direct Network Access:** If the Prometheus instance is directly exposed to the internet or an untrusted network without firewall restrictions, attackers can directly access the API.
* **Internal Network Compromise:** An attacker who has gained access to the internal network can easily discover and access the Prometheus API if it's not properly secured.
* **Lateral Movement:**  An attacker who has compromised another system within the network can use that foothold to access the Prometheus API.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:**  If the application is deployed with a vulnerable or misconfigured Prometheus instance (e.g., in a container image), this vulnerability can be inherited.
* **Social Engineering:**  While less direct, attackers could potentially trick authorized users into revealing information about the Prometheus instance's location or configuration.

**3. Detailed Impact Analysis:**

Expanding on the initial impact assessment:

* **Information Disclosure (High Impact):**
    * **Business Metrics:** Revenue, user activity, conversion rates, etc.
    * **System Performance:** CPU usage, memory utilization, network traffic, disk I/O.
    * **Application Behavior:** Request latency, error rates, transaction counts.
    * **Security Metrics:** Failed login attempts, firewall events (if monitored).
    * **Infrastructure Details:**  Exposed targets reveal the systems being monitored.
* **Potential Configuration Changes Leading to Monitoring Disruption or Security Vulnerabilities (High Impact):**
    * **Altering scrape configurations:**  Attackers could stop monitoring critical services or introduce malicious targets.
    * **Modifying recording rules:**  Attackers could suppress alerts or create misleading metrics.
    * **Manipulating alerting rules:**  Attackers could disable critical alerts or flood administrators with false positives.
    * **Adding malicious remote write endpoints:**  Attackers could inject fabricated metrics to mask real issues or trigger false alarms in downstream systems.
* **Denial of Service (High Impact):**
    * **Resource-intensive queries:**  Attackers can craft queries that consume significant CPU, memory, and disk I/O, making Prometheus unresponsive.
    * **Repeated API calls:**  Flooding the API with requests can overwhelm the server.
    * **TSDB manipulation (if enabled):**  Actions like `clean_tombstones` or other administrative functions, if abused, could lead to data corruption or performance degradation.

**4. Detailed Mitigation Strategies and Implementation Considerations:**

The provided mitigation strategies are crucial. Let's delve deeper into their implementation:

* **Implement Authentication and Authorization for the Prometheus API:**
    * **Basic Authentication:**  Simple to implement but less secure as credentials are transmitted in base64 encoding. Suitable for internal, less critical deployments. Requires configuring the `--web.enable-lifecycle` flag and setting `--web.auth-users` and `--web.auth-passwords` flags.
    * **TLS Client Certificates:**  More secure as it relies on cryptographic certificates for authentication. Requires generating and distributing certificates. Configured using the `--web.client-ca-file` flag.
    * **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect:**  The most robust approach for complex environments. Requires integrating Prometheus with an identity provider (IdP) like Keycloak, Okta, or Azure AD. This often involves using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Traefik with an authentication plugin (e.g., `oauth2_proxy`).
    * **Considerations:**
        * **Complexity:** OAuth 2.0/OIDC requires more setup and configuration.
        * **Performance:** Authentication adds overhead to API requests.
        * **Credential Management:** Securely storing and managing credentials for Basic Authentication is critical.
        * **Integration:**  Ensure seamless integration with existing identity management systems.

* **Restrict Access to the Prometheus API to Authorized Users and Applications Only:**
    * **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Prometheus instance within a private network segment and use firewalls to restrict access to only necessary hosts and ports.
    * **Reverse Proxy with Access Control:**  Utilize a reverse proxy (Nginx, HAProxy, Traefik) to act as a gateway to the Prometheus API. The reverse proxy can handle authentication and authorization before forwarding requests to Prometheus.
    * **Considerations:**
        * **Network Architecture:** Requires careful planning of network segmentation.
        * **Firewall Rules:**  Properly configure firewall rules to allow only authorized traffic.
        * **Reverse Proxy Configuration:**  Ensure the reverse proxy is correctly configured for authentication and authorization.

* **Disable or Restrict Access to API Endpoints that Allow Configuration Changes if Not Strictly Necessary:**
    * **Disable `--web.enable-lifecycle`:** This flag enables endpoints that allow for configuration reloading, shutting down Prometheus, and other potentially dangerous actions. **Disable this in production environments.**
    * **Restrict access to `/api/v1/admin/*` endpoints:** These endpoints allow for direct manipulation of the time-series database. Restrict access to these endpoints using authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    * **Considerations:**
        * **Operational Impact:** Disabling certain endpoints might limit operational flexibility. Carefully evaluate the necessity of these endpoints.
        * **Granular Control:**  Explore options for more granular control over API endpoint access if full disabling is not feasible.

**5. Detection and Monitoring:**

Even with mitigation strategies in place, continuous monitoring is essential to detect potential attacks:

* **Monitor Authentication Logs:** Track failed login attempts to the Prometheus API. Unusual patterns could indicate brute-force attacks.
* **Analyze API Access Logs:**  Examine the Prometheus access logs (if enabled) or reverse proxy logs for unusual request patterns, access to sensitive endpoints, or requests from unauthorized sources.
* **Monitor Prometheus Metrics:**  Track metrics related to API request rates, error rates, and resource utilization. Spikes or anomalies could indicate malicious activity.
* **Implement Alerting:**  Set up alerts for suspicious activity, such as repeated failed authentication attempts or access to restricted endpoints from unexpected sources.

**6. Prevention Best Practices:**

Beyond the specific mitigation strategies, consider these broader security practices:

* **Secure Defaults:**  Ensure that Prometheus is deployed with secure default configurations.
* **Regular Updates:**  Keep Prometheus updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the Prometheus deployment and its integration with the application.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to users and applications accessing the Prometheus API.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**  Use IaC tools to manage the deployment and configuration of Prometheus, ensuring consistency and security.
* **Security Awareness Training:**  Educate development and operations teams about the risks associated with insecure Prometheus deployments.

**7. Conclusion:**

Unauthorized access to the Prometheus API poses a significant and critical threat to the application. Implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, coupled with network segmentation and careful configuration management, is paramount. Continuous monitoring and adherence to security best practices are essential for detecting and preventing potential attacks. By proactively addressing this threat, the development team can significantly enhance the security posture of the application and protect sensitive data and monitoring infrastructure.
