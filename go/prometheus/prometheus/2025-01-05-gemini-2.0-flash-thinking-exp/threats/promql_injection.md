**To:** Development Team

**From:** Cybersecurity Expert

**Date:** October 26, 2023

This document provides a deep analysis of the PromQL Injection threat identified in our application's threat model, specifically focusing on its implications for our Prometheus integration (using the `prometheus/prometheus` library). Understanding the nuances of this threat is crucial for building a secure and resilient monitoring system.

**1. Executive Summary:**

PromQL Injection poses a significant risk to our application's security and stability. By manipulating user-supplied input that is directly incorporated into PromQL queries, attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive metrics, disrupt monitoring services, and even impact the underlying system's performance. This analysis will delve into the technical details of this threat, explore potential attack vectors, and reinforce the importance of the recommended mitigation strategies.

**2. Threat Deep Dive: PromQL Injection**

PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) is a powerful and expressive language used to query time-series data stored in Prometheus. Its flexibility, while a strength for legitimate users, can become a vulnerability if not handled carefully when dealing with external input.

**The Core Problem:** The vulnerability arises when user-controlled data is directly concatenated or interpolated into PromQL queries without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PromQL syntax, effectively hijacking the intended query and executing their own malicious commands.

**Why is this dangerous in the context of Prometheus?**

* **Access to Sensitive Data:** Prometheus often stores a wide range of metrics, potentially including sensitive information about application performance, infrastructure health, and even business-related data. A successful injection could allow attackers to extract metrics they are not authorized to see, revealing confidential details about our systems and operations.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can craft resource-intensive PromQL queries designed to overload the Prometheus server. This can lead to:
    * **High CPU and Memory Usage:** Queries involving complex aggregations, large time ranges, or cross-joins can consume significant resources, potentially bringing the Prometheus server down or impacting its performance for legitimate queries.
    * **Disk I/O Overload:**  Queries that scan large amounts of data can strain the disk I/O subsystem, further contributing to performance degradation.
* **Potential for Indirect System Impact:** While PromQL itself doesn't directly execute system commands, the information gained through injection could be used to inform further attacks on other parts of the system. For example, identifying performance bottlenecks could help an attacker target those areas.

**3. Affected Components in Detail:**

* **Prometheus Query Engine:** This is the core component responsible for parsing and executing PromQL queries. It's the primary target of PromQL injection attacks. When unsanitized user input is fed into the query engine, it interprets the injected code as legitimate PromQL.
* **PromQL Parser:** The parser is responsible for understanding the syntax of the PromQL query. A vulnerability here lies in its inability to distinguish between legitimate and injected code when user input is directly embedded.

**4. Detailed Analysis of Attack Vectors:**

Let's explore specific ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability:

* **Simple Metric Name Manipulation:** If user input is used to specify a metric name, an attacker could inject a different metric name they are not authorized to access.
    * **Example (Vulnerable):** `query=up{instance="$user_provided_instance"}`
    * **Injected Input:**  `" or on() vector(1) == vector(1)`
    * **Resulting Query:** `query=up{instance="" or on() vector(1) == vector(1)}` - This might lead to unexpected results or errors, potentially revealing information about the system.
* **Label Filtering Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate label filters to access data outside their intended scope.
    * **Example (Vulnerable):** `query=rate(http_requests_total{job="$user_provided_job"}[5m])`
    * **Injected Input:** `" or job!="my-application"`
    * **Resulting Query:** `query=rate(http_requests_total{job="" or job!="my-application"}[5m])` - This could return data for all jobs, not just the intended one.
* **Aggregation Function Abuse:**  Injecting malicious aggregation functions can lead to resource exhaustion.
    * **Example (Vulnerable):** `query=sum by ($user_provided_grouping_label) (cpu_usage_seconds_total)`
    * **Injected Input:** `label1,label2,label3,label4,label5,label6,label7,label8,label9,label10` (many distinct labels)
    * **Resulting Query:** `query=sum by (label1,label2,label3,label4,label5,label6,label7,label8,label9,label10) (cpu_usage_seconds_total)` - Aggregating by a large number of distinct labels can create a massive number of time series, consuming significant resources.
* **Time Range Manipulation:**  If user input controls the time range of a query, attackers could request data for excessively long periods.
    * **Example (Vulnerable):** `query=rate(http_requests_total[${user_provided_duration}])`
    * **Injected Input:** `1y` (one year)
    * **Resulting Query:** `query=rate(http_requests_total[1y])` - Querying over a very long time range can be resource-intensive.
* **Subquery Injection:**  Attackers can inject subqueries to extract more complex information or further overload the system.
    * **Example (Vulnerable):** `query=sum_over_time(http_requests_total{path="$user_provided_path"}[5m])`
    * **Injected Input:** `"} or on() vector(count(up)) == vector(1)`
    * **Resulting Query:** `query=sum_over_time(http_requests_total{path=""} or on() vector(count(up)) == vector(1)[5m])` - This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

**5. Reinforcing Mitigation Strategies and Providing Concrete Examples:**

The provided mitigation strategies are crucial and need to be strictly enforced:

* **Never Directly Incorporate User Input:** This is the golden rule. Directly embedding user input into PromQL queries is the root cause of this vulnerability.

* **Use Parameterized Queries or a Query Builder Library:**  This is the most effective way to prevent PromQL injection. Instead of string concatenation, use mechanisms that treat user input as data, not code. While Prometheus itself doesn't have explicit "parameterized queries" in the SQL sense, we can achieve similar safety through careful construction and abstraction.

    * **Example (Secure Approach - Abstraction Layer):**
        ```python
        def get_http_request_rate(job_name):
            query = f'rate(http_requests_total{{job="{job_name}"}}[5m])'
            # Execute the query using your Prometheus client library
            # ...
        ```
        In this example, `job_name` is treated as a string value within the query, preventing the injection of arbitrary PromQL syntax. A dedicated query builder library would offer even more robust protection.

* **Implement Strict Input Validation:**  Validate all user-provided data used in queries against a strict whitelist of allowed values and formats.

    * **Example (Input Validation):**
        ```python
        def get_http_request_rate(user_provided_job):
            allowed_jobs = ["my-application", "another-service"]
            if user_provided_job not in allowed_jobs:
                raise ValueError("Invalid job name")
            query = f'rate(http_requests_total{{job="{user_provided_job}"}}[5m])'
            # ...
        ```
    * **Sanitization:**  Escape special characters that have meaning in PromQL (e.g., `{`, `}`, `=`, `,`). While not as robust as parameterized queries, it can add a layer of defense.

**6. Defense in Depth Considerations:**

Beyond the core mitigation strategies, consider these additional layers of security:

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the application components interacting with Prometheus have only the necessary permissions to query the required metrics. Avoid using API keys or tokens with overly broad access.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints that allow users to trigger PromQL queries. This can help mitigate DoS attacks.
* **Security Headers:**  Implement relevant security headers to protect against other web application vulnerabilities that could be used in conjunction with PromQL injection.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Periodically review the code and infrastructure to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure adherence to secure coding practices.

**7. Detection and Monitoring:**

Even with robust mitigation, it's essential to have mechanisms to detect potential injection attempts:

* **Logging:**  Log all PromQL queries executed by the application, including the source of the query (user or system). This allows for retrospective analysis of suspicious activity.
* **Anomaly Detection:**  Monitor Prometheus query patterns for unusual or excessively resource-intensive queries. Sudden spikes in query execution time or resource consumption could indicate an attack.
* **Alerting:**  Set up alerts for suspicious query patterns or errors related to PromQL execution.
* **Input Validation Failures:**  Log instances where user input fails validation checks. This can indicate potential probing attempts.

**8. Developer Guidelines:**

* **Treat User Input as Untrusted:** Always assume that user input is potentially malicious.
* **Avoid String Concatenation for Query Construction:**  Favor safer methods like query builders or abstraction layers.
* **Implement Robust Input Validation:**  Validate all user-provided data against strict criteria.
* **Regularly Review and Update Security Practices:** Stay informed about the latest security threats and best practices related to Prometheus and PromQL.
* **Security Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough security code reviews, specifically focusing on how user input is handled in PromQL query construction.

**9. Conclusion:**

PromQL Injection is a serious threat that requires diligent attention and proactive mitigation. By understanding the potential attack vectors and implementing the recommended security measures, we can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation. It is crucial that the development team prioritizes secure coding practices and treats all user-provided data with caution when constructing PromQL queries. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are also vital for maintaining a secure and reliable monitoring infrastructure.
