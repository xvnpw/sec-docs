* **User:** Interacts with the Lazydocker application through the terminal, providing commands and navigating the UI.
* **Lazydocker Application:** The core application logic, responsible for UI rendering, event handling, command execution, data processing, and interaction with the Docker Daemon.
* **Docker Daemon:** The background service responsible for building, running, and managing Docker containers and related resources.

## 5. Detailed Design

### 5.1. Components

* **User Interface (UI) Layer:**
    * Responsible for rendering the terminal-based UI using the `gocui` library, managing layout and display of information.
    * Handles user input (keyboard events, mouse clicks if supported by the terminal).
    * Displays information retrieved from the Docker Daemon in a structured and user-friendly manner.
    * Provides visual feedback to the user based on actions and events.
    * Manages different views or panels for various Docker resources.

* **Input Handling and Event Management:**
    * Captures and processes user input events from the terminal.
    * Maps user actions (key presses, etc.) to specific commands or UI interactions.
    * Manages the application's state based on user events.
    * Implements logic for navigating between UI elements and triggering actions.

* **Docker Client Interface:**
    * Utilizes the official Docker SDK for Go (`docker/docker/client`) to establish and manage communication with the Docker Daemon.
    * Encapsulates the complexities of interacting with the Docker API, providing a higher-level abstraction.
    * Provides functions for making various API calls to retrieve information about containers, images, volumes, networks, etc.
    * Provides functions for executing Docker commands (start, stop, restart, prune, etc.) on behalf of the user.
    * Handles authentication and authorization with the Docker Daemon based on the environment configuration.

* **Command Execution and Orchestration:**
    * Interprets user commands and maps them to specific sequences of Docker API calls.
    * Manages the execution of Docker commands, including handling asynchronous operations.
    * Implements logic for complex operations that might involve multiple API calls.
    * Handles error conditions returned by the Docker Daemon and provides informative feedback to the user.

* **Data Model and State Management:**
    * Maintains an internal representation of Docker objects (containers, images, etc.) and their current state.
    * Caches data retrieved from the Docker Daemon to improve performance and reduce API calls.
    * Implements mechanisms for updating the data model based on events and API responses.
    * Provides a consistent view of the Docker environment to the UI layer.

* **Configuration Management:**
    * Handles the loading, parsing, and validation of Lazydocker's configuration file (`.lazydocker.yml`).
    * Allows users to customize the application's behavior, appearance (themes), and keybindings.
    * Stores settings such as custom commands, ignored resources, and polling intervals.
    * Provides mechanisms for applying and reloading configuration changes.

* **Logging and Error Handling:**
    * Implements logging functionality for debugging, auditing, and troubleshooting.
    * Records application events, errors, and interactions with the Docker Daemon.
    * Typically logs to a file, standard output, or a system log.
    * Implements robust error handling to prevent crashes and provide informative error messages to the user.

### 5.2. Data Flow

The data flow within Lazydocker involves the user initiating an action, Lazydocker interacting with the Docker Daemon, and then updating the UI based on the response.

1. **User Interaction:** The user interacts with the Lazydocker UI by pressing keys or triggering events.
2. **Input Handling:** The UI layer captures the user input event.
3. **Event Processing:** The input handling and event management component interprets the event and determines the intended action.
4. **Command Mapping:** The command execution and orchestration component maps the user action to a specific Docker command or API call.
5. **Docker API Request:** The Docker client interface constructs and sends a request to the Docker Daemon via the Docker API (e.g., using HTTP over a Unix socket or TCP).
6. **Docker Daemon Processing:** The Docker Daemon receives and processes the API request, performing the requested operation (e.g., starting a container, retrieving container information).
7. **Docker API Response:** The Docker Daemon sends a response back to Lazydocker, containing the requested data or status information.
8. **Data Processing and Update:** Lazydocker receives the response, and the data model and state management component processes and updates its internal representation of the Docker environment.
9. **UI Update:** The UI layer is notified of the data change and updates the display to reflect the new state.

```

### 5.3. Interactions with External Systems

The primary external system Lazydocker interacts with is the **Docker Daemon**. This interaction is crucial for its functionality.

* **Communication Protocol:** Lazydocker communicates with the Docker Daemon via the Docker Engine API, typically using HTTP over a Unix socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) or a TCP connection (if the daemon is configured to listen on a network interface).
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Lazydocker relies on the Docker client configuration for authentication with the Docker Daemon. It typically uses the same credentials and context as the standard `docker` CLI, respecting Docker's access control mechanisms.
* **Types of API Calls:** Lazydocker makes a wide range of API calls, including:
    * **Container Management:** Listing, inspecting, starting, stopping, restarting, pausing, unpausing, removing containers, retrieving logs, executing commands inside containers.
    * **Image Management:** Listing, inspecting, pulling, pushing, removing images.
    * **Volume Management:** Listing, inspecting, creating, removing volumes.
    * **Network Management:** Listing, inspecting, creating, removing networks.
    * **Docker Compose:**  Interacting with Docker Compose projects (if a `docker-compose.yml` file is present in the current directory), such as listing services, starting/stopping services, viewing service logs.
    * **System Information:** Retrieving information about the Docker Daemon itself (version, system info).

### 5.4. User Interface

The Lazydocker UI is a dynamic text-based interface rendered in the terminal, providing a real-time view of the Docker environment.

* **Panel-Based Layout:** The UI is typically divided into multiple panels, each displaying a specific type of Docker resource or information.
    * **Containers Panel:** Displays a list of containers with details like ID, name, state, ports, and resource usage.
    * **Images Panel:** Shows available Docker images, including tags and sizes.
    * **Volumes Panel:** Lists Docker volumes and their mount points.
    * **Networks Panel:** Displays Docker networks and their configurations.
    * **Services Panel (Docker Compose):** Shows services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file, their status, and associated containers.
    * **Logs Panel:** Displays real-time logs for selected containers or services.
    * **Stats Panel:** Presents resource usage statistics (CPU, memory, network I/O) for containers.
* **Navigation and Interaction:** Users navigate between panels using keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Tab, arrow keys). Actions are triggered by pressing specific keys (e.g., `s` for start, `r` for restart).
* **Contextual Actions:** The available actions depend on the currently selected item and panel.
* **Visual Feedback:** The UI provides visual feedback to the user, such as highlighting selected items, displaying status messages, and indicating loading states.

## 6. Security Considerations (Pre-Threat Modeling)

Building upon the initial considerations, here are more specific potential security concerns:

* **Privilege Escalation:**
    * If Lazydocker has vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially leverage its interaction with the Docker Daemon to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the Docker Daemon (typically root).
    * Improper handling of user-provided commands or configuration could lead to unintended execution of privileged operations.
* **Command Injection:**
    * If Lazydocker doesn't properly sanitize user input that is used in Docker commands (e.g., when executing commands inside a container), it could be vulnerable to command injection attacks.
    * Custom commands defined in the configuration file could also introduce vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.
* **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
    * Vulnerabilities in the Docker SDK for Go or the `gocui` library could be exploited to compromise Lazydocker. Regular updates and security audits of dependencies are crucial.
* **Configuration Security:**
    * If the `.lazydocker.yml` file is not properly protected, an attacker could modify it to execute malicious commands or alter the application's behavior.
    * Storing sensitive information (though unlikely in the default configuration) in the configuration file could pose a risk.
* **Information Disclosure:**
    * If Lazydocker exposes sensitive information retrieved from the Docker Daemon (e.g., environment variables, secrets) in an insecure way (e.g., through verbose logging), it could lead to information disclosure.
* **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:**
    * While communication with the local Docker Daemon via a Unix socket is generally secure, if Lazydocker were to interact with a remote Docker Daemon over a network, the communication channel would need to be secured (e.g., using TLS) to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
* **Denial of Service:**
    * Maliciously crafted input or actions could potentially cause Lazydocker to consume excessive resources or crash, leading to a denial of service.

## 7. Assumptions and Constraints

* **Docker Daemon Availability and Functionality:** Lazydocker assumes that the Docker Daemon is running, accessible, and functioning correctly according to the Docker API specification.
* **Docker API Compatibility:** Lazydocker relies on the stability and backward compatibility of the Docker API. Changes in the API could potentially break Lazydocker's functionality.
* **User Permissions:** It is assumed that the user running Lazydocker has the necessary permissions to interact with the Docker Daemon as if they were using the `docker` CLI directly.
* **Terminal Environment:** Lazydocker is designed to run in a standard terminal environment that supports ANSI escape codes for rendering the UI.
* **Configuration File Integrity:** If a `.lazydocker.yml` configuration file is used, it is assumed to be a valid YAML file.
* **Local Execution:** This design primarily focuses on Lazydocker running locally on the same machine as the Docker Daemon.

## 8. Future Considerations

* **Enhanced Security Features:**
    * Implementing features like secure storage of sensitive configuration data (if needed).
    * Adding more robust input validation and sanitization mechanisms.
    * Integrating with security scanning tools for Docker images.
* **Plugin System for Extensibility:** Allowing users to extend Lazydocker's functionality with custom commands, integrations, or UI elements.
* **Improved Error Handling and Reporting:** Providing more detailed and user-friendly error messages.
* **GUI Version or Web Interface:** Exploring the possibility of a graphical user interface or a web-based interface for broader accessibility.
* **Integration with other Container Orchestration Tools:** Potentially supporting other container orchestration platforms beyond Docker Compose, such as Kubernetes (though this would be a significant undertaking).
* **Advanced Filtering and Searching:** Implementing more sophisticated ways to filter and search through Docker resources.

This enhanced design document provides a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of Lazydocker's architecture and functionality. It serves as a more robust foundation for conducting thorough threat modeling and identifying potential security vulnerabilities.
