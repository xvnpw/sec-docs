| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & How) | Impact | Affected Gin Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Middleware Spoofing/Bypass** | An attacker crafts requests to exploit the middleware execution order or vulnerabilities in custom middleware. They might bypass authentication or authorization checks by manipulating the request flow. | Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, privilege escalation. | `gin.Context`, Middleware system | High | Clearly define and enforce middleware execution order. Thoroughly review and test custom middleware. Utilize Gin's built-in middleware management features. Avoid relying on implicit middleware order. |
| **Cookie Tampering (if relying solely on Gin's default)** | An attacker intercepts and modifies cookies if sensitive information is stored without proper security measures (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, signing/encryption). | Session hijacking, unauthorized access, manipulation of user preferences or data. | `gin.Context.SetCookie`, `gin.Context.Cookie` | High | Utilize secure cookie attributes (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`). For sensitive data, encrypt or sign cookies using libraries like `gorilla/securecookie`. Avoid storing sensitive data directly in plain text cookies. |
| **Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Middleware** | Poorly written middleware inadvertently logs or exposes sensitive data present in the request or response context (e.g., API keys, passwords). | Information disclosure, potential compromise of sensitive credentials. | Custom Middleware, `gin.Context` | High | Thoroughly review and test middleware to ensure it doesn't unintentionally expose sensitive information. Avoid logging sensitive data. Sanitize data before logging. |
| **Resource Exhaustion through Malicious Requests (Targeting Gin's Routing)** | An attacker sends a large number of requests to specific routes that consume significant server resources (CPU, memory) due to inefficient handlers or lack of rate limiting. | Denial of Service, application unavailability. | Router (`gin.Engine`), Route handlers | High | Implement rate limiting middleware (Gin provides examples or use third-party libraries). Optimize route handlers for performance. Implement request size limits. Use appropriate timeouts. |
| **Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom middleware for privilege escalation** | Vulnerabilities in custom middleware that handles authorization or access control could allow attackers to bypass checks and gain unauthorized access to resources or functionalities. | Elevation of Privilege, unauthorized access, data manipulation. | Custom Middleware, Authorization logic | Critical | Implement robust and well-tested authorization logic in middleware. Follow the principle of least privilege. Regularly review and audit custom middleware for security vulnerabilities. |
