| **Overly Permissive Route Definitions** | Using broad or poorly defined route patterns that can match unintended requests.                  | Gin's flexible routing allows for complex patterns, which, if not carefully defined, can lead to unintended route matching.                                  | Defining a route like `/api/{param}` without validation allows requests to `/api/../../sensitive_data` to potentially be handled by the same handler (if not secured). | Unauthorized access to resources, potential information disclosure. | High          | - Use specific route patterns instead of broad wildcards where possible.<br>- Anchor routes using `^` at the beginning and `$` at the end of the pattern.<br>- Implement input validation on path parameters to restrict allowed values.                                  |
| **Exposed Debug/Testing Endpoints** | Leaving debug or testing endpoints active in production.                                        | Gin makes it easy to define and register routes, and developers might forget to remove development-specific endpoints before deployment.                               | Leaving `/debug/pprof` or custom testing routes accessible in production, potentially exposing internal application state, performance metrics, or allowing privileged actions. | Information disclosure, potential for abuse of debug functionalities. | High          | - Implement environment-based route registration (e.g., only register debug routes in development environments).<br>- Use build flags or configuration to conditionally include/exclude debug routes.<br>- Secure debug endpoints with authentication if they must be accessible in non-production environments. |
| **Malicious or Vulnerable Middleware** | Using third-party middleware with known vulnerabilities or that performs malicious actions. | Gin's middleware system allows for easy integration of external components, increasing the attack surface if these components are not vetted.                               | Using a logging middleware with a known vulnerability that allows arbitrary log injection, potentially leading to log poisoning or information disclosure.           | Various, depending on the middleware vulnerability.                 | High to Critical | - Thoroughly vet and audit all third-party middleware before using them.<br>- Keep middleware dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.<br>- Implement security checks within your own application logic as a defense-in-depth measure.                               |
| **Incorrect Middleware Ordering** | Placing middleware in the wrong order, bypassing security checks or leading to unexpected behavior. | The order in which middleware is added using `r.Use()` in Gin determines the execution order.                                                                 | Placing an authentication middleware *after* a middleware that serves static files could allow unauthenticated access to those files.                                | Bypass of security controls, unauthorized access.                   | High          | - Carefully plan the middleware execution order to ensure security checks are performed before other processing.<br>- Document the intended middleware order and its purpose.<br>- Review the middleware chain regularly to ensure it aligns with security requirements.                               |
| **Path Traversal when Serving Static Files** | Allowing access to files outside the intended directory when serving static files.        | Gin's `r.Static()` and `r.StaticFS()` functions can be vulnerable if not configured carefully.                                                                 | Using `r.Static("/static", "./static")` and an attacker requesting `/static/../../../../etc/passwd`.                                                                 | Unauthorized access to files, potential information disclosure. | High          | - Use `r.StaticFS()` with `http.Dir` to restrict access to the intended directory.<br>- Avoid serving sensitive files directly through static file handlers.<br>- Ensure the base path for static files is properly configured and doesn't allow traversal.                               |
