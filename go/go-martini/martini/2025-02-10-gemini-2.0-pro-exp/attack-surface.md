# Attack Surface Analysis for go-martini/martini

## Attack Surface: [1. Unvalidated Route Parameters (via `martini.Params`)](./attack_surfaces/1__unvalidated_route_parameters__via__martini_params__.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate URL parameters to inject malicious data, exploiting Martini's easy parameter access.
    *   **Martini Contribution:** `martini.Params` provides direct, convenient access to route parameters, increasing the risk if developers omit validation. This is a *direct* consequence of Martini's design.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Route: `/users/:id`
        *   Attack: `/users/1; DROP TABLE users` (SQL Injection) or `/users/../../../etc/passwd` (Path Traversal).
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification, system compromise, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if used in database queries/system commands) / High (other sensitive operations).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** *Strictly* validate *all* `martini.Params` using a validation library. Define data types, formats, and ranges. *Never* use parameters directly in SQL queries or shell commands; use parameterized queries. Sanitize before use.

## Attack Surface: [2. Middleware Ordering Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/2__middleware_ordering_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect ordering of Martini middleware bypasses security checks or renders them ineffective.
    *   **Martini Contribution:** Martini's security *relies* on the correct ordering of middleware, making this a Martini-specific concern. The developer is *entirely* responsible for this ordering.
    *   **Example:** Authentication middleware *after* logging middleware, leading to sensitive data logging before authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, authentication/authorization bypass.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Carefully plan and document middleware order. Standard pattern: Logging -> Recovery -> Security (Auth, AuthZ, Input Validation) -> Business Logic. Thoroughly test.

## Attack Surface: [3. Unprotected Panic Recovery (Default `martini.Recovery`)](./attack_surfaces/3__unprotected_panic_recovery__default__martini_recovery__.md)

*   **Description:** Unhandled panics expose sensitive information (stack traces) due to Martini's default behavior.
    *   **Martini Contribution:** Martini's *default* `martini.Recovery` middleware logs stack traces, which can be exposed if not customized. This is a direct risk from the default configuration.
    *   **Example:** A database error causes a panic, and the stack trace (revealing DB details) is returned to the attacker.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (leading to further attacks).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** *Customize* `martini.Recovery` (or replace it) to *never* expose stack traces in production. Log securely. Return generic 500 errors. Handle errors within handlers to prevent panics.

## Attack Surface: [4. Unintended Route Exposure](./attack_surfaces/4__unintended_route_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Accidental exposure of internal APIs or administrative functions.
    *   **Martini Contribution:** Martini's dynamic routing, while flexible, increases the risk of overlooking route exposure if not meticulously managed.
    *   **Example:** An internal API endpoint `/admin/config` is exposed without authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access, potential system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High / Critical (depending on exposed functionality).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Document all routes and access levels. Use consistent naming. Regularly review the routing configuration. Use tools to visualize routes. Implement authentication/authorization.

## Attack Surface: [5. Outdated Framework and Dependencies (Martini's Unmaintained Status)](./attack_surfaces/5__outdated_framework_and_dependencies__martini's_unmaintained_status_.md)

*   **Description:** Using an unmaintained framework (Martini) and its dependencies exposes the application to known, unpatched vulnerabilities.
    *   **Martini Contribution:** This is a *direct* consequence of using Martini, as it is no longer actively maintained. This is the *most significant* long-term risk.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a Martini dependency allows remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Varies; could range from information disclosure to complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High / Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** *Prioritize migrating to an actively maintained framework.* This is the *only* effective long-term solution. While using Martini, investigate any reported vulnerabilities. Keep dependencies updated. Consider compensating controls (WAF rules).

## Attack Surface: [6. Custom Middleware Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/6__custom_middleware_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within custom-built middleware.
    *   **Martini Contribution:** Martini's architecture heavily relies on middleware. Any custom middleware is a potential attack point.
    *   **Example:** Custom middleware with flawed input sanitization allows injection attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Varies; could lead to various vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High / Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Thoroughly review and test *all* custom middleware. Follow secure coding practices. Use static analysis and linters. Keep middleware simple.
