## Attack Tree Path: [1. Dependency Injection Exploits [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__dependency_injection_exploits__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** Martini's core functionality relies heavily on dependency injection.  Attackers can exploit this to inject malicious code, override existing functionality, or bypass security mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Exploit misconfigured dependency injection to override existing handler [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_exploit_misconfigured_dependency_injection_to_override_existing_handler__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application's dependency injection configuration is flawed (e.g., allows external input to influence which handlers are registered), an attacker could replace a legitimate handler with a malicious one.
    *   **Example:** An attacker might find a way to inject a handler that replaces the user authentication handler with one that always returns "true," granting access to all users.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Overwrite a service with a malicious implementation (if dependencies are mutable) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_overwrite_a_service_with_a_malicious_implementation__if_dependencies_are_mutable___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** If Martini allows dependencies to be modified after initialization (which is generally a bad practice), an attacker could replace a core service (e.g., database connection, logging service) with a malicious version.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could replace the database service with one that logs all queries, including sensitive data, to an attacker-controlled location.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Bypass Authentication/Authorization [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_bypass_authenticationauthorization__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This focuses on using DI to circumvent security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Inject a handler that skips authentication checks [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_inject_a_handler_that_skips_authentication_checks__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker injects a handler *before* the authentication handler in the chain, effectively bypassing it.
        *   **Example:**  Injecting a handler that sets the "user" context variable to a valid user, regardless of the actual request.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2 Modify existing authentication handler via DI to always succeed [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_modify_existing_authentication_handler_via_di_to_always_succeed__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  Similar to 1.1.2, but specifically targeting the authentication handler.
        *   **Example:**  Replacing the authentication handler with a stub that always authenticates the user.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Middleware Chain Manipulation [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__middleware_chain_manipulation__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:**  Martini uses middleware for various tasks, including security.  Manipulating the middleware chain can allow attackers to bypass security checks or inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Bypass Security Middleware [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_bypass_security_middleware__high_risk_.md)

* **Overall Description:** This focuses on avoiding security checks implemented as middleware.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Find a route that doesn't include the security middleware (misconfiguration) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_find_a_route_that_doesn't_include_the_security_middleware__misconfiguration___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  If a developer forgets to apply security middleware to a specific route, an attacker can access that route without authentication or authorization.
        *   **Example:**  An administrative API endpoint that was accidentally left unprotected.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 If middleware registration is externally controllable, inject malicious code [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_if_middleware_registration_is_externally_controllable__inject_malicious_code__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows external input to determine which middleware is loaded, an attacker can inject arbitrary code.
    *   **Example:**  A configuration setting that allows users to specify middleware plugins, which are then loaded by Martini.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1 If configuration is exposed or modifiable, alter middleware order [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1_if_configuration_is_exposed_or_modifiable__alter_middleware_order__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  If the middleware order is determined by a configuration file or setting that an attacker can modify, they can change the order to bypass security checks.
    *   **Example:**  Moving the authentication middleware to the *end* of the chain, allowing other middleware to execute before authentication.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Context Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/3__context_manipulation.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.2 Overwrite critical context values to bypass checks [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_2_overwrite_critical_context_values_to_bypass_checks__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Martini's `context.Context` is used to pass data between handlers.  If an attacker can modify critical values (e.g., user roles, permissions), they can bypass security checks.
    *   **Example:**  Injecting a value into the context that makes the application believe the user is an administrator.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Unpatched Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_unpatched_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:**  Due to the unmaintained nature of Martini, any existing or future vulnerabilities are unlikely to be patched.

## Attack Tree Path: [6.1 Leverage Known CVEs (if any exist) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/6_1_leverage_known_cves__if_any_exist___high_risk_.md)

* **Overall Description:** This involves finding and exploiting publicly documented vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [6.1.1 Research and exploit any documented vulnerabilities in Martini or its dependencies. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/6_1_1_research_and_exploit_any_documented_vulnerabilities_in_martini_or_its_dependencies___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  Searching vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD) for known issues in Martini or its dependencies.
        *   **Example:**  Finding a CVE related to a specific version of Martini and using a publicly available exploit.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Varies (potentially Very High)
        *   **Effort:** Varies
        *   **Skill Level:** Varies
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies

## Attack Tree Path: [6.2 Fuzzing [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/6_2_fuzzing__high_risk_.md)

* **Overall Description:** This involves using automated tools to find new vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [6.2.1 Use fuzzing techniques to discover unknown vulnerabilities.](./attack_tree_paths/6_2_1_use_fuzzing_techniques_to_discover_unknown_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Using fuzzing tools to send malformed or unexpected input to Martini's handlers and routing logic, hoping to trigger crashes or unexpected behavior that indicates a vulnerability.
        *   **Example:**  Using a fuzzer to send various combinations of characters and data types to a Martini API endpoint.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Varies (potentially Very High)
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
