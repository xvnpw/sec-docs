# Threat Model Analysis for go-martini/martini

## Threat: [Threat 1: Exploitation of Unpatched `net/http` Vulnerability via Martini](./threats/threat_1_exploitation_of_unpatched__nethttp__vulnerability_via_martini.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in Go's `net/http` package (which Martini uses) that hasn't been patched *because Martini is unmaintained and hasn't updated its dependency*.  The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request (e.g., exploiting header parsing, request smuggling, or a `net/http`-specific DoS) to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure. The specific impact depends on the `net/http` vulnerability.
    *   **Martini Component Affected:** `martini.Classic()`, `martini.Run()`, and any middleware/handlers interacting with `http.Request` and `http.ResponseWriter`. Martini's core routing and request handling are affected due to reliance on `net/http`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Migration (Primary):** Migrate to a maintained framework that updates its `net/http` dependency.
        *   **Fork and Patch `net/http` (High Effort, Risky, Not Recommended):** Fork Martini, manually update Go version (and `net/http`), rebuild.  High risk of breakage.
        *   **WAF with `net/http` Vulnerability Rules (Partial):** Use a WAF with rules to detect/block exploits targeting known `net/http` vulnerabilities. Reactive, not preventative.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Exploitation of Unpatched Martini-Specific Vulnerability](./threats/threat_2_exploitation_of_unpatched_martini-specific_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *directly within the Martini codebase*. This could be a flaw in Martini's routing, middleware handling, dependency injection, or other Martini-specific features.  A malicious request/input triggers the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure, Privilege Escalation. Impact depends on the specific Martini vulnerability.
    *   **Martini Component Affected:** Potentially any part of Martini: `martini.Classic()`, `martini.Run()`, `martini.Handlers()`, `martini.Action`, `martini.Router`, `martini.Context`, specific middleware, or the dependency injection system (`inject` package).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Migration (Primary):** Migrate to a maintained framework. The only reliable long-term solution.
        *   **Fork and Patch Martini (High Effort):** Fork Martini, manually apply a patch. Requires significant Go expertise and ongoing security monitoring.
        *   **WAF with Custom Rules (Partial):** Create WAF rules to detect/block exploits targeting the specific Martini vulnerability. Requires deep understanding of the vulnerability.

## Threat: [Threat 3: Dependency Injection Hijacking](./threats/threat_3_dependency_injection_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in Martini's dependency injection to inject malicious code or access sensitive data. This could involve manipulating the injection process to replace legitimate services with attacker-controlled ones, or accessing services/data that should be inaccessible.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Information Disclosure, Privilege Escalation.
    *   **Martini Component Affected:** `martini.Map()`, `martini.MapTo()`, `martini.Invoke()`, `martini.Context`. Martini's core dependency injection mechanisms are the target.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Type Checking:** Use strong typing and interfaces for dependencies. Avoid injecting generic `interface{}` types.
        *   **Limited Injection Scope:** Carefully control the scope of injected dependencies. Don't inject sensitive services unnecessarily.
        *   **Code Review (Essential):** Thoroughly review code using Martini's dependency injection for security.
        *   **Migration (Recommended):** Migrate to a framework with a more controlled dependency injection system.

## Threat: [Threat 4: Middleware Bypass](./threats/threat_4_middleware_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request that bypasses security middleware.  This could be due to flaws in the middleware, errors in how Martini chains middleware, or vulnerabilities in Martini's request handling allowing middleware to be skipped.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls (authentication, authorization, input validation), leading to unauthorized access or other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Martini Component Affected:** `martini.Handlers()`, `martini.Use()`, and any custom middleware functions. The order and logic of middleware execution are critical.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Middleware Testing:** Thoroughly test all middleware, individually and combined, to ensure they function correctly and cannot be bypassed.
        *   **Secure Middleware Ordering:** Carefully order middleware. Security-critical middleware should be early in the chain.
        *   **Code Review (Essential):** Review code defining and using middleware for security.
        *   **Migration (Recommended):** Migrate to a framework with a robust middleware system.
