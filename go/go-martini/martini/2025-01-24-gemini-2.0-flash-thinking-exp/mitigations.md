    2.  **Step 2: Martini Parameter Validation (Beyond Input Validation):**  Perform validation beyond basic input validation. Validate the *meaning* and *context* of parameters within Martini handlers to prevent logical vulnerabilities. For example, validate that IDs are within expected ranges or that filenames are safe.
    3.  **Step 3: Martini Parameter Encoding Awareness:** Be aware of different parameter encoding schemes used in Martini requests (URL encoding, form encoding). Ensure proper decoding and handling of encoded parameters to prevent injection attacks or data interpretation issues within Martini applications.
    4.  **Step 4: Martini Parameter Tampering Protection:**  Implement mechanisms to protect against parameter tampering in Martini requests. This might involve using signed parameters or checksums to verify parameter integrity, especially for sensitive parameters passed through Martini routes or requests.

    1.  **Step 1: Martini Method-Specific Route Usage:**  Utilize Martini's method-specific routing functions (`m.Get`, `m.Post`, `m.Put`, `m.Delete`, etc.) to explicitly define the allowed HTTP methods for each route. Avoid using the generic `m.Route` where possible, as it can be less restrictive.
    2.  **Step 2: Martini Route Method Restriction Review:**  Regularly review Martini route definitions to ensure that routes are restricted to only the necessary HTTP methods. Remove any unnecessary method allowances that could broaden the attack surface.
    3.  **Step 3: Martini Method Enforcement Testing:** Implement integration tests that specifically verify that Martini routes only respond to the intended HTTP methods and reject requests with disallowed methods.
    4.  **Step 4: Martini CORS Configuration (Method-Aware):** If CORS is enabled in the Martini application, configure CORS policies to be method-aware, further restricting allowed methods for cross-origin requests to specific Martini routes.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Martini Method Spoofing Attacks (Medium Severity):**  If Martini routes are not properly restricted by HTTP method, attackers might attempt to use unintended methods (e.g., using `POST` on a `GET` route) to bypass security checks or trigger unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Martini CSRF Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Incorrect method handling in Martini routes can increase the risk of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks if state-changing operations are not properly protected and are accessible via methods like `GET` when they should be `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE`.
