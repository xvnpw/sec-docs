# Attack Surface Analysis for go-martini/martini

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Injection/Manipulation in Routing](./attack_surfaces/parameter_injectionmanipulation_in_routing.md)

* **Description:** Attackers manipulate URL parameters to bypass intended logic, access unauthorized resources, or trigger unexpected behavior.
* **How Martini Contributes:** Martini's routing mechanism directly exposes extracted parameters to handler functions. Lack of validation in these handlers creates the vulnerability.
* **Example:** A route `/items/:id` might be accessed with `/items/' OR '1'='1` if the handler uses the `id` parameter directly in an SQL query without sanitization.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data breaches, application errors, potentially remote code execution if parameters are used insecurely in system commands.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Input Validation in Handlers:** Implement robust validation for all route parameters within the handler functions.
    * **Use Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries:**  When using parameters in database queries, always use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
    * **Avoid Direct Execution of System Commands with User Input:**  If necessary, sanitize and validate thoroughly before using parameters in system commands.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Order Dependency Exploits](./attack_surfaces/middleware_order_dependency_exploits.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit the order in which middleware is executed to bypass security checks or manipulate application state.
* **How Martini Contributes:** Martini's middleware system executes functions in the order they are added. This sequential execution can be exploited if dependencies between middleware are not carefully considered.
* **Example:** An authentication middleware is placed *after* a middleware that processes user input. An attacker could manipulate input in a way that bypasses the authentication check in a later middleware.
* **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, unauthorized access to resources or functionalities, data manipulation.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Middleware Ordering:** Carefully design and enforce the order of middleware execution, ensuring security-critical middleware runs before processing user input or making authorization decisions.
    * **Minimize Middleware Dependencies:** Design middleware to be as independent as possible to reduce the risk of exploitation through ordering.
    * **Thorough Testing of Middleware Chain:**  Test the application with various inputs to ensure the middleware chain functions as expected and security checks are not bypassed.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Third-Party Middleware](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_third-party_middleware.md)

* **Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist in third-party middleware used within the Martini application.
* **How Martini Contributes:** Martini's architecture allows easy integration of external middleware. If these middlewares have vulnerabilities, they directly impact the application's security.
* **Example:** Using a logging middleware with a known remote code execution vulnerability.
* **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Careful Selection of Middleware:** Choose well-maintained and reputable middleware libraries with a strong security track record.
    * **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep all middleware dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities. Use dependency management tools to track and update dependencies.
    * **Security Audits of Middleware:**  For critical applications or when using less common middleware, consider performing security audits or penetration testing of the middleware components.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal in Static File Serving (if using `martini.Static`)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_in_static_file_serving__if_using__martini_static__.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can access files outside the intended static directory by manipulating file paths in the URL.
* **How Martini Contributes:** The `martini.Static` middleware, if not used carefully, can be vulnerable to path traversal if it doesn't properly sanitize the requested file path.
* **Example:** A request like `/static/../../../../etc/passwd` might be used to access sensitive system files.
* **Impact:** Access to sensitive files, potentially leading to information disclosure, configuration leaks, or even system compromise.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Avoid `martini.Static` for Sensitive Content:** Do not use the built-in static file server for sensitive files or directories.
    * **Path Sanitization (If Using `martini.Static`):** Implement robust path sanitization within the application or a custom middleware before serving static files to prevent access to parent directories.
    * **Use a Dedicated Web Server for Static Content:**  Utilize a dedicated web server (like Nginx or Apache) to serve static content, as they often have more robust security features for handling static files and preventing path traversal.
