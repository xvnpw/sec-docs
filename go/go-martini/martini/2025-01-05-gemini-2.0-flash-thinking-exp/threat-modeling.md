# Threat Model Analysis for go-martini/martini

## Threat: [Route Hijacking/Shadowing](./threats/route_hijackingshadowing.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a request that matches a more general, unintended route due to overlapping route definitions within Martini. This leads to the execution of the wrong handler, potentially bypassing security checks or exposing unintended functionality. The attacker might intentionally target this to access restricted areas or trigger unintended actions.

**Impact:** Authorization bypass, access to sensitive data or functionality, unintended data modification, potential denial of service if the incorrect handler is resource-intensive.

**Affected Component:** `router` (responsible for matching incoming requests to defined routes).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Define routes with explicit and non-overlapping patterns within Martini's routing mechanism.
*   Avoid overly broad regular expressions or wildcard routes that could unintentionally match other routes in Martini.
*   Thoroughly test route definitions to ensure the intended handler is executed for each expected request within the Martini application.
*   Prioritize more specific routes over general ones in the route definition order within Martini.

## Threat: [ReDoS via Route Matching](./threats/redos_via_route_matching.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted request containing a string that causes the regular expression engine used in Martini's route matching to consume excessive CPU time. This leads to a denial of service by tying up server resources.

**Impact:** Denial of service, making the Martini application unavailable to legitimate users.

**Affected Component:** `router` (specifically the regular expression matching functionality within the Martini router).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid complex or unbounded regular expressions in Martini route definitions.
*   Carefully review and test regular expressions used in Martini routes for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using simpler route matching strategies if possible within Martini.
*   Implement request timeouts to limit the processing time for individual requests handled by Martini.

## Threat: [Middleware Ordering Issues leading to Security Bypass](./threats/middleware_ordering_issues_leading_to_security_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker relies on the incorrect ordering of middleware within the Martini application to bypass security checks. For example, authentication middleware might be placed after a handler that performs actions requiring authentication, or logging middleware might miss critical early stages of request processing.

**Impact:** Authorization bypass, access to restricted resources or functionalities within the Martini application, inadequate logging and auditing.

**Affected Component:** `middleware stack` (the ordered list of middleware functions in Martini).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Define a clear and secure middleware order within the Martini application.
*   Ensure authentication and authorization middleware are placed early in the Martini middleware chain.
*   Place logging and security-related middleware strategically to capture relevant events within the Martini request lifecycle.
*   Thoroughly test the Martini middleware pipeline to confirm the expected execution order.

## Threat: [Injection of Untrusted Services](./threats/injection_of_untrusted_services.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control over the Martini service injection mechanism (if the application allows external configuration or plugins) and injects malicious or compromised services. These malicious services can then be used to manipulate application behavior or gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data manipulation, complete application compromise of the Martini application.

**Affected Component:** Dependency injection mechanism within Martini.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly control the sources and configuration of injected services within the Martini application.
*   Implement strong input validation and sanitization for any external configuration related to service injection in Martini.
*   Use code signing or other mechanisms to verify the integrity of service implementations used by Martini.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Static File Handler](./threats/path_traversal_via_static_file_handler.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a request with manipulated path parameters to access files outside the intended static file directory served by Martini's `static` middleware.

**Impact:** Access to sensitive files on the server hosting the Martini application, potentially including configuration files, source code, or other critical data.

**Affected Component:** `static.Dir` middleware (or custom static file serving implementation within Martini).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using user-provided input directly in file paths for static file serving in Martini.
*   Use secure file serving mechanisms within Martini that prevent access outside the designated directory.
*   Sanitize and validate any user input used to determine the requested static file served by Martini.
