# Threat Model Analysis for go-martini/martini

## Threat: [Middleware Order Vulnerabilities](./threats/middleware_order_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit incorrect middleware ordering to bypass security checks. For example, if authentication middleware is placed after logging middleware, unauthorized requests could be logged and potentially processed by later middleware or handlers before being blocked, leading to information disclosure or further exploitation.
    *   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization bypass, exposure of sensitive data, application logic errors, potential for further exploitation.
    *   **Martini Component Affected:** Middleware execution pipeline, `m.Use()` function.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully plan and document middleware execution order.
        *   Prioritize security-related middleware (authentication, authorization, input validation) to be executed early in the pipeline.
        *   Use automated testing to verify middleware interactions and expected security behavior under different middleware orderings.
        *   Employ static analysis tools or linters to detect potential middleware ordering issues.

## Threat: [Vulnerable or Malicious Third-Party Middleware](./threats/vulnerable_or_malicious_third-party_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could leverage vulnerabilities in third-party Martini middleware or its dependencies to compromise the application. This could involve exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated middleware, or using maliciously crafted middleware designed to inject backdoors, steal data, or cause denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other vulnerabilities depending on the middleware's nature and vulnerabilities. Full application compromise is possible.
    *   **Martini Component Affected:** Middleware integration, dependency management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet third-party middleware before use, checking for active maintenance, security audits, and community reputation.
        *   Use dependency management tools to track and update middleware dependencies.
        *   Regularly audit and update middleware to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using well-established and actively maintained middleware libraries.
        *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to automatically detect vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Dependencies](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information if sensitive objects or configurations (e.g., database credentials, API keys) are inadvertently registered as injectable dependencies with too broad a scope in Martini's dependency injection system. This could occur through debugging endpoints, error messages, or if the application logic unintentionally exposes these dependencies.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information (credentials, API keys, internal configurations), unauthorized access to resources, potential for privilege escalation and further attacks.
    *   **Martini Component Affected:** Dependency Injection (`martini.Map`, `martini.Context`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully manage the scope and visibility of injected dependencies.
        *   Avoid injecting sensitive information directly as dependencies.
        *   Use environment variables or secure configuration management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to manage sensitive data.
        *   Limit the scope of dependency injection to only where it's needed.
        *   Regularly review dependency injection configurations for potential overexposure of sensitive data.

## Threat: [Dependency Overriding and Manipulation](./threats/dependency_overriding_and_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious or poorly written middleware could override critical dependencies within Martini's dependency injection system with insecure or malicious implementations. This could allow an attacker to manipulate application behavior, bypass security checks, or introduce vulnerabilities by replacing legitimate components with compromised ones.
    *   **Impact:** Application logic corruption, security bypasses, introduction of vulnerabilities, potential for remote code execution if critical components are replaced with malicious ones.
    *   **Martini Component Affected:** Dependency Injection (`martini.Map`, `martini.Context`), middleware execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Exercise caution when overriding dependencies.
        *   Clearly document dependency overrides and their intended purpose.
        *   Implement code reviews to detect unintended or malicious dependency overrides.
        *   Restrict the ability to override core dependencies to authorized components only.
        *   Consider using a more restrictive dependency injection mechanism if overriding is not frequently needed.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Martini Core or Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_martini_core_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities discovered in the Martini framework itself or its dependencies. As Martini is less actively maintained, security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities might be delayed or not released, leaving applications vulnerable to known exploits.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, and other vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the vulnerability in Martini or its dependencies. Full application compromise is possible.
    *   **Martini Component Affected:** Martini core framework, dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Monitor Martini and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities through security advisories and vulnerability databases.
        *   If possible, consider migrating to a more actively maintained framework if security updates for Martini become infrequent or cease.
        *   Implement robust security practices at the application level to mitigate the impact of potential framework vulnerabilities (defense in depth).
        *   Stay informed about the security status of Martini and its ecosystem.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools to detect potential vulnerabilities in the application code that might interact with framework components.
