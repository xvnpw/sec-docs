# Attack Surface Analysis for go-martini/martini

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive Wildcard Routes](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_wildcard_routes.md)

*   **Description:** Martini's wildcard route feature (`/*`) allows defining routes that match any path segment. If not carefully defined, these routes can unintentionally handle requests meant for other resources or internal functionalities.
    *   **How Martini Contributes:** Martini's syntax for wildcard routes makes it easy to create catch-all routes, which can be beneficial but also risky if not implemented with precision.
    *   **Example:** A route defined as `r.Get("/*", handler)` could unintentionally handle requests for `/admin/deleteUser` if no more specific routes are defined before it, potentially exposing administrative functions.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, unintended execution of code, information disclosure, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define specific routes before more general wildcard routes.
        *   Use regular expressions or custom matching logic within handlers to restrict the scope of wildcard routes.
        *   Avoid using overly broad wildcard routes unless absolutely necessary.
        *   Regularly review and audit route definitions.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Rendering](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_rendering.md)

*   **Description:** If Martini is used with a templating engine and user-provided data is directly embedded into templates without proper sanitization or escaping, attackers can inject malicious code that will be executed on the server.
    *   **How Martini Contributes:** Martini facilitates the use of templating engines for rendering responses. If developers don't handle user input carefully within these templates, SSTI vulnerabilities can arise.
    *   **Example:** Using `html/template` and directly embedding user input like `{{.UserInput}}` without escaping could allow an attacker to inject template directives that execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize or escape user-provided data before embedding it into templates.
        *   Use templating engines that offer automatic escaping by default.
        *   Avoid allowing users to control template content directly.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful XSS or SSTI.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Static File Serving](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_static_file_serving.md)

*   **Description:** If Martini's static file serving functionality is enabled and not properly configured, attackers might be able to use ".." sequences in the URL to access files outside the intended static directory.
    *   **How Martini Contributes:** Martini provides a built-in mechanism for serving static files, which, if not secured, can be exploited for path traversal.
    *   **Example:** A request like `/static/../../../../etc/passwd` could potentially expose sensitive system files if the static file serving is not properly restricted.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files, potential for further system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure the root directory for static file serving to only include intended public assets.
        *   Disable static file serving if it's not required.
        *   Implement checks to prevent access to files outside the designated static directory.
        *   Consider using a dedicated web server or CDN for serving static content, which often provides better security features.
