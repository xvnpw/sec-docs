# Threat Model Analysis for go-martini/martini

## Threat: [Middleware Bypass or Manipulation](./threats/middleware_bypass_or_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker finds a way to circumvent the execution of certain middleware components or manipulate their execution order. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in custom middleware logic, or potentially through flaws in Martini's middleware handling if any are discovered. The attacker might craft requests that exploit conditional logic within middleware or find ways to directly invoke handlers without passing through necessary middleware.

**Impact:** Circumvention of security controls (authentication, authorization, input validation), exposure of protected resources, potential for injecting malicious data or code.

**Affected Martini Component:** `middleware stack` and the `martini.Handler` interface.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review and audit all custom middleware for vulnerabilities.
*   Ensure middleware dependencies are managed securely.
*   Design middleware to be robust and resistant to bypass attempts.
*   Avoid relying solely on middleware execution order for security.

## Threat: [Dependency Poisoning through the Martini Injector](./threats/dependency_poisoning_through_the_martini_injector.md)

**Description:** An attacker finds a way to influence the dependencies being injected into Martini handlers or middleware. This could involve manipulating the injector's state or exploiting vulnerabilities in how dependencies are registered or resolved. The attacker might replace legitimate dependencies with malicious ones.

**Impact:** Code execution within the application's context, data manipulation, privilege escalation depending on the compromised dependency.

**Affected Martini Component:** `inject` package (Martini's dependency injection container).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Limit the ability to modify the injector's state after initialization.
*   Ensure dependencies are registered securely and validated.
*   Avoid exposing the injector directly to user input or external sources.

## Threat: [Context Data Manipulation Leading to Security Bypass](./threats/context_data_manipulation_leading_to_security_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a middleware component to modify data stored within the `martini.Context`. Subsequent middleware or handlers might rely on this manipulated data for security decisions, leading to a bypass of security checks or unintended actions.

**Impact:** Circumvention of authentication or authorization, data tampering, execution of unauthorized actions.

**Affected Martini Component:** `martini.Context`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Treat data within the `martini.Context` as potentially untrusted, especially if it originates from user input or external sources.
*   Validate data retrieved from the context before making security-sensitive decisions.
*   Limit the ability of middleware to modify context data in ways that could be exploited.
