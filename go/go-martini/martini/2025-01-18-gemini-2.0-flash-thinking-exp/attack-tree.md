## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in how the Martini application defines and matches routes.

**Ambiguous Route Definitions:**  Overlapping or poorly defined route patterns can lead to the application executing an unintended handler for a given request. This might involve a less secure or vulnerable handler being invoked, potentially exposing sensitive data or allowing unauthorized actions.

**Parameter Injection in Route Matching:** Attackers manipulate parameters within the URL path that are used by the application's routing logic. If these parameters are not properly sanitized or validated, attackers can inject malicious code (command injection) or access unauthorized files (path traversal).

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Middleware Injection (Requires existing vulnerability or access)](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_middleware_injection__requires_existing_vulnerability_or_access_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path requires an initial compromise allowing the attacker to modify the application's code or configuration. Once access is gained, the attacker injects malicious middleware into the Martini request processing pipeline. This malicious middleware can then execute arbitrary code on every subsequent request processed by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Injection (DI) Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_injection__di__mechanisms.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target the Martini application's dependency injection mechanism. By finding a way to influence the DI container, they can inject a malicious dependency. When the application attempts to use this dependency, the malicious code within it is executed, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Static File Serving (If Enabled)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_static_file_serving__if_enabled_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the Martini application is configured to serve static files, attackers can exploit path traversal vulnerabilities. By manipulating the file path in the request (using ".." sequences), they can access files outside the intended static file directory. This can expose sensitive configuration files, source code, or even executable files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes.md)

* **Step 3: Exploit unexpected handler execution due to ambiguity:** This is the point where the ambiguous routing leads to the execution of a potentially vulnerable handler, enabling further exploitation.
* **Step 3: Exploit insufficient sanitization or validation of route parameters leading to command injection or path traversal:** This is the point where malicious input in route parameters is successfully used to execute commands on the server or access unauthorized files.
* **Step 3: Access protected resources or functionalities without proper authorization:** This signifies a successful bypass of authentication or authorization middleware, granting unauthorized access.
* **Step 1: Gain unauthorized access to the application's code or configuration:** This is the crucial initial step required for malicious middleware injection, representing a significant compromise of the application's security.
* **Step 3: The malicious middleware executes arbitrary code on subsequent requests:** This is the point where the injected malicious middleware actively compromises the application by executing arbitrary code.
* **Step 3: Exploit this interference to bypass security checks or trigger vulnerabilities:** This signifies a successful manipulation of middleware interactions to circumvent security measures or trigger unintended behavior.
* **Step 3: The malicious dependency executes arbitrary code when invoked by the application:** This is the point where the injected malicious dependency actively compromises the application by executing arbitrary code.
* **Step 2: Analyze the error pages returned by Martini:** This is the point where an attacker extracts sensitive information from error messages, which can be used for further attacks.
* **Step 3: Cause a denial of service:** This represents a successful attack that makes the application unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming it with error-inducing requests.
* **Step 3: Access files outside the intended static file directory:** This is the point where an attacker successfully retrieves unauthorized files from the server.
* **Step 3: Exploit vulnerabilities arising from incorrect header processing:** This signifies a successful manipulation of HTTP headers to trigger unexpected behavior or bypass security checks.
* **Step 3: Exploit vulnerabilities in Martini's body parsing or the application's handling of the body:** This is the point where malicious content in the request body is used to cause harm, such as resource exhaustion or triggering other vulnerabilities.
