# Threat Model Analysis for kubernetes/kubernetes

## Threat: [API Server Unauthorized Access](./threats/api_server_unauthorized_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability or misconfiguration within the Kubernetes API server code itself (e.g., an authentication bypass in the `kube-apiserver` codebase) to gain unauthorized access. This allows them to bypass normal authentication and authorization checks.

**Impact:** Full cluster compromise, including the ability to create, modify, or delete any resource, deploy malicious workloads, exfiltrate sensitive data, and disrupt services.

**Affected Component:** kube-apiserver (authentication and authorization modules within the `kubernetes/kubernetes` codebase)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep Kubernetes components updated to the latest versions with security patches.
*   Thoroughly review and adhere to Kubernetes security best practices for API server configuration.
*   Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication, client certificates) as defense in depth.
*   Enable audit logging for API server requests and monitor for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [etcd Data Breach](./threats/etcd_data_breach.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within the etcd component integrated into Kubernetes (though etcd is a separate project, vulnerabilities in its integration or dependencies within `kubernetes/kubernetes` are relevant here) to gain unauthorized access to the etcd datastore. This could involve exploiting network vulnerabilities in how `kube-apiserver` communicates with etcd or vulnerabilities in the etcd client libraries used by Kubernetes.

**Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information (secrets, configuration data), manipulation of cluster state leading to instability, service disruption, or complete cluster compromise.

**Affected Component:** etcd integration within `kubernetes/kubernetes` (e.g., client libraries, communication protocols), potentially affecting `kube-apiserver`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep Kubernetes components updated to the latest versions, which include updated etcd client libraries and integration code.
*   Enable encryption at rest for etcd data (configuration managed by Kubernetes).
*   Enable encryption in transit for communication between etcd members and the API server (configuration managed by Kubernetes).
*   Restrict network access to etcd to only authorized components (e.g., API server).

## Threat: [Kubelet Container Escape](./threats/kubelet_container_escape.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities within the Kubelet code itself (`kubelet` component in `kubernetes/kubernetes`) to break out of a container's isolation and gain access to the underlying host operating system. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how Kubelet manages container lifecycles, resource isolation, or interacts with the container runtime.

**Impact:** Node compromise, access to other containers on the same node, potential lateral movement within the cluster, data exfiltration.

**Affected Component:** kubelet (container management logic within the `kubernetes/kubernetes` codebase)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep Kubernetes components, especially the Kubelet, updated to the latest versions with security patches.
*   Harden node security configurations.
*   Use security context constraints (SCCs) or Pod Security Admission to restrict container capabilities and access.
*   Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities as a preventative measure.

## Threat: [Network Policy Bypass](./threats/network_policy_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within the Kubernetes network policy implementation (`kube-proxy` or the network policy controller components within `kubernetes/kubernetes`) to bypass configured network policies. This allows unauthorized network traffic between pods or to external services despite the intended restrictions.

**Impact:** Lateral movement within the cluster, unauthorized access to sensitive services, data exfiltration, potential for further compromise.

**Affected Component:** kube-proxy (network proxying logic within `kubernetes/kubernetes`), network policy controller (within `kubernetes/kubernetes`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep Kubernetes components updated to the latest versions, including fixes for network policy vulnerabilities.
*   Thoroughly review and test network policies to ensure they are correctly implemented and effective.
*   Choose a reputable and well-maintained CNI plugin, as some aspects of network policy enforcement depend on the CNI.

## Threat: [Malicious Container Image Deployment (via API Server Vulnerability)](./threats/malicious_container_image_deployment__via_api_server_vulnerability_.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the `kube-apiserver`'s deployment handling logic (within the `kubernetes/kubernetes` codebase) to deploy a malicious container image into the cluster. This bypasses normal authorization or validation checks.

**Impact:** Introduction of malware into the cluster, data breaches, resource hijacking, denial of service, potential for further compromise.

**Affected Component:** kube-apiserver (deployment handling logic within the `kubernetes/kubernetes` codebase).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep Kubernetes components, especially the API server, updated to the latest versions with security patches.
*   Implement strong authorization policies and admission controllers as defense in depth.
*   Use a trusted container registry and scan images for vulnerabilities before deployment.
