# Attack Surface Analysis for kubernetes/kubernetes

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to the Kubernetes API Server](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to_the_kubernetes_api_server.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining access to the Kubernetes API without proper authentication or authorization, allowing for cluster manipulation.
    *   **How Kubernetes Contributes:** Kubernetes relies on the API server as the central control point. Weak authentication or overly permissive RBAC configurations directly expose this surface.
    *   **Example:** Exposing the API server without authentication, using default credentials, or granting overly broad cluster-admin roles.
    *   **Impact:** Full cluster compromise, deployment of malicious workloads, data exfiltration, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., TLS client certificates, OIDC).
        *   Enforce least privilege RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and regularly review role bindings.
        *   Enable audit logging to monitor API access and detect suspicious activity.
        *   Restrict network access to the API server.

## Attack Surface: [Container Escape](./attack_surfaces/container_escape.md)

*   **Description:** Breaking out of the container runtime environment to gain access to the underlying host operating system (the worker node).
    *   **How Kubernetes Contributes:** Kubernetes manages containers, and misconfigurations in container security contexts or vulnerabilities in the container runtime (managed or orchestrated by Kubernetes) can facilitate escapes.
    *   **Example:** Running privileged containers, mounting the Docker socket inside a container, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the container runtime (e.g., containerd, CRI-O) as orchestrated by Kubernetes.
    *   **Impact:** Node compromise, access to sensitive data on the node, ability to manipulate other containers on the same node.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid running privileged containers unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        *   Implement and enforce restrictive security contexts (e.g., AppArmor, SELinux) configured within Kubernetes.
        *   Regularly update container runtime and node operating system used by Kubernetes.
        *   Use tools like `seccomp` profiles to limit system calls within containers, configurable within Kubernetes pod specifications.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Secrets Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_secrets_management.md)

*   **Description:** Storing and managing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys) insecurely within the Kubernetes cluster.
    *   **How Kubernetes Contributes:** Kubernetes provides mechanisms for managing secrets, but improper usage or misconfiguration of these mechanisms leads to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Storing secrets as plain text in environment variables or ConfigMaps, granting overly broad access to Secrets through RBAC, or using insecure secret storage providers integrated with Kubernetes.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to external services or internal resources managed by the application within Kubernetes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Kubernetes Secrets objects for managing sensitive data.
        *   Consider using a Secrets Management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) integrated with Kubernetes via mechanisms like CSI drivers or webhook integrations.
        *   Enforce least privilege access to Secrets using Kubernetes RBAC.
        *   Encrypt secrets at rest using etcd encryption configured within the Kubernetes control plane.

## Attack Surface: [Ingress Controller Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/ingress_controller_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Ingress controller, which manages external access to services within the cluster.
    *   **How Kubernetes Contributes:** Kubernetes utilizes Ingress controllers to route external traffic to services, making them a direct and often exposed component of the Kubernetes networking layer.
    *   **Example:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in popular Ingress controllers like Nginx Ingress Controller or Traefik deployed within the Kubernetes cluster, leading to remote code execution or unauthorized access to backend services.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of backend services running within Kubernetes, ability to intercept or manipulate traffic destined for these services, potential for broader cluster compromise depending on the Ingress controller's privileges.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Ingress controller software running within Kubernetes up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Follow security best practices for Ingress controller configuration within Kubernetes manifests and deployments.
        *   Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules at the Ingress level to protect against common web attacks targeting services within the cluster.
        *   Regularly review and audit Ingress configurations defined within Kubernetes.

## Attack Surface: [Kubelet Compromise](./attack_surfaces/kubelet_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Kubelet, the agent running on each worker node that manages containers.
    *   **How Kubernetes Contributes:** The Kubelet is a core Kubernetes component responsible for executing commands and managing containers on worker nodes. Vulnerabilities here directly allow for node compromise within the Kubernetes environment.
    *   **Example:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the Kubelet API or leveraging misconfigurations in Kubelet settings to gain unauthorized access to node resources or execute commands on the worker node.
    *   **Impact:** Node compromise, ability to execute arbitrary commands on the node, potential to impact other workloads running on the same node managed by the compromised Kubelet.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Kubelet software on all worker nodes up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Secure the Kubelet API by disabling anonymous authentication and authorization and restricting access.
        *   Implement node-level security measures on the underlying operating system of the worker nodes.
