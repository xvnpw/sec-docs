# Attack Surface Analysis for kubernetes/kubernetes

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated/Unauthorized kube-apiserver Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticatedunauthorized_kube-apiserver_access.md)

*   **Description:**  The kube-apiserver, the central control point of Kubernetes, is accessible without proper authentication or authorization mechanisms.
*   **Kubernetes Contribution:** Kubernetes API server is the primary interface for managing the cluster. Misconfiguration or lack of authentication exposes this critical core component.
*   **Example:**  An attacker discovers the public IP address of the kube-apiserver and is able to use `kubectl` without credentials to list pods, create deployments, or even delete namespaces.
*   **Impact:** Complete cluster compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and unauthorized resource manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Authentication:**  Implement strong authentication mechanisms like TLS client certificates, OpenID Connect, or webhook token authentication.
    *   **Implement Authorization (RBAC):**  Utilize Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to define granular permissions for users and service accounts, following the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Restrict access to the kube-apiserver to authorized networks using firewalls or network policies. Consider using VPNs or bastion hosts for administrative access.
    *   **Audit Logging:** Enable and monitor API server audit logs to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.

## Attack Surface: [etcd Unauthenticated Access and Data Exposure](./attack_surfaces/etcd_unauthenticated_access_and_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** etcd, the Kubernetes datastore, is accessible without authentication or its data is exposed due to lack of encryption.
*   **Kubernetes Contribution:** Kubernetes relies on etcd to store all cluster state and secrets.  Default configurations might not enforce strong etcd security.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the etcd port (e.g., 2379) and uses `etcdctl` without authentication to read all cluster data, including secrets, or modify cluster configurations. Alternatively, unencrypted backups are compromised.
*   **Impact:** Complete cluster compromise, exposure of all secrets and sensitive data, potential data manipulation leading to instability or malicious actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable etcd Authentication:** Configure etcd with client certificate authentication to restrict access to authorized components like the kube-apiserver.
    *   **Enable etcd Encryption at Rest:**  Encrypt etcd data on disk to protect against physical access to storage.
    *   **Enable etcd Encryption in Transit (TLS):**  Use TLS to encrypt communication between etcd and the kube-apiserver, and between etcd members.
    *   **Secure etcd Backups:** Encrypt etcd backups and store them in secure locations with restricted access.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate etcd on a dedicated network segment, restricting access only to authorized Kubernetes control plane components.

## Attack Surface: [kubelet API Exposure and Container Escape](./attack_surfaces/kubelet_api_exposure_and_container_escape.md)

*   **Description:** The kubelet API is exposed and vulnerable, allowing unauthorized access to node and container operations, potentially leading to container escape.
*   **Kubernetes Contribution:** kubelet is a core Kubernetes node agent that manages containers. Its API, if not secured, becomes a direct attack vector to nodes managed by Kubernetes.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the kubelet API or gains unauthorized access to it (e.g., port 10250) to execute commands within a container, retrieve container logs, or potentially escape the container and gain node-level access.
*   **Impact:** Node compromise, container escape, data breaches, lateral movement within the cluster, denial of service on nodes.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **kubelet Authentication and Authorization:**  Enable kubelet authentication and authorization, using mechanisms like TLS client certificates and Node Authorization.
    *   **Restrict kubelet API Access:**  Use firewalls or network policies to restrict access to the kubelet API to only authorized components (like the kube-apiserver).
    *   **Regularly Patch kubelet and Container Runtime:** Keep kubelet and the underlying container runtime (Docker, containerd, CRI-O) up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Implement Container Security Best Practices:**  Use security contexts, resource limits, and seccomp profiles to strengthen container isolation and limit the impact of container escape.

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive RBAC Roles and Service Account Abuse](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_rbac_roles_and_service_account_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** RBAC roles grant excessive permissions, or default service accounts are not properly restricted, allowing compromised entities to perform unauthorized actions within the Kubernetes environment.
*   **Kubernetes Contribution:** Kubernetes' RBAC system, a core authorization feature, requires careful configuration. Default settings or overly broad roles can create vulnerabilities within the Kubernetes control plane.
*   **Example:** A compromised application pod, running with the default service account, is able to access secrets or resources in other namespaces due to overly permissive cluster-wide roles assigned to the default service account or a custom role with excessive permissions.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation within Kubernetes, unauthorized access to resources managed by Kubernetes, data breaches, lateral movement within the cluster.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to users and service accounts through RBAC roles.
    *   **Minimize Use of Cluster-Admin Role:**  Avoid granting the `cluster-admin` role unless absolutely necessary.
    *   **Restrict Default Service Account Permissions:**  Review and restrict the permissions of default service accounts. Consider disabling automounting of service account tokens when not needed.
    *   **Regular RBAC Audits:**  Periodically review and audit RBAC roles and bindings to ensure they are still appropriate and follow the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Namespace Isolation:**  Utilize namespaces to enforce logical separation and limit the scope of RBAC roles.

## Attack Surface: [Secrets Stored Unencrypted in etcd (Default)](./attack_surfaces/secrets_stored_unencrypted_in_etcd__default_.md)

*   **Description:** Kubernetes Secrets are stored unencrypted in etcd by default, making them highly vulnerable if etcd, a core Kubernetes component, is compromised.
*   **Kubernetes Contribution:** Kubernetes' default secret management, while convenient, has inherent security limitations regarding storage encryption within its core data store, etcd.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to etcd (e.g., through API server compromise or etcd misconfiguration) and is able to read all secrets stored in plain text, including database credentials, API keys, and TLS certificates managed by Kubernetes.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials and data managed by Kubernetes, complete application and potentially cluster compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable etcd Encryption at Rest (as mentioned before):** This is crucial for protecting secrets at rest within the Kubernetes data store.
    *   **Use External Secrets Management Solutions:**  Integrate with external secrets management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager) to store and manage secrets outside of etcd, often with encryption and more robust access control, bypassing Kubernetes default secret storage.
    *   **Sealed Secrets:** Consider using Sealed Secrets to encrypt secrets before storing them in Git or etcd, adding a layer of encryption to Kubernetes secret management workflows.
