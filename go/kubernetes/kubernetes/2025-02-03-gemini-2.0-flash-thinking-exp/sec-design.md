# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Kubernetes aims to provide a platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts.
  - The primary business priority is to enable users to reliably and efficiently run containerized applications at scale.
  - Key goals include:
    - Simplifying application deployment and management.
    - Improving resource utilization and infrastructure efficiency.
    - Enabling microservices architectures and cloud-native applications.
    - Providing a consistent platform across different infrastructure environments (on-premises, cloud, hybrid).

- Business Risks:
  - Availability and resilience of the platform itself, impacting all applications running on it.
  - Data integrity and consistency, especially for stateful applications.
  - Confidentiality of application data and Kubernetes secrets.
  - Compliance with various regulatory requirements depending on the applications and data being managed.
  - Complexity of configuration and operation leading to misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities.
  - Security vulnerabilities in Kubernetes components or dependencies that could be exploited.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - Implemented within the Kubernetes API Server to control access to Kubernetes resources.
  - security control: Network Policies - Implemented by network plugins to control network traffic between pods and namespaces.
  - security control: Pod Security Admission - Implemented within the Kubernetes API Server to enforce security policies on pods at the namespace level.
  - security control: Secrets Management - Implemented within the Kubernetes API Server to securely store and manage sensitive information like passwords and API keys.
  - security control: Image Security Scanning - Often integrated with container registries and admission controllers to scan container images for vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Audit Logging - Implemented within the Kubernetes API Server to record API requests for auditing and security monitoring.
  - security control: TLS Encryption - Used for communication between Kubernetes components and for external access to the API server.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Complexity of Kubernetes configuration can lead to misconfigurations that introduce security vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on third-party container images and dependencies introduces supply chain risks.
  - accepted risk: Zero-day vulnerabilities in Kubernetes components or dependencies may exist and could be exploited before patches are available.
  - accepted risk: Misuse of overly permissive RBAC roles can lead to unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) for Kubernetes development, including security requirements, threat modeling, secure coding practices, and security testing.
  - security control: Conduct regular security testing, including static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), and penetration testing, to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Implement a robust vulnerability management program to track, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities in Kubernetes components and dependencies.
  - security control: Enhance supply chain security by using signed container images, verifying dependencies, and securing the build pipeline.
  - security control: Implement security monitoring and incident response capabilities to detect and respond to security incidents in Kubernetes environments.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Securely authenticate users (human users and service accounts) accessing the Kubernetes API server.
    - Requirement: Support multiple authentication methods, including certificate-based authentication, token-based authentication, and OIDC.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement fine-grained authorization using RBAC to control access to Kubernetes resources based on the principle of least privilege.
    - Requirement: Enforce authorization policies consistently across all Kubernetes components.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Validate all inputs to the Kubernetes API server to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Validate configuration parameters and user-provided data to ensure they are within expected ranges and formats.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use strong cryptography to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    - Requirement: Encrypt Kubernetes secrets stored in etcd.
    - Requirement: Enforce TLS encryption for all communication between Kubernetes components and for external access to the API server.
    - Requirement: Properly manage and rotate cryptographic keys.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Process:
  - Orchestrating and running containerized applications reliably and securely is the critical business process. Any disruption or security breach in Kubernetes can impact all applications running on it.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Kubernetes manages various types of data, including:
    - Application Data: Data processed and stored by applications running on Kubernetes. Sensitivity varies depending on the application.
    - Kubernetes Configuration: YAML manifests, RBAC policies, network policies, etc. Sensitive as misconfiguration can lead to security issues.
    - Kubernetes Secrets: Credentials, API keys, certificates stored as Kubernetes secrets. Highly sensitive and require strong protection.
    - Audit Logs: Logs of API requests and events in Kubernetes. Sensitive as they can contain information about user activities and security events.
    - Container Images: Application code and dependencies packaged as container images. Sensitive as they contain application logic and potential vulnerabilities.

  - Data Sensitivity Levels:
    - Kubernetes Secrets: Highly Sensitive (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
    - Application Data: Sensitivity varies (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Compliance)
    - Kubernetes Configuration: Sensitive (Integrity, Availability)
    - Audit Logs: Sensitive (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Compliance)
    - Container Images: Sensitive (Integrity, Availability)
