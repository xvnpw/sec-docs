# Threat Model Analysis for kubernetes/kubernetes

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to the API Server](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_the_api_server.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the Kubernetes API server, the central control point. They might exploit weak authentication, misconfigurations, or exposed endpoints. Once in, they can use `kubectl` or API calls to control the cluster.
*   **Impact:** Full cluster compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, manipulation of workloads, privilege escalation.
*   **Kubernetes Component Affected:** `kube-apiserver`, Authentication and Authorization modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication (mutual TLS, OIDC).
    *   Enforce robust RBAC with least privilege.
    *   Secure API server network access (restrict to authorized networks).
    *   Regularly audit API server access logs.

## Threat: [etcd Compromise](./threats/etcd_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers compromise etcd, the key-value store holding cluster state and configuration. This can be through vulnerabilities, network access, or control plane node compromise. Access grants full cluster control.
*   **Impact:** Full cluster compromise, data loss, data corruption, denial of service.
*   **Kubernetes Component Affected:** `etcd`, etcd API.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Encrypt etcd data at rest and in transit.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for etcd access.
    *   Restrict network access to etcd (private network).
    *   Regularly backup etcd data.
    *   Monitor etcd health and performance.

## Threat: [Control Plane Component Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/control_plane_component_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

    *   Employ monitoring and alerting for DoS attacks.
    *   Consider managed Kubernetes service with built-in DoS protection.

## Threat: [Container Escape](./threats/container_escape.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the container runtime, kernel, or misconfigurations to escape the container and access the worker node OS.
*   **Impact:** Node compromise, access to other containers on the node, potential lateral movement, data exfiltration, privilege escalation.
*   **Kubernetes Component Affected:** Container Runtime (containerd, CRI-O), Kernel, Pod Security Context.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize secure container runtimes with security features enabled (seccomp, AppArmor/SELinux).
    *   Apply Security Contexts to Pods to restrict capabilities and privileges.
    *   Keep container runtime and kernel updated with security patches.
    *   Implement node hardening practices.

## Threat: [Kubelet Compromise](./threats/kubelet_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target the Kubelet agent on worker nodes. Exploiting vulnerabilities or gaining unauthorized network access allows control over the node and its containers.
*   **Impact:** Node compromise, container manipulation, denial of service on the node, potential lateral movement.
*   **Kubernetes Component Affected:** `kubelet`, Kubelet API.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable Kubelet authentication and authorization (TLS bootstrapping, webhook authorization).
    *   Restrict network access to the Kubelet API.
    *   Regularly update the Kubelet to the latest secure version.
    *   Harden the worker node operating system.

## Threat: [Insecure Network Policies (or Lack Thereof)](./threats/insecure_network_policies__or_lack_thereof_.md)

*   **Description:** Insufficient or missing Network Policies allow unrestricted network traffic between Pods and Namespaces, enabling lateral movement for attackers after initial compromise.
*   **Impact:** Lateral movement within the cluster, unauthorized access to services, data breaches.
*   **Kubernetes Component Affected:** Network Policy API, Network Policy Controller.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement Network Policies to enforce network segmentation and least privilege.
    *   Define default deny policies and explicitly allow necessary traffic.
    *   Regularly review and update Network Policies.

## Threat: [Ingress Misconfiguration](./threats/ingress_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigured Ingress resources can expose internal services, bypass security controls, or create vulnerabilities like path traversal or SSRF, leading to unintended access.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive services, security bypass, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Kubernetes Component Affected:** Ingress API, Ingress Controller.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely configure Ingress controllers and resources.
    *   Enforce TLS termination at the Ingress controller.
    *   Implement input validation in applications exposed through Ingress.
    *   Regularly audit Ingress configurations.

## Threat: [Service Account Abuse](./threats/service_account_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** Overly permissive service account permissions grant excessive privileges to pods. Attackers compromising a pod can abuse these permissions to access cluster resources they shouldn't.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to cluster resources, data manipulation.
*   **Kubernetes Component Affected:** Service Account API, RBAC.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Apply least privilege to Service Account permissions using RBAC.
