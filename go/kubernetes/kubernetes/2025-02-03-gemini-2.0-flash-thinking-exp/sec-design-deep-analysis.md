    * **Strategy:** **Enforce Strong Authentication and Fine-grained RBAC.**
    * **Actionable Steps:**
        1. **Implement OIDC or SAML integration for user authentication** to leverage organizational identity providers instead of relying solely on basic authentication or static tokens.
        2. **Regularly review and audit RBAC roles and bindings.** Use the principle of least privilege to grant only necessary permissions to users and service accounts. Utilize tools like `kubectl auth can-i` to verify effective permissions.
        3. **Enable and configure Admission Controllers effectively.** Leverage Pod Security Admission (PSA) to enforce baseline, restricted, or privileged security profiles at the namespace level. Consider using validating admission webhooks for more complex policy enforcement.
        4. **Disable anonymous authentication** to the API server to prevent unauthenticated access.
    * **Kubernetes Specificity:** Directly leverages Kubernetes RBAC and Admission Controller features.
