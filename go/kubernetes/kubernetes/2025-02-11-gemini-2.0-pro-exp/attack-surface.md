# Attack Surface Analysis for kubernetes/kubernetes

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized API Server Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_api_server_access.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining unauthorized access to the Kubernetes API server (kube-apiserver), the central control point.
    *   **How Kubernetes Contributes:** The API server is *the* core component for managing all cluster resources. Its design and function make it the primary target.
    *   **Example:** An attacker obtains leaked service account credentials or exploits a misconfigured RBAC policy allowing anonymous access to the API server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete cluster compromise. Full control over all resources, data, and workloads.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible. Use strong authentication mechanisms (OIDC, client certificates).  *Disable anonymous access*.
        *   **Robust RBAC:** Enforce the principle of least privilege with *granular* RBAC policies. Regularly audit and review RBAC. Avoid overly permissive roles.
        *   **Network Policies:** Restrict network access to the API server to *only* authorized clients (worker nodes, specific management tools).
        *   **API Server Auditing:** Enable and regularly review API server audit logs.
        *   **Keep Kubernetes Updated:** Regularly update Kubernetes to the latest stable release and patch version.

## Attack Surface: [Container Escape (to Host)](./attack_surfaces/container_escape__to_host_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker breaks out of a container's isolation and gains access to the underlying host operating system.
    *   **How Kubernetes Contributes:** Kubernetes orchestrates containers, and vulnerabilities in the *Kubernetes-managed container runtime* or the *kernel* (which Kubernetes relies on) can allow for escapes. Kubernetes configurations (like privileged containers) directly impact this risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in containerd (managed by kubelet) or a kernel vulnerability to gain root access on the host node.
    *   **Impact:** Host compromise, leading to potential lateral movement within the cluster and access to all data on the host.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Privileged Containers:** Do *not* run containers with the `--privileged` flag (or equivalent Kubernetes settings) unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        *   **Use AppArmor/Seccomp:** Implement AppArmor or Seccomp profiles (managed through Kubernetes) to restrict container system calls.
        *   **Pod Security Admission (PSA):** Use PSA to enforce security policies that prevent overly permissive pods.
        *   **Keep Container Runtime Updated:** Regularly update the *Kubernetes-managed* container runtime (e.g., containerd, CRI-O) to the latest version.
        *   **Kernel Updates:** Keep the host operating system's kernel (which Kubernetes relies on) updated.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised etcd](./attack_surfaces/compromised_etcd.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to or manipulation of the etcd data store.
    *   **How Kubernetes Contributes:** etcd is a *core, required component* of Kubernetes. Its security is entirely a Kubernetes concern.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains direct network access to etcd and reads or modifies cluster configuration, secrets, or other sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete cluster compromise or severe disruption. The attacker can manipulate the cluster state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict network access to etcd to *only* the API server and authorized components (using Kubernetes network policies).
        *   **etcd Encryption at Rest:** Enable encryption at rest for etcd data (a Kubernetes configuration option).
        *   **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Use strong authentication (e.g., client certificates, managed by Kubernetes) and authorization for etcd access.
        *   **Regular Backups:** Implement robust backup and recovery procedures for etcd data (a Kubernetes operational task).
        *   **Keep etcd Updated:** Regularly update etcd (part of the Kubernetes update process) to the latest patch version.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Network Policies](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_network_policies.md)

*   **Description:** Lack of or overly permissive network policies, allowing unintended communication between pods and services *within the Kubernetes cluster*.
    *   **How Kubernetes Contributes:** Network policies are a *core Kubernetes feature* for controlling network traffic *within the cluster*. Their configuration is entirely a Kubernetes concern.
    *   **Example:** A compromised pod in one namespace can access a database pod in another namespace because network policies are not in place.
    *   **Impact:** Increased blast radius of a compromise. Easier lateral movement within the cluster.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Default Deny Policy:** Implement a "deny-all" default network policy and explicitly allow only required traffic (using Kubernetes NetworkPolicy objects).
        *   **Least Privilege:** Define network policies that allow only the *necessary* communication between pods and services (again, using Kubernetes NetworkPolicy objects).
        *   **Namespace Isolation:** Use network policies to isolate namespaces (a core Kubernetes concept).
        *   **Regular Review:** Regularly review and audit network policies (a Kubernetes operational task).

## Attack Surface: [Secrets Mismanagement (within Kubernetes)](./attack_surfaces/secrets_mismanagement__within_kubernetes_.md)

*   **Description:** Improper storage or handling of sensitive data *using Kubernetes Secrets*.
    *   **How Kubernetes Contributes:** Kubernetes *provides* Secrets objects, and their proper use is a direct Kubernetes security concern.
    *   **Example:** Access to Kubernetes Secrets is not properly restricted via RBAC, allowing unauthorized pods to read them.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, potential for privilege escalation *within the cluster*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Kubernetes Secrets:** Store sensitive data in Kubernetes Secrets objects (as opposed to environment variables or config maps).
        *   **Encryption at Rest:** Enable encryption at rest for Kubernetes Secrets (a Kubernetes configuration option).
        *   **RBAC for Secrets:** Use RBAC (a core Kubernetes feature) to restrict access to Secrets to *only* authorized pods and users.
        *   **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:** Never hardcode secrets in application code or configuration files (best practice, but relevant to how secrets are *used* within Kubernetes).
