# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for kubernetes/kubernetes

## Mitigation Strategy: [RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Hardening](./mitigation_strategies/rbac__role-based_access_control__hardening.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Strict Least Privilege RBAC.

**Description:**
1.  **Analyze Requirements:** Identify all necessary actions each user, service account, and group needs to perform within the cluster. Document these requirements.
2.  **Create Roles:** Define granular Kubernetes Roles (namespaced) and ClusterRoles (cluster-wide) that grant *only* the specific permissions identified in step 1. Avoid using pre-defined roles like `cluster-admin` unless absolutely necessary and fully justified. Use verbs (get, list, watch, create, update, patch, delete) and resources (pods, deployments, services, secrets, etc.) to define permissions.
3.  **Create RoleBindings/ClusterRoleBindings:** Bind the created Roles/ClusterRoles to specific users, service accounts, or groups using RoleBindings (namespaced) and ClusterRoleBindings (cluster-wide).
4.  **Regular Audits:** At least quarterly, review all Roles, ClusterRoles, RoleBindings, and ClusterRoleBindings. Use tools like `kubectl auth can-i` to test permissions and identify overly permissive configurations.
5.  **Namespace Isolation:** Use Kubernetes namespaces to logically separate different applications, teams, or environments. Apply RBAC at the namespace level to limit the scope of access.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents users or compromised service accounts from accessing resources they shouldn't.
*   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Limits the ability of an attacker who gains access to a low-privilege account from escalating to higher privileges.
*   **Accidental Misconfiguration (Medium Severity):** Reduces the impact of accidental changes to the cluster by limiting the blast radius.
*   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Limits the damage a malicious insider can do by restricting their access.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced by 80-90%. Significantly limits the scope of potential breaches.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced by 70-80%. Makes it much harder for attackers to gain control of the cluster.
*   **Accidental Misconfiguration:** Risk reduced by 50-60%. Limits the impact of errors.
*   **Insider Threats:** Risk reduced by 60-70%. Reduces the potential damage.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic Roles and RoleBindings are defined for the `development` and `production` namespaces.
*   Service accounts are used for application deployments.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No regular audit process is in place.
*   Some Roles are still overly permissive (e.g., granting `list` access to all resources within a namespace).
*   No specific roles for operators.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Policy Enforcement](./mitigation_strategies/network_policy_enforcement.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Default-Deny Network Policies.

**Description:**
1.  **Ensure Network Policy Support:** Verify that your installed Kubernetes network plugin (e.g., Calico, Cilium, Weave Net) supports NetworkPolicies. This is a prerequisite.
2.  **Create Default Deny Policy:** Create a NetworkPolicy in each namespace that denies all ingress and egress traffic by default. This acts as a baseline security posture. This policy will have an empty `podSelector` and empty `ingress`/`egress` rules.
3.  **Define Allow Rules:** Create specific NetworkPolicies that *allow* only the necessary communication between pods and namespaces. Use pod selectors, namespace selectors, and IP block selectors (if supported by your network plugin) to define the allowed traffic flows. Consider both ingress and egress rules.
4.  **Regular Review:** Review and update NetworkPolicies as the application architecture changes. This should be part of the regular deployment process.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Lateral Movement (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from moving laterally between pods and namespaces after compromising a single pod.
*   **Unauthorized Communication (Medium Severity):** Blocks communication between pods that shouldn't be talking to each other.
*   **Data Exfiltration (Medium Severity):** Makes it harder for attackers to exfiltrate data from compromised pods.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Low Severity):** Can help mitigate some DoS attacks by limiting network traffic.

**Impact:**
*   **Lateral Movement:** Risk reduced by 70-80%. Significantly limits the spread of attacks.
*   **Unauthorized Communication:** Risk reduced by 80-90%. Enforces strict communication rules.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced by 60-70%. Adds another layer of defense.
*   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced by 20-30%. Provides limited protection.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Calico is installed as the network plugin.
*   Basic NetworkPolicies are in place to allow communication between specific services.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No default-deny policy is implemented. The cluster relies on explicitly allowing traffic.
*   No regular review process for NetworkPolicies.
*   Egress rules are not consistently defined.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pod Security Context Hardening](./mitigation_strategies/pod_security_context_hardening.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Least Privilege Pod Security Contexts and use Pod Security Admission.

**Description:**
1.  **Define Security Contexts:** For each pod/container, define a `securityContext` in the pod specification.
2.  **Run as Non-Root:** Set `runAsUser` and `runAsGroup` to a non-zero UID/GID.  Create a dedicated user within the container image for the application.
3.  **Drop Capabilities:** Use `capabilities.drop` to remove unnecessary Linux capabilities.  Start with dropping `ALL` and add back only the strictly required capabilities.
4.  **Read-Only Root Filesystem:** Set `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` if the application doesn't need to write to the root filesystem.
5.  **Resource Limits:** Set `resources.limits` for CPU and memory to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
6. **Seccomp Profiles (Optional but Recommended):** Define and use seccomp profiles to restrict the system calls that containers can make.  Kubernetes provides a way to load custom seccomp profiles.
7.  **Pod Security Admission:** Use the built-in Pod Security Admission controller (PSA) to enforce these security context settings cluster-wide. Configure PSA with predefined profiles (e.g., `baseline`, `restricted`) or create custom admission configuration. This replaces the deprecated PodSecurityPolicy.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Container Escape (High Severity):** Reduces the impact of a container escape vulnerability by limiting the privileges of the container process.
*   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Makes it harder for an attacker to gain root privileges within the container.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Prevents containers from consuming excessive resources and impacting other pods.
*   **Unauthorized System Calls (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential damage from malicious code by restricting system calls.

**Impact:**
*   **Container Escape:** Risk reduced by 60-70%.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced by 70-80%.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced by 80-90%.
*   **Unauthorized System Calls:** Risk reduced by 50-60%.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Resource limits (CPU and memory) are set for some pods.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Most containers run as root.
*   Capabilities are not explicitly dropped.
*   `readOnlyRootFilesystem` is not used.
*   No seccomp profiles are used.
*   No Pod Security Admission controller is configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Kubernetes Secrets (Basic Protection)](./mitigation_strategies/kubernetes_secrets__basic_protection_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Use Kubernetes Secrets with etcd Encryption at Rest.

**Description:**
1.  **Create Secrets:** Store sensitive data (API keys, credentials) as Kubernetes Secrets objects.  This provides base64 encoding (which is *not* encryption).
2.  **Mount Secrets:** Mount the Secrets as volumes or environment variables within your pods.  Prefer volumes for better security.
3.  **Enable etcd Encryption:**  *Crucially*, configure your Kubernetes cluster to encrypt etcd data at rest.  This is a cluster-level configuration, often done during cluster setup.  The specific method depends on your Kubernetes distribution and cloud provider (if applicable). This protects the Secrets data stored in etcd.
4. **Limit Secret Access:** Use RBAC to restrict access to Secrets objects. Only grant necessary permissions to service accounts that need to access specific Secrets.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Credential Exposure (Medium Severity):** Provides a basic level of protection against accidental exposure of credentials in configuration files or logs (compared to plain text).
*   **Unauthorized Access to Secrets (Medium Severity):** RBAC limits who can read the Secrets objects.
*   **Data at Rest (Medium Severity):** etcd encryption protects the secret data if the underlying storage is compromised.

**Impact:**
*   **Credential Exposure:** Risk reduced by 40-50% (compared to plain text).
*   **Unauthorized Access to Secrets:** Risk reduced by 60-70% (with proper RBAC).
*   **Data at Rest:** Risk reduced by 70-80% (with etcd encryption).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Kubernetes Secrets are used to store some sensitive data (base64 encoded).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   etcd encryption at rest is NOT enabled.
*   Sensitive data is sometimes stored in environment variables.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Quotas and Limit Ranges](./mitigation_strategies/resource_quotas_and_limit_ranges.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Resource Quotas and Limit Ranges

**Description:**
1.  **Define LimitRanges:** In each namespace, create `LimitRange` objects to define default and maximum resource limits (CPU, memory, storage) for containers and pods. This prevents a single pod from consuming excessive resources.
2.  **Define ResourceQuotas:** Create `ResourceQuota` objects in each namespace to limit the *total* amount of resources (CPU, memory, storage, number of pods, etc.) that can be consumed by all pods within that namespace. This prevents resource exhaustion at the namespace level.
3.  **Enforcement:** Kubernetes automatically enforces these limits. Pods that exceed the `LimitRange` will not be scheduled.  If a namespace exceeds its `ResourceQuota`, new resource creation will be denied.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents resource exhaustion attacks that could make the cluster or applications unavailable.
*   **Resource Contention (Low Severity):** Ensures fair resource allocation among different applications and teams.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced by 70-80%.
*   **Resource Contention:** Risk reduced by 60-70%.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   None

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No `LimitRange` objects are defined.
*   No `ResourceQuota` objects are defined.
