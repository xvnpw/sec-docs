# Attack Tree Analysis for kubernetes/kubernetes

Objective: Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and/or achieve arbitrary code execution within the application's containers or the Kubernetes cluster itself, leading to data exfiltration, service disruption, or lateral movement within the cluster.

## Attack Tree Path: [[*** Compromise Application via Kubernetes ***]](./attack_tree_paths/__compromise_application_via_kubernetes__.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching goal of the attacker. All subsequent nodes and paths represent ways to achieve this compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Very High (as it encompasses all successful attack paths)
*   **Impact:** Very High (complete compromise of the application and potentially the cluster)
*   **Effort:** Varies depending on the specific path taken.
*   **Skill Level:** Varies depending on the specific path taken.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies depending on the specific path taken.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Compromise Cluster]](./attack_tree_paths/_compromise_cluster_.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining control over the entire Kubernetes cluster, allowing manipulation of all applications running on it.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (requires exploiting cluster-level vulnerabilities or misconfigurations)
*   **Impact:** Very High (complete control over the cluster)
*   **Effort:** Varies, but generally Medium to High.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard.

## Attack Tree Path: [[*** RBAC Abuse ***]](./attack_tree_paths/__rbac_abuse__.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting overly permissive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configurations.
*   **Likelihood:** High (common misconfiguration)
*   **Impact:** Very High (potential for cluster-wide compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **`[*** Overly Permissive Service Account Token ***]` (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** A pod's service account token has excessive permissions, allowing an attacker who compromises the pod to escalate privileges within the cluster.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        1.  Attacker compromises a pod (e.g., through a vulnerability in the application).
        2.  Attacker obtains the service account token from within the pod (usually mounted at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`).
        3.  Attacker uses the token to make API calls with elevated privileges, potentially gaining control of the cluster.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires monitoring API server audit logs for suspicious activity by service accounts)

## Attack Tree Path: [[Compromise Application Directly]](./attack_tree_paths/_compromise_application_directly_.md)

*    **Description:** Targeting the application's containers or services without necessarily compromising the entire cluster.
*    **Likelihood:** High
*    **Impact:** High to Very High
*    **Effort:** Low to High
*    **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Expert
*    **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [[*** Container Escape ***]](./attack_tree_paths/__container_escape__.md)

*   **Description:** Breaking out of a compromised container to gain access to the host node.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on vulnerabilities in the container image and runtime)
*   **Impact:** High (access to the host node and potentially other containers)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

    *   **`[*** Vulnerable Image ***]` (Critical Node):**
        *   **Description:** The application uses a container image with known vulnerabilities that allow for container escape.
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            1.  Attacker identifies a vulnerable container image used by the application.
            2.  Attacker exploits the vulnerability within the container (e.g., a kernel exploit, a vulnerability in the container runtime).
            3.  Attacker gains access to the host node's operating system.
            4.  Attacker can then access other containers, data, or resources on the node.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires advanced intrusion detection and container security monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [[*** Misconfigured Service ***]](./attack_tree_paths/__misconfigured_service__.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting a misconfigured Kubernetes service.
*   **Likelihood:** High (common misconfiguration)
*   **Impact:** High (unauthorized access to the service and potentially other resources)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **`[*** Missing/Weak NetworkPolicy ***]` (Critical Node):**
        *   **Description:** The service is exposed to the entire cluster (or even externally) due to a missing or overly permissive NetworkPolicy.
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            1.  Attacker discovers a service that is not protected by a NetworkPolicy or has a policy that allows unintended access.
            2.  Attacker directly accesses the service from another pod within the cluster (or externally, if exposed).
            3.  Attacker interacts with the service, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or exploiting vulnerabilities.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires monitoring network traffic and reviewing NetworkPolicy configurations)
