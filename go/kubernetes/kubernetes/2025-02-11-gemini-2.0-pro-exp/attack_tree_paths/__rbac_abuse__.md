# Deep Analysis: Kubernetes RBAC Abuse - Overly Permissive Service Account Token

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the threat posed by overly permissive service account tokens in a Kubernetes cluster, specifically focusing on how an attacker might exploit this misconfiguration to escalate privileges and potentially compromise the entire cluster.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities, attack vectors, mitigation strategies, and detection methods related to this attack path.  This analysis will inform the development team about secure coding practices, configuration best practices, and monitoring requirements.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following:

*   **Kubernetes Environment:**  The analysis assumes a Kubernetes cluster based on the upstream `github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes` project.  We are not considering vendor-specific extensions or managed Kubernetes services (like GKE, EKS, AKS) *except* where those services directly interact with core Kubernetes RBAC mechanisms.
*   **Service Account Tokens:**  We are specifically concerned with the default service account tokens and those explicitly created and assigned to pods.  We are *not* directly analyzing user-based RBAC (e.g., `kubectl` access for developers).
*   **Attack Path:** The analysis follows the provided attack tree path:  RBAC Abuse -> Overly Permissive Service Account Token.  We will explore the specific steps an attacker would take within this path.
*   **Impact:** We will assess the potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the cluster and its hosted applications.
* **Mitigation and Detection:** We will identify the best practices to prevent and detect this attack.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use the provided attack tree as a starting point and expand upon it by considering various attack scenarios and attacker motivations.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  We will examine the Kubernetes RBAC system and identify specific configurations and code patterns that could lead to overly permissive service account tokens.
3.  **Exploitation Analysis:**  We will detail the steps an attacker would take to exploit a vulnerable configuration, including specific commands and API calls.
4.  **Mitigation Review:**  We will identify and evaluate various mitigation strategies, including Kubernetes best practices, security policies, and third-party tools.
5.  **Detection Analysis:**  We will explore methods for detecting this type of attack, focusing on Kubernetes audit logs, security monitoring tools, and anomaly detection.
6. **Documentation Review:** We will review official Kubernetes documentation, security advisories, and community best practices.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path: Overly Permissive Service Account Token

### 4.1. Threat Model and Attack Scenarios

**Attacker Motivation:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data stored in the cluster (e.g., secrets, configuration data, application data).
*   **Resource Hijacking:**  Using cluster resources for malicious purposes (e.g., cryptomining, launching DDoS attacks).
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Using the compromised pod as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.
*   **Cluster Disruption:**  Causing denial of service or damaging the cluster infrastructure.
*   **Reputation Damage:**  Compromising the cluster to damage the organization's reputation.

**Attack Scenarios:**

1.  **Default Service Account Abuse:**  An application running with the default service account in a namespace (which might have overly broad permissions granted by default or by an administrator) is compromised.  The attacker uses the default service account token to access other resources in the cluster.
2.  **Explicitly Over-Permissioned Service Account:**  A developer creates a new service account for a specific application but mistakenly assigns it overly broad permissions (e.g., `cluster-admin` role, or a custom role with excessive privileges).  The application is compromised, and the attacker leverages the powerful service account.
3.  **Compromised CI/CD Pipeline:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD pipeline and modifies the deployment configuration to use a more privileged service account or inject a malicious sidecar container with elevated privileges.
4.  **Legacy Application Migration:** An application migrated from a non-containerized environment is deployed to Kubernetes without proper RBAC review.  The application might require broad permissions in its original environment, which are inadvertently translated to overly permissive service account settings in Kubernetes.

### 4.2. Vulnerability Analysis

**Key Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Default Service Account Permissions:**  In some Kubernetes distributions or older versions, the default service account in a namespace might have more permissions than necessary.  Administrators might not be aware of these default permissions.
*   **Lack of Least Privilege Principle:**  Developers or administrators often grant excessive permissions to service accounts for convenience or due to a lack of understanding of the required permissions.  This violates the principle of least privilege.
*   **Improper Role and RoleBinding/ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding Usage:**
    *   Using `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` when `Role` and `RoleBinding` would suffice (granting cluster-wide access instead of namespace-specific access).
    *   Creating custom `Roles` or `ClusterRoles` with overly broad verbs (e.g., `*` for all verbs) or resources (e.g., `*` for all resources).
    *   Binding service accounts to overly permissive roles (e.g., `cluster-admin`).
*   **Missing Network Policies:**  Even with proper RBAC, a lack of network policies can allow a compromised pod to communicate with other pods or services it shouldn't, facilitating lateral movement.
*   **Insufficient Auditing and Monitoring:**  Without proper auditing and monitoring, it can be difficult to detect suspicious activity associated with service account tokens.
* **AutomountServiceAccountToken not set to false:** If not explicitly set, Kubernetes will automatically mount service account token.

### 4.3. Exploitation Analysis

**Attacker Steps (Detailed):**

1.  **Initial Compromise:** The attacker gains access to a running pod.  This could be achieved through:
    *   **Application Vulnerability:** Exploiting a vulnerability in the application code (e.g., SQL injection, remote code execution, command injection).
    *   **Container Image Vulnerability:**  Exploiting a vulnerability in a container image used by the pod.
    *   **Misconfigured Service:**  Exploiting a misconfigured service exposed by the pod (e.g., an exposed debug port).
    *   **Stolen Credentials:** Obtaining leaked or stolen credentials that allow access to the pod (e.g., via `kubectl exec`).

2.  **Token Acquisition:**  The attacker locates and obtains the service account token.  This is typically found at:
    ```bash
    /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
    ```
    The attacker can simply read this file:
    ```bash
    cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
    ```

3.  **API Interaction:** The attacker uses the token to authenticate to the Kubernetes API server.  They can use tools like `curl` or `kubectl` (if installed within the container).  Example using `curl`:
    ```bash
    TOKEN=$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://<kubernetes-api-server>/api/v1/namespaces
    ```
    Or, if `kubectl` is available:
    ```bash
    kubectl auth can-i --list --token=$TOKEN  # Check permissions
    kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --token=$TOKEN # List all pods
    kubectl create deployment ... --token=$TOKEN # Create a malicious deployment
    ```

4.  **Privilege Escalation:**  Depending on the permissions associated with the token, the attacker can perform various actions, including:
    *   **Listing Resources:**  Viewing pods, deployments, secrets, configmaps, etc., across the cluster or within specific namespaces.
    *   **Creating Resources:**  Deploying new pods, services, deployments, etc., potentially with malicious code.
    *   **Modifying Resources:**  Altering existing deployments, injecting malicious sidecar containers, modifying secrets.
    *   **Deleting Resources:**  Deleting pods, deployments, services, causing denial of service.
    *   **Accessing Secrets:**  Reading sensitive data stored in Kubernetes secrets.
    *   **Executing Commands in Other Pods:**  Using `kubectl exec` to gain shell access to other pods in the cluster.
    *   **Gaining Node Access:**  In extreme cases, if the service account has permissions to create privileged pods, the attacker might be able to gain access to the underlying host nodes.

5.  **Lateral Movement and Persistence:** The attacker uses the escalated privileges to move laterally within the cluster, compromise other pods and services, and establish persistence (e.g., by creating a backdoor pod or modifying existing deployments).

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

**Preventative Measures:**

1.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant service accounts *only* the minimum necessary permissions.  Avoid using the default service account for applications.  Create dedicated service accounts for each application with specific roles.
2.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    *   Use `Role` and `RoleBinding` for namespace-specific permissions whenever possible.  Avoid `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` unless absolutely necessary.
    *   Carefully define `Roles` and `ClusterRoles` with specific verbs (e.g., `get`, `list`, `watch`, `create`, `update`, `delete`) and resources (e.g., `pods`, `deployments`, `secrets`).  Avoid using wildcards (`*`) unless strictly required.
    *   Regularly audit and review RBAC configurations.
3.  **Service Account Token Management:**
    *   **Disable Automounting:** Set `automountServiceAccountToken: false` in the pod specification if the application doesn't need to access the Kubernetes API. This prevents the token from being automatically mounted.
    *   **Use Short-Lived Tokens:**  Consider using projected service account tokens (available in newer Kubernetes versions) which have a limited lifetime and are automatically rotated.
    *   **TokenRequest API:** Utilize the `TokenRequest` API to obtain short-lived, audience-bound tokens for specific purposes.
4.  **Network Policies:**  Implement network policies to restrict network traffic between pods and namespaces.  This limits the blast radius of a compromised pod, even if it has elevated privileges.
5.  **Pod Security Policies (PSP) / Pod Security Admission (PSA):**
    *   **PSP (Deprecated):**  In older Kubernetes versions, use Pod Security Policies to enforce security constraints on pods, including restrictions on service account usage.
    *   **PSA (Recommended):** In newer versions, use the built-in Pod Security Admission controller to enforce similar security standards.  This can prevent pods from running with overly permissive service accounts.
6.  **Image Security:**  Use secure base images, scan container images for vulnerabilities, and regularly update images to patch known vulnerabilities.
7.  **Secure Coding Practices:**  Develop applications with security in mind, following secure coding guidelines to prevent vulnerabilities that could lead to initial pod compromise.
8.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the Kubernetes cluster, including RBAC configurations, network policies, and application security.
9. **Limit Admission Controller:** Use admission controllers like Kyverno or OPA Gatekeeper to enforce custom security policies, including restrictions on service account permissions.

### 4.5. Detection Methods

1.  **Kubernetes Audit Logs:**  Enable and monitor Kubernetes audit logs.  Look for:
    *   **Suspicious API Calls:**  Unusual or unexpected API calls made by service accounts, especially those involving resource creation, modification, or deletion.
    *   **Failed Authentication Attempts:**  Repeated failed authentication attempts using service account tokens.
    *   **Access to Sensitive Resources:**  Service accounts accessing secrets or other sensitive resources they shouldn't be accessing.
    *   **Changes to RBAC Configurations:**  Unauthorized modifications to `Roles`, `RoleBindings`, `ClusterRoles`, or `ClusterRoleBindings`.
    *  Filter audit logs by `userAgent` to identify requests made by service accounts (typically, the user agent will be the name of the service account).

2.  **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate Kubernetes audit logs with a SIEM system for centralized logging, analysis, and alerting.

3.  **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  Deploy network-based or host-based intrusion detection systems to monitor for suspicious network traffic or system activity.

4.  **Anomaly Detection:**  Use machine learning or statistical analysis to detect anomalous behavior by service accounts.  This can help identify deviations from normal usage patterns.

5.  **Security Monitoring Tools:**  Utilize specialized Kubernetes security monitoring tools (e.g., Falco, Sysdig Secure, Aqua Security, Prisma Cloud) that can detect and respond to security threats in real-time.  These tools often provide pre-built rules for detecting RBAC abuse and other Kubernetes-specific attacks.

6.  **Runtime Security Monitoring:**  Monitor the behavior of running pods for suspicious activity, such as unexpected network connections, file system modifications, or process executions.

7. **Regular Expressions and Log Analysis:** Use regular expressions to search for patterns in audit logs that indicate potential attacks. For example, search for log entries where a service account is attempting to create resources it shouldn't have access to.

### 4.6. Example Audit Log Analysis

Here's an example of how you might analyze Kubernetes audit logs to detect suspicious activity:

**Scenario:** An attacker compromises a pod running with an overly permissive service account and attempts to create a new deployment.

**Audit Log Entry (Simplified):**

```json
{
  "kind": "Event",
  "apiVersion": "audit.k8s.io/v1",
  "level": "RequestResponse",
  "auditID": "...",
  "stage": "ResponseComplete",
  "requestURI": "/apis/apps/v1/namespaces/default/deployments",
  "verb": "create",
  "user": {
    "username": "system:serviceaccount:default:my-service-account",
    "groups": [
      "system:serviceaccounts",
      "system:serviceaccounts:default",
      "system:authenticated"
    ]
  },
  "sourceIPs": [
    "..."
  ],
  "userAgent": "kubectl/v1.25.0 (linux/amd64) ...",
  "objectRef": {
    "resource": "deployments",
    "namespace": "default",
    "name": "malicious-deployment"
  },
  "responseStatus": {
    "metadata": {},
    "code": 201
  },
  "requestObject": {
    ... // Details of the deployment being created
  },
  "responseObject": {
    ... // Details of the created deployment
  }
}
```

**Analysis:**

*   **`user.username`:**  Identifies the service account (`system:serviceaccount:default:my-service-account`) making the request.
*   **`verb`:**  Shows the action being performed (`create`).
*   **`objectRef.resource`:**  Indicates the resource type (`deployments`).
*   **`objectRef.namespace`:**  Specifies the namespace (`default`).
*   **`objectRef.name`:**  Shows the name of the deployment being created (`malicious-deployment`).
*   **`responseStatus.code`:**  Indicates the HTTP status code (201 - Created).

**Detection Logic:**

1.  **Baseline:** Establish a baseline of normal activity for the `my-service-account` service account.  This might involve tracking the types of API calls it typically makes, the resources it accesses, and the namespaces it operates in.
2.  **Anomaly Detection:**  If the service account starts making unusual API calls (e.g., creating deployments, which it normally doesn't do), this could trigger an alert.
3.  **Rule-Based Detection:**  Create a rule that triggers an alert if `my-service-account` attempts to create a deployment with a name matching a suspicious pattern (e.g., `malicious-*`).
4.  **RBAC Review:**  If an alert is triggered, review the RBAC configuration for `my-service-account` to determine if it has excessive permissions.

## 5. Conclusion

Overly permissive service account tokens represent a significant security risk in Kubernetes clusters. By understanding the attack vectors, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, development teams can build more secure applications and configurations.  Implementing a combination of preventative measures (least privilege, RBAC, network policies) and detection methods (audit logging, security monitoring) is crucial for protecting Kubernetes clusters from this type of attack.  Regular security audits and continuous monitoring are essential for maintaining a strong security posture.
