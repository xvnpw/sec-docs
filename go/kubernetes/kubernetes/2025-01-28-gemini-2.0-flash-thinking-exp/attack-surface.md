# Attack Surface Analysis for kubernetes/kubernetes

## Attack Surface: [1. Unauthenticated API Server Access](./attack_surfaces/1__unauthenticated_api_server_access.md)

*   **Description:**  Exposure of the Kubernetes API server without proper authentication. This Kubernetes component, the central control plane, becomes accessible to unauthorized entities.
*   **Kubernetes Contribution:** Kubernetes API server is the core management interface. Lack of enforced authentication is a Kubernetes configuration issue that directly exposes the cluster.
*   **Example:**  A Kubernetes cluster is deployed with the API server exposed to the internet and anonymous authentication enabled, or with weak authentication methods. Attackers can directly use `kubectl` to control the cluster.
*   **Impact:** Full cluster compromise, complete control over Kubernetes resources and applications, data breaches, denial of service, and malicious deployments.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Strong Authentication:** Enforce robust authentication methods for API server access, such as mutual TLS (mTLS), OpenID Connect (OIDC), or webhook token authentication.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict network access to the API server using firewalls and network policies, limiting access to authorized networks and administrative IPs.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Continuously audit API server authentication configurations to ensure adherence to security best practices and prevent misconfigurations.

## Attack Surface: [2. RBAC Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/2__rbac_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitable misconfigurations or vulnerabilities within Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This Kubernetes authorization system, when flawed, allows unauthorized actions.
*   **Kubernetes Contribution:** Kubernetes relies on RBAC for access control. Misconfigurations in RBAC policies are Kubernetes-specific vulnerabilities that directly lead to privilege escalation.
*   **Example:**  A user is granted `get` pod permissions, but due to a misconfigured RoleBinding or a flaw in RBAC policy evaluation, they can escalate to create deployments or access secrets they shouldn't.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation within the Kubernetes cluster, unauthorized access to sensitive resources, potential data breaches, and ability to perform malicious actions beyond intended permissions.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege RBAC:** Implement RBAC policies strictly adhering to the principle of least privilege. Grant only necessary permissions, avoiding overly broad roles.
    *   **Regular RBAC Policy Reviews:**  Conduct periodic audits of RBAC roles and role bindings to identify and rectify overly permissive configurations or unintended access grants.
    *   **Namespace-Scoped Roles:** Favor namespace-specific roles over cluster-wide roles to limit the scope of potential privilege escalation.
    *   **Automated RBAC Enforcement:** Utilize tools and processes to automatically validate and enforce RBAC policies, detecting deviations from secure configurations.

## Attack Surface: [3. Exposed kubelet API](./attack_surfaces/3__exposed_kubelet_api.md)

*   **Description:** Unprotected exposure of the kubelet API on Kubernetes worker nodes. This Kubernetes node agent API, if accessible, allows direct node and container manipulation.
*   **Kubernetes Contribution:** kubelet is a core Kubernetes component on each node. Exposing its API without proper authentication is a Kubernetes configuration vulnerability that directly compromises node security.
*   **Example:** The kubelet API (port 10250) is exposed on worker nodes without authentication or authorization. Attackers gaining network access can use this Kubernetes API to execute commands in containers or on the host node.
*   **Impact:** Kubernetes node compromise, container escape, potential data breaches by accessing node resources, denial of service by disrupting node operations, and lateral movement within the cluster from a compromised node.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **kubelet API Authentication & Authorization:**  Enable and enforce strong authentication and authorization for the kubelet API using modes like `Webhook` or `X509` provided by Kubernetes.
    *   **Network Isolation for kubelet:**  Restrict network access to the kubelet API using firewalls and network policies, allowing only control plane components (API server, etc.) to communicate with it.
    *   **Disable Anonymous kubelet Authentication:** Ensure anonymous authentication is explicitly disabled for the kubelet API to prevent unauthorized access.

## Attack Surface: [4. Permissive Network Policies (or Lack Thereof)](./attack_surfaces/4__permissive_network_policies__or_lack_thereof_.md)

*   **Description:**  Absence or misconfiguration of Kubernetes Network Policies leading to unrestricted network traffic within the cluster. This Kubernetes networking feature, when not utilized or misconfigured, negates network segmentation.
*   **Kubernetes Contribution:** Kubernetes Network Policies are the primary mechanism for enforcing network segmentation within a cluster. Failure to implement or properly configure them is a Kubernetes-specific security gap.
*   **Example:** A Kubernetes cluster operates without Network Policies. If a web application pod is compromised, attackers can freely move laterally within the cluster network, accessing databases or other sensitive services in different namespaces without network restrictions.
*   **Impact:** Uncontrolled lateral movement within the Kubernetes cluster, unauthorized access to services and data across namespaces, increased blast radius of security incidents, and potential for widespread compromise from a single point of entry.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Network Policy Implementation:**  Implement Kubernetes Network Policies to enforce network segmentation between namespaces, pods, and services based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Default Deny Network Policies:**  Consider adopting default-deny network policies to establish a zero-trust network posture within the cluster, explicitly allowing only necessary traffic flows.
    *   **Regular Network Policy Review & Updates:**  Periodically review and update Network Policies to ensure they remain effective, aligned with application needs, and adapt to evolving security requirements.

## Attack Surface: [5. Secrets Stored Unencrypted in etcd](./attack_surfaces/5__secrets_stored_unencrypted_in_etcd.md)

*   **Description:** Kubernetes Secrets, by default, are stored in etcd (the Kubernetes data store) in an unencrypted format (base64 encoded, not encrypted). This Kubernetes default behavior exposes secrets if etcd is compromised.
*   **Kubernetes Contribution:** Kubernetes' default secret management, while functional, has an inherent security weakness in its default storage method. This is a Kubernetes-specific design aspect that requires explicit mitigation.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to etcd. They can retrieve Kubernetes Secrets, which are only base64 encoded, and easily decode them to obtain sensitive credentials like database passwords or API keys.
*   **Impact:** Direct exposure of sensitive credentials stored as Kubernetes Secrets, leading to data breaches, compromise of applications and external services relying on these secrets, and potential for wider system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable etcd Encryption at Rest:** Configure Kubernetes to enable encryption at rest for etcd using encryption providers like KMS (Key Management Service) or Vault, a Kubernetes configuration step.
    *   **External Secret Management Integration:** Integrate with external, dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider secret managers) to store and manage secrets securely outside of etcd, a Kubernetes integration strategy.
    *   **Minimize Secret Storage in Kubernetes:** Reduce reliance on Kubernetes Secrets by exploring alternative approaches for credential management where feasible, minimizing the attack surface related to Kubernetes secret storage.
