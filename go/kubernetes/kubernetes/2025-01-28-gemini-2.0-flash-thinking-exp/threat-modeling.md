# Threat Model Analysis for kubernetes/kubernetes

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to API Server](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_api_server.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Kubernetes API server, potentially by exploiting weak authentication, misconfigured RBAC, or vulnerabilities in authentication plugins. They might use stolen credentials, exploit exposed API server ports, or bypass authentication mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Full cluster compromise, including the ability to deploy malicious workloads, exfiltrate secrets, disrupt services, and modify cluster configurations.
*   **Kubernetes Component Affected:** API Server, Authentication & Authorization modules (RBAC, Service Accounts, Admission Controllers)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable strong authentication methods (e.g., mutual TLS, OIDC).
    *   Implement and enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with least privilege.
    *   Regularly audit RBAC configurations.
    *   Securely configure and protect API server ports (e.g., restrict access to trusted networks).
    *   Enable Admission Controllers to enforce security policies.
    *   Keep Kubernetes version up-to-date and apply security patches.

## Threat: [API Server Vulnerabilities](./threats/api_server_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Kubernetes API server software. This could involve exploiting bugs in API handling, authentication logic, or other API server functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Control plane compromise, denial of service, data breaches (especially if vulnerabilities expose etcd access), and privilege escalation to cluster administrator.
*   **Kubernetes Component Affected:** API Server (software vulnerabilities)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Kubernetes version up-to-date and apply security patches promptly.

They might attempt to directly access etcd ports if exposed or exploit vulnerabilities in etcd itself.
*   **Impact:** Complete cluster compromise. Attackers can read and modify all cluster state, including secrets, configurations, and workload definitions. This allows for full control over the Kubernetes environment.
*   **Kubernetes Component Affected:** etcd
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure etcd access control using mutual TLS authentication.
    *   Encrypt etcd data at rest and in transit.
    *   Restrict network access to etcd ports to only authorized control plane components.
    *   Regularly backup etcd data to a secure location.
    *   Monitor etcd logs and metrics for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) against API Server](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__against_api_server.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers overwhelm the API server with a large volume of requests, exhausting its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and making it unresponsive to legitimate users and components. This could be achieved through network flooding, resource exhaustion attacks, or exploiting API inefficiencies.
*   **Impact:** Prevents management of the cluster, leading to application outages, inability to scale, and potential cascading failures if control plane becomes unavailable.
