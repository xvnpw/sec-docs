Here's the updated list of high and critical threats directly involving Hugo:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Theme Inclusion
    *   **Description:** An attacker could create or compromise a Hugo theme and inject malicious code. A developer using this theme would unknowingly execute this code *during the Hugo build process*. This directly leverages Hugo's theme system to introduce malicious functionality.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromised website with malicious scripts affecting visitors.
        *   Exposure of sensitive information from the build environment.
        *   Website malfunction or unavailability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Theme system, build process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and audit all third-party themes before use.
        *   Use themes from trusted sources with active communities and security records.
        *   Consider using submodules or vendoring themes to have more control over the codebase.
        *   Implement regular updates for themes to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools on theme code before integration.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Shortcodes or Custom Functions
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious input that, when processed by a vulnerable custom shortcode or function *within a Hugo template*, allows them to execute arbitrary code on the build server. This directly exploits Hugo's templating engine and shortcode functionality.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete compromise of the build server.
        *   Data breaches and exfiltration.
        *   Malicious modification of the website.
    *   **Affected Component:** Templating engine, custom shortcodes, custom functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user-provided input used within custom shortcodes or functions.
        *   Avoid using dynamic code execution within templates if possible.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom Hugo functionality.
        *   Regularly review and audit custom shortcodes and functions for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement input validation and output encoding.

*   **Threat:** Accidental Inclusion of Sensitive Files in the Output
    *   **Description:** Incorrect configuration or oversight *within Hugo's build process* could lead to the inclusion of sensitive files (e.g., `.env` files, private keys) in the generated static site. This is a direct consequence of how Hugo handles files during the build.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of sensitive credentials or configuration details.
        *   Potential for complete system compromise if private keys are exposed.
    *   **Affected Component:** Build process, file handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a `.gitignore` file to explicitly exclude sensitive files and directories from the build output.
        *   Carefully review the `publishDir` setting in Hugo's configuration.
        *   Implement automated checks to verify that sensitive files are not present in the generated output.
        *   Store sensitive information outside the Hugo project directory and access it securely during the build process if necessary.
