# Project Design Document: Gitea - A Self-Hosted Git Service

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Software Architect

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an enhanced and detailed architectural design of Gitea, a lightweight, self-hosted Git service written in Go. This document aims to clearly outline the system's components, their interactions, and the overall architecture with greater depth. It will serve as a robust foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

The primary goals of Gitea are to provide:

* A robust and reliable self-hosted alternative to platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
* A lightweight and efficient Git service optimized for minimal resource consumption.
* An intuitive and user-friendly web interface for comprehensive management of Git repositories.
* Essential and advanced features for collaborative software development, including issue tracking, pull requests, wikis, and project management tools.
* Flexible support for various authentication methods to integrate with existing infrastructure.
* An extensible platform through well-defined APIs, enabling automation and integration with other services.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

Gitea employs a well-defined three-tier architecture, promoting modularity and separation of concerns:

* **Presentation Tier:** The user-facing interface, primarily accessed through web browsers, facilitating user interaction with Gitea's features.
* **Application Tier:** The core of the Gitea application, responsible for processing user requests, implementing business logic, and managing data flow.
* **Data Tier:** The persistent storage layer for all of Gitea's data, encompassing Git repositories and application-specific metadata.

## 4. Detailed Component Design

This section provides a more in-depth look at the key components within the Gitea architecture and their functionalities.

### 4.1. Presentation Tier

* **Web Browser:**  The primary client interface, rendering HTML, CSS, and executing JavaScript to provide a dynamic user experience. It interacts with the Gitea web server via HTTP/HTTPS.
* **Git Client:**  Command-line tools (e.g., `git`) or GUI applications used by developers to manage Git repositories hosted on Gitea. Communication occurs via SSH for authenticated operations and HTTPS for read-only access or with credentials.

### 4.2. Application Tier

* **Web Server (Go HTTP Handlers):**  Built using Go's efficient `net/http` library or a routing framework like `chi` or `gin`, responsible for:
    * Receiving and processing incoming HTTP requests from web browsers and API clients.
    * Routing requests to the appropriate handler functions based on URL paths and HTTP methods.
    * Handling request parsing, validation, and response generation.
    * Serving static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images).
* **Authentication & Authorization Service:** A dedicated component responsible for managing user identity and access control:
    * **Authentication:** Verifying user credentials using various methods: local passwords (hashed and salted), OAuth 2.0 providers (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Google), LDAP/Active Directory, SAML, and HTTP Authentication.
    * **Authorization:** Determining user permissions based on roles and access control lists (ACLs) for repositories, organizations, and administrative functions. This includes checks for read, write, and admin privileges.
* **API Gateway & Rate Limiting:**  Acts as a central point of entry for API requests, providing:
    * **Routing:** Directing API requests to the appropriate backend services.
    * **Rate Limiting:** Protecting the application from abuse by limiting the number of requests from a specific user or IP address within a given timeframe.
    * **Authentication & Authorization Enforcement:** Ensuring that API requests are authenticated and authorized before reaching backend services.
* **Git Command Execution Engine:**  A crucial component responsible for securely executing Git commands on the server:
    * Interacting with the underlying `git` binary through system calls.
    * Handling Git protocols (e.g., `git-receive-pack`, `git-upload-pack`) for push and pull operations.
    * Managing repository metadata and ensuring data integrity.
    * Executing Git hooks (client-side and server-side) based on repository events.
* **Database Interaction Layer (ORM):**  Utilizes an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), such as GORM, to abstract database interactions:
    * Mapping Go objects to database tables, simplifying data access and manipulation.
    * Handling database connections, transactions, and query generation.
    * Supporting multiple database backends (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, TiDB) through a consistent interface.
    * Managing database migrations and schema updates.
* **Asynchronous Task Queue:**  Manages and schedules background tasks that do not require immediate processing:
    * Utilizing a message queue (e.g., Redis, in-memory queue) to store tasks.
    * Decoupling long-running operations from the main request-response cycle.
* **Background Workers:**  Processes tasks from the asynchronous task queue:
    * Sending email notifications for events (e.g., issue updates, pull request merges).
    * Processing webhooks to notify external services of repository events.
    * Performing repository maintenance tasks (e.g., garbage collection, repacking).
    * Indexing repository content for efficient code search.

### 4.3. Data Storage

* **Git Repositories (File System):**  Stores the core Git repository data on the server's file system:
    * Utilizing the standard Git object database format.
    * Organizing repositories in a structured directory hierarchy, often based on user or organization.
    * Managing repository access permissions at the file system level.
* **Database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL):**  Persistently stores Gitea's application metadata:
    * User accounts, profiles, and credentials.
    * Organization and team structures, including membership and permissions.
    * Repository metadata (name, description, privacy settings, forks).
    * Issue and pull request details, comments, and associated data.
    * Wiki content and revisions.
    * Configuration settings and application preferences.
* **LFS Storage (Optional File System/Object Storage):**  Handles large files tracked by Git LFS:
    * Storing large file content separately from the main Git repository.
    * Supporting local file system storage or integration with object storage services (e.g., AWS S3, MinIO, Azure Blob Storage).
    * Managing access control and data integrity for LFS objects.

## 5. Data Flow

This section illustrates the flow of data for key user interactions within the Gitea system.

        alt Authorization Success
            WebServer ->> GitEngine: Execute git-receive-pack
            GitEngine ->> GitRepo: Write Git Objects
            GitEngine -->> WebServer: Push Successful
            WebServer -->> User: Push Successful
        else Authorization Failure
            WebServer -->> User: Authorization Error
        end
    else Authentication Failure
        WebServer -->> User: Authentication Error
    end
```

### 5.2. Viewing an Issue via Web Browser

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant "User (Web Browser)" as UserBrowser
    participant "Web Server" as WebServer
    participant "Authentication Service" as Auth
    participant "Database" as DB

    UserBrowser ->> WebServer: Request Issue Details (HTTP GET)
    WebServer ->> Auth: Authenticate User (Session Cookie)
    Auth -->> WebServer: Authentication Result
    alt Authentication Success
        WebServer ->> Auth: Authorize View Issue
        Auth -->> WebServer: Authorization Result
        alt Authorization Success
            WebServer ->> DB: Retrieve Issue Data
            DB -->> WebServer: Issue Data
            WebServer ->> DB: Retrieve User Data (Author, Assignees, etc.)
            DB -->> WebServer: User Data
            WebServer -->> UserBrowser: Rendered HTML Page
        else Authorization Failure
            WebServer -->> UserBrowser: Authorization Error Page
        end
    else Authentication Failure
        WebServer -->> UserBrowser: Redirection to Login Page
    end
```
