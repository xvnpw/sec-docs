# Threat Model Analysis for sirupsen/logrus

## Threat: [Information Leakage via Insecure Hooks](./threats/information_leakage_via_insecure_hooks.md)

- **Description:** An attacker might intercept or gain unauthorized access to log data being transmitted to external services through `logrus` hooks if these hooks are not configured securely. This could involve using unencrypted protocols (e.g., plain HTTP), exposing credentials in the hook configuration, or sending logs to untrusted destinations. The vulnerability lies in the insecure configuration or implementation of the `logrus` hook mechanism.
- **Impact:** Data breach through external logging channels, potential compromise of external logging systems, and exposure of sensitive information.
- **Affected Component:** The `Hooks` functionality of `logrus`, specifically the implementation of individual hooks and their configuration within `logrus`.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Use secure protocols (HTTPS, TLS) for communication with external logging services within `logrus` hook configurations.
    - Securely manage credentials required for authentication with external services, avoiding hardcoding them in `logrus` hook configurations. Utilize environment variables or secrets management systems.
    - Validate the security posture of external logging services before integrating them as `logrus` hooks.
    - Implement appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms for external logging services used by `logrus` hooks.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Custom Formatters or Hooks](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_custom_formatters_or_hooks.md)

- **Description:** If developers implement custom formatters or hooks for `logrus`, vulnerabilities within this custom code could be exploited by an attacker. This could range from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability within the custom `logrus` component.
- **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including information disclosure, data manipulation, and potentially full system compromise stemming from a flaw in a `logrus` extension.
- **Affected Component:** Custom `Formatter` or `Hook` implementations extending `logrus` functionality.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Thoroughly review and test custom formatters and hooks for security vulnerabilities, treating them as part of the application's trusted codebase interacting with `logrus`.
    - Follow secure coding practices when developing custom components for `logrus`.
    - Keep dependencies of custom components up to date to patch potential vulnerabilities within their own code.
    - Consider using well-vetted and maintained third-party formatters or hooks if possible to reduce the risk of introducing custom vulnerabilities.
