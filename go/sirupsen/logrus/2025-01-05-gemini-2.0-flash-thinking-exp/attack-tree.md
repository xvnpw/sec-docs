# Attack Tree Analysis for sirupsen/logrus

Objective: Execute arbitrary code on the application server or gain access to sensitive information by leveraging vulnerabilities or misconfigurations related to the Logrus logging library.

```


## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Log Formatter Vulnerability (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_log_formatter_vulnerability__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker aims to execute arbitrary code by leveraging Logrus's ability to use custom formatters.
* **Critical Node: Supply Malicious Custom Formatter**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker's goal is to make the application load and use a formatter they control.
* **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Configuration**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker attempts to modify the application's configuration (e.g., through environment variables, configuration files, or other means) to specify the path to a malicious formatter. This malicious formatter, when used by Logrus to format log messages, can execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse Log Hooks (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2__abuse_log_hooks__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker aims to execute arbitrary code or interact with external services by manipulating Logrus's hook mechanism.
* **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Hook Configuration**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker attempts to modify the application's configuration to include a malicious hook. This hook could be designed to execute arbitrary commands on the server or to send sensitive information to an attacker-controlled external service whenever a log event occurs.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Information Disclosure through Logs (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_information_disclosure_through_logs__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker aims to gain access to sensitive information that is unintentionally being logged by the application.
* **Critical Node: Trigger Logging of Sensitive Data**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates the application's input or state in a way that causes the application to log sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, database credentials, personally identifiable information). This could be due to developer error, overly verbose logging configurations, or insufficient sanitization of data before logging. The attacker can then access these logs through various means (if not properly secured).
