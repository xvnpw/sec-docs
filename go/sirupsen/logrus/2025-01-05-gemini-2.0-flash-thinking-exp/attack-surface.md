# Attack Surface Analysis for sirupsen/logrus

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal in File Output](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_in_file_output.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the log file path if the application dynamically constructs the log file path based on external input and uses Logrus to write to that path without proper validation.
    *   **How Logrus Contributes:** Logrus allows specifying the output file path. If this path is derived from unsanitized external input, it creates a vulnerability that Logrus directly facilitates by writing to the specified location.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits an API endpoint that allows specifying a log file name. By providing a path like `../../../../etc/passwd`, they could potentially overwrite sensitive system files using Logrus's file writing functionality if the application runs with sufficient privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary file write, potentially leading to system compromise, denial of service, or privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid constructing log file paths based on user input.
        *   If dynamic paths are necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal.
        *   Use absolute paths for log files or restrict the allowed directory for log output within the Logrus configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Logrus Hooks](./attack_surfaces/malicious_logrus_hooks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers introduce malicious code into the application by exploiting the Logrus hook mechanism, if the application loads hooks from untrusted sources or allows external influence over loaded hooks.
    *   **How Logrus Contributes:** Logrus's hook feature allows extending its functionality by executing custom code at different logging stages. This extensibility becomes a critical vulnerability if not managed securely, as Logrus will execute the code provided by the hook.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises a dependency that provides a Logrus hook. When the application initializes Logrus and loads this hook, the malicious code within the hook is executed by Logrus, potentially granting the attacker remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data exfiltration, complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only load Logrus hooks from trusted and verified sources.
        *   Implement code reviews for any custom Logrus hooks.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in third-party hooks.
        *   Consider using a more restrictive approach to loading hooks, such as explicit whitelisting within the Logrus initialization.

## Attack Surface: [Uncontrolled Log Level Configuration](./attack_surfaces/uncontrolled_log_level_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the application's Logrus configuration to set the logging level to a more verbose setting (e.g., `Debug` or `Trace`) in a production environment.
    *   **How Logrus Contributes:** Logrus provides the functionality to configure the logging level dynamically. If this configuration is exposed or not properly secured, attackers can leverage Logrus's configuration options to force the logging of sensitive information.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits an insecure API endpoint or configuration file vulnerability to change the Logrus log level to `Debug`, causing the application to log sensitive data like user credentials or internal system details through Logrus's logging mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive data, potentially leading to account compromise or further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure configuration sources (e.g., use proper file permissions, avoid storing configuration in publicly accessible locations).
        *   Implement strict access control for configuration endpoints or files.
        *   Avoid exposing Logrus configuration directly to user input.
        *   Consider using environment variables with proper restrictions for setting log levels.
        *   Enforce least privilege principle for processes accessing Logrus configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Network Logging](./attack_surfaces/insecure_network_logging.md)

*   **Description:** Configuring Logrus to send logs over a network without proper encryption or authentication, allowing attackers to intercept and read sensitive log data.
    *   **How Logrus Contributes:** Logrus supports sending logs to network destinations. If this functionality is used without proper security measures, Logrus directly facilitates the transmission of potentially sensitive data over an insecure channel.
    *   **Example:** Logrus is configured to send logs to a remote syslog server using plain TCP without TLS encryption. An attacker on the network can intercept these log messages sent by Logrus and access sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data contained in logs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure protocols like TLS for network logging when configuring Logrus's network output.
        *   Implement authentication and authorization for log receiving servers.
        *   Consider using dedicated and secured logging infrastructure.
        *   Avoid sending highly sensitive data over the network in logs if absolutely necessary.
