# Attack Surface Analysis for sirupsen/logrus

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data Exposure](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_exposure.md)

Description: Inadvertent logging of confidential information, violating privacy and compliance regulations.
How Logrus Contributes: `logrus` provides the mechanism for logging; the vulnerability arises from *what* is logged using that mechanism. It is the developer's responsibility to prevent sensitive data from being passed to `logrus`.
Example:

    // BAD: Logging the entire user object, including password hash
    log.WithFields(logrus.Fields{"user": user}).Info("User logged in")

    // BAD: Logging a raw JWT
    log.Infof("Authentication token: %s", token)

Impact:
    Exposure of PII, credentials, financial data, or internal system details.
    Compliance violations (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, etc.).
    Reputational damage.
    Legal repercussions.
    Identity theft.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    Strict Logging Policies: Define and enforce a "deny by default" policy.
    Code Reviews: Mandatory code reviews.
    Automated Scanning (SAST): Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., `gitleaks`).
    Data Masking/Redaction (Hooks/Formatters): Implement `logrus` hooks or custom formatters for automatic redaction. Example:
        
        type RedactHook struct{}

        func (hook *RedactHook) Levels() []logrus.Level {
            return logrus.AllLevels
        }

        func (hook *RedactHook) Fire(entry *logrus.Entry) error {
            if entry.Data["password"] != nil {
                entry.Data["password"] = "*****" // Redact
            }
            // Add more redaction logic
            return nil
        }

        log.AddHook(&RedactHook{})
        
    Log Level Management: Use appropriate log levels (Debug, Info, Warn, Error). Production should use less verbose levels.
    Contextual Logging: Log *about* the data, not the data itself.
    Training: Educate developers.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Excessive Logging](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__-_excessive_logging.md)

Description: Attackers trigger code paths that generate a massive volume of log messages, exhausting resources.
How Logrus Contributes: `logrus` is the mechanism for writing logs; excessive logging, regardless of the source, can overwhelm the system *through* `logrus`. While the root cause might be elsewhere, `logrus` is the *conduit* for the attack.
Example: An attacker repeatedly triggering an error condition that logs a detailed stack trace for each occurrence (using `logrus`). Or, a vulnerability causing a loop that repeatedly calls `logrus` logging functions.
Impact:
    Disk space exhaustion.
    CPU overload.
    Network bandwidth saturation (if logs are sent remotely).
    Log aggregator overload.
    Application crash or unresponsiveness.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on user actions.
    Log Level Control: Use appropriate log levels (Info, Warn) in production.
    Log Rotation: Configure log rotation.
    Log Sampling: Consider log sampling (custom hooks or application-level logic).
    Monitoring: Monitor disk space, CPU, and network bandwidth.
    Defensive Programming: Address code vulnerabilities that could lead to infinite logging loops *that utilize `logrus`*.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Large Log Messages](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__-_large_log_messages.md)

Description: Attackers inject very large strings into log messages, consuming excessive resources.
How Logrus Contributes: `logrus` handles the formatting and writing; it doesn't inherently limit the size of log messages *passed to it*. The vulnerability is in how `logrus` is *used*.
Example:

    // BAD: Logging a large, attacker-controlled string
    log.Infof("Received data: %s", largeUserInput)

Impact: Similar to excessive logging: disk space exhaustion, CPU overload, network bandwidth consumption.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Input Validation: Strictly validate the size and content of user input *before passing it to `logrus`*.
    Truncation (Hooks/Formatters): Use `logrus` formatters or hooks to truncate long strings *before they are processed by `logrus`*.
        
        type TruncateFormatter struct {
            logrus.Formatter
            MaxLength int
        }

        func (f *TruncateFormatter) Format(entry *logrus.Entry) ([]byte, error) {
            for key, value := range entry.Data {
                if str, ok := value.(string); ok && len(str) > f.MaxLength {
                    entry.Data[key] = str[:f.MaxLength] + "..." // Truncate
                }
            }
            return f.Formatter.Format(entry)
        }

        log.SetFormatter(&TruncateFormatter{
            Formatter: &logrus.TextFormatter{}, // Or &logrus.JSONFormatter{}
            MaxLength: 256,
        })
        
    Structured Logging: Limits the impact of a single large field.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Custom Formatters/Hooks](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_custom_formattershooks.md)

Description: Security vulnerabilities within custom `logrus` formatters or hooks.
How Logrus Contributes: `logrus` provides the extension points (formatters and hooks); the vulnerability resides in the *custom* code written to *extend* `logrus`.
Example: A custom hook that makes an external network request without proper validation (SSRF vulnerability). Or, a custom formatter with a buffer overflow.
Impact: Depends on the specific vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
Risk Severity: Variable (Can be High or Critical, depending on the vulnerability within the *custom* `logrus` component)
Mitigation Strategies:
    Secure Coding Practices: Follow secure coding guidelines.
    Code Reviews: Thoroughly review custom code.
    Testing: Test custom formatters/hooks with various inputs.
    Input Validation: Validate any data used within the custom formatter or hook.
    Least Privilege: Ensure the custom hook or formatter operates with minimal privileges.
