# Threat Model Analysis for sirupsen/logrus

## Threat: [Logging Sensitive Data in Plain Text](./threats/logging_sensitive_data_in_plain_text.md)

**Description:** If developers inadvertently log sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, PII, or session tokens within log messages using `logrus` functions (e.g., `logrus.Info`, `logrus.Error`), an attacker gaining access to these logs can read this sensitive data in plain text. Access could be gained through compromised servers, exposed storage, or insider threats.

**Impact:** Information Disclosure, Data Breach, Compliance Violations, Reputational Damage.

**Logrus Component Affected:** Core Logging Functionality (e.g., `logrus.Info`, `logrus.Error`, formatters).

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict code reviews to prevent logging of sensitive data.
*   Utilize structured logging with `logrus` fields to log identifiers or references instead of sensitive values directly.
*   Employ log scrubbing or masking techniques to automatically redact sensitive information from logs before they are stored or transmitted.
*   Ensure logs are stored securely with appropriate access controls and encryption both in transit and at rest, independently of logrus.
*   Educate developers on secure logging practices and the risks of information disclosure through logs.

## Threat: [Insecure Log Destinations](./threats/insecure_log_destinations.md)

**Description:** If `logrus` is configured to send logs to insecure destinations through its hooks or output configurations, attackers intercepting network traffic or gaining unauthorized access to these destinations can read sensitive log data. Insecure destinations include unencrypted network connections (e.g., plain HTTP, unencrypted syslog) or publicly accessible storage locations configured via logrus hooks.

**Impact:** Information Disclosure, Data Breach, Loss of Confidentiality.

**Logrus Component Affected:** Hooks and Output configuration (e.g., file output, network hooks).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of data and insecurity of destination).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use secure and encrypted channels for transmitting logs over networks when configuring network hooks (e.g., HTTPS, TLS-encrypted syslog).
*   Ensure log storage locations configured through logrus hooks (e.g., writing to files, cloud storage) are properly secured with strong access controls and are not publicly accessible.
*   Use logging destinations that provide robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, especially when using custom hooks.
*   Regularly review and audit log destination configurations within your `logrus` setup to ensure they remain secure.
