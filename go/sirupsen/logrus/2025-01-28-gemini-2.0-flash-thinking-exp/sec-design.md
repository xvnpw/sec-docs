# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a robust, flexible, and widely adopted logging library for Go applications.
  - Enable developers to easily integrate structured logging into their Go projects.
  - Maintain high performance and minimal overhead to avoid impacting application performance.
  - Foster a strong community around the library for contributions and support.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in `logrus` could impact a large number of applications that depend on it.
  - Performance bottlenecks introduced by `logrus` could negatively affect applications.
  - Lack of maintenance or slow response to issues could reduce developer trust and adoption.
  - Incompatibility with newer Go versions or logging standards could limit its long-term usability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code - The source code is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus), allowing for community review and scrutiny.
  - security control: Community Contributions - The project benefits from community contributions, including bug fixes and feature enhancements, which can indirectly improve security.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security Audits - Security audits are primarily driven by the community and may not be as frequent or comprehensive as dedicated security reviews.
  - accepted risk: Vulnerability Response Time - Response time to reported vulnerabilities depends on maintainer availability and community contributions.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Dependency Scanning - Implement automated checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies used by `logrus`.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan the `logrus` codebase for potential security flaws.
  - security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security contact and expected response times.
  - security control: Security Contact - Designate a security contact or security team responsible for handling security-related inquiries and vulnerability reports.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Not directly applicable to `logrus` as it is a logging library. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications using `logrus` when interacting with logging backends.
  - Authorization:
    - Not directly applicable to `logrus`. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications using `logrus` to control access to log data and logging configurations.
  - Input Validation:
    - Log message inputs should be handled carefully by applications using `logrus` to prevent log injection attacks if logs are processed by external systems. `logrus` itself should handle formatting and encoding of log messages safely.
  - Cryptography:
    - `logrus` itself does not directly implement cryptography. However, applications using `logrus` might log sensitive data that requires encryption at rest or in transit when sent to logging backends. This is the responsibility of the application and the logging backend infrastructure.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Logging functionality in Go applications that depend on `logrus`. If `logrus` has vulnerabilities or malfunctions, it can impact the reliability and security of applications using it. This can affect monitoring, debugging, security incident response, and overall application stability.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Log messages generated by applications using `logrus`. The sensitivity of this data depends entirely on what the applications log. It could range from non-sensitive informational messages to highly sensitive data like:
    - Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Usernames, email addresses, IP addresses, etc.
    - Application Secrets: API keys, passwords (though logging passwords is a very bad practice).
    - Business-critical data: Transaction details, financial information, etc.
  - The sensitivity level needs to be determined by each application that uses `logrus` based on their specific logging practices and data being logged.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended scope of security responsibility for the `logrus` project maintainers versus the applications that use `logrus`?
  - Are there any specific security certifications or compliance requirements that `logrus` aims to meet?
  - Is there a dedicated security contact or team for the `logrus` project to handle vulnerability reports?
  - What is the process for handling and disclosing security vulnerabilities in `logrus`?

- Assumptions:
  - `logrus` is intended to be used in a wide variety of Go applications, including those that handle sensitive data.
  - Security is a significant concern for a widely used logging library like `logrus`.
  - The primary security responsibility for `logrus` maintainers is to ensure the library itself is free from vulnerabilities and to provide secure coding practices.
  - Applications using `logrus` are responsible for securely configuring logging, handling sensitive data in logs, and protecting the logging infrastructure.
