## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Exploit Log Output Destination (CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_exploit_log_output_destination__critical_node_&_high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities related to how logrus outputs logs to different destinations.
*   **Breakdown:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Path Traversal via Log File Configuration (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_path_traversal_via_log_file_configuration__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Description:**  Attacker manipulates the log file path configuration (if externally configurable and not properly validated) to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`).
*   **Vulnerability Exploited:** Insufficient input validation on log file path configuration.
*   **Potential Impact:** Writing logs to arbitrary locations on the file system.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Write Logs to Sensitive Locations (e.g., /etc/shadow, web root) (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_write_logs_to_sensitive_locations__e_g___etcshadow__web_root___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Description:**  Leveraging path traversal to write log data to sensitive system files or web-accessible directories.
*   **Vulnerability Exploited:** Path traversal vulnerability combined with insufficient file system permissions or misconfigurations.
*   **Potential Impact:** Overwriting critical system files (less likely due to permissions, but possible in some scenarios), serving malicious content from web root, or application file corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Redirect Logs to Attacker-Controlled Server (Network Hook) (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_redirect_logs_to_attacker-controlled_server__network_hook___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Description:** Attacker modifies the logrus configuration (if vulnerable) to redirect log output to a network server they control, often using network hooks.
*   **Vulnerability Exploited:** Insecure configuration management, allowing unauthorized modification of logrus network hook settings.
*   **Potential Impact:** Exfiltration of sensitive information logged by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Exfiltrate Sensitive Information via Logs (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_exfiltrate_sensitive_information_via_logs__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Description:**  After successfully redirecting logs, the attacker passively collects and analyzes the logs sent to their server, searching for sensitive data.
*   **Vulnerability Exploited:** Logging of sensitive information in the application combined with successful log redirection.
*   **Potential Impact:** Data breach, disclosure of credentials, API keys, personal data, or other confidential information.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.0 Exploit Log Processing/Formatting (CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH for 2.2 & 2.3)](./attack_tree_paths/2_0_exploit_log_processingformatting__critical_node_&_high_risk_path_for_2_2_&_2_3_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting issues related to how logrus processes and formats log messages, specifically focusing on resource exhaustion and information leakage.
*   **Breakdown:**

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Resource Exhaustion via Excessive Logging (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_resource_exhaustion_via_excessive_logging__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Description:** Attacker triggers actions within the application that generate a large volume of log messages, overwhelming logging resources.
*   **Vulnerability Exploited:** Verbose logging configuration (e.g., `Debug` or `Trace` level in production), lack of log rate limiting, or insufficient resource allocation for logging.
*   **Potential Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to disk space exhaustion, I/O overload, or logging system crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Denial of Service through Log Flooding (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_denial_of_service_through_log_flooding__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Description:**  The consequence of excessive logging leading to application downtime or performance degradation due to resource exhaustion.
*   **Vulnerability Exploited:**  As described in 2.2, verbose logging and lack of resource management.
*   **Potential Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption, and potential financial losses.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3 Information Leakage via Verbose Logging Configuration (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_information_leakage_via_verbose_logging_configuration__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Description:**  Application is configured to log at a verbose level, unintentionally including sensitive information in the logs.
*   **Vulnerability Exploited:** Overly verbose logging configuration in production environments, logging sensitive data without redaction.
*   **Potential Impact:** Unintentional disclosure of sensitive data to anyone with access to the logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1 Expose Sensitive Data in Logs (Credentials, API Keys, etc.) (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1_expose_sensitive_data_in_logs__credentials__api_keys__etc____high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Description:**  Sensitive information like credentials, API keys, personal data, or internal system details are logged due to verbose configuration.
*   **Vulnerability Exploited:**  Logging sensitive data and insufficient review of logging practices.
*   **Potential Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to systems or data, and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.0 Exploit Logrus Hooks (HIGH RISK PATH for 3.2)](./attack_tree_paths/3_0_exploit_logrus_hooks__high_risk_path_for_3_2_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities related to logrus hooks, specifically focusing on manipulation of hook configurations.
*   **Breakdown:**

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Hook Manipulation (If Configuration is Vulnerable) (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_hook_manipulation__if_configuration_is_vulnerable___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Description:** Attacker gains unauthorized access to the logrus configuration and modifies it to inject malicious hooks.
*   **Vulnerability Exploited:** Insecure configuration management, allowing unauthorized modification of logrus hook settings.
*   **Potential Impact:** Ability to execute arbitrary code or alter application behavior whenever log messages are processed.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1 Inject Malicious Hooks to Alter Application Behavior (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1_inject_malicious_hooks_to_alter_application_behavior__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Description:**  After successfully injecting malicious hooks, the attacker's code executes within the application's context whenever logging occurs.
*   **Vulnerability Exploited:** Successful hook injection combined with the ability of hooks to influence application logic.
*   **Potential Impact:** Application takeover, backdoors, data manipulation, or further exploitation of the system.
