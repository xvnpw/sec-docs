# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for sirupsen/logrus

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Implement Sensitive Data Redaction in Log Hooks](./mitigation_strategies/1__implement_sensitive_data_redaction_in_log_hooks.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Logrus Hook for Sensitive Data Redaction
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create a Custom Logrus Hook:** Develop a Go struct that implements the `logrus.Hook` interface. This hook will be registered with `logrus` and intercept log entries before they are output.
    2.  **Implement Redaction Logic within the Hook's `Fire` method:** Inside the `Fire` method of your custom hook, add code to:
        *   Identify sensitive data within the `logrus` log entry's `Message` and `Data` fields. This can be done using regular expressions, keyword lists, or more sophisticated data classification techniques.
        *   Redact or mask the identified sensitive data. Replace sensitive strings with placeholders like `[REDACTED]` or apply anonymization techniques.
    3.  **Register the Hook with Logrus:** Use `logrus.AddHook()` to register your custom redaction hook with the global `logrus` logger or specific logger instances in your application. This ensures the hook is applied to all relevant log entries.
    4.  **Configure Hook Application:**  If needed, implement logic within the hook to selectively apply redaction based on log levels, log entry fields, or other criteria available within the `logrus.Entry`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Accidental logging of sensitive data (passwords, API keys, PII) which could be exposed if logs are compromised.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces the risk by actively redacting sensitive information *within the logrus pipeline* before it reaches any output destination.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. A basic redaction hook exists in `internal/logging`, but it's limited to API keys and passwords and uses simple keyword matching. It is registered globally using `logrus.AddHook()`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Expand the redaction hook to cover more sensitive data types and use more robust pattern matching within the `logrus` hook's `Fire` method.
    *   Add configuration options to the hook itself (e.g., via struct fields) to customize redaction rules without modifying the core hook code, leveraging `logrus`'s hook registration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Control Log Levels Granularly Based on Environment using Logrus](./mitigation_strategies/2__control_log_levels_granularly_based_on_environment_using_logrus.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Logrus Environment-Based Log Level Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine Environment-Specific Log Levels:** Decide on appropriate `logrus` log levels for different deployment environments (Development, Staging, Production).  Use more verbose levels (e.g., `logrus.Debug`, `logrus.Trace`) in development and less verbose levels (e.g., `logrus.Info`, `logrus.Warn`, `logrus.Error`) in production.
    2.  **Utilize Environment Variables or Configuration:**  Read the desired log level from an environment variable (e.g., `LOG_LEVEL`) or a configuration file at application startup.
    3.  **Set Logrus Level Programmatically:** Use `logrus.SetLevel()` to programmatically set the global `logrus` log level based on the value obtained from the environment or configuration.  `logrus` provides constants like `logrus.DebugLevel`, `logrus.InfoLevel`, etc., for easy level setting.
    4.  **Document Log Level Configuration:** Clearly document how to configure the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable or configuration setting to control `logrus` verbosity in different environments.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Verbose logging in production can expose internal details useful to attackers.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Low Severity):** Excessive logging can impact performance, especially at verbose levels.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces risk by limiting verbose, potentially revealing logs in production by configuring `logrus` to a less verbose level.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Minimizes performance impact in production by reducing log volume through `logrus` level configuration.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable is used, and `logrus.SetLevel()` is called to configure the level. However, default production level is not yet optimally restrictive.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Change the default `LOG_LEVEL` for production to `Info` or `Warn` to leverage `logrus`'s level filtering more effectively by default.
    *   Ensure documentation clearly outlines how to use the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to control `logrus` verbosity.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Secure Log Output Destinations Configuration in Logrus](./mitigation_strategies/3__secure_log_output_destinations_configuration_in_logrus.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Logrus Output Destination Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Secure Output Destinations:** Select appropriate and secure output destinations for `logrus` logs. Options include:
        *   **Securely Configured Files:** If logging to files, ensure the file paths are within secure directories and file permissions are restricted.
        *   **Secure Network Destinations:** For network logging (e.g., syslog, remote logging services), configure `logrus` to use secure protocols like TLS for encrypted transmission.
    2.  **Configure Logrus Output using `logrus.SetOutput()`:** Use `logrus.SetOutput()` to direct log output to the chosen destination. For file output, use `os.OpenFile()` with appropriate flags and permissions before passing the file handle to `logrus.SetOutput()`. For network destinations, consider using `logrus` formatters or hooks to integrate with secure logging libraries.
    3.  **Utilize Logrus Formatters for Structured Output:** Employ `logrus` formatters (like JSON formatter) to structure logs in a machine-readable format, which is often beneficial for secure and efficient ingestion into centralized logging systems.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Logs written to insecure destinations can be accessed by unauthorized parties.
    *   **Log Tampering/Deletion (Medium Severity):** Insecure log storage can allow attackers to modify or delete logs.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces risk by ensuring `logrus` is configured to write logs to secure locations, controlled through `logrus.SetOutput()` and destination setup.
    *   **Log Tampering/Deletion:** Contributes to log integrity by directing `logrus` output to destinations that can be secured against tampering.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `logrus.SetOutput()` is used to direct logs to files, but secure network destinations and structured formatters are not fully utilized. File permission configuration is not robustly managed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement centralized logging using a secure cloud logging service and configure `logrus.SetOutput()` or custom hooks to send logs securely (e.g., via TLS).
    *   If using file logging, ensure file creation and permission settings are handled securely when `logrus` initializes the output, potentially within a custom hook or initialization function.
    *   Adopt `logrus`'s JSON formatter for structured logging to facilitate secure and efficient log ingestion into centralized systems.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Carefully Review and Test Custom Logrus Formatters](./mitigation_strategies/4__carefully_review_and_test_custom_logrus_formatters.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Logrus Custom Formatter Management
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Custom Formatters:**  Prefer using `logrus`'s built-in formatters (Text, JSON) as they are well-tested. Only create custom formatters if absolutely necessary for specific output requirements.
    2.  **Code Review Custom Formatters:** If custom formatters are needed, conduct thorough code reviews of the formatter's `Format` method implementation. Pay attention to:
        *   **Data Handling:** How the formatter processes the `logrus.Entry` data and ensures safe handling of all data types.
        *   **String Formatting:**  Verify that string formatting within the formatter is secure and avoids format string vulnerabilities or injection issues.
        *   **Error Handling:**  Ensure the formatter handles errors gracefully and doesn't introduce new vulnerabilities through error handling logic.
    3.  **Unit and Integration Testing for Formatters:** Implement unit tests specifically for custom `logrus` formatters. Test with various log entry data types and edge cases to ensure correct and secure formatting.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Log Injection (Medium Severity):** Vulnerabilities in custom formatters could be exploited to inject malicious content into logs through manipulated formatting.
    *   **Denial of Service (Low Severity):** Inefficient custom formatters can cause performance issues.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Log Injection:** Reduces risk by ensuring custom `logrus` formatters are securely implemented and don't introduce injection points.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Minimizes performance risks associated with custom formatters by promoting code review and testing.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. A custom JSON formatter is used, but formal security review and dedicated unit tests for the formatter are missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Conduct a security-focused code review of the custom JSON formatter's `Format` method.
    *   Implement unit tests specifically targeting the custom JSON formatter to validate its security and correctness under various conditions.
    *   Consider switching to `logrus`'s built-in JSON formatter if the custom formatter doesn't provide critical, unique functionality.

## Mitigation Strategy: [5. Audit and Secure Custom Logrus Hooks](./mitigation_strategies/5__audit_and_secure_custom_logrus_hooks.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Logrus Custom Hook Management
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Custom Hooks:**  Avoid unnecessary custom `logrus` hooks.  Use built-in `logrus` features or well-established, community-vetted hooks when possible.
    2.  **Code Review Custom Hooks:** If custom hooks are necessary, rigorously review the code of the `Fire` method and any supporting functions within the hook implementation. Focus on:
        *   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Identify potential injection flaws, resource leaks, or insecure data handling within the hook's logic.
        *   **Code Quality and Logic:** Ensure the hook's logic is sound, efficient, and doesn't introduce unintended side effects into the logging pipeline.
        *   **Dependencies:** If the hook relies on external libraries, review those dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Source Code Provenance (for external hooks):** If using third-party hooks, verify their source and ensure they come from trusted and reputable sources.
    4.  **Regular Updates and Security Scanning:** Keep custom hooks updated and use static analysis security scanning tools to check hook code for potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Code Injection (Medium Severity):** Malicious or vulnerable custom hooks could be exploited to inject code into the logging process.
    *   **Denial of Service (Low Severity):** Buggy hooks can cause performance issues or crashes.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low Severity):** Insecure hooks might bypass redaction or expose sensitive data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Injection:** Reduces risk by ensuring custom `logrus` hooks are secure and don't introduce new code execution vulnerabilities within the logging pipeline.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Minimizes performance and stability risks associated with custom hooks through code review and secure development practices.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces risk of information leaks caused by insecure hook implementations.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. A custom redaction hook exists, but a formal security audit process for hooks is not yet established.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Establish a mandatory code review process specifically for all custom `logrus` hooks before deployment.
    *   Integrate static analysis security scanning into the development workflow for custom hooks.
    *   Document guidelines for secure development and maintenance of custom `logrus` hooks.
