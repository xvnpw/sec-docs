                * **Details:** If log files are world-readable or accessible to unauthorized users, attackers can directly read them.
    * **1.3 Analyze Log Data for Sensitive Information [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:**  Analyzing the accessed log data to extract sensitive information.
        * **Details:**  Using manual review or automated scripts to search logs for patterns and keywords indicative of sensitive data like credentials, API keys, or PII.
        * **1.3.1 Automated/Manual Log Analysis for Credentials, API Keys, PII, etc. [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:**  Performing the actual analysis of log data to find sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.0 Exploit Log Injection Vulnerabilities (Indirect via Logrus) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_0_exploit_log_injection_vulnerabilities__indirect_via_logrus___high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Indirectly exploiting Logrus by injecting malicious data into logs, which can then be used to attack downstream systems or cause other issues.
* **Breakdown:**
    * **2.1 Inject Malicious Data into Logs [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:**  Injecting malicious data into the logs generated by Logrus.
        * **Details:** This is achieved by controlling input that the application logs or crafting specific log messages.
        * **2.1.1 Control Input Logged by Application [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating user-controlled input that is subsequently logged by the application.
            * **Details:** Exploiting input validation weaknesses in the application to inject malicious strings that will be logged via Logrus.
        * **2.1.1.1 Exploit Application Input Validation Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:**  Specifically targeting vulnerabilities in the application's input validation mechanisms.
            * **Details:** By bypassing or exploiting weak input validation, attackers can inject arbitrary data that gets logged.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.0 Exploit Log Storage/Destination Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3_0_exploit_log_storagedestination_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities related to how and where logs are stored, leading to data breaches or denial of service.

            * **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting log files configured with overly permissive permissions.
            * **Details:** If log files are set to be readable by everyone, attackers can easily access and read them.
        * **3.1.2 Publicly Accessible Network Log Storage (e.g., Misconfigured S3 buckets) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting misconfigured network storage locations where logs are stored, making them publicly accessible.
            * **Details:**  If cloud storage buckets or network shares used for logging are misconfigured for public access, attackers can access and download logs.

            * **4.2.1.1 Expose Logs to Unauthorized Parties [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
