# Attack Surface Analysis for restic/restic

## Attack Surface: [1. Repository Password Brute-forcing](./attack_surfaces/1__repository_password_brute-forcing.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess the repository password to gain unauthorized access to backups.
*   **Restic Contribution:** Restic's password-based encryption mechanism makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks if weak passwords are used. The security directly relies on the strength of the chosen password.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses password cracking tools against the restic repository, trying common passwords or using dictionary attacks until they find the correct password and decrypt the repository.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to backups, data breach, data manipulation, data deletion, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce the use of strong, unique, and randomly generated repository passwords.
    *   **Password Complexity Policies:** Implement password complexity requirements (length, character types).
    *   **Key Files:** Utilize restic's key file option instead of passwords for potentially stronger and more manageable authentication.
    *   **Regular Password Rotation:** Periodically change repository passwords.

## Attack Surface: [2. Client-Side Vulnerabilities in Restic Binary](./attack_surfaces/2__client-side_vulnerabilities_in_restic_binary.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the restic client binary itself to execute arbitrary code, cause denial of service, or gain access to sensitive information on the client system.
*   **Restic Contribution:** Restic, being a software application, can contain vulnerabilities in its code. These vulnerabilities, if exploited, directly compromise the security of the system running restic.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability is discovered in restic's handling of long filenames during backup. An attacker crafts a backup with specially crafted filenames to trigger the overflow and execute malicious code on the client system running the restic binary.
*   **Impact:** Code execution on the client system, data exfiltration from the client system, denial of service of the backup process, potential privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Restic Updated:** Regularly update restic to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits and Vulnerability Scanning:** Rely on community security efforts and reports, and if feasible, conduct security audits and vulnerability scans of the restic codebase.
    *   **Input Validation:** While less directly controllable by developers *using* restic, understanding how restic handles input and ensuring the application using restic provides clean input is important.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Client System):** Run restic with minimal necessary privileges on the client system to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Attack Surface: [3. Insecure Storage of Repository Passwords/Keys](./attack_surfaces/3__insecure_storage_of_repository_passwordskeys.md)

*   **Description:** Repository passwords or key files, required by restic, are stored insecurely on the client system, making them easily accessible to attackers.
*   **Restic Contribution:** Restic *requires* passwords or key files for repository access. The responsibility of securely managing these secrets falls on the user/application integrating restic.  Insecure handling directly undermines restic's security model.
*   **Example:** Repository passwords are stored in plain text in a configuration file within the application's directory, which is accessible to unauthorized users or processes on the client system.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized repository access, data breach, data manipulation, data deletion, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Plain Text Storage:** Never store repository passwords or key files in plain text in configuration files, environment variables, or application code.
    *   **Secure Secret Storage Mechanisms:** Utilize secure secret storage mechanisms provided by the operating system or dedicated secret management tools (e.g., operating system keychains, HashiCorp Vault, etc.).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Access to Secrets):** Restrict access to stored secrets only to the necessary processes and users.
    *   **Environment Variables (with Caution):** If using environment variables, ensure they are properly secured and not easily accessible to unauthorized users or processes.
    *   **Prompt for Password (Interactive Use):** For interactive use cases, prompt the user for the repository password instead of storing it persistently.
