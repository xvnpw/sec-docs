# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for restic/restic

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Repository Password/Key](./mitigation_strategies/strong_repository_passwordkey.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Password Generation:** Use a cryptographically secure random password generator to create a password of sufficient length and complexity. Alternatively, generate a strong key file using `restic key generate`.
    2.  **Password Storage (Avoid Hardcoding):**  Do not embed the password directly in scripts, configuration files, or application code.
    3.  **Secure Password Input:** When prompted for a password, ensure it's entered securely.
    4.  **Key File Storage (Secure Location):** If using key files, store them in a secure location with restricted file system permissions.
    5.  **Password Management (Secrets Manager):**  Ideally, integrate with a secrets management solution to retrieve the password or key at runtime.
    6.  **Password Rotation (Regularly):** Implement a policy to rotate the repository password or key file periodically.

    2.  **Comprehensive Checks (`--read-data`):** Periodically run `restic check --read-data` to verify data blob integrity.
    3.  **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor the output of `restic check` commands and set up alerts for errors or warnings.
    4.  **Automated Remediation (If Possible):** Consider automating `restic repair` after a failed `restic check`, with caution and testing.
    5.  **Log Analysis:**  Review `restic check` logs regularly.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify Restic Client Binaries](./mitigation_strategies/verify_restic_client_binaries.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Official Download Sources:** Download `restic` binaries only from official and trusted sources.
    2.  **Checksum Verification:**  Always verify the integrity of downloaded binaries using checksums provided by the `restic` project.
    3.  **GPG Signature Verification (Optional but Recommended):**  If possible, verify the GPG signature of the release artifacts.
    4.  **Secure Distribution Channels:** If distributing `restic` binaries internally, use secure distribution channels and ensure the binaries are verified before distribution.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Malware Injection (High Severity)
    *   Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity)
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity)

    *   Malware Injection: High reduction
    *   Supply Chain Attacks: Medium reduction
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: Medium reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined
*   **Missing Implementation:** To be determined

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Key Exposure in Logs and Outputs](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_key_exposure_in_logs_and_outputs.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Environment Variables for Passwords:** Utilize `restic`'s support for reading repository passwords from environment variables (e.g., `RESTIC_PASSWORD`, `RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE`).
    2.  **Redact Sensitive Information in Logs:** Configure logging systems to redact or mask sensitive information like repository passwords or key file paths from log outputs.
    3.  **Secure Logging Practices:** Ensure logs are stored securely and access is restricted to authorized personnel.
    4.  **Code Review and Script Auditing:**  Review backup scripts and application code to ensure that repository passwords or key file paths are not inadvertently logged or printed.
    5.  **Error Handling and Output Sanitization:** Implement proper error handling in backup scripts and applications to avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages. Sanitize outputs before displaying them to users or writing them to logs.
