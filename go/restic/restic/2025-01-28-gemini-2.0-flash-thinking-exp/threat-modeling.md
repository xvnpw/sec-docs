# Threat Model Analysis for restic/restic

## Threat: [Spoofing Restic Repository](./threats/spoofing_restic_repository.md)

* **Description:** Attacker redirects application's `restic` backups to a malicious repository by manipulating repository URL or credentials. This can be done by compromising application configuration or intercepting network traffic.
* **Impact:** Data exfiltration to attacker-controlled repository, data corruption by backing up to a fake repository, denial of service by backing up to a non-existent repository.
* **Restic Component Affected:** Repository configuration, `restic backup` command, network communication.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strict repository URL and credential validation in the application.
    * Securely store and manage repository configuration (avoid hardcoding, use environment variables or secrets management).
    * Utilize repository verification mechanisms if available (e.g., checking repository ID).
    * Enforce HTTPS for repository communication.

## Threat: [Spoofing Restic Binary](./threats/spoofing_restic_binary.md)

* **Description:** Attacker replaces the legitimate `restic` binary on the application server with a malicious executable. This can be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in system security or gaining unauthorized access. When the application executes `restic`, the malicious binary runs instead.
* **Impact:** Complete system compromise, arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, denial of service, privilege escalation.
* **Restic Component Affected:** `restic` binary execution, system calls.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement binary integrity verification (checksumming) for `restic` upon installation and regularly.
    * Securely store the `restic` binary in a protected directory with restricted write access.
    * Harden system PATH environment variable to prevent execution of malicious binaries from attacker-controlled directories.
    * Employ system security monitoring and intrusion detection systems.

## Threat: [Tampering with Backup Data in Repository](./threats/tampering_with_backup_data_in_repository.md)

* **Description:** Attacker gains unauthorized access to the backup repository (e.g., by compromising credentials or exploiting repository vulnerabilities) and modifies or deletes backup snapshots.
* **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, inability to restore from backups, potential introduction of malicious data during restore if attacker injects compromised snapshots.
* **Restic Component Affected:** Backup repository storage, `restic prune`, `restic forget` commands (if misused by attacker).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strong access control mechanisms for the backup repository (authentication, authorization).
    * Regularly use `restic check` to verify repository integrity and detect tampering.
    * Consider immutable backup storage solutions if available.
    * Implement robust backup versioning and retention policies.
    * Monitor repository access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Tampering with Restic Command Execution (Command Injection)](./threats/tampering_with_restic_command_execution__command_injection_.md)

* **Description:** If the application dynamically constructs `restic` commands without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands through application inputs.
* **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the application server, data exfiltration, data corruption, denial of service, privilege escalation.
* **Restic Component Affected:** Application's `restic` command construction logic, system command execution.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement secure command construction practices: parameterization, escaping, or using libraries that prevent command injection.
    * Thoroughly sanitize and validate all inputs used in `restic` command construction.
    * Apply principle of least privilege when executing `restic` commands.

## Threat: [Exposure of Backup Repository Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_backup_repository_credentials.md)

* **Description:** Backup repository credentials (passwords, API keys) are exposed through insecure storage (hardcoding, insecure configuration files), logging, or application vulnerabilities.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the backup repository, leading to data exfiltration, tampering, or denial of service.
* **Restic Component Affected:** Credential management within the application, repository access.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., Vault, Key Vault, Secrets Manager) to store and retrieve credentials.
    * Never hardcode credentials in application code or configuration files.
    * Use environment variables for credential passing where appropriate.
    * Implement principle of least privilege for credential access.
    * Regularly rotate repository credentials.
    * Avoid logging credentials.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Restic Execution](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_restic_execution.md)

* **Description:** If `restic` is run with elevated privileges (e.g., root) and vulnerabilities exist in `restic` or its integration, an attacker could exploit these to gain higher privileges.
* **Impact:** Complete system compromise, ability to perform any action on the system.
* **Restic Component Affected:** `restic` binary execution, system calls, application's privilege management.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Apply principle of least privilege: run `restic` with minimal necessary privileges.
    * If root privileges are required, carefully review security implications and minimize scope.
    * Implement secure command execution practices to prevent command injection.
    * Conduct regular security audits of the application and its `restic` integration.
