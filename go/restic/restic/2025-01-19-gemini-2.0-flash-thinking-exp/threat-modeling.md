# Threat Model Analysis for restic/restic

## Threat: [Unauthorized Repository Access](./threats/unauthorized_repository_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Repository Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the restic repository. This could be achieved by compromising storage credentials (e.g., cloud storage access keys, SSH keys) used *by restic*, exploiting network vulnerabilities to access the storage location configured *for restic*, or through physical access to the storage medium containing the *restic* repository. Once accessed, the attacker can read, modify, or delete backup data managed *by restic*.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive application data backed up *with restic*, potential data corruption or loss within the *restic* repository, disruption of backup and restore capabilities *provided by restic*, and potential for using the repository as a staging ground for further attacks targeting data managed *by restic*.
    *   **Affected Restic Component:** Repository Storage (backends like s3, rest-server, local filesystem as configured in *restic*), Authentication mechanisms for repository access *within restic*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls and authentication mechanisms for the restic repository storage as configured *within restic*.
        *   Utilize secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSH) for accessing remote repositories *as configured in restic*.
        *   Enforce multi-factor authentication for accessing storage accounts used *by restic*.
        *   Regularly review and rotate storage credentials used *by restic*.
        *   Implement network segmentation to limit access to the repository storage used *by restic*.
        *   Consider encryption at rest for the storage medium itself where the *restic* repository resides.

## Threat: [Compromised Encryption Key](./threats/compromised_encryption_key.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Encryption Key
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the restic encryption key. This could happen through insecure storage of the key (e.g., in plain text configuration files used *by restic*, environment variables accessible *to restic*), phishing attacks targeting administrators who manage *restic* keys, or exploiting vulnerabilities in key management systems used *in conjunction with restic*. With the key, the attacker can decrypt and access the backed-up data managed *by restic*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete exposure of all data backed up *with restic*, potentially leading to data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Restic Component:** Encryption/Decryption functionality *within restic*, Key handling *by restic*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store the encryption key securely using a dedicated secrets manager or hardware security module (HSM) integrated *with restic* or the system running it.
        *   Implement strong access controls for accessing the key used *by restic*.
        *   Enforce multi-factor authentication for key access related *to restic*.
        *   Consider key rotation policies for *restic* encryption keys.
        *   Educate administrators about phishing and social engineering attacks that could target *restic* key management.

## Threat: [Loss of Encryption Key](./threats/loss_of_encryption_key.md)

*   **Threat:** Loss of Encryption Key
    *   **Description:** The restic encryption key is permanently lost or becomes inaccessible due to hardware failure, accidental deletion, or other unforeseen circumstances affecting the storage of the *restic* key. Without the key, the backups created *by restic* become unusable.
    *   **Impact:** Permanent loss of all data backed up *with restic*, rendering the backups useless for recovery purposes.
    *   **Affected Restic Component:** Encryption/Decryption functionality *within restic*, Key handling *by restic*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a robust key backup and recovery plan specifically for the *restic* encryption key.
        *   Store backups of the *restic* encryption key in a secure and separate location.
        *   Consider using key derivation from a passphrase and securely storing the passphrase (with appropriate complexity) used *with restic*.
        *   Regularly test the key recovery process for *restic*.

## Threat: [Malicious Backup Modification](./threats/malicious_backup_modification.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Backup Modification
    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to the system running restic or the repository modifies existing backups created *by restic*. This could involve injecting malicious code into backed-up files or altering data to cause application malfunctions upon restoration *using restic*.
    *   **Impact:** Restoring compromised backups *with restic* could lead to the reintroduction of vulnerabilities, deployment of malware, or corruption of application data.
    *   **Affected Restic Component:** Backup process *within restic*, Repository Storage (as managed *by restic*), Snapshot management *by restic*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the environment where restic is running to prevent unauthorized access.
        *   Implement integrity checks on data before and after backup *using restic*.
        *   Utilize immutable storage for the restic repository if possible.
        *   Regularly verify the integrity of backups using `restic check`.

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection During Backup](./threats/malicious_data_injection_during_backup.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Data Injection During Backup
    *   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges on the system running restic manipulates the data being backed up before restic processes it. This could involve injecting malicious code or altering data that will be included in the backup created *by restic*.
    *   **Impact:** Restoring these compromised backups *with restic* will introduce malicious data or code into the application environment.
    *   **Affected Restic Component:** Backup process *within restic*, File selection and processing *by restic*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strict access controls on the system running restic.
        *   Implement monitoring for unauthorized file modifications before *restic* backup.
        *   Run restic with the least necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Exploiting Restic Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_restic_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Restic Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the restic software itself to gain unauthorized access to the repository managed *by restic*, manipulate backups, or cause denial of service affecting *restic* operations.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for data breaches from the *restic* repository, data corruption within *restic* backups, or disruption of backup services *provided by restic*.
    *   **Affected Restic Component:** Various components depending on the vulnerability (e.g., parsing, networking, encryption *within restic*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep restic updated to the latest stable version.
        *   Monitor restic security advisories and apply patches promptly.
        *   Consider using a stable and well-vetted version of restic.

## Threat: [Compromised Restic Binary](./threats/compromised_restic_binary.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Restic Binary
    *   **Description:** An attacker replaces the legitimate restic binary with a malicious one. This could be done through various means, such as compromising the download source or exploiting vulnerabilities in the system where restic is installed. The malicious binary could then perform actions within the scope of *restic's* functionality.
    *   **Impact:** The malicious binary could be used to steal data from the repository managed *by restic*, compromise backups created *by restic*, or perform other malicious actions using *restic's* capabilities.
    *   **Affected Restic Component:** Entire application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Download restic binaries from official and trusted sources.
