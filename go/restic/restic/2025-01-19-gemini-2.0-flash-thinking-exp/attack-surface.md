# Attack Surface Analysis for restic/restic

## Attack Surface: [Repository Access and Credentials](./attack_surfaces/repository_access_and_credentials.md)

**Description:** Unauthorized access to the restic repository, allowing attackers to view, modify, or delete backups.

**How Restic Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Restic's core security model relies on a single password to encrypt and authenticate access to the entire repository. Compromise of this password grants full access.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the configuration file where the repository password is stored or intercepts the password being entered during a restic command.

**Impact:** Complete loss of backup confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Attackers can read sensitive data, delete backups leading to data loss, or inject malicious data.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strong Password Policy:** Enforce the use of strong, unique passwords for the restic repository.
* **Secure Password Storage:** Avoid storing the password directly in configuration files or scripts. Utilize secure secret management solutions.
* **Avoid Passing Password in Command Line:** Do not pass the repository password as a command-line argument. Use environment variables or secure input methods.

## Attack Surface: [Storage Backend Vulnerabilities (Directly impacting Restic)](./attack_surfaces/storage_backend_vulnerabilities__directly_impacting_restic_.md)

**Description:** Security weaknesses in the underlying storage backend that, when exploited, directly compromise the restic repository's integrity or confidentiality.

**How Restic Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Restic relies on the security of the storage backend it's configured to use. If the backend is compromised (and restic's access credentials are used), the repository is directly affected.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the AWS access keys used by restic to store backups in an S3 bucket. They can then directly delete or modify the backup data within the repository structure.

**Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, or unauthorized access to backups stored within the restic repository structure on the compromised backend.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure Storage Backend Configuration:** Follow security best practices for the chosen storage backend (e.g., strong access controls for S3 buckets, secure SSH configuration for SFTP).
* **Principle of Least Privilege for Backend Credentials:** Grant restic only the necessary permissions to the storage backend.
* **Regularly Rotate Backend Credentials:** Periodically change the access keys or passwords used by restic to access the storage backend.

## Attack Surface: [Restic-Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/restic-specific_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Security flaws within the `restic` application itself that could be exploited by attackers to compromise the backup process or repository.

**How Restic Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  Bugs or vulnerabilities in `restic`'s code can be directly exploited if an attacker can influence its input or execution.

**Example:** A vulnerability in restic's handling of certain file metadata could be exploited by backing up a specially crafted file, leading to repository corruption or denial of service.

**Impact:** Potential for denial of service of the backup process, corruption of the backup repository, or in severe cases, arbitrary code execution on the system running restic.

**Risk Severity:** **High** (potential for significant impact on backup integrity and availability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep Restic Updated:** Regularly update restic to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
* **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about any reported security vulnerabilities in restic.
* **Limit Input from Untrusted Sources:** Be cautious about backing up data from untrusted sources, as it could contain malicious payloads designed to exploit restic vulnerabilities.
