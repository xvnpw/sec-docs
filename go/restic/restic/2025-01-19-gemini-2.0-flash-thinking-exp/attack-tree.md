## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Restic [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_restic__high-risk_path_.md)

This represents the overall goal achieved through one or more of the identified high-risk paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Restic Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_restic_configuration__critical_node_.md)

This node is critical because successful compromise often reveals sensitive information needed for further attacks, such as repository locations and potentially the encryption key.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Read Access to Configuration Files [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_read_access_to_configuration_files__high-risk_path_.md)

If the server hosting the application has weak file system permissions, attackers can directly read the Restic configuration file.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability to Read Configuration Files [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_to_read_configuration_files__high-risk_path_.md)

A vulnerability in the application (e.g., Local File Inclusion) allows attackers to bypass normal access controls and read arbitrary files, including the Restic configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain Restic Password/Key [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_restic_passwordkey__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

Obtaining the encryption key or password grants access to the backups.

## Attack Tree Path: [Plaintext Storage in Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/plaintext_storage_in_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

The Restic password is stored directly in the configuration file without any encryption or hashing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Password Hardcoded in Application [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/password_hardcoded_in_application__high-risk_path_.md)

The Restic password is directly embedded within the application's source code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured Access Controls on Key File [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_access_controls_on_key_file__high-risk_path_.md)

If a key file is used for encryption, weak file system permissions allow unauthorized users to read the key file.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Restic Execution [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_restic_execution__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers aim to control how Restic is executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Application [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_application__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Restic Commands or Options [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_restic_commands_or_options__high-risk_path_.md)

The application constructs Restic commands using user-supplied input without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary commands or options.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Restic Repository [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_restic_repository__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers aim to gain access to the stored backup data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Repository Files [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_repository_files__high-risk_path_.md)

If the Restic repository is stored on the local filesystem, weak permissions allow unauthorized users to directly access and manipulate the repository files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Repository Credentials [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_repository_credentials__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Reuse of Restic Password for Repository Access [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/reuse_of_restic_password_for_repository_access__high-risk_path_.md)

The same password used for Restic encryption is also used to authenticate with the repository backend. Compromising the Restic password grants access to the repository.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaked Repository Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/leaked_repository_credentials__high-risk_path_.md)

The credentials used to access the repository backend are accidentally exposed in the application's code, logs, or other accessible locations.
