        print("* **Reputational Damage:** Data loss incidents erode trust with customers, partners, and stakeholders, potentially leading to loss of business and negative publicity.")
        print("* **Financial Losses:** Beyond immediate revenue loss, recovery efforts, potential fines for regulatory non-compliance, and legal fees can incur significant costs.")
        print("* **Legal and Regulatory Non-Compliance:** Many regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) mandate data backup and recovery capabilities. Failure to restore due to inadequate verification can lead to penalties.")
        print("* **Increased Recovery Costs and Time:** Attempting to recover from corrupted backups can be significantly more complex and time-consuming than restoring from a verified, healthy backup.")
        print("* **Loss of Productivity:** Employees are unable to perform their tasks effectively when critical data is unavailable.")

        print("* **Silent Data Corruption:** Underlying storage issues (e.g., bit rot, hardware failures) can corrupt backup data over time without immediate detection. `restic` itself might not be aware of these issues until a `check` is performed.")
        print("* **Software Bugs:** Rare but possible, bugs within `restic` or the underlying operating system could lead to backup corruption. Regular checks can help identify these issues early.")
        print("* **Human Error during Backup Process:** Although `restic` is generally reliable, misconfigurations or errors during the backup process could lead to incomplete or corrupted backups. Verification helps identify these issues.")
        print("* **Insufficient Storage Space:** If the backup repository runs out of space during a backup, the process might fail or create an incomplete backup. Checks can flag these issues.")
        print("* **Changes in Backup Infrastructure:** Modifications to the storage infrastructure or network can introduce inconsistencies that affect backup integrity. Regular checks after such changes are crucial.")

        print("    * **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines:** Consider integrating basic `restic check` operations into CI/CD pipelines to verify backups after deployments or significant changes.")
