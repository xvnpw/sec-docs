# Attack Surface Analysis for restic/restic

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Repository Credentials](./attack_surfaces/compromised_repository_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the `restic` repository due to leaked or stolen credentials (password or key file).
*   **How Restic Contributes:** `restic` relies on these credentials for authentication and decryption. If compromised, the entire backup set is vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the environment variable storing the `RESTIC_PASSWORD` used by the application.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of backup data, including unauthorized access, modification, and deletion. Potential for restoring malicious data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store repository passwords securely using secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
    *   Avoid storing passwords directly in code, configuration files, or environment variables without proper protection.
    *   Utilize key files for authentication where possible and ensure they have appropriate file system permissions.
    *   Implement strong access controls on systems where credentials are stored or used.
    *   Regularly rotate repository passwords or keys.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Repository Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_repository_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Storing `restic` repository credentials in a way that is easily accessible to attackers.
*   **How Restic Contributes:** `restic` requires these credentials to function, making their storage a critical security concern.
*   **Example:** The application stores the `restic` repository password in plain text within a configuration file checked into a public Git repository.
*   **Impact:**  Direct compromise of repository credentials, leading to unauthorized access and manipulation of backups.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never store passwords in plain text in configuration files.
    *   Avoid committing sensitive information like passwords to version control systems.
    *   Use environment variables with restricted access or dedicated secrets management solutions.
    *   Encrypt configuration files containing sensitive information.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Restic Commands](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_restic_commands.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious commands into the `restic` command-line arguments executed by the application.
*   **How Restic Contributes:** If the application dynamically constructs `restic` commands based on user input or external data without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable.
*   **Example:** The application allows users to specify backup paths, and an attacker injects `"; rm -rf /"` into the path.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the application, potentially leading to system compromise, data loss, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid dynamically constructing `restic` commands from untrusted input.
    *   If dynamic construction is necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate all input.
    *   Use parameterized commands or a dedicated `restic` library (if available and secure) to avoid direct command-line interaction.
    *   Run `restic` with the least necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Restic Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_restic_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Leveraging known security flaws within the `restic` binary itself.
*   **How Restic Contributes:** The application's reliance on the `restic` binary introduces the risk of vulnerabilities present in that software.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific version of `restic` allows for remote code execution when processing a crafted repository.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the `restic` binary updated to the latest stable version.
    *   Monitor `restic` release notes and security advisories for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a process for quickly patching or updating `restic` when security issues are identified.
