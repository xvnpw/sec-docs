# Threat Model Analysis for restic/restic

## Threat: [Weak or Compromised Password/Key](./threats/weak_or_compromised_passwordkey.md)

**Description:** The password or key used to encrypt the `restic` repository is weak, easily guessable, or has been compromised. This could occur through brute-force attacks or if the password/key is stored insecurely. An attacker with the correct password/key can decrypt and access the backup data managed by `restic`.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to all backup data managed by `restic`, loss of confidentiality.

**Affected Restic Component:** Encryption Module, Key Derivation Function

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use strong, randomly generated passwords or passphrases for `restic`.
* Store the `restic` password/key securely using a dedicated secrets management system.
* Avoid storing the password/key directly in application code or configuration files.
* Implement access controls for accessing the stored password/key.
* Regularly rotate the `restic` password/key.

## Threat: [Key Exposure through Application Vulnerability](./threats/key_exposure_through_application_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability in the application that interacts with `restic` allows an attacker to retrieve the encryption password or key used by `restic`. This could be due to insecure storage of the key in memory, configuration files, environment variables, or through vulnerabilities like command injection that allow reading sensitive files.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to all backup data managed by `restic`, loss of confidentiality.

**Affected Restic Component:** Encryption Module, potentially the command-line interface if the password is passed as an argument.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid passing the `restic` password as a command-line argument. Use environment variables or secure input methods provided by `restic`.
* Securely manage and store the `restic` password/key using a dedicated secrets management system.
* Regularly scan the application for vulnerabilities, including those that could expose secrets.
* Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent command injection attacks.

## Threat: [Loss of Encryption Key](./threats/loss_of_encryption_key.md)

**Description:** The encryption key used for the `restic` repository is lost or becomes permanently inaccessible, preventing `restic` from decrypting the backups. This could happen due to accidental deletion, hardware failure, or loss of access to the secrets management system.

**Impact:** Inability to decrypt and restore backups managed by `restic`, leading to permanent data loss.

**Affected Restic Component:** Encryption Module, Key Handling

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a robust key backup and recovery strategy.
* Store backups of the encryption key in a secure, offsite location.
* Consider using key escrow mechanisms if appropriate for your security requirements.
* Regularly test the key recovery process.

## Threat: [Command Injection Vulnerability](./threats/command_injection_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** The application constructs `restic` commands dynamically based on user input or other external data without proper sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious commands into the `restic` execution, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server running `restic`. For example, injecting commands to delete files or exfiltrate data using `restic`'s context.

**Impact:** Complete system compromise, data breach, denial of service, depending on the injected commands executed by `restic`.

**Affected Restic Component:** Command-Line Interface, potentially any command that accepts user-controlled input indirectly.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid constructing `restic` commands dynamically from user input.
* If dynamic command construction is unavoidable, use secure methods to sanitize and validate all input before passing it to `restic`.
* Employ parameterized commands or use a dedicated `restic` library (if one exists and is secure) instead of directly invoking the command-line interface.
* Run the `restic` process with the least privileges necessary.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Command-Line Arguments](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_command-line_arguments.md)

**Description:** The `restic` password or other sensitive information (like repository credentials) is passed directly as a command-line argument when invoking `restic`. This information can be visible in process listings, shell history, or system logs, potentially compromising `restic`'s security.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials used by `restic`, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the repository.

**Affected Restic Component:** Command-Line Interface

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Never pass the `restic` password or sensitive credentials directly as command-line arguments.
* Utilize environment variables or secure input methods provided by `restic` for passing sensitive information.

## Threat: [Downgrade Attacks on Restic Binary](./threats/downgrade_attacks_on_restic_binary.md)

**Description:** An attacker replaces the legitimate `restic` binary with an older, vulnerable version. This could be achieved through compromising the system where `restic` is installed.

**Impact:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the older version of `restic`, potentially leading to remote code execution or other attacks within `restic`'s context.

**Affected Restic Component:** The entire `restic` binary.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of the `restic` binary (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures).
* Secure the system where `restic` is installed to prevent unauthorized modification of files.
* Regularly update `restic` to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Known Vulnerabilities in Restic](./threats/known_vulnerabilities_in_restic.md)

**Description:** Unpatched security vulnerabilities exist in the version of `restic` being used. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to backups, cause denial of service within `restic`, or compromise the system running `restic`.

**Impact:** Potential for various attacks depending on the nature of the vulnerability within `restic` (e.g., remote code execution, denial of service, access to backup data).

**Affected Restic Component:** Any part of the `restic` codebase depending on the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update `restic` to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Subscribe to security advisories and release notes for `restic`.
* Implement a vulnerability management process to track and address known vulnerabilities in `restic`.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on Restic](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_restic.md)

**Description:** The `restic` binary or its dependencies are compromised before being deployed. This could involve malicious code being injected into the source code, build process, or distribution channels of `restic`.

**Impact:** Backdoored backups created by `restic`, potential for system compromise through the compromised `restic` binary, data exfiltration via the compromised `restic` process, or other malicious activities.

**Affected Restic Component:** The entire `restic` binary and its dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Download `restic` binaries from official and trusted sources.
* Verify the integrity of downloaded binaries using checksums or digital signatures provided by the `restic` developers.
* Consider using reproducible builds to ensure the integrity of the `restic` build process.
* Monitor the `restic` project for any signs of compromise or suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Inadequate Backup Verification](./threats/inadequate_backup_verification.md)

**Description:** Backups created by `restic` are not regularly tested for integrity and restorability using `restic`'s `check` and `restore` commands. This could lead to a situation where backups are thought to be working but are actually corrupted or unusable when needed.

**Impact:** Failure to restore data when needed using `restic`, leading to data loss despite having backups managed by `restic`.

**Affected Restic Component:** `check` and `restore` commands.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly run `restic check` to verify the integrity of the repository.
* Periodically perform test restores using `restic` to ensure backups can be successfully recovered.
* Automate the backup verification process using `restic`.
