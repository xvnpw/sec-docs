## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Restic Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_restic_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

* Attack Vector: This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Any successful path leading to this node signifies a compromise of the application through its use of Restic.
* Impact: Full compromise of the application, including data breach, service disruption, and potential control over the application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Restic Configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_restic_configuration__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

* Attack Vector: Attackers aim to gain control over how Restic is configured. This allows them to manipulate backup destinations, encryption settings, and other parameters to their advantage.
* Impact: Can lead to data exfiltration, malware injection during restores, or denial of service by disrupting backups. It also opens the door for further attacks by controlling Restic's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Insecurely Stored Restic Password/Key (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/access_insecurely_stored_restic_passwordkey__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

* Attack Vector: This involves exploiting weaknesses in how the application stores or handles the Restic password or encryption key. If the password/key is compromised, the attacker gains full access to the backups.
* Impact: Complete access to all backed-up data, allowing for exfiltration, modification, or deletion. This also enables the attacker to perform malicious restores.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak File Permissions on Configuration Files (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_file_permissions_on_configuration_files__critical_node_.md)

* Attack Vector: If the configuration files containing the Restic password or other sensitive information have overly permissive file permissions, an attacker with access to the server can easily read them.
* Impact: Direct compromise of the Restic password/key, leading to the impacts described above. This is a common and easily exploitable vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Backup Repository (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_backup_repository__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

* Attack Vector: Attackers target the storage location where Restic backups are kept. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the storage service itself or compromising the credentials used to access it.
* Impact: Full control over the backup data, allowing for exfiltration, modification, deletion, or replacement with malicious backups.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Repository Access Credentials (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_repository_access_credentials__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

* Attack Vector: Similar to compromising the Restic password, this involves obtaining the credentials (username, password, API keys, etc.) required to access the backup repository.
* Impact: Grants the attacker the ability to read, write, and delete backups, leading to data breaches, data corruption, or the ability to inject malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Backup/Restore Processes (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_backuprestore_processes__high-risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: This involves interfering with the normal backup and restore operations performed by Restic. This can range from preventing backups to injecting malicious content during restores.
* Impact: Can lead to data loss, inability to recover from incidents, or the introduction of malware into the application environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Malicious Restores (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_malicious_restores__high-risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: Attackers leverage their control over the backup repository (through compromised credentials or configuration) to replace legitimate backups with malicious ones. When a restore operation is performed, this malicious data is deployed into the application's environment.
* Impact: Can lead to code execution, system compromise, and further exploitation of the application and its environment. This is a particularly dangerous attack vector.
