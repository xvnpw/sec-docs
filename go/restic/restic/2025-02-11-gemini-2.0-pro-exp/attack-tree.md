## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Steal Repo Password/Key](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_steal_repo_passwordkey.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker's primary objective is to obtain the password or key used to access the restic repository. This grants them full control over the backups.
*   **Why it's critical:** Direct access to the repository bypasses all other security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Social Engineering](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_social_engineering.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses deceptive techniques (e.g., phishing emails, impersonation) to trick a legitimate user into revealing the repository password or key.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium-High
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-High

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4 Find Unencrypted Password/Key](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4_find_unencrypted_passwordkey.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker searches for the repository password or key stored in plain text in locations like code repositories, configuration files, environment variables, or unsecured storage.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Very Low-Low
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.5 Compromise System with Access](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_5_compromise_system_with_access.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to a system (e.g., developer workstation, CI/CD server, backup server) that has access to the restic repository password/key or can be used to execute restic commands.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium-High
*   **Skill Level:** Medium-High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-High

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.2 Compromise a system with access to the restic configuration](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_2_compromise_a_system_with_access_to_the_restic_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to 1.1.5, but specifically targets a system that stores or has access to the restic configuration file, which may contain repository access information (though ideally, the password/key itself should *not* be in the config file).
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium-High
*   **Effort:** Medium-High
*   **Skill Level:** Medium-High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-High

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1 Gain Access to Repo (e.g., cloud provider creds)](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_gain_access_to_repo__e_g___cloud_provider_creds_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains access to the underlying storage infrastructure (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage) where the restic repository is stored, typically by obtaining cloud provider credentials.  They then delete the repository data.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium-High
*   **Skill Level:** Medium-High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.2 Gain Access to Repo (e.g., cloud provider creds)](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_2_gain_access_to_repo__e_g___cloud_provider_creds_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains access to the underlying storage infrastructure (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage) where the restic repository is stored, typically by obtaining cloud provider credentials.  They then delete the repository data.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium-High
*   **Skill Level:** Medium-High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1 Gain Access to Repo (e.g., cloud provider creds)](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1_gain_access_to_repo__e_g___cloud_provider_creds_.md)

*    **Description:** Similar to 3.1.1, but instead of deleting the data, the attacker overwrites it with garbage data, rendering the backups unusable.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium-High
*   **Skill Level:** Medium-High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.2 Gain Access to Repo (e.g., cloud provider creds)](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_2_gain_access_to_repo__e_g___cloud_provider_creds_.md)

*    **Description:** Similar to 3.1.1, but instead of deleting the data, the attacker overwrites it with garbage data, rendering the backups unusable.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium-High
*   **Skill Level:** Medium-High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
