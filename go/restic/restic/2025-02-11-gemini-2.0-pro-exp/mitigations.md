# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for restic/restic

## Mitigation Strategy: [Append-Only Repository Configuration (via Restic and Backend)](./mitigation_strategies/append-only_repository_configuration__via_restic_and_backend_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Backend Configuration (as prerequisite):** Configure the storage backend (S3, B2, SFTP, etc.) for append-only access.  This is *essential* for restic's append-only mode to function correctly.  (See previous detailed description for backend-specific steps).
    2.  **Separate Credentials:** Create *separate* credentials for backup (append-only) and `forget`/`prune` (delete-capable) operations.
    3.  **Restic Initialization (if new repository):** When initializing a new repository, use the append-only credentials.
    4.  **Restic Configuration (existing repository):** If using an existing repository, ensure restic is configured to use the append-only credentials for regular backup operations. This usually involves setting environment variables or using command-line flags (e.g., `--repo`, `--password-file`, and backend-specific options) correctly.
    5.  **`forget` and `prune` with Restricted Credentials:** Use the separate, highly restricted credentials *only* when running `restic forget` and `restic prune`.  These commands *can* delete data, so their use must be carefully controlled.
    6. **Testing:** Verify that backups can be created, but existing data *cannot* be modified or deleted using the regular backup credentials. Use `restic snapshots` to list snapshots and attempt to modify/delete them with the append-only credentials â€“ this should fail.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Repository Compromise (Data Tampering/Deletion):** Severity: **Critical**.
    *   **Accidental Deletion:** Severity: **High**.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Repository Compromise:** Risk reduction: **Very High**.
    *   **Accidental Deletion:** Risk reduction: **High**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **(Hypothetical Project):** Partially Implemented. Backend configured for append-only, but separate credentials for `forget`/`prune` are not consistently used in scripts.
    *   **(Real Project):** *Replace with your project's status.*

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **(Hypothetical Project):** Consistent use of separate, restricted credentials for all `forget` and `prune` operations, including those within automated scripts.
    *   **(Real Project):** *Identify gaps.*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Integrity Checks (using `restic check`)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_integrity_checks__using__restic_check__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Automated Script:** Create a script that runs `restic check --read-data` (strongly recommended) or, at a minimum, `restic check`. The `--read-data` flag verifies the actual data blocks, providing a much more thorough check.
    2.  **Scheduling:** Schedule the script to run regularly (e.g., daily, weekly) using a task scheduler.
    3.  **Alerting:** Configure the script to send alerts if any errors are detected.
    4.  **Logging:** Log the output of the `restic check` command.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Repository Compromise (Data Tampering):** Severity: **Critical**.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Severity: **High**.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Repository Compromise:** Risk reduction: **Medium**.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduction: **High**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **(Hypothetical Project):** A weekly `restic check` is scheduled, but `--read-data` is not used consistently.
    *   **(Real Project):** *Replace with your project's status.*

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **(Hypothetical Project):** Consistent use of `restic check --read-data` in the scheduled script.
    *   **(Real Project):** *Identify gaps.*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Versioned Restores (using `restic restore`)](./mitigation_strategies/versioned_restores__using__restic_restore__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Snapshots:** Use `restic snapshots` to list available snapshots and identify the desired point in time for restoration. Note the snapshot ID.
    2.  **Targeted Restore:** Use `restic restore <snapshot_id> --target <restore_directory> [options]` to restore to a specific snapshot.
        *   `--target`: Specifies the directory where the data will be restored. *Crucially*, this should *not* be the original location, but a separate, safe location (ideally a sandboxed environment).
        *   `--include`, `--exclude`: Use these options to restore only specific files or directories, minimizing the amount of data restored and reducing the potential attack surface.
    3. **Verification:** After restoring, verify the integrity of the restored data and ensure it matches the expected state at the chosen snapshot.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised Backup Source (Malware Included in Backup):** Severity: **Critical** (when combined with a sandboxed restore environment). Allows restoring to a point *before* a potential compromise.
    * **Accidental File Deletion/Modification:** Severity: **High**.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised Backup Source:** Risk reduction: **Medium** (High when combined with sandboxing).
    * **Accidental File Deletion/Modification:** Risk reduction: **High**

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **(Hypothetical Project):** Developers are aware of `restic restore`, but there's no standardized procedure for versioned restores, and restores are often done directly to non-production systems without a dedicated sandbox.
    *   **(Real Project):** *Replace with your project's status.*

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **(Hypothetical Project):** Documented procedure for performing versioned restores, including the use of `--target` to a safe location and the use of `--include`/`--exclude` for targeted restores. Integration with a sandboxed restore environment (as described previously).
    *   **(Real Project):** *Identify gaps.*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Key Management (for Restic Encryption)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_key_management__for_restic_encryption_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Strong Password/Key:** Generate a strong, random password or key for the restic repository.
    2.  **Secure Storage:** Store the password/key *outside* the repository and *outside* any system that has direct access to the repository. Use a password manager, secrets management service, or HSM.
    3.  **Key Rotation:** Implement a process for regularly rotating the restic repository password/key using `restic key add` and `restic key remove`. This involves:
        *   Generating a new key.
        *   Adding the new key to the repository: `restic key add`.
        *   Removing the old key: `restic key remove`.
        *   Securely storing the new key and securely deleting the old key.
    4. **Access Control:** Limit access to the password/key.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Key Compromise (Unauthorized Access to Backups):** Severity: **Critical**.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Key Compromise:** Risk reduction: **High**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **(Hypothetical Project):** Password is in a password manager, but key rotation is not automated or regularly performed.
    *   **(Real Project):** *Replace with your project's status.*

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **(Hypothetical Project):** Automated or documented procedure for key rotation using `restic key add` and `restic key remove`.
    *   **(Real Project):** *Identify gaps.*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restic Updates](./mitigation_strategies/restic_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Releases:** Regularly check for new restic releases on GitHub.
    2.  **Review Changelogs:** Examine changelogs for security fixes.
    3.  **Update Procedure:**
        *   Download the latest release binary.
        *   Verify the binary's integrity (checksums, GPG signatures).
        *   Replace the existing restic binary.
        *   Test the updated version (`restic version`, `restic snapshots`).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Restic Vulnerabilities:** Severity: **Variable**.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Restic Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduction: **High**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **(Hypothetical Project):** Updates are performed ad-hoc, without a formal procedure.
    *   **(Real Project):** *Replace with your project's status.*

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **(Hypothetical Project):** Formalized update procedure, including verification of binaries and testing after updates.
    *   **(Real Project):** *Identify gaps.*
