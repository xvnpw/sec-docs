# Threat Model Analysis for restic/restic

## Threat: [Unauthorized Repository Access via Stolen Credentials](./threats/unauthorized_repository_access_via_stolen_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains the `restic` repository password, cloud storage access keys, or other credentials.  The attacker could use the `restic` CLI or a custom tool to connect to the repository, decrypt the data, and exfiltrate it. They could also modify or delete existing backups. This is a *direct* threat because it targets `restic`'s core functionality: repository access and encryption.
    *   **Impact:** Complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of backup data.  Potential for data breaches, data loss, and reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Restic Component:**  Repository access logic (all backends), encryption/decryption routines.  This affects the entire `restic` process, as repository access is fundamental.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secrets Management:** Store credentials in a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   **Strong Passwords:** Use a strong, unique, and randomly generated password for the `restic` repository.
        *   **Credential Rotation:** Regularly rotate the repository password and any cloud storage access keys.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Grant the application only the minimum necessary permissions to the repository (e.g., read-only access for verification, write-only for backups).
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA for access to the secrets manager and cloud storage provider.
        *   **Environment Variables:** Pass credentials to `restic` via environment variables, *never* hardcoding them.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** If possible, isolate the backup repository on a separate network segment.

## Threat: [Repository Corruption due to Storage Failure (If `restic` backend doesn't handle it)](./threats/repository_corruption_due_to_storage_failure__if__restic__backend_doesn't_handle_it_.md)

*   **Description:** The underlying storage used for the `restic` repository experiences a failure.  While `restic` is designed to be robust, certain storage failures *combined with specific backend limitations* could lead to corruption that `restic` cannot automatically recover from. This is *direct* because it relates to how `restic` interacts with its storage backend.  (Note: This is less of a concern with robust backends like S3, but more relevant for simpler backends like `local` or `sftp` if used without underlying redundancy).
    *   **Impact:**  Loss of backup data availability.  Potential for data loss if the repository cannot be recovered.
    *   **Affected Restic Component:**  The specific backend used for storage (e.g., `local`, `s3`, `sftp`).  `restic`'s internal data structures are also affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Redundant Storage:** Use redundant storage for the repository (e.g., RAID, cloud storage with built-in redundancy). This is the *primary* mitigation.
        *   **Regular Checks:** Run `restic check` regularly to verify the integrity of the repository and detect corruption early.
        *   **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring to detect storage failures or performance issues.
        *   **Multiple Repositories:** Consider maintaining multiple, geographically distributed `restic` repositories for disaster recovery.
        *   **Choose Reliable Backend:** Select a `restic` backend known for its reliability and data durability, and ensure the *underlying storage* is also reliable.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Leakage via Misconfigured Exclusions](./threats/sensitive_data_leakage_via_misconfigured_exclusions.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrect or incomplete `--exclude` or `--exclude-file` patterns in the `restic` configuration lead to sensitive files being included in the backup. This is a *direct* threat because it involves the specific configuration and functionality of `restic`'s file inclusion/exclusion mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of data confidentiality. Sensitive information is exposed to anyone with access to the repository.
    *   **Affected Restic Component:** The `--exclude` and `--exclude-file` options and the associated file matching logic within `restic`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Configuration:** Thoroughly review and test the `restic` include/exclude patterns. Use a "deny-all, allow-specific" approach if possible.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically audit the *contents* of backups (by restoring to a test environment) to verify that sensitive data is not being included.
        *   **Least Privilege (Data):** Avoid storing sensitive data in locations that are likely to be backed up *at all*.
        *   **Separate Repositories:** Consider using separate repositories for different data sensitivity levels, with stricter access controls on the more sensitive repositories.
