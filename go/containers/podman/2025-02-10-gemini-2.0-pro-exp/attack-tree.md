## Attack Tree Path: [Path 1: Unauthenticated API Access -> Gain Unauthorized Root Access](./attack_tree_paths/path_1_unauthenticated_api_access_-_gain_unauthorized_root_access.md)

This is the most direct and critical path. If the API is exposed without authentication, the attacker immediately achieves their goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 2: Rootless Podman Bypass -> Gain Unauthorized Root Access](./attack_tree_paths/path_2_rootless_podman_bypass_-_gain_unauthorized_root_access.md)

This path bypasses the intended security of rootless Podman, leading to control over the host user's resources and potentially full root access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 3: Known Image Vulnerabilities -> Privilege Escalation within Container -> Exploit Container Runtime Vulnerabilities (Implicit in the tree, but not shown as a separate node) -> Gain Unauthorized Root Access](./attack_tree_paths/path_3_known_image_vulnerabilities_-_privilege_escalation_within_container_-_exploit_container_runti_01894dc2.md)

**Step 1: Known Image Vulnerabilities:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application or a library within the container image to gain initial code execution.
**Step 2: Privilege Escalation within Container:** The attacker leverages a misconfiguration within the container (e.g., a setuid binary, excessive capabilities) to gain higher privileges *inside* the container, often becoming root *within the container's namespace*.
**Step 3: Exploit Container Runtime Vulnerabilities (Implicit):** The attacker then exploits a vulnerability in the container runtime (runC, crun) to escape the container and gain access to the host system. This step is *implicit* because it's a common follow-on to privilege escalation within the container, but the sub-tree focuses on the *initial* high-risk entry points.
This is a classic and very common container escape scenario.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 4: Outdated Base Image -> Known Image Vulnerabilities -> ... (same as Path 3)](./attack_tree_paths/path_4_outdated_base_image_-_known_image_vulnerabilities_-______same_as_path_3_.md)

An outdated base image often contains known vulnerabilities, making it a stepping stone to Path 3.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 5: Insecure Network Configuration -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Container Images -> ... (Potentially leading to Path 3)](./attack_tree_paths/path_5_insecure_network_configuration_-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_container_images_-______potential_626e38c6.md)

An exposed service within the container, due to insecure network configuration, makes it easier for an attacker to reach and exploit vulnerabilities within the container image.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 6: Volume Mount Abuse -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Container Images -> ... (Potentially leading to Path 3)](./attack_tree_paths/path_6_volume_mount_abuse_-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_container_images_-______potentially_leading_t_002cad6a.md)

If a container has write access to a sensitive host directory via a volume mount, an attacker could modify host files or gain access to sensitive data, potentially aiding in further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 7: Privilege Escalation within Container -> Exploit Container Runtime Vulnerabilities (Implicit) -> Gain Unauthorized Root Access](./attack_tree_paths/path_7_privilege_escalation_within_container_-_exploit_container_runtime_vulnerabilities__implicit___7dd6599d.md)

This path highlights that even without initial image vulnerabilities, if a container is run with excessive privileges, an attacker can potentially escape.
