# Deep Analysis: Verify Image Signatures (Podman)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation gaps of the "Verify Image Signatures" mitigation strategy within the context of a Podman-based containerized application.  We aim to understand how this strategy protects against image tampering and supply chain attacks, identify current implementation shortcomings, and propose concrete steps for improvement.  The ultimate goal is to ensure that only trusted and verified container images are used in the application's deployment pipeline.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following aspects:

*   **Podman's built-in signature verification capabilities:**  `podman image trust` and `podman pull --signature-policy`.
*   **The role of `skopeo` in signature verification:**  As a closely related tool often used with Podman.
*   **The current state of implementation:**  Acknowledging the use of a private container registry but the absence of `podman image trust` and `--signature-policy`.
*   **Threats directly addressed by this strategy:** Image tampering and supply chain attacks.
*   **The impact of *not* fully implementing this strategy.**
*   **Recommendations for full implementation and best practices.**

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other container runtimes (e.g., Docker).
*   Mitigation strategies unrelated to image signing.
*   Detailed configuration of the private container registry itself (beyond its interaction with signature verification).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling Review:** Briefly revisit the threat model to confirm the relevance of image tampering and supply chain attacks.
2.  **Technical Deep Dive:**  Explain the mechanics of `podman image trust`, `podman pull --signature-policy`, and `skopeo`'s signature verification capabilities.  This includes how signatures are created, stored, and verified.
3.  **Gap Analysis:**  Identify the specific discrepancies between the ideal implementation of this strategy and the current state.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Quantify (where possible) the increased risk due to the identified gaps.
5.  **Recommendations:**  Provide actionable steps to fully implement the mitigation strategy, including specific commands, configuration examples, and best practices.
6.  **Integration with Development Workflow:** Discuss how to integrate signature verification into the CI/CD pipeline.

## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1 Threat Modeling Review

Image tampering and supply chain attacks are critical threats to containerized applications.

*   **Image Tampering:** An attacker could modify a legitimate image in a registry, injecting malicious code that would be executed when the container is run.  This could lead to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks:**  An attacker could compromise the build process or the registry itself, substituting a malicious image for a legitimate one.  This is particularly dangerous because it can be difficult to detect without proper verification.

The use of a private registry *reduces* the attack surface compared to using public registries, but it does *not* eliminate the risk.  An attacker who gains access to the private registry (e.g., through compromised credentials or a vulnerability) could still tamper with images.

### 4.2 Technical Deep Dive

#### 4.2.1 `podman image trust`

This command manages the trust policy for container registries.  It allows you to define which registries are trusted and what level of signature verification is required.  The trust policy is stored in a file (typically `/etc/containers/policy.json`).

*   **`podman image trust show`:** Displays the current trust policy.
*   **`podman image trust set`:**  Sets or modifies the trust policy for a specific registry.  You can specify:
    *   **`type`:**  The type of trust policy.  Common options include:
        *   `signedBy` : Requires images to be signed by a specific key.
        *   `accept` : Accepts all images from the registry (no verification).
        *   `reject` : Rejects all images from the registry.
    *   **`keyPath` or `keyType`:** Specifies the location or type of the key used for signature verification.
*   **`podman image trust modify`:** is deprecated.

#### 4.2.2 `podman pull --signature-policy`

This option allows you to override the default trust policy (from `/etc/containers/policy.json`) for a specific `podman pull` operation.  You provide a path to a custom policy file.  This is useful for testing or for pulling images from registries with different trust requirements.

#### 4.2.3 `skopeo`

`skopeo` is a command-line utility for working with container images and registries.  While not a direct part of Podman, it's frequently used alongside it.  `skopeo` can:

*   **Inspect images:**  `skopeo inspect docker://<registry>/<image>:<tag>`  This can show image metadata, including signature information.
*   **Copy images:**  `skopeo copy` can be used to copy images between registries, and it can also perform signature verification during the copy process.
*   **Verify signatures:** `skopeo standalone-verify` can be used to verify the signature of a local image manifest.

#### 4.2.4 Signature Creation and Verification Process

1.  **Signing:**  A container image is signed using a private key.  This generates a digital signature that is associated with the image's digest (a cryptographic hash of the image's contents).
2.  **Storage:**  The signature is typically stored in the container registry alongside the image.
3.  **Verification:**  When Podman (or `skopeo`) pulls an image, it retrieves the signature from the registry.  It then uses the corresponding public key to verify that the signature is valid and that the image's digest matches the one associated with the signature.  If the verification fails, the image is rejected.

### 4.3 Gap Analysis

The primary gap is the lack of utilization of `podman image trust` and `--signature-policy`.  This means:

*   **No enforced signature verification:**  Podman is likely pulling images without checking their signatures.  This leaves the application vulnerable to image tampering and supply chain attacks, even with the private registry.
*   **No defined trust policy:**  There's no explicit configuration specifying which registries are trusted and what level of signature verification is required.  This makes it difficult to manage trust consistently and to prevent accidental use of untrusted images.

### 4.4 Impact Assessment

The impact of these gaps is **high**.  Without signature verification, the application is highly susceptible to:

*   **Compromised containers:**  An attacker could inject malicious code into the application, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Reputational damage:**  A successful attack could damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
*   **Compliance violations:**  Depending on the industry and regulations, running untrusted code could lead to compliance violations and penalties.

### 4.5 Recommendations

To fully implement the "Verify Image Signatures" mitigation strategy, the following steps are recommended:

1.  **Generate Signing Keys:**
    *   Use a secure key management system to generate and store the private and public keys used for signing images.  Consider using a hardware security module (HSM) for enhanced security.
    *   Example (using `gpg` - *not recommended for production without proper key management*):
        ```bash
        gpg --full-generate-key
        gpg --armor --export <key-id> > public.key
        ```

2.  **Configure `podman image trust`:**
    *   Create or modify `/etc/containers/policy.json` to define the trust policy for your private registry.
    *   Example:
        ```json
        {
            "default": [
                {
                    "type": "reject"
                }
            ],
            "transports": {
                "docker": {
                    "my-private-registry.com": [
                        {
                            "type": "signedBy",
                            "keyType": "GPGKeys",
                            "keyPath": "/path/to/public.key"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
        ```
        This example configures Podman to reject all images by default, except for images from `my-private-registry.com` that are signed with the specified GPG key.

3.  **Sign Images:**
    *   Integrate image signing into your build process.  This can be done using tools like `skopeo` or other signing utilities.
    *   Example (using `skopeo`):
        ```bash
        skopeo copy --sign-by <key-id> docker://<source-image> docker://my-private-registry.com/<target-image>
        ```

4.  **Enforce Signature Verification on Pull:**
    *   While the `policy.json` should enforce this, you can also use `--signature-policy` for specific pulls:
        ```bash
        podman pull --signature-policy /etc/containers/policy.json my-private-registry.com/my-image:latest
        ```

5.  **Regularly Rotate Keys:**
    *   Establish a key rotation policy to limit the impact of a compromised key.

6.  **Monitor and Audit:**
    *   Monitor Podman logs for any signature verification failures.
    *   Regularly audit the trust policy and signing keys to ensure they are still valid and secure.

7. **Use skopeo for verification**
    *   Use skopeo to verify the image before pushing it to registry.
        ```bash
        skopeo standalone-verify manifest.json <image> <signature-file> /path/to/public.key
        ```

### 4.6 Integration with Development Workflow

Integrate signature verification into the CI/CD pipeline:

1.  **Build Stage:**  Sign the image after it's built.
2.  **Push Stage:**  Push the signed image to the private registry.
3.  **Deployment Stage:**  Configure Podman (via `policy.json` or `--signature-policy`) to verify the signature before pulling the image.  Ensure that the deployment process fails if signature verification fails.

By following these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of image tampering and supply chain attacks, ensuring that only trusted and verified container images are used in the application. This enhances the overall security posture of the application and protects against a wide range of potential threats.
