## Attack Tree Path: [OR [Exploit Podman Daemon/API] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/or__exploit_podman_daemonapi___high-risk_path_.md)

This path represents attacks targeting the Podman daemon or its API. Successful exploitation grants significant control over the container environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND [Gain Unauthorized Access to Podman Daemon/API] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/and__gain_unauthorized_access_to_podman_daemonapi___critical_node_.md)

This critical node signifies the attacker successfully bypassing authentication or exploiting authorization flaws to gain access to the Podman API. This access is a gateway to further malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND [Execute Malicious Commands via Podman Daemon/API] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/and__execute_malicious_commands_via_podman_daemonapi___critical_node_.md)

Once API access is gained, this critical node represents the attacker's ability to execute arbitrary commands on the host system or within containers managed by Podman.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit Command Injection Vulnerability in Application's Podman Usage] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_command_injection_vulnerability_in_application's_podman_usage___high-risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path involves the application improperly constructing Podman commands based on user input, allowing an attacker to inject their own commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR [Exploit Container Configuration] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/or__exploit_container_configuration___high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from insecure container configurations, which are often easier to exploit than software vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND [Run Privileged Container] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/and__run_privileged_container___critical_node_.md)

Running containers with elevated privileges (e.g., `--privileged` flag or excessive capabilities) expands the attack surface and allows for more impactful exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit Capabilities within Privileged Container] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_capabilities_within_privileged_container___high-risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path involves exploiting specific Linux capabilities granted to the privileged container to perform actions that compromise the host or other containers.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Escape Privileged Container to Host] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/_escape_privileged_container_to_host___critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents the attacker successfully breaking out of the container's isolation and gaining direct access to the host operating system.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND [Mount Sensitive Host Paths into Container] [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/and__mount_sensitive_host_paths_into_container___critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Mounting directories from the host system into containers can create significant security risks if not done carefully.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Access Sensitive Host Files from within Container] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/_access_sensitive_host_files_from_within_container___high-risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path involves an attacker within the container accessing confidential data or configuration files located on the host.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Modify Sensitive Host Files from within Container] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/_modify_sensitive_host_files_from_within_container___critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents the attacker's ability to alter critical files on the host system, potentially leading to system compromise or data corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND [Expose Sensitive Ports on Container] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/and__expose_sensitive_ports_on_container___high-risk_path_.md)

Exposing container ports directly to the network can bypass application-level security measures and expose internal services to attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Directly Access Container Service via Exposed Port] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/_directly_access_container_service_via_exposed_port___high-risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path involves an attacker directly accessing a vulnerable service running within the container through an unnecessarily exposed port.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR [Exploit Container Image Vulnerabilities] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/or__exploit_container_image_vulnerabilities___high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities present within the container images themselves, either in the base image or added layers.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND [Use Vulnerable Base Image] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/and__use_vulnerable_base_image___critical_node_.md)

Using outdated or vulnerable base images introduces known security flaws into the container environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Base Image Libraries/Packages] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_base_image_librariespackages___high-risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path involves attackers exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in software packages included in the base image.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND [Introduce Malicious Layers During Image Build] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/and__introduce_malicious_layers_during_image_build___critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents a compromise in the image building process, where malicious code or backdoors are intentionally or unintentionally added to the image.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Include Backdoors or Malware in Image] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/_include_backdoors_or_malware_in_image___critical_node_.md)

This critical node signifies the successful inclusion of malicious software within the container image, providing a persistent foothold for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND [Pull Malicious or Compromised Images] [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/and__pull_malicious_or_compromised_images___critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Using container images from untrusted sources or without proper vulnerability scanning can introduce compromised software into the environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Pull Image from Untrusted Registry] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/_pull_image_from_untrusted_registry___high-risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path involves pulling container images from registries that are not verified or known to be secure, increasing the risk of using malicious images.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Pull Image with Known Vulnerabilities] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/_pull_image_with_known_vulnerabilities___high-risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path involves using images that have known security vulnerabilities, even if pulled from a trusted source, if proper scanning and patching are not in place.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR [Exploit Host System Interaction]](./attack_tree_paths/or__exploit_host_system_interaction_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [AND [Container Escape via Kernel Vulnerability] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/and__container_escape_via_kernel_vulnerability___critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents a highly impactful attack where a vulnerability in the host operating system's kernel is exploited to break out of container isolation and gain full control of the host.
