# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Podman project aims to provide a secure, efficient, and daemonless container management solution for Linux systems. It addresses the need for containerization in environments where traditional daemon-based container engines might be considered less secure or less suitable due to architectural constraints. The primary business priorities and goals are focused on:

- Security: Enhancing container security through a daemonless architecture, rootless container execution, and integration with Linux security features like namespaces, seccomp, and SELinux/AppArmor.
- Daemonless Architecture: Eliminating the need for a central daemon, reducing the attack surface and improving system stability.
- OCI Compliance: Adhering to Open Container Initiative standards to ensure compatibility and interoperability within the container ecosystem.
- Docker Compatibility: Providing a command-line interface and functionalities that are largely compatible with Docker, easing the transition for users familiar with Docker.
- Developer and System Administrator Friendliness: Offering a user-friendly tool for building, running, and managing containers, catering to both developers and system administrators.

The most important business risks associated with the Podman project include:

- Security Vulnerabilities: Potential vulnerabilities in the Podman codebase, container runtime, or dependencies that could be exploited to compromise containerized applications or the host system.
- Misconfiguration Risks: Improper configuration of Podman or container settings by users, leading to security weaknesses and potential breaches.
- Compatibility Issues: Incompatibilities with certain Docker features, container images, or workflows, which could hinder adoption and user experience.
- Supply Chain Risks: Vulnerabilities introduced through dependencies or build processes if not properly secured.
- Performance Bottlenecks: Performance issues arising from the daemonless architecture or specific features, impacting application performance and scalability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

## Existing Security Controls

- security control: Namespace isolation is used to isolate containers from each other and the host system, limiting the impact of container breaches. Implemented by the Linux kernel and utilized by Podman.
- security control: seccomp profiles are used to restrict the system calls available to containers, reducing the attack surface. Implemented by the container runtime (runc/crun) and configured by Podman.
- security control: SELinux/AppArmor integration provides mandatory access control, further isolating containers and limiting their capabilities. Implemented by the Linux kernel and integrated with Podman.
- security control: Rootless mode allows containers to be run without root privileges, significantly reducing the risk of host system compromise in case of container escape. Implemented by Podman and the container runtime.
- security control: Image signing and verification mechanisms (like Sigstore, cosign) can be used to ensure the integrity and authenticity of container images. Potentially integrated or can be integrated with Podman workflows.
- security control: Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning of the Podman codebase and dependencies are likely performed by the open-source community and maintainers (though specific details need verification). Described in project's security policies and practices (if publicly available).
- security control: Secure software development lifecycle practices are generally followed in open-source projects, including code reviews and testing. Implemented by the Podman development team and community.
- security control: Deployment model typically involves installing Podman binaries from trusted repositories or building from source, relying on OS-level package management security. Described in Podman installation documentation.

## Accepted Risks

- accepted risk: Kernel vulnerabilities affecting containers are a general risk for all container technologies, including Podman. Mitigation relies on timely kernel patching and security updates.
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies used by Podman can introduce security risks. Mitigation involves dependency management and regular updates.
- accepted risk: User misconfiguration of Podman or containers can lead to security weaknesses. Mitigation relies on clear documentation, secure defaults, and user education.
- accepted risk: Supply chain attacks targeting container images or build pipelines are a general risk in the container ecosystem. Mitigation involves image signing and verification, and secure build processes.

## Recommended Security Controls

- security control: Implement automated vulnerability scanning of container images used with Podman, both during development and runtime, to identify and mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implement runtime security monitoring and anomaly detection for containers managed by Podman to detect and respond to suspicious activities.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits specifically targeting Podman and its integration with the underlying system to identify and address potential weaknesses.
- security control: Enhance supply chain security by implementing measures to verify the integrity and authenticity of dependencies and build artifacts used in Podman development and distribution.
- security control: Provide and promote security hardening guidelines and best practices for Podman users to minimize misconfiguration risks.

## Security Requirements

- Authentication: If remote management capabilities are exposed (e.g., via an API), strong authentication mechanisms are required to verify the identity of clients accessing Podman.
- Authorization: Robust authorization controls are necessary to ensure that only authorized users or processes can perform specific actions on containers and Podman itself. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) should be considered.
- Input Validation: All inputs to Podman, including CLI commands, API requests, and configuration files, must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography: Cryptographic mechanisms should be used to protect sensitive data, such as container image signatures, secrets management within containers, and secure communication channels if remote management is enabled. Secure storage of cryptographic keys is also essential.

## DEPLOYMENT

Podman itself is typically deployed as a set of binaries on a Linux host. There isn't a complex deployment architecture for Podman itself, as it is designed to be daemonless and run directly on the host. However, we can consider the deployment of applications *using* Podman.

A common deployment scenario is to use Podman on individual Linux servers or virtual machines to run containerized applications.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes: For Podman itself, the critical process is providing a secure and reliable container management platform. For users of Podman, the critical business processes are the applications they run inside containers managed by Podman. Protecting the integrity and availability of these applications is paramount.
- Data Sensitivity: The data being protected includes:
  - Container Images: These can contain sensitive application code and configurations. Integrity and confidentiality of images are important. Sensitivity depends on the content of the images.
  - Container Data Volumes: These volumes can store application data, which can be highly sensitive (e.g., user data, financial information, secrets). Sensitivity depends on the applications using Podman.
  - Podman Configuration: Configuration files and settings can contain sensitive information and impact security. Confidentiality and integrity are important.
  - Build Artifacts and Source Code: Source code and build artifacts represent the intellectual property and functionality of Podman. Integrity and confidentiality are important to prevent tampering and unauthorized access.
