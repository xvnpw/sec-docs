# Threat Model Analysis for containers/podman

## Threat: [OCI Runtime (runc/crun) Vulnerability (Container Escape)](./threats/oci_runtime__runccrun__vulnerability__container_escape_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the OCI runtime (like `runc` or `crun`) that Podman uses to execute containers.
    *   This could involve exploiting bugs in the runtime's container creation, execution, or isolation logic.
    *   Successful exploitation allows the attacker to escape container isolation and gain access to the host system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical Host Compromise:** Full control of the host system.
    *   **Data Breach:** Potential access to sensitive data on the host.
    *   **System Downtime:** Possibility to disrupt host services.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Potential to move to other systems from the compromised host.
*   **Podman Component Affected:**
    *   OCI Runtime (runc/crun) - specifically the execution component that Podman utilizes.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Runtime Updates:** Keep the OCI runtime (`runc` or `crun`) updated to the latest versions with security fixes. Subscribe to security advisories for these components and apply updates promptly.
    *   **Secure Runtime Configuration:** Ensure the runtime is configured securely, following best practices and security guidelines. Regularly review runtime configurations.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the container runtime environment and related Podman configurations.
    *   **Rootless Podman (Reduced Impact):** While runtime vulnerabilities can still be exploited in rootless mode, the impact might be limited to the user's scope rather than full root compromise, potentially reducing the severity in some scenarios.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Container Capabilities/Namespaces (Privilege Escalation/Escape)](./threats/misconfigured_container_capabilitiesnamespaces__privilege_escalationescape_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Developers or operators incorrectly configure Podman to grant excessive Linux capabilities to containers (e.g., `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`) or improperly configure namespaces (e.g., sharing host PID namespace via Podman options).
    *   An attacker inside the container can leverage these misconfigurations, facilitated by Podman's configuration, to escalate privileges within the container or potentially escape to the host.
    *   For example, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` granted through Podman can be highly dangerous and often leads to escape possibilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Container:** Gaining root privileges inside the container, even if the container process started as a non-root user.
    *   **Potential Container Escape:** Depending on the misconfiguration and vulnerabilities, escape to the host system might be possible.
    *   **Host Resource Access:** Access to host resources or processes due to shared namespaces configured via Podman.
*   **Podman Component Affected:**
    *   `podman run` command and container configuration options (capabilities, namespaces) provided by Podman.
    *   Podman's interface for managing kernel namespaces and capabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Podman Configuration):**  When using `podman run` or defining container configurations, grant only the absolutely necessary capabilities. Strictly avoid using `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` unless critically required and with thorough security justification.
    *   **Namespace Isolation (Podman Configuration):**  Utilize Podman's namespace options to ensure containers use separate namespaces (PID, network, IPC, etc.) and avoid sharing host namespaces unless explicitly required and with full understanding of the risks.
    *   **Capability Dropping (Podman):**  Explicitly drop unnecessary capabilities using `--cap-drop=ALL` in `podman run` and then add back only the required ones using `--cap-add=...`. Use Podman's capability management features effectively.
    *   **Configuration Reviews (Podman Usage):** Regularly review `podman run` commands and container configurations to identify and rectify any over-privileged settings. Implement code review processes for Podman configurations.
    *   **Static Analysis Tools (Podman Configurations):** Use static analysis tools to scan container definitions and `podman run` commands for potential capability and namespace misconfigurations.

## Threat: [Host Volume Mount Vulnerability (Host File Access/Modification via Podman)](./threats/host_volume_mount_vulnerability__host_file_accessmodification_via_podman_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Developers or operators use Podman's volume mounting feature to mount host directories into containers without proper security considerations.
    *   A compromised container, due to insecure volume mounts configured via Podman, can then access, modify, or delete files and directories on the host system within the mounted volume.
    *   If sensitive host directories are mounted (e.g., `/`, `/etc`, `/var`) using Podman, this can lead to severe host compromise.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Host Data Breach/Modification:** Access to sensitive host data within mounted volumes configured by Podman. Potential modification or deletion of critical host files.
    *   **Host System Instability:** Modification of critical system files through Podman-mounted volumes can lead to host instability or failure.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Indirect via Podman):** Modifying setuid binaries or system configuration files on the host through Podman-mounted volumes could lead to indirect privilege escalation on the host.
*   **Podman Component Affected:**
    *   `podman run` volume mounting feature (`-v`, `--mount`). Podman's interface for volume management.
    *   Podman's interaction with host file system access control mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize Volume Mounts (Podman Usage):** Only mount necessary host directories into containers using Podman. Strictly avoid mounting the entire host filesystem (`/`) via Podman.
    *   **Read-Only Mounts (Podman):** Mount volumes as read-only whenever possible using the `:ro` option in `podman run -v`. Leverage Podman's volume mount options for security.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Volumes (Podman):** When using Podman to mount volumes, mount only specific subdirectories and files needed by the container, instead of entire directories.
    *   **Dedicated Volumes (Podman):** Prefer using named volumes or container-managed volumes instead of bind mounts when possible with Podman, as they offer better isolation.
    *   **Regular Volume Audits (Podman Configurations):** Periodically review volume mounts in Podman configurations and `podman run` commands to ensure they are necessary and securely configured.

## Threat: [Container Networking Misconfiguration Leading to External Exposure (via Podman)](./threats/container_networking_misconfiguration_leading_to_external_exposure__via_podman_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Operators incorrectly configure Podman's networking features, leading to unintended network exposure of containerized services.
    *   This could involve using Podman to expose container ports to public networks when they should be internal, or misconfiguring port mappings in `podman run` to allow external access to sensitive services.
    *   Attackers can exploit these misconfigurations in Podman networking to access container services they shouldn't be able to reach, potentially leading to data breaches or application compromise.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized External Access:** Exposure of containerized application services to unauthorized networks or the public internet due to Podman networking misconfiguration.
    *   **Data Breach:** Potential access to sensitive data through exposed services due to Podman networking errors.
    *   **Application Compromise:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in exposed services accessible due to Podman networking misconfiguration.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Network-based):** Compromised services, exposed via Podman networking, can be used as a pivot point for network-based attacks.
*   **Podman Component Affected:**
    *   Podman networking features (`--network`, `-p`, `--publish`). Podman's interface for managing container networks and port mappings.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Bridge Networks by Default (Podman):**  Use bridge networks for container isolation by default when using Podman. Avoid using host networking mode unless absolutely necessary and with strong security justification.
    *   **Port Mapping Review (Podman):** Carefully review port mappings (`-p`, `--publish`) in `podman run` and only expose necessary ports. Avoid exposing ports to `0.0.0.0` (public internet) if services should be internal. Use specific IP addresses for binding if needed.
    *   **Network Policies (Podman with CNI):** If using CNI plugins with Podman for advanced networking, implement network policies to control network traffic between containers and networks. Define strict network segmentation and access control rules using CNI features.
    *   **Network Segmentation (Podman):** Segment container networks based on security zones and application requirements when configuring Podman networking.
    *   **Network Audits (Podman Configurations):** Regularly audit container network configurations and firewall rules related to Podman to identify and rectify any misconfigurations that could lead to external exposure.
