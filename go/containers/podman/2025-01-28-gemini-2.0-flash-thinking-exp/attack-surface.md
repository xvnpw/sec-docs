# Attack Surface Analysis for containers/podman

## Attack Surface: [1. User Namespace Exploitation (Rootless Mode)](./attack_surfaces/1__user_namespace_exploitation__rootless_mode_.md)

*   **Description:** Kernel vulnerabilities within the user namespace implementation can be exploited to gain elevated privileges or escape container isolation in rootless Podman.
*   **Podman Contribution:** Rootless Podman relies heavily on user namespaces for security and isolation. Any weakness in this kernel feature directly impacts Podman's security model.
*   **Example:** A kernel bug allows a process within a user namespace to bypass namespace boundaries and access resources outside the namespace, potentially gaining root privileges on the host.
*   **Impact:** Container escape, privilege escalation to root on the host system, compromise of host system security.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Host Kernel Updated: Regularly update the host kernel to the latest stable version to patch known user namespace vulnerabilities.
    *   Enable Kernel Security Features: Utilize kernel security features like SELinux or AppArmor in enforcing mode to further restrict container capabilities.
    *   Monitor Kernel Security Advisories: Stay informed about kernel security advisories and promptly apply patches related to user namespaces.

## Attack Surface: [2. Command Injection via Podman CLI](./attack_surfaces/2__command_injection_via_podman_cli.md)

*   **Description:** Improper sanitization of user input passed to Podman CLI commands can lead to command injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host.
*   **Podman Contribution:** Podman CLI is a primary interface for interacting with Podman. If applications or scripts construct Podman commands using unsanitized user input, it creates an injection point.
*   **Example:** A web application takes user-provided image names and uses them in a `podman run` command without proper validation. An attacker injects malicious commands within the image name, which are then executed by Podman on the host.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the host system, potentially leading to data breach, system compromise, denial of service, or privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize User Input: Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user input before incorporating it into Podman CLI commands.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege: Run Podman commands with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running Podman as root whenever possible.
    *   Input Validation Libraries: Utilize input validation libraries to ensure robust input sanitization.

## Attack Surface: [3. Malicious Container Images from Untrusted Registries](./attack_surfaces/3__malicious_container_images_from_untrusted_registries.md)

*   **Description:** Pulling and running container images from untrusted or compromised registries can introduce malware, backdoors, or vulnerable software into your environment.
*   **Podman Contribution:** Podman facilitates pulling images from various registries. If users are not careful about the source of images, they can inadvertently introduce malicious content.
*   **Example:** A developer pulls a seemingly legitimate image from an unofficial registry that has been compromised. The image contains a backdoor that allows attackers to gain access to the container and potentially the host system.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of malware, backdoors, or vulnerable software, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Trusted Registries:  Pull images only from trusted and reputable registries.
    *   Image Signing and Verification: Utilize image signing and verification mechanisms to ensure image integrity and authenticity.
    *   Image Scanning: Implement automated image scanning tools to scan images for vulnerabilities before deployment.

## Attack Surface: [4. Container Escape Vulnerabilities in Runtime (runc/crun)](./attack_surfaces/4__container_escape_vulnerabilities_in_runtime__runccrun_.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs in the container runtime (like `runc` or `crun`) can potentially allow containers to escape their isolation and gain access to the host system.
*   **Podman Contribution:** Podman relies on container runtimes to execute containers. Vulnerabilities in these runtimes directly undermine Podman's security.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in `runc` allows a specially crafted container to overwrite host binaries or access host kernel resources, leading to container escape and potential root access on the host.
*   **Impact:** Container escape, privilege escalation to root on the host system, complete compromise of the host system.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Container Runtime Updated: Regularly update `runc` or `crun` to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor Runtime Security Advisories: Stay informed about security advisories for `runc` and `crun` and promptly apply patches.
    *   Kernel Security Features: Utilize kernel security features (SELinux, AppArmor) to limit the impact of potential runtime exploits.
