## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Podman Exploitation (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_podman_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the overall goal and entry point for all high-risk attack paths. Successful compromise at any of the sub-nodes leads to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Podman API Vulnerabilities (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_podman_api_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **API Authentication/Authorization Bypass (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Weak or Default Credentials (High-Risk Path):**
            *   **Action:** Attempt to use default credentials or brute-force weak passwords to gain unauthorized access to the Podman API.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High (Full API Access)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Low
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Unsecured API Endpoint:** (Although marked as Low Likelihood in full tree, unsecured endpoints are still a potential misconfiguration leading to bypass)
            *   **Action:** Access API endpoints without any authentication due to misconfiguration.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (Configuration errors, but less common in production)
            *   **Impact:** High (Full API Access)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Low
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
    *   **API Command Injection (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Unsanitized Input to API Commands (High-Risk Path):**
            *   **Action:** Inject malicious commands into API parameters (e.g., container name, image name) that are not properly sanitized by the Podman API.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High (Container compromise, potentially host compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Container Vulnerabilities via Podman (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_container_vulnerabilities_via_podman__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Container Image (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Pulling from Untrusted Registry (High-Risk Path):**
            *   **Action:** Pull and run container images from untrusted or compromised registries that may contain malware or vulnerabilities.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High (Full container compromise, potential host compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Medium

            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Compromised Base Image (High-Risk Path):**
            *   **Action:** Utilize base container images that contain known vulnerabilities, which can be exploited after deployment.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High (Container compromise, potential host compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Low

        *   **Misconfigured Container Security Context (High-Risk Path):**
            *   **Action:** Exploit overly permissive security configurations of containers, such as privileged mode or host namespace sharing, to escape the container and gain access to the host system.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High (Container escape, potentially host compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium

            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Host System Interaction via Podman (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_host_system_interaction_via_podman__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Shared Volumes/Bind Mounts Exploitation (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Insecure Permissions on Host Volumes (High-Risk Path):**
            *   **Action:** Exploit weak permissions on host directories that are mounted as volumes into containers, allowing unauthorized access or modification of sensitive host files from within the container.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High (Host file access, data breach, potential host compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Low
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

            *   **Action:** Exploit overly permissive container networking configurations, such as using host networking mode, to gain direct access to host services or other containers on the same network, bypassing container network isolation.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Access to host services, lateral movement to other containers)
            *   **Effort:** Low
