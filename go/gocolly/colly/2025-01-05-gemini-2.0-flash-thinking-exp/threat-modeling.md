# Threat Model Analysis for gocolly/colly

## Threat: [Malicious URL Injection/Manipulation](./threats/malicious_url_injectionmanipulation.md)

**Threat:** Malicious URL Injection/Manipulation

* **Description:** An attacker manipulates the URLs that Colly is instructed to visit. This involves injecting special characters, encoding exploits, or redirecting to malicious websites *through the `collector.Visit()` or `collector.Request()` functions of Colly*. The attacker provides these crafted URLs through input fields, configuration files, or other external data sources used by the application to determine scraping targets, which are then directly passed to Colly.

* **Impact:**
    * **Accessing Internal Resources:** Colly, *following the manipulated URL*, could be tricked into accessing internal network resources or APIs not intended for public access.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS) on Internal Systems:** Colly, *instructed by the manipulated URL*, could flood internal systems with requests.
    * **Information Disclosure from Unintended Targets:** Colly, *directed by the manipulated URL*, could scrape sensitive information from websites not intended to be accessed.

* **Affected Colly Component:**
    * `collector.Visit()` function
    * `collector.Request()` function
    * URL parsing logic *within Colly's request handling*.

* **Risk Severity:** High

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict Input Validation *before passing to Colly*:** Sanitize and validate all URL inputs before passing them to Colly's `Visit()` or `Request()` functions. Use allow-lists of permitted domains and paths.
    * **Avoid Direct User Input for Colly URLs:** Minimize or eliminate the use of raw user input to construct scraping URLs that are directly used by Colly.
    * **URL Parsing and Normalization *before Colly processing*:** Use a robust URL parsing library to normalize URLs and identify potentially malicious components *before* they are given to Colly.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion

* **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the scraping process *through Colly's configuration or by targeting specific websites* to consume excessive resources on the application's server. This could involve instructing Colly to target websites with extremely large pages, an infinite number of pages, or by triggering an excessive number of requests *via Colly's functions*.

* **Impact:**
    * **Memory Exhaustion:** Colly, *when instructed to scrape large pages or many pages simultaneously*, can lead to memory exhaustion on the application server.
    * **CPU Exhaustion:** Colly, *performing complex parsing on a large number of fetched pages*, can consume excessive CPU resources.
    * **Network Bandwidth Exhaustion:** Colly, *downloading a large volume of data from targeted websites*, can saturate the network bandwidth of the application's server.

* **Affected Colly Component:**
    * `collector.Visit()` and `collector.Request()` functions (for initiating requests *controlled by the application's logic and potentially influenced by attacker input*)
    * Response handling and parsing logic *within Colly*.
    * Internal queuing mechanisms *managed by Colly*.

* **Risk Severity:** High

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Rate Limiting (using Colly's features):** Utilize Colly's `LimitRule` to control the frequency of requests to specific domains.
    * **Request Timeouts (Colly configuration):** Set appropriate timeouts for requests *within Colly's configuration* to prevent indefinite waiting.
    * **Resource Limits (application-level, influencing Colly):** Configure limits on the number of concurrent requests *that the application allows Colly to make* and the size of downloaded content.
    * **Memory Management (application-level):** Be mindful of how scraped data is stored and processed *after Colly extracts it* to avoid memory leaks, but also consider Colly's internal memory usage.
    * **Circuit Breaker Pattern (application-level, interacting with Colly):** Implement a circuit breaker to stop scraping *by instructing Colly to stop* if a target website becomes unresponsive or starts returning errors.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious Response](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__via_malicious_response.md)

**Threat:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious Response

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the underlying parsing libraries used by Colly could potentially lead to RCE if a malicious website serves specially crafted content designed to exploit these weaknesses. *This threat directly involves how Colly processes the responses it receives*.

* **Impact:**
    * **Server Compromise:** An attacker could gain control of the server running the Colly application *by exploiting a vulnerability in how Colly parses a malicious response*.

* **Affected Colly Component:**
    * Underlying HTML parsing libraries used by Colly (e.g., `golang.org/x/net/html`) *as utilized by Colly's parsing functions*.

* **Risk Severity:** Critical

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Colly and all its dependencies, especially the HTML parsing libraries, to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * **Careful Custom Response Handling:** Exercise caution when implementing custom response handling logic *within Colly's callbacks* and ensure proper error handling. Avoid directly processing raw response bodies without proper sanitization if bypassing Colly's built-in parsing.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration of Colly](./threats/insecure_configuration_of_colly.md)

**Threat:** Insecure Configuration of Colly

* **Description:** Misconfiguring Colly *itself* can introduce security vulnerabilities. This might involve disabling security features provided by Colly or using insecure default settings within Colly's configuration.

* **Impact:**
    * **Bypassing Security Features:** Disabling TLS verification *in Colly's configuration* could expose communication to man-in-the-middle attacks.

* **Affected Colly Component:**
    * `colly.Collector` configuration options (e.g., `TLSClientConfig`)
    * Custom HTTP client configuration *used by Colly*.

* **Risk Severity:** High

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Review Colly Configuration Options:** Carefully review all Colly configuration options and understand their security implications.
    * **Enable TLS Verification:** Ensure TLS verification is enabled *in Colly's configuration* to enforce secure connections.
