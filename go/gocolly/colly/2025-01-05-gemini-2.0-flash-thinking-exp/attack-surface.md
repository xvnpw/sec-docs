# Attack Surface Analysis for gocolly/colly

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

**Description:** An attacker can induce the application to make requests to unintended locations, potentially internal resources or arbitrary external systems.

**How Colly Contributes:** The application uses `colly` to make HTTP requests to URLs that might be influenced by user input or external data sources.

**Example:** A user provides a URL to be scraped, and this URL points to an internal service like `http://localhost:8080/admin`. `colly` makes a request to this internal service.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize all input used to construct URLs for `colly`.
*   Implement a whitelist of allowed domains or URL patterns for scraping.
*   Consider using a proxy server and restricting its access.
*   Disable or restrict access to internal network ranges from the server running the `colly` application.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Authentication Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_authentication_credentials.md)

**Description:**  Authentication credentials used by `colly` to access protected websites are stored or handled insecurely.

**How Colly Contributes:** The application might configure `colly` with authentication details (e.g., basic auth credentials, API keys) to access restricted content.

**Example:**  Basic authentication credentials for a target website are hardcoded in the application's source code or stored in a plain text configuration file used by `colly`.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, potential data breaches, and compromise of the target website's security.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never hardcode credentials in the application's source code.
*   Store credentials securely using environment variables, secrets management systems, or dedicated credential stores.
*   Ensure proper access controls are in place for any storage mechanism used for credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Colly's Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_colly's_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist in the third-party libraries that `colly` depends on.

**How Colly Contributes:** `colly` relies on other Go packages for its functionality. If these dependencies have vulnerabilities, the application using `colly` is also potentially vulnerable.

**Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in the `net/http` package (a standard Go library used by `colly`). Applications using `colly` could be affected if they haven't updated their Go version.

**Impact:**  Various security issues depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency, potentially leading to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:**  Varies (can be High or Critical depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update `colly` and its dependencies to the latest versions.
*   Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies.
*   Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in `colly`'s dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Cookies](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_cookies.md)

**Description:** Cookies used by `colly` are not handled securely, potentially leading to session hijacking or other cookie-based attacks.

**How Colly Contributes:** `colly` manages cookies for making requests. If these cookies are not handled with appropriate security measures within the application using `colly`, they can be vulnerable.

**Example:** Session cookies obtained by `colly` are stored in a way that is accessible to other parts of the application or even external entities without proper encryption or protection.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users on the target website.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure cookies are stored securely (e.g., encrypted at rest).
*   Use secure attributes for cookies (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`) when configuring `colly`'s cookie handling.
*   Avoid logging or exposing sensitive cookie information.
