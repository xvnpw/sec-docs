## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit Colly's Fetching Mechanism -> Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Redirection]  **(Critical Node)**](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_colly's_fetching_mechanism_-_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_redirection____critical_2ae29234.md)

**Attack Vector:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Redirection
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the target website that Colly is instructed to scrape. This malicious website issues HTTP redirects to internal resources within the application's network or to external services controlled by the attacker.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   The attacker identifies a target website that the application uses Colly to scrape.
        *   The attacker compromises this target website or sets up a malicious website.
        *   The malicious website is configured to respond with an HTTP redirect to an internal resource (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/admin`) or an external service.
        *   Colly, following the redirect, makes a request to the attacker-specified destination.
    *   **Potential Impact:**
        *   Access to internal services not intended for public access, potentially leading to data breaches or further exploitation.
        *   Interaction with external services, potentially launching attacks from the application's IP address or exfiltrating data.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict allow-listing of domains Colly is permitted to scrape.
        *   Limit the number of redirects Colly follows or implement checks on the destination of redirects.
        *   Sanitize and validate URLs passed to Colly.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit Colly's Parsing and Data Handling -> Malicious HTML/XML Parsing]  **(Critical Node)**](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_colly's_parsing_and_data_handling_-_malicious_htmlxml_parsing____critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Malicious HTML/XML Parsing leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts or payloads within the HTML/XML content on a target website. When Colly scrapes this content and the application processes or renders it without proper sanitization, the malicious scripts are executed in the context of the application's users' browsers.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   The attacker identifies a target website that the application uses Colly to scrape.
        *   The attacker finds a way to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript into the content of the target website (e.g., through a comment section, vulnerable form, or by compromising the target website).
        *   Colly scrapes this malicious content.
        *   The application processes or renders this scraped data without proper sanitization.
        *   The malicious script executes in a user's browser when they interact with the application's interface displaying the scraped content.
    *   **Potential Impact:**
        *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
        *   Session hijacking, allowing the attacker to take over user accounts.
        *   Redirection to malicious websites.
        *   Theft of sensitive information.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize and validate scraped data before using it in the application's frontend or backend.
        *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS.
        *   Update Colly and its parsing libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit Colly's Configuration and Setup -> Insecure Configuration Injection]](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_colly's_configuration_and_setup_-_insecure_configuration_injection_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Insecure Configuration Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates Colly's configuration options (e.g., allowed domains, user-agent strings, request headers) to bypass security measures or perform malicious actions. This occurs when the application allows external influence on Colly's configuration.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   The attacker identifies a way to influence Colly's configuration within the application (e.g., through URL parameters, form inputs, or environment variables).
        *   The attacker injects malicious configuration values, such as adding a wildcard to allowed domains to enable SSRF or setting a specific User-Agent to bypass target website restrictions.
        *   Colly operates with the attacker-controlled configuration.
    *   **Potential Impact:**
        *   Bypassing security restrictions on target websites.
        *   Enabling Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by manipulating allowed domains.
        *   Impersonating different user agents to access restricted content.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly exposing Colly's configuration to user input.
        *   Thoroughly validate any user input that influences Colly's configuration.
        *   Implement strict access controls on configuration files and settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit Colly's Configuration and Setup -> Callback Function Vulnerabilities]  **(Critical Node)**](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_colly's_configuration_and_setup_-_callback_function_vulnerabilities____critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in User-Defined Callback Functions
    *   **Description:** User-defined callback functions in Colly are executed with the scraped data. If these functions contain vulnerabilities, an attacker can manipulate the scraped data to exploit these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   The attacker analyzes the application's code to understand the logic and functionality of the Colly callback functions.
        *   The attacker identifies vulnerabilities within these functions, such as SQL injection if the callback interacts with a database or command injection if it executes system commands.
        *   The attacker crafts malicious data on the target website that, when scraped and processed by the vulnerable callback function, triggers the vulnerability.
    *   **Potential Impact:**
        *   SQL injection, allowing the attacker to access or modify the application's database.
        *   Command injection, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the application server.
        *   Other application-specific vulnerabilities depending on the callback's functionality.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when writing callback functions, including input validation, output encoding, and parameterized queries.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to callback functions, granting them only the necessary permissions.
        *   Regularly review and audit the code of callback functions for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit Dependencies of Colly -> Vulnerabilities in Colly's Go dependencies]](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_dependencies_of_colly_-_vulnerabilities_in_colly's_go_dependencies_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Colly's Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Colly relies on various Go libraries. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities and are not updated, an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities through specific inputs or actions.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   The attacker identifies the specific versions of Colly's dependencies being used by the application.
        *   The attacker researches known vulnerabilities affecting those dependency versions (e.g., through CVE databases or security advisories).
        *   The attacker crafts specific inputs or triggers actions that exploit the identified vulnerability in one of Colly's dependencies.
    *   **Potential Impact:**
        *   Depending on the specific vulnerability, this could lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or even remote code execution.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a dependency management tool (like Go modules) to track and update dependencies.
        *   Regularly audit Colly's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
        *   Implement automated processes to update dependencies with security patches promptly.
