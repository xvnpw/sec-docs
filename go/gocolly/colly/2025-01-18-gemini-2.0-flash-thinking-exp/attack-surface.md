# Attack Surface Analysis for gocolly/colly

## Attack Surface: [Target URL Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/target_url_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can influence the URLs that `colly` is instructed to scrape.
    *   **How Colly Contributes:** `colly`'s core functionality involves making HTTP requests to specified URLs. If these URLs are derived from untrusted sources, it becomes an attack vector *directly through Colly's request mechanism*.
    *   **Example:** An application takes a website URL as input from a user and uses `colly` to scrape data from it. A malicious user provides a URL to an internal network resource (SSRF) or a website hosting malicious content, causing `colly` to make the request.
    *   **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), information disclosure from internal networks, redirection to malicious websites, potential execution of malicious code if the scraped content is processed unsafely.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all sources used to define target URLs *before passing them to Colly*.
        *   Use allow-lists of permitted domains or URL patterns instead of relying solely on blacklists *for Colly's target URLs*.
        *   Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct scraping URLs *that Colly will process*.
        *   Implement checks to ensure the target URL is within expected boundaries *before Colly initiates the request*.

## Attack Surface: [Cookie Jar Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/cookie_jar_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject or manipulate cookies used by `colly`.
    *   **How Colly Contributes:** `colly` manages cookies for maintaining sessions. If the cookie jar *used by Colly* can be influenced by external sources, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An application allows importing cookies from a user-provided file without proper validation, and these cookies are then used by `colly` in subsequent requests. A malicious user provides a file containing cookies for a different user on the target website, which `colly` then uses.
    *   **Impact:** Session fixation, impersonation on the target website, unauthorized access to user accounts on the target website.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid allowing external control over the cookie jar *used by Colly*.
        *   If importing cookies *for Colly* is necessary, strictly validate the format and content of the imported data.
        *   Ensure cookies *managed by Colly* are handled securely and are not exposed unnecessarily.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Scraped Data](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_scraped_data.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious scripts embedded in scraped data are executed in the context of the application's users.
    *   **How Colly Contributes:** `colly` retrieves HTML and other content from websites. If this content contains malicious scripts and is displayed or processed without sanitization *after being fetched by Colly*, it can lead to XSS.
    *   **Example:** `colly` scrapes a forum where a malicious user has posted a message containing a `<script>` tag. If the application displays this scraped message *obtained by Colly* without sanitizing it, the script will execute in the browser of users viewing the application.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, and other client-side attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly sanitize all scraped data *obtained by Colly* before displaying it in the application's frontend. Use appropriate escaping or sanitization libraries for the relevant context (e.g., HTML escaping).
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Redirects](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_redirects.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can leverage redirects on scraped websites to make `colly` issue requests to internal resources.
    *   **How Colly Contributes:** `colly` follows redirects by default. A malicious website can redirect `colly` to an internal IP address or service, causing `colly` to make the unintended request.
    *   **Example:** `colly` starts scraping a seemingly harmless external website. This website redirects `colly` to `http://localhost:6379` (the default port for Redis), potentially allowing an attacker to interact with the internal Redis instance if it's not properly secured *because Colly followed the redirect*.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal services and resources, potential data breaches, ability to perform actions on internal systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully control the domains and URLs that `colly` is allowed to access.
        *   Implement checks to validate the destination of redirects and prevent requests to internal or restricted networks *within Colly's request handling logic or by inspecting redirect responses*.
        *   Consider disabling automatic redirect following *in Colly* and implementing custom logic with stricter validation.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Colly Extensions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_colly_extensions.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws in custom or third-party `colly` extensions introduce new attack vectors.
    *   **How Colly Contributes:** `colly`'s extension mechanism allows adding custom functionality. Vulnerabilities in these extensions *directly integrated with Colly* can impact the security of the application.
    *   **Example:** A poorly written `colly` extension that handles response data might be vulnerable to code injection or other security issues, affecting how `colly` processes data.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the extension, potentially ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit any third-party `colly` extensions before using them.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom `colly` extensions.
        *   Keep extensions up-to-date with the latest security patches.
