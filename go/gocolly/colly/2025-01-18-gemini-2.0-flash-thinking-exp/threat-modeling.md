# Threat Model Analysis for gocolly/colly

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Maliciously Crafted URLs](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_maliciously_crafted_urls.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate input data or compromise a target website to influence the URLs that the `colly` application scrapes. This could cause `colly` to make requests to internal network resources (e.g., databases, internal APIs) or external services that the attacker controls. The attacker might exploit this to scan internal networks, access sensitive data not publicly available, or launch attacks against other systems.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal resources, data exfiltration from internal networks, potential for further exploitation of internal systems, denial of service against internal resources.

**Affected Colly Component:** `Collector` (Request Methods, URL handling), `Request` struct.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input used to construct URLs.
*   Implement a whitelist of allowed domains or IP ranges that `colly` is permitted to access.
*   Avoid directly using user input in URL construction. Use parameterized queries or predefined URL templates.
*   Monitor `colly`'s outgoing requests for suspicious destinations.
*   Run the `colly` application in a sandboxed environment with limited network access.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Request Headers](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_request_headers.md)

**Description:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information (e.g., API keys, authentication tokens, internal identifiers) in the custom request headers used by `colly`. If the target website logs these headers or if the communication is intercepted (though `colly` encourages HTTPS), this information could be exposed to unauthorized parties.

**Impact:** Compromise of API keys, unauthorized access to other services, potential for account takeover on the target website if authentication tokens are leaked.

**Affected Colly Component:** `Request` struct (Header manipulation).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid including sensitive information directly in request headers.
*   If authentication is required, use secure methods like OAuth 2.0 or session cookies managed by `colly` appropriately.
*   Regularly review the request headers being sent by the `colly` application.
*   Store and manage sensitive credentials securely, outside of the application's code.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Colly's HTML Parsing Library Leading to Exploitation](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_colly's_html_parsing_library_leading_to_exploitation.md)

**Description:** `colly` relies on an underlying HTML parsing library. If this library has vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, arbitrary code execution flaws), a malicious website could serve specially crafted HTML that exploits these vulnerabilities when `colly` parses it. This could lead to crashes, resource exhaustion, or even remote code execution within the application's process.

**Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, potential remote code execution on the server running the `colly` application.

**Affected Colly Component:** `HTMLElement` (parsing logic), underlying HTML parsing library (e.g., `goquery`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `colly` and its dependencies, including the HTML parsing library, up to date with the latest security patches.
*   Consider using alternative parsing methods if security vulnerabilities are discovered in the default library.
*   Implement robust error handling around HTML parsing operations to prevent crashes.
*   Run the `colly` application in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Threat: [Extraction and Processing of Malicious Content](./threats/extraction_and_processing_of_malicious_content.md)

**Description:** `colly` extracts data from web pages. If a target website contains malicious content (e.g., JavaScript, if JavaScript execution is enabled, or other executable content embedded in data), and the application processes this extracted data without proper sanitization or sandboxing, it could lead to security issues. For example, unsanitized JavaScript could be executed if the scraped data is later displayed in a web browser.

**Impact:** If JavaScript execution is enabled in `colly`, potential for arbitrary code execution within the scraping process. If the extracted data is used elsewhere, it could introduce vulnerabilities like stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in other parts of the application.

**Affected Colly Component:** `HTMLElement` (data extraction methods), callbacks for data processing (`OnHTML`, `OnResponse`).

**Risk Severity:** High (if JavaScript execution is enabled).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Disable JavaScript execution in `colly` if it's not strictly necessary for the scraping task.
*   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all scraped data before using it in other parts of the application.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) if the scraped data is displayed in a web browser.
*   Be cautious about processing and storing potentially executable content.

## Threat: [Mishandling of Cookies and Sessions Leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/mishandling_of_cookies_and_sessions_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

**Description:** `colly` can handle cookies and sessions. If the application doesn't properly manage these, it could lead to security vulnerabilities. For example, storing session cookies insecurely, reusing cookies across different scraping targets inappropriately, or failing to clear cookies when necessary could lead to unauthorized access or information leakage.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts on target websites, potential for impersonation.

**Affected Colly Component:** `Collector` (Cookie handling), `Request` and `Response` structs (Cookie management).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Handle cookies securely, using appropriate storage mechanisms and access controls.
*   Be mindful of the scope and lifetime of cookies.
*   Avoid sharing cookies between different scraping sessions or targets unless explicitly intended and secure.
*   Use HTTPS to protect cookies in transit.
*   Consider using `colly`'s cookie jar functionality carefully and understand its implications.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution via Malicious JavaScript (if enabled)](./threats/remote_code_execution_via_malicious_javascript__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:** If JavaScript execution is enabled in `colly` (e.g., using libraries like `chromedp`), a malicious website could serve JavaScript code that exploits vulnerabilities in the browser engine or the application's environment. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the `colly` application.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the server running the application, data breaches, denial of service, installation of malware.

**Affected Colly Component:** Integration with browser automation libraries (e.g., `chromedp`), JavaScript execution environment.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid enabling JavaScript execution in `colly` unless absolutely necessary.
*   If JavaScript execution is required, ensure the browser automation library is up to date with the latest security patches.
*   Run the `colly` application in a highly isolated and sandboxed environment with minimal privileges.
*   Monitor the application for suspicious activity and resource usage.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via JavaScript (if enabled)](./threats/information_disclosure_via_javascript__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:** Even without achieving full remote code execution, malicious JavaScript on a target website could be designed to extract sensitive information from the application's environment (e.g., environment variables, internal configurations) or the scraped data and send it to an attacker-controlled server.

**Impact:** Leakage of sensitive data, API keys, internal configurations, intellectual property.

**Affected Colly Component:** Integration with browser automation libraries (e.g., `chromedp`), JavaScript execution environment.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Minimize the information accessible to the `colly` application's environment when JavaScript execution is enabled.
*   Implement strict network egress filtering to prevent the application from making unauthorized outbound connections.
*   Monitor network traffic for suspicious data exfiltration attempts.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Colly or its Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_colly_or_its_dependencies.md)

**Description:** `colly` and its dependencies may contain known security vulnerabilities. Failure to keep these libraries updated can expose the application to these vulnerabilities, which attackers could exploit.

**Impact:** Various security breaches depending on the nature of the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.

**Affected Colly Component:** Entire library and its dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the severity of the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update `colly` and all its dependencies to the latest versions.
*   Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues in `colly` and its dependencies.
*   Implement a process for promptly patching vulnerabilities.
