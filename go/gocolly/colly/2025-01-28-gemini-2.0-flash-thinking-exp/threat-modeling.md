# Threat Model Analysis for gocolly/colly

## Threat: [Vulnerable Colly Library or Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_colly_library_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**  The `gocolly/colly` library or its dependencies contain known security vulnerabilities. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses a vulnerable version of Colly. Exploitation could lead to remote code execution on the server running the application, denial of service, or unauthorized access to application resources. Vulnerabilities can be present in Colly's core code or in third-party libraries it relies upon.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breach, denial of service, unauthorized access to server resources, potential for complete server takeover.
*   **Colly Component Affected:** Entire `colly` library and its dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Management:** Utilize Go modules or a similar dependency management system to precisely track and manage `colly` and its dependencies.
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Proactively update `colly` and all its dependencies to the latest versions. This ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched as soon as updates are available.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement regular vulnerability scanning of project dependencies, including `colly`, using tools like `govulncheck` or other suitable vulnerability scanners. Integrate this into the development and deployment pipeline.
    *   **Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the application and its dependencies, specifically focusing on `colly` and its integration, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack during Scraping](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_during_scraping.md)

*   **Description:** If HTTPS is not strictly enforced by the application using Colly, or if TLS certificate verification is improperly disabled within Colly's configuration, the communication between the application and target websites becomes vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks. An attacker intercepting network traffic can eavesdrop on scraped data being transmitted, potentially capturing sensitive information. Furthermore, attackers could manipulate requests sent by Colly or responses received from target websites, leading to injection of malicious content or alteration of the application's intended scraping behavior.
*   **Impact:** Data interception and theft, manipulation of scraped data, injection of malicious content into the application's data flow, potential for application compromise if manipulated responses are processed insecurely.
*   **Colly Component Affected:** `Collector.SetTransport` configuration, TLS related settings within `colly.Collector` configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce HTTPS:**  Ensure that Colly is explicitly configured to *always* use HTTPS for all scraping requests. Verify that the application's Colly setup does not inadvertently allow HTTP connections when HTTPS is expected.
    *   **Enable TLS Verification:**  Maintain the default behavior of Colly to enable and properly perform TLS certificate verification. Avoid disabling TLS verification unless absolutely necessary for specific, well-understood reasons (e.g., testing in controlled environments) and with extreme caution. If disabling is unavoidable, ensure it is strictly limited to specific scenarios and re-enabled in production.
    *   **Secure Network Environment:** Deploy the application in a secure network environment to minimize the overall risk of network-based attacks, including MitM attacks. This includes using secure network infrastructure and potentially network segmentation.
