## Attack Tree Path: [1. Root Goal: Compromise Application via Colly Exploitation (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1__root_goal_compromise_application_via_colly_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the attacker's ultimate objective. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing damage to the application that uses `gocolly/colly`.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Full compromise of the application, potential data breach, service disruption, reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Misconfiguration or Misuse of Colly in Application (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_misconfiguration_or_misuse_of_colly_in_application__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most significant high-risk area. It focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how developers use and configure `gocolly/colly` within their application, rather than flaws in Colly itself.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
    *   Data Poisoning via Scraped Content
    *   Callback Function Vulnerabilities
    *   Insecure Handling of Cookies/Sessions
    *   Insecure Proxy Configuration (less critical, but still relevant)
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Secure coding practices, input validation, output sanitization, secure configuration management, regular security assessments.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Unvalidated URL Handling (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/3__server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_unvalidated_url_handling__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Occurs when the application takes user-controlled input as a URL and uses it with Colly without proper validation. This allows attackers to make Colly send requests to unintended destinations, including internal network resources.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **2.1.1. Application Accepts User-Controlled Input as URL for Colly:**  Application design flaw where user input directly influences Colly's target URL.
    *   **2.1.2. Application Fails to Validate/Sanitize User-Provided URL:** Lack of or insufficient URL validation allows malicious URLs to be processed.
        *   **2.1.2.1. No URL Validation Implemented:** Complete absence of URL validation.
        *   **2.1.2.2. Insufficient URL Validation (e.g., Blacklisting instead of Whitelisting):**  Blacklists are easily bypassed; whitelisting is recommended.
    *   **2.1.3. Attacker Provides Malicious URL (Internal Network, Cloud Metadata, etc.):** Exploitation step where attacker crafts URLs targeting internal resources (e.g., `http://localhost`, `http://169.254.169.254`).
*   **Impact:** High - Access to internal network, potential data exfiltration, possible Remote Code Execution on internal systems if combined with other vulnerabilities.
*   **Mitigation:** Strict URL whitelisting, input sanitization, network segmentation, principle of least privilege for Colly process.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Data Poisoning via Scraped Content (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/4__data_poisoning_via_scraped_content__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Arises when the application processes and uses scraped data without sanitization. Attackers can inject malicious content into scraped websites, which is then scraped by Colly and incorporated into the application, leading to vulnerabilities like Stored XSS or logic bugs.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **2.2.1. Application Processes and Uses Scraped Data Without Sanitization:**  Failure to sanitize scraped data before storage or use.
    *   **2.2.2. Attacker Injects Malicious Content into Scraped Website:** Injecting malicious content into the target website to be scraped.
        *   **2.2.2.2. Find Vulnerable Input Points on Target Website (e.g., Comments, Forms):** Exploiting website input points to inject malicious content.
    *   **2.2.3. Malicious Content Impacts Application Functionality or Users:** Consequences of data poisoning.
        *   **2.2.3.1. Stored XSS in Application Database via Scraped Data:**  Malicious scripts injected into the database via scraped data, executed when data is displayed.
        *   **2.2.3.2. Logic Bugs in Application due to Unexpected Scraped Data:**  Unexpected or malicious data breaking application logic.
        *   **2.2.3.3. Data Integrity Issues, Leading to Incorrect Application Behavior:**  Data corruption and incorrect application state due to malicious data.
*   **Impact:** Medium-High - Stored XSS, application malfunction, data corruption, data integrity issues.
*   **Mitigation:**  Strict output sanitization of scraped data, Content Security Policy (CSP), input validation on scraped data structure, regular security scanning.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Callback Function Vulnerabilities (Application-Specific) (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/5__callback_function_vulnerabilities__application-specific___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within custom callback functions defined by the application to process scraped data (e.g., `OnHTML`, `OnResponse`). Poorly written callbacks can introduce code injection, logic errors, or resource exhaustion.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **2.3.1. Application Defines Custom Callback Functions (e.g., OnHTML, OnResponse):**  Application uses custom callbacks, which are potential vulnerability points.
    *   **2.3.2. Callback Functions Contain Vulnerabilities:**  Callbacks are not securely implemented.
        *   **2.3.2.2. Logic Errors in Callbacks Leading to Unexpected Behavior:**  Flaws in callback logic causing application errors.
        *   **2.3.2.3. Resource Exhaustion in Callbacks (e.g., infinite loops, excessive processing):**  Callbacks consuming excessive resources, leading to DoS.
*   **Impact:** Variable - Ranging from application malfunction to Denial of Service, potentially Remote Code Execution if code injection vulnerabilities are present (though less emphasized in this high-risk path focus, code injection in callbacks is still a potential high impact vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation:** Secure coding practices in callbacks, input validation within callbacks, code review, resource limits for callback execution, thorough testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Insecure Handling of Cookies/Sessions by Application (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/6__insecure_handling_of_cookiessessions_by_application__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities related to how the application handles cookies and sessions, especially if relying on Colly's cookie management for authentication or authorization. Insecure storage or exposure of cookies can lead to session hijacking or unauthorized access.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **2.4.1. Application Relies on Colly's Cookie Handling for Authentication/Authorization:** Application uses cookies for security-sensitive functions in conjunction with Colly.
    *   **2.4.2. Application Mishandles or Stores Cookies Insecurely:**  Cookies are not protected properly.
        *   **2.4.2.1. Cookies Stored in Plain Text Logs or Databases:**  Storing sensitive cookies in easily accessible, unencrypted locations.
        *   **2.4.2.2. Cookies Exposed via Application Vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, Path Traversal):**  Application vulnerabilities allowing attackers to steal cookies.
        *   **2.4.2.3. Session Fixation or Session Hijacking via Colly's Cookie Management:**  Session management flaws allowing attackers to hijack or fix sessions.
*   **Impact:** High - Authentication bypass, session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts and application functionalities.
*   **Mitigation:** Secure cookie storage (encryption), HTTPS only cookies, HttpOnly cookies, robust session management practices, vulnerability scanning for XSS and path traversal.
