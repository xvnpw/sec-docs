# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for gocolly/colly

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization of Scraped Data (Post-Colly Processing)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_of_scraped_data__post-colly_processing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: After `colly` successfully scrapes data from target websites using its various `OnHTML`, `OnXML`, `OnResponse` handlers, treat all received data as potentially malicious.
    *   Step 2: Before using the scraped data in your application (displaying, storing in databases, processing), implement sanitization and validation routines *outside* of `colly`'s scraping logic, but immediately after data extraction.
    *   Step 3:  Use context-aware sanitization. For example, if displaying scraped text in HTML, use HTML escaping functions. If using data in SQL queries, use parameterized queries.
    *   Step 4: Validate data types and formats. Ensure scraped values conform to expected types (e.g., numbers, dates) and formats before further processing.
    *   Step 5:  This step is crucial because `colly` itself focuses on fetching and parsing, not on sanitizing the *content* of what it fetches. Sanitization is a necessary post-processing step for any data obtained via web scraping.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Severity: High
    *   SQL Injection - Severity: High
    *   Command Injection - Severity: Medium (if scraped data is used in system commands)
    *   Data Integrity Issues - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   XSS: High reduction - Prevents injection of malicious scripts through scraped content obtained by `colly`.
    *   SQL Injection: High reduction - Eliminates the risk of database manipulation via scraped data fetched by `colly`.
    *   Command Injection: Medium reduction - Reduces the risk if scraped data from `colly` is used in system commands.
    *   Data Integrity Issues: Medium reduction - Improves reliability of data scraped by `colly`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** To be determined. Check data processing modules *after* `colly` scraping is completed.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Potentially missing in data processing functions that handle data *after* it's scraped by `colly`, especially before displaying or storing the data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Request Delays (Using Colly's Features)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_request_delays__using_colly's_features_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Utilize `colly.Limit(&colly.LimitRule{DomainGlob: "*", Parallelism: N})` to control the number of concurrent requests `colly` makes to a domain. Set `N` to a reasonable value to avoid overwhelming target servers.
    *   Step 2: Implement `colly.Delay` and `colly.RandomDelay` options within `colly.LimitRule` to introduce delays between requests.  `colly.Delay` sets a fixed delay, while `colly.RandomDelay` introduces a random delay within a specified range.
    *   Step 3: Handle `429 Too Many Requests` errors within `colly`'s `OnError` callback. Check for `http.StatusTooManyRequests` and respect `Retry-After` headers if provided in the response.  Pause `colly` scraping for the specified duration or implement exponential backoff.
    *   Step 4: Configure these rate limiting rules directly within your `colly` collector setup before starting the scraping process.
    *   Step 5: Monitor `colly`'s scraping behavior and adjust rate limits and delays as needed based on target website responsiveness and your scraping requirements.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) against target websites - Severity: High (for target website) / Low (for your application security directly)
    *   IP Blocking/Banning - Severity: Medium
    *   Detection as Malicious Bot - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   DoS against target websites: High reduction - `colly`'s rate limiting prevents overwhelming target servers.
    *   IP Blocking/Banning: High reduction - `colly`'s rate limiting and delays significantly reduce the chance of IP bans.
    *   Detection as Malicious Bot: Medium reduction - `colly`'s features help mimic more human-like request patterns.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Check `colly` initialization code. Look for `colly.Limit` configuration and `OnError` handling for `429` status codes.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Rate limiting might be absent or not properly configured in `colly` setup. Error handling for `429` and `Retry-After` within `colly`'s `OnError` might be missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Respect `robots.txt` and Allowed Domains (Using Colly's Features)](./mitigation_strategies/respect__robots_txt__and_allowed_domains__using_colly's_features_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Set `c.RespectRobotsTxt = true` when initializing your `colly` collector. This instructs `colly` to automatically fetch and obey `robots.txt` directives for each domain.
    *   Step 2: Use `c.AllowedDomains = []string{"example.com", "another-domain.net"}` to restrict `colly` to only scrape within the specified domains. This prevents accidental scraping of external, unintended websites.
    *   Step 3: If needed, use `c.DisallowedPaths = []string{"/admin/*", "/temp/*"}` to explicitly exclude specific URL paths or patterns from being scraped by `colly`, even if allowed by `robots.txt` or within allowed domains.
    *   Step 4: Configure these settings directly when setting up your `colly` collector before starting the scraping process.
    *   Step 5: Regularly review and update `AllowedDomains` and `DisallowedPaths` in your `colly` configuration as your scraping scope changes.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Legal and Ethical Issues - Severity: High
    *   Over-Scraping and Resource Waste - Severity: Low
    *   Accidental Scraping of Sensitive Areas - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   Legal and Ethical Issues: High reduction - `colly`'s `RespectRobotsTxt` ensures compliance with website policies.
    *   Over-Scraping and Resource Waste: Medium reduction - `colly`'s domain and path restrictions improve scraping efficiency.
    *   Accidental Scraping of Sensitive Areas: Medium reduction - `colly`'s `DisallowedPaths` prevents scraping of explicitly excluded areas.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Check `colly` collector initialization. Verify if `RespectRobotsTxt` and `AllowedDomains` are set. Check for `DisallowedPaths` configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:** `RespectRobotsTxt` and `AllowedDomains` might be missing in `colly` setup. `DisallowedPaths` might need to be added for specific exclusion needs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Descriptive User-Agent (Configured in Colly)](./mitigation_strategies/descriptive_user-agent__configured_in_colly_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Set a descriptive User-Agent string using `c.UserAgent = "YourAppName/Version (Contact Email or Website)"` when initializing your `colly` collector.
    *   Step 2: Ensure the User-Agent clearly identifies your application, its purpose (e.g., "research crawler", "price aggregator"), and provides contact information (email or website) for website administrators.
    *   Step 3: Configure this User-Agent directly within your `colly` collector setup before starting the scraping process.
    *   Step 4: Avoid using generic or misleading User-Agent strings. A well-formed User-Agent helps website administrators understand traffic originating from your `colly` scraper.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   IP Blocking/Banning - Severity: Medium
    *   Detection as Malicious Bot - Severity: Medium
    *   Lack of Transparency - Severity: Low
*   **Impact:**
    *   IP Blocking/Banning: Medium reduction - A descriptive User-Agent can reduce the likelihood of being blocked based on User-Agent alone.
    *   Detection as Malicious Bot: Medium reduction - Makes your `colly` scraper appear more legitimate to website security measures.
    *   Lack of Transparency: High reduction - Improves communication and transparency with website administrators regarding your `colly` scraping activity.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Check `colly` collector initialization. Verify if `UserAgent` is set and if it is descriptive.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Descriptive User-Agent might be missing or set to a generic value in `colly` setup. Ensure it's configured to clearly identify your application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Proxy Usage (Configured in Colly)](./mitigation_strategies/proxy_usage__configured_in_colly_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: If proxy usage is necessary for your scraping scenario (e.g., to rotate IPs or bypass geographic restrictions), configure `colly.ProxyFunc` when initializing your `colly` collector.
    *   Step 2: `colly.ProxyFunc` accepts a function that returns a proxy URL string for each request. You can use this to implement static proxies or more complex proxy rotation logic.
    *   Step 3: Ensure you are using reputable and ethical proxy providers if implementing proxy rotation. Avoid free or untrusted proxy services.
    *   Step 4: Configure `ProxyFunc` directly within your `colly` collector setup before starting the scraping process.
    *   Step 5: Be mindful of the ethical and legal implications of using proxies and ensure compliance with target website terms of service and proxy provider policies.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   IP Blocking/Banning - Severity: High
    *   Rate Limiting (IP-based) - Severity: Medium
    *   Geographic Restrictions - Severity: Low
*   **Impact:**
    *   IP Blocking/Banning: High reduction - `colly`'s `ProxyFunc` allows bypassing IP-based blocking.
    *   Rate Limiting (IP-based): Medium reduction - `colly`'s `ProxyFunc` can help circumvent IP-based rate limits (use ethically).
    *   Geographic Restrictions: Low reduction - `colly`'s `ProxyFunc` can enable access to geographically restricted content.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Check `colly` collector initialization. Verify if `ProxyFunc` is configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Proxy usage might be missing entirely in `colly` setup. If needed, implement `ProxyFunc` configuration. **Important:** Use proxies responsibly and ethically.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Error Handling (Using Colly's Callbacks)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_error_handling__using_colly's_callbacks_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Implement `colly.OnError` callback in your `colly` collector setup. This callback is triggered when `colly` encounters HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx) or network errors during requests.
    *   Step 2: Within `colly.OnError`, log detailed error information, including the URL, error type, and HTTP status code. This helps in debugging and monitoring scraping issues.
    *   Step 3: Implement retry logic within `colly.OnError` for transient errors. Use `c.Retry()` within the callback to retry the failed request. Consider implementing exponential backoff for retries to avoid overwhelming servers after errors.
    *   Step 4: Implement `colly.OnResponse` callback to log successful responses and potentially analyze response status codes and headers for monitoring and debugging purposes.
    *   Step 5: Configure these error handling callbacks directly when setting up your `colly` collector.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Loss/Incompleteness - Severity: Medium
    *   Application Instability - Severity: Low
    *   Delayed Issue Detection - Severity: Medium
    *   Security Incident Investigation - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Loss/Incompleteness: Medium reduction - `colly`'s `OnError` and retry logic improve data completeness.
    *   Application Instability: Low reduction - `colly`'s error handling prevents crashes due to scraping errors.
    *   Delayed Issue Detection: High reduction - `colly`s error logging in `OnError` enables early detection of problems.
    *   Security Incident Investigation: High reduction - `colly`'s error logs are valuable for investigating scraping-related issues.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Check `colly` collector initialization. Verify if `OnError` and `OnResponse` callbacks are implemented and if logging/retry logic is present within them.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Error handling callbacks in `colly` might be basic or missing. Implement comprehensive `OnError` and `OnResponse` with detailed logging and retry mechanisms.
