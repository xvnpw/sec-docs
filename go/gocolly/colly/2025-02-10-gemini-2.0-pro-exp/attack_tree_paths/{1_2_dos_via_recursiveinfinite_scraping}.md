# Deep Analysis: DoS via Recursive/Infinite Scraping (Colly)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "DoS via Recursive/Infinite Scraping" attack vector against a Colly-based application.  We aim to:

*   Identify specific vulnerabilities within Colly's configuration and usage that could lead to this attack.
*   Assess the practical feasibility and impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities.
*   Provide concrete, actionable recommendations for developers to mitigate the risk.
*   Develop testing strategies to verify the effectiveness of mitigations.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack path described as "DoS via Recursive/Infinite Scraping" within the context of a web application utilizing the Colly library for web scraping.  It considers:

*   **Colly-Specific Features:**  How Colly's features (e.g., `Async`, `MaxDepth`, `AllowedDomains`, `DisallowedDomains`, request handling) can be misused or misconfigured to facilitate the attack.
*   **Application Logic:** How the application's use of Colly (e.g., how it processes scraped data, handles links, and manages scraping tasks) can contribute to the vulnerability.
*   **Target Website Characteristics:**  How the structure and behavior of target websites (e.g., intentionally malicious sites, poorly designed sites with infinite loops) can exacerbate the attack.
* **Testing:** How to test application for this vulnerability.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General DoS attacks unrelated to Colly (e.g., network-level flooding).
*   Vulnerabilities in the target website itself, except as they relate to triggering infinite scraping.
*   Other attack vectors against the Colly-based application (e.g., data exfiltration, code injection).

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Examine Colly's documentation, source code, and common usage patterns to identify potential weaknesses that could lead to infinite or excessive scraping.
2.  **Exploit Scenario Development:**  Construct realistic scenarios where an attacker could exploit these weaknesses.  This includes considering different types of target websites and attacker inputs.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the potential consequences of a successful attack, including resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), application downtime, and potential financial losses.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  Analyze the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations (from the original attack tree) and identify any gaps or limitations.  Propose additional or refined mitigations.
5.  **Testing Strategy Development:**  Outline a comprehensive testing strategy to validate the effectiveness of the mitigations. This includes both unit tests and integration/system tests.
6.  **Documentation:**  Clearly document all findings, recommendations, and testing procedures.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2 DoS via Recursive/Infinite Scraping

### 2.1 Vulnerability Identification

Several factors can contribute to this vulnerability when using Colly:

*   **Missing or Insufficient `MaxDepth`:**  Colly's `MaxDepth` setting controls how many levels deep the scraper will follow links.  If this is not set or set too high, the scraper can get trapped in deeply nested or infinitely recursive websites.  A missing `MaxDepth` is equivalent to infinite depth.
*   **Lack of Domain Restrictions:**  Without `AllowedDomains` or `DisallowedDomains`, Colly will follow links to *any* domain.  An attacker could craft a page that links to another domain, which links back to the original, creating a loop.  Even without malicious intent, a poorly designed website could inadvertently create such a loop.
*   **Ignoring `robots.txt`:** While Colly can respect `robots.txt`, it's not automatic. If the application doesn't explicitly configure Colly to use a `robots.txt` parser, it might ignore disallow directives that would otherwise prevent excessive scraping.
*   **Unbounded Queue/Async Behavior:**  Colly's asynchronous capabilities (`Async = true`) can exacerbate the problem.  If the scraper is adding links to the queue faster than it can process them, and there's no limit on the queue size or the number of concurrent requests, resource exhaustion can occur rapidly.
*   **Improper Link Handling:**  The application's logic for extracting and processing links is crucial.  If the application doesn't properly normalize URLs, handle relative links correctly, or detect duplicate URLs, it can contribute to infinite loops.  For example, `/page1` and `./page1` might be treated as different URLs, leading to repeated scraping.
*   **Lack of Request Timeouts:**  If Colly doesn't have appropriate timeouts set (both for individual requests and for the overall scraping operation), it can get stuck waiting for responses from slow or unresponsive servers, consuming resources.
*   **No Crawl Budget:**  Even with `MaxDepth` and domain restrictions, a large website could still consume significant resources.  A "crawl budget" (limiting the total number of requests) provides an additional layer of protection.
*   **Ignoring HTTP Status Codes:**  The application should intelligently handle HTTP status codes.  Repeatedly following redirects (3xx codes) without limits can lead to infinite loops.  Ignoring error codes (4xx, 5xx) can also lead to unnecessary resource consumption.

### 2.2 Exploit Scenario Development

Here are a few example exploit scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1:  Infinite Redirect Loop:**
    *   Attacker creates two web pages: `attacker.com/page1` and `attacker.com/page2`.
    *   `page1` contains a 301 redirect to `page2`.
    *   `page2` contains a 301 redirect to `page1`.
    *   The attacker submits `attacker.com/page1` as the starting URL to the Colly-based application.
    *   If the application doesn't limit redirect follows or detect the loop, Colly will bounce between the two pages indefinitely.

*   **Scenario 2:  Dynamically Generated Infinite Depth:**
    *   Attacker finds a website with a URL structure like `example.com/page/1`, `example.com/page/2`, `example.com/page/3`, etc., where each page links to the next.
    *   The website dynamically generates these pages, so there's no practical limit to the number of pages.
    *   If `MaxDepth` is not set or is too high, Colly will continue scraping these pages until resources are exhausted.

*   **Scenario 3:  Cross-Domain Loop:**
    *   Attacker controls two domains: `attacker1.com` and `attacker2.com`.
    *   `attacker1.com/page1` links to `attacker2.com/page1`.
    *   `attacker2.com/page1` links to `attacker1.com/page1`.
    *   Without domain restrictions, Colly can get trapped in this loop.

*   **Scenario 4:  Relative Link Misinterpretation:**
    *   A legitimate website has a page at `example.com/products/`.
    *   This page contains a relative link: `<a href="./">Products</a>`.
    *   If the application doesn't correctly resolve this relative link, it might treat `example.com/products/` and `example.com/products/./` as different URLs, leading to repeated scraping.

### 2.3 Impact Assessment

A successful DoS attack via recursive/infinite scraping can have severe consequences:

*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The most immediate impact is the exhaustion of server resources:
    *   **CPU:**  High CPU usage due to continuous scraping and link processing.
    *   **Memory:**  Memory consumption grows as Colly stores visited URLs, request queues, and scraped data.  This can lead to out-of-memory errors and application crashes.
    *   **Network Bandwidth:**  Excessive requests consume network bandwidth, potentially impacting other applications and users on the same server or network.
    *   **File Descriptors:**  Each open connection consumes a file descriptor.  Exhausting file descriptors can prevent the application from making any further network connections.

*   **Application Downtime:**  Resource exhaustion will likely lead to application downtime, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

*   **Financial Losses:**  Downtime can result in lost revenue, damage to reputation, and potential service-level agreement (SLA) penalties.

*   **Denial of Service to Target Website:**  The excessive scraping can also act as a DoS attack against the target website, potentially impacting its availability. This could lead to legal issues.

### 2.4 Mitigation Analysis

Let's analyze the proposed mitigations and add some refinements:

*   **Strictly limit recursion depth using `MaxDepth`:**  This is **essential** and should always be set to a reasonable value based on the expected structure of the target websites.  A value of 3-5 is often a good starting point, but it should be adjusted based on specific needs.  **Crucially, a default value should be set, even if the user can configure it.**

*   **Implement a crawl budget (limit total requests):**  This is a **highly recommended** mitigation.  It provides a hard limit on the total number of requests Colly will make, regardless of depth or domain.  This can be implemented using a counter that is incremented for each request and checked before making a new request.

*   **Blacklist/Whitelist domains:**  Using `AllowedDomains` (whitelist) is generally **preferred** over `DisallowedDomains` (blacklist).  A whitelist approach is more secure because it explicitly defines the allowed domains, preventing accidental scraping of unintended sites.  A blacklist can be useful in specific cases, but it's easier to miss malicious domains.

*   **Set timeouts for requests and the overall operation:**  This is **critical**.  Colly provides options for setting timeouts:
    *   `colly.WithTransport(&http.Transport{DialContext: (&net.Dialer{Timeout: 30 * time.Second}).DialContext})` - Sets timeout for establishing connection.
    *   `colly.WithTransport(&http.Transport{ResponseHeaderTimeout: 30 * time.Second})` - Sets timeout for receiving response headers.
    *   `ctx.Context().Done()` - Can be used to implement overall operation timeout.

*   **Additional Mitigations:**

    *   **Respect `robots.txt`:**  Use a `robots.txt` parser (e.g., `github.com/temoto/robotstxt`) and configure Colly to respect its directives.  This is a standard practice for web scraping and helps avoid unintentional DoS.
    *   **Limit Concurrent Requests:**  Use `Limit(&colly.LimitRule{DomainGlob: "*", Parallelism: 2})` to control the number of concurrent requests.  This prevents overwhelming the target server and your own application.
    *   **Implement a Request Delay:**  Use `Limit(&colly.LimitRule{DomainGlob: "*", Delay: 2 * time.Second})` to introduce a delay between requests.  This is polite scraping and reduces the risk of triggering rate limits or DoS protections on the target server.
    *   **Handle Redirects Carefully:**  Limit the number of redirects Colly will follow using `MaxRedirects`.  Inspect the redirect URLs to detect potential loops.
    *   **Normalize URLs:**  Before adding a URL to the queue, normalize it to a canonical form.  This prevents scraping the same page multiple times due to variations in the URL (e.g., with/without trailing slash, different capitalization).  Use `net/url` package for this.
    *   **Detect Duplicate URLs:**  Maintain a set of visited URLs (using a `map[string]bool` or a more sophisticated data structure like a Bloom filter for large-scale scraping) and check if a URL has already been visited before adding it to the queue.
    *   **Monitor Resource Usage:**  Implement monitoring to track CPU, memory, network usage, and the number of open connections.  This allows you to detect potential DoS attacks early and take corrective action.
    *   **Implement Circuit Breaker:** If scraping of particular domain is causing issues, stop scraping it for some time.
    *   **User Agent:** Set a meaningful User-Agent header to identify your scraper. This allows website administrators to contact you if there are issues.

### 2.5 Testing Strategy

A robust testing strategy is crucial to ensure the effectiveness of the mitigations:

*   **Unit Tests:**

    *   **`MaxDepth` Test:**  Create a test website with a known depth and verify that Colly respects the `MaxDepth` setting.
    *   **Domain Restriction Tests:**  Test `AllowedDomains` and `DisallowedDomains` with various URL patterns to ensure they function correctly.
    *   **Timeout Tests:**  Create mock servers that simulate slow responses and timeouts to verify that Colly's timeout settings work as expected.
    *   **Redirect Handling Tests:**  Create mock servers that simulate various redirect scenarios (e.g., 301, 302, infinite loops) and verify that Colly handles them correctly.
    *   **URL Normalization Tests:**  Test the URL normalization logic with various URL variations to ensure it produces the expected canonical forms.
    *   **Duplicate URL Detection Tests:**  Test the duplicate URL detection mechanism with a set of URLs, including duplicates and variations.
    *   **Robots.txt Tests:** Test parsing and respecting of `robots.txt` file.
    *   **Request Limit Tests:** Test that request limit is not exceeded.
    *   **Concurrency Limit Tests:** Test that concurrency limit is not exceeded.

*   **Integration/System Tests:**

    *   **DoS Simulation:**  Create a test environment that simulates a DoS attack using the exploit scenarios described earlier.  This could involve creating a small, self-contained website with intentionally malicious structures (e.g., infinite redirect loops, dynamically generated pages).
    *   **Resource Monitoring:**  During the DoS simulation, monitor the resource usage of the Colly-based application to ensure it remains within acceptable limits.
    *   **Long-Running Tests:**  Run long-running scraping tests against a variety of target websites (both well-behaved and potentially problematic) to identify any long-term resource leaks or unexpected behavior.

* **Test Implementation Details:**

    * Use `net/http/httptest` package to create mock servers for unit testing.
    * Use a testing framework like `testing` in Go.
    * Use a separate test environment to avoid impacting production systems.
    * Automate the tests as part of the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
