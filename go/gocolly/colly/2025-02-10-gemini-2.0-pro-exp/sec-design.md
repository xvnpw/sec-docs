Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a fast and efficient web scraping and crawling framework for Go.
*   Offer an easy-to-use API for developers to extract structured data from websites.
*   Maintain a robust and reliable library that can handle various website structures and complexities.
*   Foster a strong community around the project, encouraging contributions and providing support.
*   Ensure the library remains performant and scalable to handle large-scale scraping tasks.

Business Risks:

*   Legal and ethical concerns related to web scraping, including potential violations of website terms of service and data privacy regulations.
*   Reputational damage if the library is used for malicious purposes, such as spamming or data theft.
*   Technical challenges in maintaining compatibility with evolving website technologies and anti-scraping measures.
*   Dependency on external websites, which may change their structure or become unavailable, impacting the functionality of the library.
*   Competition from other web scraping libraries and tools, requiring continuous improvement and innovation.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Input validation: The library provides mechanisms for handling and sanitizing user inputs, such as URLs and selectors, to prevent injection vulnerabilities. (Described in documentation and implemented in code).
*   security control: Rate limiting: The library offers features for controlling the frequency of requests to avoid overwhelming target websites and triggering anti-scraping measures. (Described in documentation and implemented in code).
*   security control: Random user agent: The library allows setting random user agents to mimic different browsers and reduce the likelihood of being detected as a scraper. (Described in documentation and implemented in code).
*   security control: Proxy support: The library supports the use of proxy servers to mask the origin of requests and bypass IP-based restrictions. (Described in documentation and implemented in code).
*   security control: Cookie management: The library provides mechanisms for handling cookies, which can be necessary for interacting with websites that require authentication or session management. (Described in documentation and implemented in code).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The library, by its nature, interacts with external websites, which are inherently untrusted environments. While the library provides some security controls, it cannot guarantee complete protection against all potential threats.
*   accepted risk: Users of the library are responsible for ensuring their scraping activities comply with legal and ethical guidelines, as well as the terms of service of the target websites.
*   accepted risk: Websites may implement anti-scraping measures that could block or limit the library's functionality.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement robust error handling and logging to detect and respond to unexpected website behavior or anti-scraping measures.
*   security control: Provide options for configuring request headers, such as referer and accept-language, to further mimic legitimate browser behavior.
*   security control: Consider incorporating CAPTCHA solving mechanisms or providing guidance on integrating with third-party CAPTCHA solving services.
*   security control: Offer features for respecting robots.txt rules to ensure ethical scraping practices.
*   security control: Regularly update the library to address security vulnerabilities and adapt to evolving website technologies.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The library should support various authentication methods, including cookie-based authentication, HTTP basic authentication, and API key authentication, as required by target websites.
*   Authorization:
    *   The library itself does not handle authorization in the traditional sense, as it primarily focuses on data extraction. However, it should provide mechanisms for managing authenticated sessions and handling access control restrictions imposed by target websites.
*   Input Validation:
    *   The library must validate and sanitize all user-provided inputs, such as URLs, selectors, and regular expressions, to prevent injection vulnerabilities and ensure the integrity of the scraping process.
*   Cryptography:
    *   The library should use secure communication protocols (HTTPS) when interacting with websites to protect sensitive data in transit.
    *   If the library handles sensitive data, such as credentials or API keys, it should provide options for securely storing and managing this information.

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code changes to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
2.  The commit triggers a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI).
3.  The pipeline runs a build step using the `go build` command to compile the Go code and create an executable binary.
4.  The pipeline runs a test step using the `go test` command to execute unit tests and ensure code quality.
5.  The pipeline runs a lint step using tools like `golint` and `gofmt` to check for code style and formatting issues.
6.  Optionally, the pipeline runs a SAST (Static Application Security Testing) step using tools like GoSec to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
7.  If all steps pass successfully, the pipeline proceeds to the package step.
8.  The package step uses Docker build to create a Docker image containing the Go binary and its dependencies.
9.  The Docker image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Amazon ECR).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Code review: Code changes are reviewed by other developers before being merged into the main branch.
*   security control: Automated testing: Unit tests and integration tests are executed automatically to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   security control: Linting: Code style and formatting checks are enforced to maintain consistency and readability.
*   security control: SAST (Static Application Security Testing): Static analysis tools are used to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: Dependency management: Dependencies are managed using a package manager (e.g., Go modules) and are regularly checked for security updates.
*   security control: Secure build environment: The CI/CD pipeline runs in a secure environment with limited access and appropriate security configurations.
*   security control: Image scanning: Docker images are scanned for vulnerabilities before being deployed.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Data extraction: The core business process is extracting data from websites. The accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of this process are critical.
*   Application functionality: The Go application that utilizes Colly must function correctly and provide the intended features to its users.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Publicly available data: The primary data being accessed is publicly available information on websites. The sensitivity of this data depends on the specific content being scraped.
*   Potentially sensitive data: If the scraping targets websites that require authentication or contain user-specific information, the scraped data could be considered sensitive. Examples include:
    *   Usernames and passwords (if scraping login forms, which is generally discouraged).
    *   Personal information (if scraping profiles or user-generated content).
    *   Financial data (if scraping e-commerce sites or financial portals).
    *   Proprietary data (if scraping internal websites or APIs).

The sensitivity of the data being scraped should be carefully considered, and appropriate security measures should be implemented to protect it.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific legal or ethical guidelines that the scraping activities must adhere to?
*   Are there any specific websites or types of websites that are prohibited from being scraped?
*   What is the expected scale of the scraping operations (number of requests per day, number of websites)?
*   Are there any existing security tools or infrastructure in place that should be integrated with the Colly application?
*   What are the specific requirements for data storage and handling after it is scraped?
*   What level of logging and monitoring is required for the scraping activities?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to extract data from websites efficiently and reliably, while adhering to ethical and legal guidelines.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The existing security controls in the Colly library provide a baseline level of protection, but additional measures may be needed depending on the specific use case and data sensitivity.
*   DESIGN: The provided design diagrams represent a typical deployment scenario, but the actual deployment may vary based on specific requirements and infrastructure. The build process assumes the use of a CI/CD pipeline, but manual builds are also possible.
