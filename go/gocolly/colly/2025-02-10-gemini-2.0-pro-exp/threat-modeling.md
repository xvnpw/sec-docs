# Threat Model Analysis for gocolly/colly

## Threat: [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (DoS/DDoS)](./threats/uncontrolled_resource_consumption__dosddos_.md)

*   **1. Threat: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (DoS/DDoS)**

    *   **Description:** An attacker, or a poorly configured legitimate user, configures `colly` to send excessive requests, ignoring `robots.txt`, disabling rate limiting, or setting a high `Parallelism`. This overwhelms the target, causing a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** High. Target website unavailability, legal repercussions, IP blocking, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected `colly` Component:**
        *   `colly.Collector`: Core component managing requests and concurrency.
        *   `LimitRule`: Misconfiguration or absence of `Delay`, `RandomDelay`, and `Parallelism`.
        *   `colly.Async`: Uncontrolled use of goroutines.
        *   `colly.RobotsTxt`: Disabling or ignoring `RobotsTxt` support.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Rate Limiting:** Enforce strict `LimitRule` configurations.
        *   **`robots.txt` Compliance:** Always enable and respect `robots.txt` using `c.SetRobotsTxtHandler`.
        *   **`Async` Control:** Carefully limit concurrent goroutines when using `Async`.
        *   **Circuit Breaker:** Stop scraping on consistent error codes (e.g., 5xx).
        *   **Exponential Backoff:** Retry with exponential backoff for temporary errors.

## Threat: [Anti-Scraping Bypass (Intentional)](./threats/anti-scraping_bypass__intentional_.md)

*   **2. Threat: Anti-Scraping Bypass (Intentional)**

    *   **Description:** An attacker intentionally circumvents website anti-scraping measures. They might rapidly rotate user agents, use many proxies, attempt to solve CAPTCHAs automatically, or avoid honeypots.
    *   **Impact:** High. Legal action, IP blocking, account suspension, data loss.
    *   **Affected `colly` Component:**
        *   `colly.Collector`: Core component.
        *   `colly.UserAgent`: Setting/rotating user agents.
        *   `colly.ProxyFunc`: Configuring proxy usage.
        *   `colly.Request`: Manipulating request headers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Ethical Scraping Policy:**  *Do not* bypass anti-scraping unless explicitly permitted.
        *   **Responsible User-Agent Rotation:** Use a realistic, limited set of user agents if rotation is necessary and permitted.
        *   **Ethical Proxy Use:** Use proxies responsibly and with permission, if permitted.
        *   **CAPTCHA Avoidance:** Do *not* attempt automatic CAPTCHA solving unless permitted.
        *   **Honeypot Awareness:** Design the scraper to avoid honeypots.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access](./threats/unauthorized_data_access.md)

*   **3. Threat: Unauthorized Data Access**

    *   **Description:** The scraper accesses protected pages/data without proper authentication, or with compromised credentials. This could be due to hardcoded credentials, insecure storage, or a failure to implement authentication.
    *   **Impact:** High. Data breach, legal consequences, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected `colly` Component:**
        *   `colly.Collector`: Core component.
        *   `colly.Request`: Setting headers (including authentication).
        *   `colly.Post`: Sending data for login forms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Credential Management:** *Never* hardcode credentials. Use secure storage (environment variables, secrets management).
        *   **Proper Authentication:** Implement robust authentication *before* using `colly`.
        *   **Least Privilege:** The scraper should only access necessary data.
        *   **Session Management:** Handle cookies and sessions securely.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **4. Threat: Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation**

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in `colly` or its dependencies (e.g., `net/http`, `goquery`), potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Potentially High. Could lead to complete system compromise, data breaches.
    *   **Affected `colly` Component:** Any component, depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `colly` and dependencies updated.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use dependency vulnerability scanning tools.
        *   **Security Audits:** Periodically review code and dependencies.
