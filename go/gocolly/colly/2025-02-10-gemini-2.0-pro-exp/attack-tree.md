## Attack Tree Path: [{1. Abuse Colly's Scraping Capabilities}](./attack_tree_paths/{1__abuse_colly's_scraping_capabilities}.md)

*   **Description:** This branch encompasses attacks that leverage Colly's primary function – web scraping – in malicious ways.  The ease of using Colly for its intended purpose also makes it easier to misuse.
*   **Mitigation (General for this branch):**
    *   Implement strict rate limiting and request throttling.
    *   Monitor request patterns and set alerts for suspicious activity.
    *   Use CAPTCHAs or other challenge-response mechanisms when necessary.
    *   Sanitize and validate all scraped data.
    *   Limit recursion depth and implement a crawl budget.
    *   Use domain whitelists/blacklists.
    *   Set reasonable timeouts.

## Attack Tree Path: [{1.1 Data Leak via Excessive Requests}](./attack_tree_paths/{1_1_data_leak_via_excessive_requests}.md)

*   **Description:** The application, acting as a proxy via Colly, is used to aggressively scrape a target website.  This can expose sensitive information *from the target* that the application then inadvertently reveals.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation (Specific):**
    *   Aggressively enforce rate limits using `LimitRule`.
    *   Monitor for unusually high request volumes to specific domains.

## Attack Tree Path: [{1.2 DoS via Recursive/Infinite Scraping}](./attack_tree_paths/{1_2_dos_via_recursiveinfinite_scraping}.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker crafts input that causes Colly to enter an infinite scraping loop or recursively scrape a very large website, exhausting resources and causing a denial of service.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium
*   **Mitigation (Specific):**
    *   Strictly limit recursion depth using `MaxDepth`.
    *   Implement a crawl budget (limit total requests).
    *   Blacklist/Whitelist domains.
    *   Set timeouts for requests and the overall operation.

## Attack Tree Path: [{1.3 Content Spoofing via Manipulating Scraped Content}](./attack_tree_paths/{1_3_content_spoofing_via_manipulating_scraped_content}.md)

*   **Description:**  The application displays scraped content without proper sanitization.  An attacker targets a website designed to inject malicious content (e.g., JavaScript) into the scraped data, leading to XSS or other attacks *within the application*.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
*   **Mitigation (Specific):**
    *   Thoroughly sanitize scraped content using a robust HTML sanitizer (e.g., `bluemonday`).
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP).
    *   Validate data types rigorously.

## Attack Tree Path: [<<2. Exploit Colly Configuration Weaknesses>>](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_colly_configuration_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** This represents vulnerabilities arising from improper configuration of the Colly library itself.  Configuration errors can create significant security holes.
*   **Mitigation (General for this branch):**
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege in configuration.
    *   Regularly audit Colly's configuration.
    *   Keep Colly and its dependencies updated.

## Attack Tree Path: [<<2.1 Unrestricted Domain/URL Access>>](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_unrestricted_domainurl_access.md)

*   **Description:** Colly is configured to allow access to *any* domain or URL.  This allows an attacker to use the application as an open proxy to access internal resources, sensitive APIs, or other websites that should not be publicly accessible. This is the *most critical* vulnerability.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (but misconfigurations happen)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Mitigation (Specific):**
    *   **Strictly limit allowed domains using `AllowedDomains`.**  This is the primary defense.
    *   Use a URL whitelist if possible.
    *   Implement network segmentation to limit the application's access to internal resources.
