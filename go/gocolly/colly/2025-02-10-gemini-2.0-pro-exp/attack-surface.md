# Attack Surface Analysis for gocolly/colly

## Attack Surface: [Unintentional Denial of Service (DoS) Against Target Website (via Colly's Request Mechanism)](./attack_surfaces/unintentional_denial_of_service__dos__against_target_website__via_colly's_request_mechanism_.md)

Colly, due to its configuration, sends an excessive number of requests to a target website, overwhelming its server and causing a denial-of-service. This is a direct consequence of Colly's core functionality.
    *   **How Colly Contributes:** Colly's ability to make automated, high-frequency requests, especially with `Async = true` and without proper rate limiting (`LimitRule`), is the *direct* cause of this risk.  Colly *is* the attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A Colly scraper configured with `Async = true` and no `LimitRule`, rapidly fetching thousands of pages from a small website.
    *   **Impact:** Target website unavailability; potential legal action; reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting (`colly.LimitRule`):**  *Mandatory*. Implement strict rate limiting using `colly.LimitRule`.  This is the primary defense.  Choose appropriate delays based on the target website's capacity.
        *   **Asynchronous Requests with Control (`colly.Async`):**  Use `colly.Async` *only* in conjunction with `colly.LimitRule`.  Never use `Async` without rate limiting.
        *   **Respect `robots.txt` (via Colly):** Use `colly.DisallowedDomains` or a custom `robots.txt` parser integrated with Colly to avoid crawling disallowed areas.
        *   **Dynamic Rate Adjustment (based on Colly's responses):** Monitor HTTP response codes received by Colly (e.g., 429, 503) and dynamically adjust the scraping rate (e.g., using a callback on `OnError`).
        *   **Exponential Backoff (within Colly's request handling):** Implement an exponential backoff strategy within Colly's request handling, increasing the delay after failed or rate-limited requests.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Content Parsing (Exploiting Colly's Parsers)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_content_parsing__exploiting_colly's_parsers_.md)

A malicious website crafts its HTML, CSS, or JavaScript to exploit vulnerabilities *within Colly's parsing logic or its underlying dependencies*. This is a direct attack on Colly's parsing capabilities.
    *   **How Colly Contributes:** Colly's core function is to parse web content.  This parsing process, performed by Colly and its dependencies, is the direct target of this attack.
    *   **Example:** A website includes a specially crafted HTML tag designed to trigger a buffer overflow in Colly's HTML parser (or the underlying Go `html` package).
    *   **Impact:** Application crash; denial-of-service; *potential* remote code execution (RCE) within your application (if a vulnerability in Colly or its dependencies is exploited).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Limits (`colly.MaxBodySize`):** Set a reasonable `colly.MaxBodySize` to limit the amount of data Colly processes, mitigating some buffer overflow risks.
        *   **Timeouts (`colly.SetRequestTimeout`):** Use `colly.SetRequestTimeout` to prevent Colly from hanging on malicious responses.
        *   **Dependency Management (for Colly):** Keep Colly and its dependencies (especially Go itself) up-to-date.  This is crucial for patching vulnerabilities in the parsing libraries.
        *   **Fuzz Testing (of Colly):**  Directly fuzz test Colly's parsing functions (and the underlying libraries it uses) with malformed inputs to identify vulnerabilities.
        * **Disable Javascript Execution:** If Javascript execution is not required, do not enable it.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (via Colly's URL Handling)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf___via_colly's_url_handling_.md)

If the URLs that Colly accesses are influenced by user input, an attacker can use Colly to make requests to internal systems or other unintended targets. Colly becomes the *tool* for the SSRF.
    *   **How Colly Contributes:** Colly's fundamental purpose is to make requests to the URLs it's given.  If those URLs are attacker-controlled, Colly directly facilitates the SSRF attack.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to input a URL for Colly to scrape.  An attacker provides an internal IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.1/admin`) or a cloud metadata endpoint.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of internal systems; potential for lateral movement; access to sensitive cloud resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation (before passing to Colly):**  *Never* allow users to directly control the full URL passed to Colly.
        *   **Whitelisting (for Colly's targets):**  Use a predefined, whitelisted set of allowed domains/paths for Colly.  User input should *only* be used to select from this whitelist, *never* to construct the URL directly.
        *   **Network Segmentation (for Colly's runtime):** Run the Colly application in a network environment with severely limited access to internal resources.  Use firewalls to restrict outbound connections from the Colly process.
        *   **DNS Resolution Control (for Colly):**  Consider using a custom DNS resolver (that Colly uses) which only resolves to the whitelisted domains.
