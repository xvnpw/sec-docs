# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for gofiber/fiber

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation Middleware (Fiber-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_middleware__fiber-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Leverage Fiber Middleware:** Implement input validation as a Fiber middleware function. This allows you to intercept requests *before* they reach route handlers.
2.  **Access Request Context (`c *fiber.Ctx`):** Within the middleware, use the Fiber context (`c *fiber.Ctx`) to access request data:
    *   `c.Params()`: For route parameters.
    *   `c.Query()`: For query parameters.
    *   `c.FormValue()`/`c.BodyParser()`: For request body data.
    *   `c.GetReqHeaders()`: For request headers.
3.  **Validate Data:** Use a Go validation library (like `go-playground/validator/v10`) or custom validation logic to check the extracted data against expected types, formats, and constraints.
4.  **Return Error Responses via Fiber Context:** If validation fails, use `c.Status()` and `c.JSON()` (or `c.SendString()`, etc.) to return appropriate HTTP error responses (e.g., 400 Bad Request) directly from the middleware, preventing further processing by route handlers.
5.  **Apply Middleware using Fiber's `app.Use()` or Route-Specific Middleware:** Apply the validation middleware globally using `app.Use()` for application-wide validation, or use route-specific middleware for targeted validation on particular routes or groups of routes.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** By validating input *before* database queries, you reduce the risk of injecting malicious SQL through Fiber's request handling.
*   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Validating input used in system commands accessed via Fiber routes prevents command injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium to High Severity):** Input validation in Fiber middleware can catch unexpected or malicious input patterns before they are processed and potentially rendered in views.
*   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Fiber middleware validation ensures data received by your application through Fiber routes is in the expected format, maintaining data integrity.

**Impact:**
*   **SQL Injection:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Command Injection:** High Risk Reduction
*   **XSS:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Data Integrity Issues:** High Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Implemented in API endpoints handling user registration and profile updates as Fiber middleware applied to specific routes.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Not fully implemented as Fiber middleware for all API endpoints, especially less critical ones.
*   Validation middleware might not be consistently applied to all input sources accessible via Fiber context methods (`c.Params()`, `c.Query()`, `c.BodyParser()`, `c.GetReqHeaders()`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting Middleware (Fiber-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_middleware__fiber-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Utilize Fiber's `fiber/middleware/limiter`:** Integrate the `fiber/middleware/limiter` provided by the Fiber framework.
2.  **Configure Rate Limits within Fiber Middleware:** Configure rate limiting parameters directly within the middleware setup, using options like:
    *   `Max`: Maximum requests per time window.
    *   `Duration`: Time window for rate limiting.
    *   `KeyGenerator`: Function to identify clients (using `c *fiber.Ctx` to access IP, headers, etc.).
    *   `ErrorHandler`: Customize the error response using Fiber's context (`c *fiber.Ctx`).
3.  **Apply Rate Limiting Middleware using `app.Use()` or Route-Specific Middleware:** Apply the `fiber/middleware/limiter` globally using `app.Use()` to protect the entire Fiber application, or selectively to specific routes using route-specific middleware.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):** Fiber's rate limiting middleware restricts request frequency to Fiber routes, hindering brute-force attempts targeting Fiber endpoints.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity):** By limiting request rates handled by Fiber, the middleware prevents attackers from overwhelming the Fiber application and its underlying resources.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Fiber's rate limiting helps protect server resources consumed by Fiber applications by controlling the rate of requests processed by Fiber routes.

**Impact:**
*   **Brute-Force Attacks:** High Risk Reduction
*   **DoS Attacks:** Medium to High Risk Reduction
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** High Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Rate limiting is implemented globally for all API routes using `fiber/middleware/limiter` in the main Fiber application setup.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   More granular rate limiting using Fiber middleware is not implemented for specific sensitive Fiber routes.
*   Rate limiting key generation in Fiber middleware is solely based on IP address; no user-based or session-based rate limiting within Fiber middleware.

## Mitigation Strategy: [CORS Middleware Configuration (Fiber-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/cors_middleware_configuration__fiber-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Employ Fiber's `fiber/middleware/cors`:** Utilize the `fiber/middleware/cors` provided by the Fiber framework for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing control.
2.  **Configure CORS Options within Fiber Middleware:** Configure CORS policies directly within the middleware setup, using options like:
    *   `AllowOrigins`: Whitelist allowed origins for cross-origin requests to Fiber routes.
    *   `AllowMethods`: Define allowed HTTP methods for cross-origin requests to Fiber routes.
    *   `AllowHeaders`: Specify allowed headers for cross-origin requests to Fiber routes.
    *   `AllowCredentials`: Control credential sharing for cross-origin requests to Fiber routes.
3.  **Apply CORS Middleware using `app.Use()` or Route-Specific Middleware:** Apply `fiber/middleware/cors` globally using `app.Use()` for application-wide CORS policy enforcement in Fiber, or selectively to specific routes using route-specific middleware for different CORS policies on different Fiber endpoints.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity - Indirect):** Fiber's CORS middleware can limit the impact of certain XSS attacks by controlling cross-origin access to Fiber application resources.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium Severity - Indirect):** Fiber's CORS middleware provides some defense against CSRF originating from unexpected origins accessing Fiber routes.
*   **Unauthorized Data Access (Medium Severity):** Fiber's CORS middleware prevents unauthorized websites from accessing resources exposed through Fiber routes via cross-origin requests.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS (Indirect):** Low to Medium Risk Reduction
*   **CSRF (Indirect):** Low Risk Reduction
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Medium Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:**
*   CORS middleware is implemented globally for all API routes using `fiber/middleware/cors` in the Fiber application.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   CORS configuration in Fiber middleware might not be regularly reviewed and updated as Fiber application requirements change.
*   No specific CORS configurations within Fiber middleware for different API endpoint groups; all Fiber endpoints share the same CORS policy.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Security Headers Middleware (Fiber-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/security_headers_middleware__fiber-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Integrate Fiber's `fiber/middleware/helmet`:** Utilize the `fiber/middleware/helmet` provided by Fiber to easily set security-related HTTP headers.
2.  **Configure Security Headers within Fiber Middleware:** Configure security headers directly within the `fiber/middleware/helmet` setup, controlling headers like:
    *   `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP): To mitigate XSS for Fiber applications.
    *   `X-Frame-Options`: To prevent clickjacking for Fiber applications.
    *   `X-Content-Type-Options`: To prevent MIME-sniffing vulnerabilities in Fiber applications.
    *   `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS): To enforce HTTPS for Fiber applications.
    *   `Referrer-Policy`: To control referrer information for requests originating from Fiber applications.
    *   `Permissions-Policy`: To control browser features for Fiber applications.
3.  **Apply Security Headers Middleware using `app.Use()`:** Apply `fiber/middleware/helmet` globally using `app.Use()` to enforce security headers across the entire Fiber application.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium to High Severity):** Fiber's Helmet middleware with CSP significantly reduces XSS risks in Fiber applications.
*   **Clickjacking (Medium Severity):** Fiber's Helmet middleware with `X-Frame-Options` prevents clickjacking attacks on Fiber applications.
*   **MIME-Sniffing Vulnerabilities (Low Severity):** Fiber's Helmet middleware with `X-Content-Type-Options` mitigates MIME-sniffing issues in Fiber applications.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** Fiber's Helmet middleware with HSTS enforces HTTPS for Fiber applications, protecting against MITM attacks.
*   **Information Leakage (Low Severity):** Fiber's Helmet middleware with `Referrer-Policy` can control referrer information from Fiber applications.
*   **Feature Abuse (Low Severity):** Fiber's Helmet middleware with `Permissions-Policy` restricts browser feature access for Fiber applications.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS:** Medium to High Risk Reduction
*   **Clickjacking:** High Risk Reduction
*   **MIME-Sniffing Vulnerabilities:** Low Risk Reduction
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Medium to High Risk Reduction
*   **Information Leakage:** Low Risk Reduction
*   **Feature Abuse:** Low Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Security headers middleware (`fiber/middleware/helmet`) is implemented globally for all routes in the Fiber application.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   CSP policy within Fiber's Helmet middleware is default and needs review and tightening for the specific Fiber application.
*   HSTS `max-age` in Fiber's Helmet middleware is default and should be increased for production Fiber deployments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Error Handler (Fiber-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/custom_error_handler__fiber-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define Custom Error Handler Function for Fiber:** Create a function that matches the `fiber.ErrorHandler` signature, taking `*fiber.Ctx` and `error` as arguments. This function will handle errors occurring within Fiber route handlers and middleware.
2.  **Utilize Fiber Context (`c *fiber.Ctx`) in Error Handler:** Within the custom error handler, use the Fiber context (`c *fiber.Ctx`) to:
    *   Log errors (securely, avoiding sensitive data).
    *   Set HTTP status codes using `c.Status()`.
