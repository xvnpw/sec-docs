## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Fiber Framework Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_fiber_framework_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target inherent weaknesses within the Fiber framework's code itself. This can include bugs in routing logic, middleware handling, request parsing, or other core functionalities.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Known Fiber Vulnerabilities (CVEs) [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific Fiber version used by the application.
        *   **Impact:** Can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or Authentication/Authorization Bypass.
        *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in Fiber's request parsing could be exploited to inject malicious commands, leading to RCE.
    *   **Zero-Day Fiber Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Discovering and exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities (zero-days) in Fiber.
        *   **Impact:** Similar to known CVEs, can result in RCE, DoS, or Authentication/Authorization Bypass, but is often more impactful due to lack of existing patches and defenses.
        *   **Example:** A zero-day vulnerability in Fiber's routing mechanism could allow attackers to bypass authentication and access administrative endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Fiber Misconfigurations [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_fiber_misconfigurations__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit insecure configurations of the Fiber application, often stemming from developer errors or insufficient security awareness.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Developer Misconfigurations [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Exploiting misconfigurations introduced by developers during application setup and deployment.
        *   **Identify Misconfigurations (e.g., Improper CORS setup, Missing Security Headers, Insecure Middleware) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack:** Identifying common misconfigurations such as:
                *   **Improper CORS Setup:** Allows unauthorized cross-origin requests, potentially leading to data theft or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
                *   **Missing Security Headers:** Lack of headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, and `HSTS` weakens defenses against XSS, Clickjacking, and other attacks.
                *   **Insecure Middleware:** Using vulnerable or improperly configured middleware can introduce vulnerabilities or bypass security controls.
        *   **Exploit Developer Misconfiguration [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack:** Actively exploiting identified misconfigurations to compromise the application.
            *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (via improper CORS or missing security headers) [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack:** Injecting malicious scripts into the application that are executed in users' browsers due to improper CORS or missing security headers.
                *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, defacement, and malware distribution.
            *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass (via misconfigured middleware) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack:** Bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms due to flaws in custom or third-party middleware configuration.
                *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities Exploited via Fiber [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities_exploited_via_fiber__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in libraries and packages that Fiber depends on (e.g., `fasthttp`). These vulnerabilities can be indirectly exploited through the Fiber application.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Exploit Dependency Vulnerability through Fiber Application [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Triggering vulnerable code paths within Fiber's dependencies by crafting specific requests or interactions with the Fiber application.
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (via vulnerable dependency) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack:** Exploiting a dependency vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
            *   **Impact:** Full system compromise.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (via vulnerable dependency) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack:** Exploiting a dependency vulnerability to cause the application to crash or become unresponsive.
            *   **Impact:** Service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Fiber-Specific Features in Unintended Ways (DoS via resource exhaustion, websocket flooding) [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_fiber-specific_features_in_unintended_ways__dos_via_resource_exhaustion__websocket_flooding__98bf80c1.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers abuse Fiber's features like streaming, websockets, or file serving in ways not intended by developers, leading to resource exhaustion and Denial of Service.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (via resource exhaustion, websocket flooding) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Overwhelming the server's resources by:
            *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Abusing features like streaming or file serving to consume excessive bandwidth, memory, or CPU.
            *   **Websocket Flooding:** Sending a large number of websocket connections or messages to exhaust server resources.
        *   **Impact:** Service disruption, application unavailability.
