*   **Attack Surface: Route Parameter Injection**
    *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate route parameters (e.g., `/users/:id`) to access unintended resources or trigger unexpected behavior.
    *   **How Fiber Contributes:** Fiber's routing mechanism directly exposes these parameters to the application logic, making it vulnerable if developers don't sanitize or validate them.
    *   **Example:** A request to `/users/../admin` might bypass intended access controls if the application doesn't properly handle the `..` sequence in the `id` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, privilege escalation, or application errors.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation on all route parameters to ensure they conform to expected formats and values.
        *   **Avoid Direct File Access:**  Do not directly use route parameters to access files or resources without proper sanitization and path canonicalization.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure users only have access to the resources they need, regardless of parameter manipulation attempts.

*   **Attack Surface: Wildcard Route Abuse**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit wildcard routes (e.g., `/static/*`) to access arbitrary files or directories on the server.
    *   **How Fiber Contributes:** Fiber's wildcard routing feature, while useful, can be dangerous if not configured with strict limitations on the accessible paths.
    *   **Example:** A wildcard route for serving static files might allow an attacker to request sensitive configuration files by crafting a URL like `/static/../config.yaml`.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potential code execution if uploaded files are accessible.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Wildcard Scope:**  Limit the directories and files accessible through wildcard routes as much as possible.
        *   **Path Canonicalization:**  Ensure the application canonicalizes paths to prevent traversal attacks.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Review wildcard route configurations to ensure they are still appropriate and secure.

*   **Attack Surface: Middleware Ordering Issues**
    *   **Description:** Incorrect ordering of middleware can lead to security vulnerabilities by bypassing intended security checks or exposing sensitive information.
    *   **How Fiber Contributes:** Fiber's middleware system relies on the order in which middleware is registered using `app.Use()`. Incorrect ordering can lead to unexpected execution flows.
    *   **Example:** Placing a logging middleware before an authentication middleware might log requests from unauthenticated users, potentially exposing sensitive information. Placing an authorization middleware after a route handler could allow unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing authentication or authorization, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Middleware Planning:**  Thoroughly plan the order of middleware execution, ensuring security-related middleware is executed before any logic that handles sensitive data or actions.
        *   **Modular Middleware:** Design middleware to be self-contained and focused on specific tasks to reduce the risk of unintended interactions.
        *   **Review Middleware Configuration:** Regularly review the middleware order to ensure it aligns with security requirements.

*   **Attack Surface: Lack of Built-in CSRF Protection**
    *   **Description:** Fiber does not provide built-in Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection, making applications vulnerable to attacks where malicious websites can trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions.
    *   **How Fiber Contributes:** Fiber's minimalist approach means developers are responsible for implementing CSRF protection themselves.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could embed a malicious form on their website that submits a request to the vulnerable Fiber application while the user is logged in, performing actions like changing their password or making a purchase without their knowledge.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of authenticated users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement CSRF Tokens:** Use a library or implement a mechanism to generate and validate CSRF tokens for state-changing requests.
        *   **Double Submit Cookie Pattern:** Consider using the double-submit cookie pattern as an alternative CSRF protection method.
        *   **Referer/Origin Header Checks:** While not foolproof, checking the `Referer` or `Origin` headers can provide some level of protection.
