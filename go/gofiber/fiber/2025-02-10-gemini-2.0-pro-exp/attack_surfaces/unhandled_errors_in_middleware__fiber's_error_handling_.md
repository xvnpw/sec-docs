# Deep Analysis: Unhandled Errors in Fiber Middleware

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand and mitigate the risks associated with unhandled errors within Fiber middleware functions.  We aim to prevent information leakage that could occur due to Fiber's default or misconfigured error handling mechanisms.  This analysis focuses specifically on how Fiber processes and responds to errors originating *within* middleware.

## 2. Scope

This analysis is scoped to the following:

*   **Fiber's Middleware Execution:**  How Fiber executes middleware functions and passes errors between them (`ctx.Next(err)`).
*   **Fiber's Error Handling:**  The behavior of Fiber's default error handler and any custom global error handlers configured within the application.
*   **Error Propagation:** How errors that are *not* explicitly handled within a middleware function are propagated to Fiber's error handling mechanisms.
*   **Response Generation:**  The content and structure of HTTP responses generated by Fiber when an unhandled error occurs.
*   **Go's `panic` and `recover`:** How panics within middleware are handled by Fiber, and the implications for error responses.
* **Fiber version:** Analysis is valid for Fiber v2, but it is recommended to check documentation for specific version.

This analysis *excludes* errors that occur outside of Fiber's middleware chain (e.g., errors in route handlers that are *not* triggered by middleware). It also excludes general application logic errors that are not directly related to Fiber's error handling.

## 3. Methodology

The following methodology will be used for this deep analysis:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the Fiber framework's source code (specifically, the `middleware.go`, `router.go`, and `app.go` files, and any files related to error handling) to understand the internal error handling logic.
2.  **Experimentation:** Create a test Fiber application with various middleware configurations, including:
    *   Middleware that intentionally throws errors (both `error` values and `panic`).
    *   Middleware that uses `ctx.Next(err)` to propagate errors.
    *   No custom error handler (relying on Fiber's default).
    *   A custom global error handler with varying levels of detail in the response.
    *   A custom error handler that specifically checks the type of error.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis:** Use tools like `curl`, `Postman`, or a web browser's developer tools to interact with the test application and observe the HTTP responses generated under different error conditions.
4.  **Fuzzing (Optional):** If time permits, use a basic fuzzer to send unexpected inputs to the middleware to trigger potential edge cases in error handling.
5.  **Documentation Review:** Consult the official Fiber documentation to ensure our understanding aligns with the intended behavior of the framework.
6.  **Threat Modeling:** Identify specific threat scenarios related to information leakage through unhandled errors.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 4.1. Fiber's Error Handling Mechanism

Fiber's error handling revolves around the `ctx.Next(err)` function and a global error handler.  Here's a breakdown:

*   **`ctx.Next(err)`:** When a middleware function encounters an error, it can call `ctx.Next(err)` to pass the error to the next middleware in the chain *or* to the global error handler if it's the last middleware.  If `err` is `nil`, execution continues normally.
*   **Default Error Handler:** If no custom error handler is configured, Fiber uses a default handler.  This default handler, *in development mode*, often returns a detailed error message, including a stack trace.  This is a significant security risk in production. In production mode, the default error handler typically returns a generic 500 Internal Server Error.
*   **Custom Error Handler:**  Developers can define a custom global error handler using `app.Use(func(c *fiber.Ctx) error { ... })` or, more commonly, `app.Config.ErrorHandler = func(c *fiber.Ctx, err error) error { ... }`. This handler receives the `fiber.Ctx` and the `error` object.  It's responsible for generating an appropriate HTTP response.
* **Panic Handling:** If middleware function panics, Fiber will recover from the panic internally. The recovered panic value is then converted to an error and passed to the error handler.

### 4.2. Potential Vulnerabilities

1.  **Default Handler in Production:**  The most critical vulnerability is deploying an application to production *without* configuring a custom error handler.  The default handler's detailed error messages can expose sensitive information.

2.  **Overly Verbose Custom Handler:**  Even with a custom handler, developers might inadvertently include sensitive information in the error response.  Examples include:
    *   Echoing back the original error message without sanitization.
    *   Including stack traces (even partial ones).
    *   Revealing internal error codes or database error messages.
    *   Leaking information about the server's file system or environment variables.

3.  **Error Type Disclosure:**  A custom error handler might differentiate responses based on the *type* of error.  While this can be useful for debugging, it can also leak information to an attacker.  For example, distinguishing between a "database connection error" and a "validation error" might reveal details about the application's architecture.

4.  **Unhandled Error Types:** If the custom error handler doesn't handle *all* possible error types (e.g., it only checks for specific custom error types), unexpected errors might still trigger the default handler or result in unexpected behavior.

5.  **Panic Information Leakage:** Even though Fiber recovers from panics, the information from the panic (if not carefully handled in the custom error handler) could still be leaked.

### 4.3. Threat Scenarios

1.  **Information Gathering:** An attacker intentionally triggers errors in middleware (e.g., by providing invalid input) to probe the application's internal structure and identify potential vulnerabilities.  They analyze the error responses for clues about the database, file system, or other internal components.

2.  **Denial of Service (DoS):** While less direct, an attacker might be able to trigger specific errors that consume excessive resources or lead to unexpected application behavior, potentially causing a denial of service. This is more likely if the error handling logic itself is flawed.

3.  **Exploitation of Revealed Information:** If the error responses reveal details about specific vulnerabilities (e.g., a SQL injection vulnerability), the attacker can use this information to craft more targeted attacks.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

1.  **Mandatory Custom Error Handler:**  *Always* implement a custom global error handler in Fiber.  This handler should be the *first* middleware in the chain to ensure it catches all errors.

    ```go
    package main

    import (
    	"fmt"
    	"log"
    	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
    )

    func main() {
    	app := fiber.New(fiber.Config{
    		ErrorHandler: func(c *fiber.Ctx, err error) error {
    			// Log the error for internal debugging
    			log.Printf("Error: %v", err)

    			// Return a generic error message to the client
    			code := fiber.StatusInternalServerError
    			if e, ok := err.(*fiber.Error); ok {
    				code = e.Code
    			}
    			return c.Status(code).JSON(fiber.Map{
    				"error": "An unexpected error occurred.", // Generic message
    			})
    		},
    	})

    	app.Use(func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    		// Simulate an error
    		return fmt.Errorf("middleware error")
    		// Or, to trigger a specific HTTP status code:
    		// return fiber.NewError(fiber.StatusUnauthorized, "Unauthorized")
    	})

    	app.Get("/", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    		return c.SendString("Hello, World!")
    	})

    	log.Fatal(app.Listen(":3000"))
    }

    ```

2.  **Generic Error Responses:**  The custom error handler should *never* return sensitive information to the client.  Use generic error messages like "An unexpected error occurred" or "Internal Server Error."  Include a unique error ID in the response *and* log the full error details (including the ID) server-side for debugging.

3.  **HTTP Status Code Handling:**  Use appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 500 Internal Server Error) to indicate the general nature of the error, but avoid revealing specific details in the response body.  Fiber's `fiber.Error` type can be helpful here.

4.  **Error Type Handling (Careful):**  If you need to differentiate responses based on error type, do so *carefully*.  Avoid exposing internal error classifications.  Focus on broad categories relevant to the client (e.g., "invalid input" vs. "server error").

5.  **Panic Handling:** Ensure your custom error handler can gracefully handle errors that originated from panics.  The `recover()` function can be used within the error handler if necessary, but the recovered value should *never* be directly exposed to the client.

6.  **Testing:**  Thoroughly test your error handling logic.  Create unit tests and integration tests that specifically trigger errors in middleware and verify that the responses are generic and do not leak information.

7.  **Environment-Specific Configuration:** Use environment variables (e.g., `APP_ENV=production`) to control the level of detail in error responses.  In development, you might want more verbose logging, but in production, error responses should be completely generic. Fiber's `Config` struct allows for environment-based configuration.

8.  **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews to ensure that error handling best practices are consistently followed.

9.  **Security Audits:**  Periodically perform security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities, including those related to error handling.

## 5. Conclusion

Unhandled errors in Fiber middleware represent a significant attack surface due to the potential for information leakage. By understanding Fiber's error handling mechanisms and implementing robust mitigation strategies, developers can significantly reduce the risk of exposing sensitive information.  The key is to *always* use a custom error handler, return generic error responses, and thoroughly test the error handling logic.  This proactive approach is crucial for building secure and resilient Fiber applications.
