Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Misconfigured CORS" attack tree path, tailored for a Fiber application, presented in Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: Misconfigured CORS in Fiber Applications

## 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the "Misconfigured CORS" attack vector within a Fiber-based web application, identify specific vulnerabilities, propose concrete mitigation strategies, and provide actionable guidance for developers to prevent and detect such misconfigurations.  This analysis aims to move beyond general advice and provide Fiber-specific context.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on:

*   **Fiber Framework:**  Specifically, how CORS is implemented and potentially misconfigured within applications built using the `gofiber/fiber` framework in Go.
*   **Common Misconfigurations:**  Identifying the most frequent mistakes developers make when configuring CORS in Fiber.
*   **Exploitation Scenarios:**  Describing realistic attack scenarios that leverage misconfigured CORS in a Fiber context.
*   **Mitigation Techniques:**  Providing practical, Fiber-specific code examples and configuration recommendations to prevent CORS vulnerabilities.
*   **Detection Methods:**  Outlining how to identify existing CORS misconfigurations in a Fiber application.
*   **Impact on different HTTP methods:** How different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS) are affected by CORS and how misconfigurations can impact them differently.
*   **Interaction with other security mechanisms:** How CORS interacts with other security features like CSRF protection, authentication, and authorization.

This analysis *does *not* cover:

*   General web security concepts unrelated to CORS.
*   Vulnerabilities specific to other web frameworks.
*   Deep dives into browser internals beyond the scope of CORS.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Review Fiber Documentation:**  Examine the official Fiber documentation regarding CORS configuration and middleware.
2.  **Code Analysis:**  Analyze example Fiber code snippets, both vulnerable and secure, to illustrate the practical implications of CORS misconfigurations.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Develop realistic attack scenarios based on common CORS vulnerabilities.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies using Fiber's built-in features and best practices.
5.  **Detection Technique Identification:**  Describe methods for identifying existing CORS misconfigurations, including manual code review, automated scanning, and browser-based testing.
6.  **Impact Assessment:** Evaluate the potential impact of successful CORS exploitation on the application and its users.

## 4. Deep Analysis of "Misconfigured CORS" Attack Tree Path

### 4.1. Understanding CORS and Fiber's Implementation

CORS is a browser-enforced security mechanism that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one from which they originated.  This prevents malicious websites from accessing sensitive data from other sites.  A "domain" is defined by the scheme (http/https), host (example.com), and port (80, 443).

Fiber provides built-in middleware (`fiber.Config.Cors`) to handle CORS configuration.  This middleware intercepts incoming requests and adds the necessary HTTP headers (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`) to the response, based on the configured policy.

### 4.2. Common Misconfigurations in Fiber

The most common and dangerous misconfiguration is using a wildcard (`*`) for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2/middleware/cors"
)

func main() {
	app := fiber.New()

	// VULNERABLE: Allows requests from ANY origin
	app.Use(cors.New(cors.Config{
		AllowOrigins: "*",
		AllowMethods: "GET,POST,HEAD,PUT,DELETE,PATCH",
	}))

	app.Get("/", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
		return c.SendString("Hello, World!")
	})

	app.Listen(":3000")
}
```

This configuration effectively disables CORS protection, allowing any website to make requests to the Fiber application.  Other common misconfigurations include:

*   **Overly Permissive `AllowMethods`:**  Allowing methods like `PUT`, `DELETE`, or `PATCH` without proper authorization checks can lead to unauthorized data modification or deletion.
*   **Overly Permissive `AllowHeaders`:**  Allowing custom headers without validation can be exploited in some cases, although this is less common than origin or method issues.
*   **Trusting User-Supplied Origins:**  Dynamically setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header based on the `Origin` header from the request *without proper validation* is extremely dangerous.  An attacker can simply set the `Origin` header to their malicious site.
*   **Misunderstanding `AllowCredentials`:**  Setting `AllowCredentials: true` along with `AllowOrigins: "*"` is explicitly forbidden by the CORS specification and will be ignored by browsers.  However, setting `AllowCredentials: true` with a specific, trusted origin allows the browser to send cookies and HTTP authentication headers with cross-origin requests.  This must be used carefully.
*  **Ignoring Preflight Requests (OPTIONS):** The browser may send an OPTIONS request (a "preflight" request) before a "non-simple" cross-origin request (e.g., a POST request with a `Content-Type` other than `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, or `text/plain`).  The server *must* respond appropriately to the OPTIONS request, or the actual request will be blocked.  Misconfigured CORS middleware might not handle OPTIONS requests correctly.

### 4.3. Exploitation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Data Theft (GET)**

1.  **Vulnerable Fiber App:**  A Fiber application serving sensitive user data at `/api/user/profile` has `AllowOrigins: "*"`.
2.  **Attacker's Website:**  An attacker hosts a malicious website at `attacker.com`.
3.  **Victim's Browser:**  A user, logged into the vulnerable Fiber application, visits `attacker.com`.
4.  **Malicious JavaScript:**  The attacker's website includes JavaScript code that makes a `fetch` request to `https://vulnerable-app.com/api/user/profile`.
5.  **Browser Executes Request:**  Because of the wildcard CORS configuration, the browser allows the request, even though it's cross-origin.  The user's cookies (including session cookies) are sent with the request.
6.  **Data Exfiltration:**  The Fiber application responds with the user's profile data.  The attacker's JavaScript receives the data and sends it to the attacker's server.

**Scenario 2: Unauthorized Actions (POST/PUT/DELETE)**

1.  **Vulnerable Fiber App:**  A Fiber application has an endpoint at `/api/posts` that allows creating new posts via a `POST` request.  It has `AllowOrigins: "*"`.
2.  **Attacker's Website:**  An attacker hosts a malicious website.
3.  **Victim's Browser:**  A user, logged into the vulnerable application, visits the attacker's website.
4.  **Hidden Form/JavaScript:**  The attacker's website contains a hidden form or JavaScript code that makes a `POST` request to `https://vulnerable-app.com/api/posts` with malicious content.
5.  **Browser Executes Request:**  The browser allows the cross-origin request due to the wildcard CORS configuration.  The user's session cookies are sent.
6.  **Unauthorized Action:**  The Fiber application processes the request, creating a new post with the attacker's content, potentially defacing the website or spreading malware.

**Scenario 3: CSRF with Misconfigured CORS**
While CORS is not a direct CSRF protection, a misconfigured CORS policy can *weaken* existing CSRF protections. If a site relies solely on the same-origin policy for CSRF protection (which is not recommended), a wildcard CORS configuration removes that protection. Even with CSRF tokens, if the token-retrieval endpoint is also vulnerable to a CORS misconfiguration, the attacker can fetch the token and then perform the CSRF attack.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Fiber-Specific)

1.  **Restrict `AllowOrigins`:**  The most crucial step is to explicitly list the allowed origins.  *Never* use `"*"` in production.

    ```go
    app.Use(cors.New(cors.Config{
        AllowOrigins: "https://example.com, https://www.example.com", // Only allow these origins
        AllowMethods: "GET,POST,HEAD,OPTIONS", // Be specific with methods
    }))
    ```

2.  **Use a Function for Dynamic Origins (Carefully!):** If you need to allow multiple origins dynamically, use a function to validate the origin against a whitelist.  *Do not* simply echo back the `Origin` header.

    ```go
    var allowedOrigins = map[string]bool{
        "https://example.com":     true,
        "https://sub.example.com": true,
    }

    app.Use(cors.New(cors.Config{
        AllowOriginsFunc: func(origin string) (bool, error) {
            if allowedOrigins[origin] {
                return true, nil
            }
            return false, nil // Deny the request
        },
        AllowMethods: "GET,POST,HEAD,OPTIONS",
    }))
    ```

3.  **Restrict `AllowMethods`:**  Only allow the HTTP methods that are actually needed for each endpoint.

4.  **Validate `AllowHeaders`:**  If you allow custom headers, validate them to prevent potential injection attacks.  Fiber's `cors.Config` allows specifying allowed headers.

5.  **Handle `AllowCredentials` Correctly:**  If you need to allow credentials (cookies, HTTP authentication), set `AllowCredentials: true` and specify the *exact* allowed origin (no wildcards).

    ```go
    app.Use(cors.New(cors.Config{
        AllowOrigins:     "https://example.com",
        AllowCredentials: true, // Only with a specific origin!
        AllowMethods:     "GET,POST,HEAD,OPTIONS",
    }))
    ```

6.  **Implement CSRF Protection:**  Use Fiber's CSRF middleware (`github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2/middleware/csrf`) in addition to CORS.  CORS and CSRF protection work together.

    ```go
    import "github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2/middleware/csrf"

    app.Use(csrf.New()) // Add CSRF protection
    ```

7.  **Handle OPTIONS Requests:** Fiber's CORS middleware automatically handles OPTIONS requests based on your configuration.  Ensure you're using the middleware correctly.  If you're implementing custom CORS logic, you *must* handle OPTIONS requests explicitly.

8. **Consider using `ExposeHeaders`:** If your frontend JavaScript needs to access custom headers in the response, you must explicitly list them in the `ExposeHeaders` configuration.

### 4.5. Detection Techniques

1.  **Code Review:**  Manually inspect the Fiber application's code, focusing on the `cors.New()` configuration.  Look for wildcards, overly permissive settings, and improper dynamic origin handling.

2.  **Automated Scanning:**  Use security scanners that can detect CORS misconfigurations.  Tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and various online scanners can help.

3.  **Browser-Based Testing:**
    *   **Developer Tools:**  Use the browser's developer tools (Network tab) to inspect the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in responses.
    *   **Cross-Origin Requests:**  Create a simple HTML page on a different domain (or even locally using a different port) and use JavaScript (`fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`) to make requests to the Fiber application.  Observe whether the requests succeed or fail, and check the browser's console for CORS errors.
    *   **Test with and without Credentials:** Test both with and without sending credentials (e.g., cookies) to ensure `AllowCredentials` is configured correctly.
    * **Test different HTTP methods:** Ensure that all relevant HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS) are tested with different origins.

4.  **Unit and Integration Tests:** Write tests that specifically check the CORS headers in responses for different request scenarios. This can help catch regressions.

### 4.6. Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful CORS exploitation can range from medium to high, depending on the nature of the data and functionality exposed by the vulnerable endpoints.

*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers can steal sensitive user data, including personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or authentication tokens.
*   **Account Takeover:**  If session cookies are exposed, attackers can hijack user accounts.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:**  Attackers can perform actions on behalf of users, such as posting content, modifying data, or deleting resources.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful CORS exploit can damage the reputation of the application and the organization behind it.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Data breaches can lead to legal and regulatory penalties, especially if PII is involved.

## 5. Conclusion

Misconfigured CORS is a serious security vulnerability that can have significant consequences.  By understanding how CORS works, the common misconfigurations in Fiber applications, and the available mitigation strategies, developers can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation.  Regular code reviews, automated scanning, and thorough testing are essential for maintaining a secure CORS configuration.  Fiber's built-in CORS middleware provides a convenient and powerful way to implement secure CORS policies, but it must be configured correctly.  Always prioritize security and follow the principle of least privilege when configuring CORS.
