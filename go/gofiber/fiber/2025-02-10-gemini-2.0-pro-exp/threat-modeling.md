# Threat Model Analysis for gofiber/fiber

## Threat: [Fasthttp Request Smuggling](./threats/fasthttp_request_smuggling.md)

*   **1. Threat: Fasthttp Request Smuggling**

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request exploiting vulnerabilities in how `fasthttp` parses and handles HTTP headers (e.g., `Transfer-Encoding`, `Content-Length`).  The attacker smuggles a second, hidden request within the first, bypassing security controls. This leverages `fasthttp`'s non-standard HTTP implementation.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Bypass of authentication and authorization.
        *   Access to restricted resources.
        *   Potential data modification/deletion.
        *   Possible remote code execution (RCE) in severe cases, if the smuggled request interacts with vulnerable backend systems.
    *   **Affected Fiber Component:** `fasthttp` (underlying HTTP server library), Fiber's request parsing logic (which relies on `fasthttp`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **a. Reverse Proxy (Primary):** Deploy a well-configured reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache, HAProxy) *in front* of the Fiber application.  Configure the proxy to strictly enforce HTTP/1.1 compliance and reject ambiguous requests.
        *   **b. Fasthttp Updates:** Stay *absolutely current* with `fasthttp` releases. Monitor security advisories and apply patches immediately.
        *   **c. WAF:** Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with rules to detect and block HTTP request smuggling, specifically tailored to `fasthttp`'s behavior.
        *   **d. Monitoring:** Detailed HTTP request logging and monitoring to detect unusual patterns.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Fasthttp Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_fasthttp_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **2. Threat: Denial of Service (DoS) via Fasthttp Resource Exhaustion**

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends many requests, or specially crafted requests, to exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, connections) within `fasthttp`. This could include slowloris attacks, large request bodies, or exploiting inefficiencies in `fasthttp`'s connection handling.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application unavailability.
        *   Service disruption.
        *   Potential financial losses.
    *   **Affected Fiber Component:** `fasthttp` (connection handling, request processing), Fiber's server configuration (concurrency limits, timeouts).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **a. Rate Limiting:** Implement robust rate limiting using Fiber's middleware (e.g., `fiber.Limiter`) or a dedicated service. Configure limits based on IP, user ID, etc.
        *   **b. Connection Limits:** Configure `fasthttp`'s connection limits (via Fiber's server settings) to prevent a single client from consuming too many connections.
        *   **c. Request Timeouts:** Set appropriate timeouts for requests to prevent slowloris and other slow-request vulnerabilities. Use Fiber's configuration.
        *   **d. Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, connections) and set up alerts.
        *   **e. Reverse Proxy:** A reverse proxy can help absorb some DoS attacks.
        *   **f. CDN:** Use a CDN to distribute static content.

## Threat: [Third-Party Middleware Vulnerability (Authentication Bypass)](./threats/third-party_middleware_vulnerability__authentication_bypass_.md)

*   **3. Threat: Third-Party Middleware Vulnerability (Authentication Bypass)**

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a third-party Fiber middleware used for authentication (e.g., a JWT middleware). The vulnerability might allow forging authentication tokens, bypassing authentication, or escalating privileges.  This is *directly* related to Fiber because it's within Fiber's middleware ecosystem.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to protected resources.
        *   Data breaches.
        *   Account takeover.
        *   Potential for complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Fiber Component:** The specific third-party middleware (e.g., `github.com/gofiber/jwt`), Fiber's middleware execution chain.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **a. Middleware Auditing:** *Thoroughly* audit the source code of any third-party authentication middleware.
        *   **b. Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a vulnerability scanner to identify known vulnerabilities.
        *   **c. Updates:** Keep the middleware updated. Subscribe to security advisories.
        *   **d. Least Privilege (Middleware):** Ensure the middleware has only minimum necessary permissions.
        *   **e. Custom Middleware (If Feasible):** For critical authentication, consider writing your own middleware.
        *   **f. Defense in Depth:** Implement additional security controls (e.g., multi-factor authentication).

## Threat: [Template Injection (using a vulnerable template engine with Fiber)](./threats/template_injection__using_a_vulnerable_template_engine_with_fiber_.md)

* **4. Threat: Template Injection (using a vulnerable template engine with Fiber)**
    *   **Description:** If a template engine is used *with Fiber*, and user data is rendered into a template without proper escaping, an attacker can inject malicious code. This can lead to XSS or RCE. While not *exclusively* a Fiber issue, the integration with Fiber is the attack vector.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   XSS: Execute malicious JavaScript in other users' browsers.
        *   RCE: Execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Affected Fiber Component:** The chosen template engine, Fiber's integration with the template engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible), High (for XSS)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **a. Auto-Escaping Template Engine:** Use a template engine that *automatically* escapes output by default (e.g., Go's `html/template`).
        *   **b. Manual Escaping (If Necessary):** If the engine doesn't auto-escape, *manually* escape all user-supplied data.
        *   **c. Context-Aware Escaping:** Ensure escaping is appropriate for the context.
        *   **d. Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP to mitigate XSS.
