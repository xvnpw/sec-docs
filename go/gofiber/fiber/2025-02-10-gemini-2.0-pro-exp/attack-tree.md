## Attack Tree Path: [<<Bypass Middleware>>](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker successfully circumvents security checks implemented by Fiber middleware. This could involve bypassing authentication, authorization, input validation, or other security-related middleware. The attacker achieves this by exploiting flaws in the middleware's logic, incorrect middleware order, or vulnerabilities in third-party middleware used with Fiber.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High.
*   **Impact:** Very High.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard.
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Strict Middleware Order:** Ensure middleware is applied in the correct sequence (authentication *before* authorization).
    *   **Bypass Testing:** Actively attempt to bypass middleware with invalid credentials and malformed requests.
    *   **Third-Party Middleware Vetting:** Thoroughly assess the security of any third-party middleware.
    *   **Redundant Input Validation:** Implement input validation in *every* relevant middleware, not just a single point.
    *   **Prefer Established Middleware:** Use well-known, actively maintained middleware packages.

## Attack Tree Path: [{Expose Sensitive Data (e.g., /debug/pprof)}](./attack_tree_paths/{expose_sensitive_data__e_g___debugpprof_}.md)

*   **Description:** Fiber, or Go's standard library, exposes debugging endpoints (like `/debug/pprof`) that can leak sensitive information about the application's internal state, memory, and potentially source code. Attackers can access these endpoints if they are not properly disabled or restricted in production environments.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (if developers are aware) to High (if developers are unaware or forgetful).
*   **Impact:** Medium to High.
*   **Effort:** Very Low.
*   **Skill Level:** Novice.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (with monitoring) to Very Hard (without monitoring).
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Disable in Production:** Explicitly disable or remove debugging endpoints in production. Use environment variables.
    *   **Restrict Access:** If needed in non-production, restrict access via IP whitelisting or authentication.
    *   **Monitor Access:** Implement monitoring to detect unauthorized access attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [<<Misconfigured CORS>>](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_cors.md)

*   **Description:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a browser security mechanism. Misconfigured CORS policies (e.g., allowing requests from any origin using `*`) can allow attackers to bypass the same-origin policy, leading to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and other cross-origin attacks. Attackers can potentially steal data or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of users.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High.
*   **Effort:** Low.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium.
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Restrict Origins:** Only allow requests from trusted origins. Avoid wildcards (`*`) in production.
    *   **Use Fiber's Middleware:** Leverage Fiber's built-in CORS middleware for easier configuration.
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Test the CORS configuration rigorously to ensure it's working as intended.
