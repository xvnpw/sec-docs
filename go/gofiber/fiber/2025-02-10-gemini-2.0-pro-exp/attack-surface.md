# Attack Surface Analysis for gofiber/fiber

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Injection (Fiber's Parsing)](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_injection__fiber's_parsing_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting how Fiber *internally* parses and handles route parameters (e.g., `/users/:id`), going beyond basic application-level input validation. This is about Fiber's parsing logic, *not* the developer's validation.
*   **How Fiber Contributes:** Fiber's `ctx.Params()` and related functions are responsible for extracting and making these parameters available.  The underlying parsing logic, type handling, and any implicit conversions *within Fiber* are the key attack surface.
*   **Example:**  If Fiber doesn't strictly enforce an expected integer `:id` *at the routing level*, an attacker might provide `/users/abc` or `/users/1;DROP TABLE users`. Even with application validation, Fiber's initial parsing could cause issues (panics, unexpected behavior). Injecting very long strings to test for buffer overflows or resource exhaustion *within Fiber's parameter handling* is another example.
*   **Impact:**  Potential for application crashes (panics within Fiber), unexpected behavior in middleware that relies on `ctx.Params()`, bypassing of intended route constraints (if Fiber has them), and potentially influencing later application logic (though proper validation is still the application's responsibility).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Utilize Fiber's built-in parameter constraints (if available and appropriate) to enforce data types and lengths *at the routing level*. This is Fiber's first line of defense. Example: `:id<int>` if supported.
    *   **Developer:**  Thoroughly review Fiber's source code and documentation related to parameter parsing to understand its limitations and edge cases.
    *   **Developer:** Fuzz test routes with unexpected parameter values, specifically targeting Fiber's parsing logic. This is *distinct* from application-level input validation fuzzing.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Bypass/Misconfiguration (Fiber's Pipeline)](./attack_surfaces/middleware_bypassmisconfiguration__fiber's_pipeline_.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrect ordering or conditional execution of Fiber middleware, allowing attackers to bypass security controls. This focuses on Fiber's middleware execution mechanism.
*   **How Fiber Contributes:** Fiber's middleware system (`app.Use()`, `app.Group()`, route-specific middleware application) *defines* the request processing pipeline. Incorrect configuration *within Fiber's system* is the vulnerability.
*   **Example:**  Placing authorization middleware *after* authentication middleware (a configuration error within Fiber's setup).  Another example: a bug in Fiber's middleware logic that allows a route to be accessed without going through the intended middleware chain.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to protected resources, data breaches, privilege escalation â€“ all stemming from bypassing Fiber's intended security flow.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**  Carefully plan and document the middleware chain, paying close attention to the order of execution *as defined by Fiber's API*.
    *   **Developer:**  Thoroughly test all routes, including edge cases, to ensure that the intended middleware is executed in the correct order *by Fiber*.
    *   **Developer:**  Use Fiber's grouping features (`app.Group()`) to logically organize routes and apply middleware consistently, leveraging Fiber's mechanisms for structured application.
    *   **Developer:** Audit Fiber's middleware execution logic (if possible) to identify potential bypass vulnerabilities *within the framework itself*.

## Attack Surface: [Request Body Parsing Vulnerabilities (Fiber's Parsers)](./attack_surfaces/request_body_parsing_vulnerabilities__fiber's_parsers_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Fiber *itself* parses request bodies (JSON, XML, form data, multipart). This is about Fiber's parsing implementations, not just the application's use of the parsed data.
*   **How Fiber Contributes:** Fiber's `ctx.BodyParser()`, `ctx.FormValue()`, and related functions are the *direct* attack surface. The underlying parsing libraries *used by Fiber* and Fiber's integration with them are crucial.
*   **Example:**  Sending a deeply nested JSON payload to cause resource exhaustion *within Fiber's JSON parser*, sending an excessively large request body to cause a denial-of-service *by overwhelming Fiber's parsing capabilities*, or sending malformed XML to exploit vulnerabilities in Fiber's XML parsing implementation.
*   **Impact:**  Denial of service (due to Fiber's resource exhaustion), application crashes (panics within Fiber's parsing logic), potential for remote code execution (if the underlying parsing library used by Fiber has vulnerabilities).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**  Use Fiber's built-in body size limits (if available) to prevent excessively large requests *at the Fiber level*. This is a framework-provided defense.
    *   **Developer:**  Review Fiber's documentation and source code for the parsing libraries it uses. Investigate any known vulnerabilities in those libraries.
    *   **Developer:** Fuzz test API endpoints with various malformed request bodies, specifically targeting Fiber's parsing functions. This is *distinct* from application-level input validation fuzzing.

## Attack Surface: [Unhandled Errors in Middleware (Fiber's Error Handling)](./attack_surfaces/unhandled_errors_in_middleware__fiber's_error_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** Improper error handling *within* Fiber middleware functions, leading to information leakage due to Fiber's default or misconfigured error responses.
*   **How Fiber Contributes:** Fiber's middleware execution and error handling mechanisms (`ctx.Next(err)`, and the behavior of Fiber's default or custom global error handlers) are the direct concern. If errors aren't caught *by Fiber* and handled gracefully *by Fiber*, internal details might be exposed.
*   **Example:** A middleware function panics, and Fiber's default error handler (or a poorly configured custom handler) returns a stack trace or other sensitive information. This is about *Fiber's* response to the error.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (stack traces, internal error messages, potentially revealing details about Fiber's internals or the application's structure).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *    **Developer:** Implement a global error handler *in Fiber* that catches *all* unhandled errors and returns a generic, non-sensitive error response. This is a Fiber-level configuration.
    *   **Developer:** Ensure that *Fiber's* error handling mechanism is configured to *not* expose internal error messages or stack traces in production.
    *   **Developer:** Thoroughly test error handling within middleware to ensure that *Fiber* behaves as expected and doesn't leak information.
