Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the Template Injection threat within a Fiber application.

## Deep Analysis: Template Injection in Fiber Applications

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the nature of template injection vulnerabilities within the context of a Fiber web application, identify specific attack vectors, assess potential impact, and propose robust, practical mitigation strategies.  We aim to provide actionable guidance for developers to prevent this vulnerability.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses on:

*   Fiber applications that utilize template engines (e.g., `html/template`, `pug`, `amber`, `handlebars`, etc.).
*   Scenarios where user-supplied data is directly or indirectly incorporated into templates.
*   The interaction between Fiber's request handling and the template rendering process.
*   Both server-side template injection (SSTI) leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and client-side template injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   Go's built in `html/template` and other third party template engines.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Definition and Refinement:**  Expand on the initial threat description, clarifying the specific mechanisms of template injection.
2.  **Attack Vector Analysis:**  Identify common code patterns and configurations that introduce template injection vulnerabilities.  Provide concrete examples.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Detail the potential consequences of successful exploitation, including specific examples of XSS and RCE payloads.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive:**  Elaborate on the proposed mitigation strategies, providing code examples and best practices.  Discuss the limitations of each strategy.
5.  **Testing and Verification:**  Outline methods for testing and verifying the effectiveness of implemented mitigations.
6.  **Fiber-Specific Considerations:**  Address any unique aspects of Fiber that might influence the vulnerability or its mitigation.

### 2. Threat Definition and Refinement

Template injection occurs when an attacker can control all or part of a template that is rendered by the server.  This differs from simply passing untrusted data *to* a template; the vulnerability lies in allowing the attacker to *define the template structure itself*.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Template Engine:** Software that combines a template (a text file with placeholders) and data to produce output (e.g., HTML, text).
*   **Template Syntax:** The special characters and keywords used by the template engine to define placeholders, control flow (loops, conditionals), and other logic.  Examples:
    *   `{{ ... }}` (Go's `html/template`, Jinja2, Twig)
    *   `#{ ... }` (Pug)
    *   `<%= ... %>` (EJS)
*   **Context:** The location within the output where the data is being inserted (e.g., HTML attribute, HTML text, JavaScript).  Different contexts require different escaping rules.
*   **Escaping:** The process of converting potentially dangerous characters into their safe equivalents (e.g., `<` becomes `&lt;` in HTML).

**Mechanism:**

1.  **Unsafe Data Handling:** The application takes user input (e.g., from a form, URL parameter, or database) and directly concatenates it into a template string.
2.  **Template Engine Interpretation:** The template engine treats the attacker-controlled portion as part of the template's structure, not just as data.
3.  **Payload Execution:** The attacker's injected code (within the template syntax) is executed by the template engine, either on the server (SSTI) or in the client's browser (XSS).

### 3. Attack Vector Analysis

Let's examine some common vulnerable code patterns in Fiber applications:

**Example 1: Direct Concatenation (Highly Vulnerable)**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"
	"text/template" // Using text/template for demonstration; html/template is recommended

	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
)

func main() {
	app := fiber.New()

	app.Get("/unsafe", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
		userInput := c.Query("name")
		// VULNERABLE: Directly concatenating user input into the template string.
		tmplStr := fmt.Sprintf("<h1>Hello, %s!</h1>", userInput)
		tmpl, err := template.New("unsafe").Parse(tmplStr)
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
		return tmpl.Execute(c.Response().BodyWriter(), nil)
	})

	log.Fatal(app.Listen(":3000"))
}
```

**Attack:**

If a user visits `/unsafe?name={{.্যাবস}}`, the server will try to execute Go code.  This is because `{{.্যাবস}}` is valid `text/template` syntax.  The `.` refers to the current context (which is `nil` in this case), and `্যাবস` is a non-existent field, likely causing an error, but demonstrating the injection.  A more sophisticated attacker could inject code to read files, execute commands, etc.

**Example 2:  Incorrect Use of `html/template` (Potentially Vulnerable)**

```go
package main

import (
	"html/template"
	"log"

	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
)

func main() {
	app := fiber.New()

	app.Get("/unsafe2", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
		userInput := c.Query("name")
        //VULNERABLE: User input is used to create template
		tmpl, err := template.New("unsafe2").Parse("<h1>Hello, " + userInput + "!</h1>")
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
		return tmpl.Execute(c.Response().BodyWriter(), nil)
	})

	log.Fatal(app.Listen(":3001"))
}
```

**Attack:**
If a user visits `/unsafe2?name={{.্যাবস}}`, the server will try to execute Go code.

**Example 3:  Using a Vulnerable Third-Party Template Engine (Hypothetical)**

Let's assume a hypothetical template engine called "MyTemplate" that *doesn't* auto-escape and uses `[[ ... ]]` as its syntax.

```go
// (Hypothetical - assuming a custom template engine integration)
app.Get("/unsafe3", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
	userInput := c.Query("comment")
	data := map[string]string{"comment": userInput}
	// VULNERABLE:  If MyTemplate doesn't auto-escape, this is vulnerable.
	return c.Render("comment_template", data, "MyTemplate")
})

// comment_template.my (Hypothetical template file)
// <p>Comment: [[ comment ]]</p>
```

**Attack:**

If a user submits `comment=[[ <script>alert(1)</script> ]]`, and "MyTemplate" doesn't escape, the resulting HTML will contain the injected script, leading to XSS.

### 4. Impact Assessment

**Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) - RCE:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the web application process.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Read sensitive files (configuration files, database credentials, source code).
*   **System Compromise:**  Potentially gain full control of the server, install malware, pivot to other systems on the network.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Crash the server or consume excessive resources.

**Example RCE Payload (Go's `text/template`):**

While `html/template` is generally safe against RCE due to its context-aware escaping, `text/template` is not.  If `text/template` were used unsafely (as in Example 1), an attacker might try:

```
{{/* This is a comment */}}
{{range .}}{{end}}
{{define "T1"}}ONE{{end}}
{{template "T1"}}
{{range $k, $v := .}}{{if eq $k "Name"}}{{$v}}{{end}}{{end}}
{{printf "%s" "hello"}}
{{. | html}}
```

This payload, while not directly executing OS commands, demonstrates the ability to execute arbitrary Go template logic.  A more complex payload *could* potentially leverage Go's standard library to achieve RCE, depending on the application's context and available functions.

**Client-Side Template Injection - XSS:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** Steal user cookies and impersonate the user.
*   **Data Theft:**  Access and exfiltrate sensitive data displayed on the page or stored in the browser (e.g., local storage).
*   **Website Defacement:**  Modify the content of the page.
*   **Phishing:**  Redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Keylogging:**  Capture user keystrokes.

**Example XSS Payload:**

```
<script>alert('XSS');</script>
<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
{{.}}
```

### 5. Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive

**5.a. Auto-Escaping Template Engine (Recommended):**

*   **Go's `html/template`:** This is the *strongly recommended* choice for Fiber applications.  It automatically escapes output based on the context (HTML, attributes, JavaScript, CSS, URLs).
*   **How it Works:**  `html/template` parses the template and understands the HTML structure.  When it encounters a placeholder (e.g., `{{ .Name }}`), it determines the appropriate escaping function to apply.
*   **Example (Safe):**

    ```go
    package main

    import (
    	"html/template"
    	"log"

    	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
    )

    func main() {
    	app := fiber.New()

    	app.Get("/safe", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    		userInput := c.Query("name")
    		data := struct{ Name string }{Name: userInput}

    		// SAFE: Using html/template and passing data as a struct.
    		tmpl, err := template.New("safe").Parse("<h1>Hello, {{ .Name }}!</h1>")
    		if err != nil {
    			return err
    		}
    		return tmpl.Execute(c.Response().BodyWriter(), data)
    	})

    	log.Fatal(app.Listen(":3002"))
    }
    ```

    Even if `userInput` contains `<script>alert(1)</script>`, `html/template` will correctly escape it to `&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;`, preventing XSS.

*   **Limitations:**  `html/template` might not be suitable for all use cases (e.g., generating non-HTML output).  In such cases, consider `text/template` *very carefully* and use manual escaping.

**5.b. Manual Escaping (If Necessary):**

*   **Use with Caution:**  Only use manual escaping if you *absolutely cannot* use an auto-escaping engine.  It's error-prone.
*   **Go's `html` Package:**  Provides functions like `html.EscapeString` for basic HTML escaping.
*   **Example (Less Safe, Requires Careful Handling):**

    ```go
    import (
    	"html"
    	"log"
        "text/template"
    	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
    )

    app.Get("/manual", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    	userInput := c.Query("name")
    	escapedInput := html.EscapeString(userInput) // Manual escaping.
        data := struct{ Name string }{Name: escapedInput}
    	tmpl, err := template.New("manual").Parse("<h1>Hello, {{ .Name }}!</h1>")
    	if err != nil {
    		return err
    	}
    	return tmpl.Execute(c.Response().BodyWriter(), data)
    })
    ```

*   **Limitations:**  Manual escaping is context-agnostic.  You must choose the correct escaping function for each context.  Forgetting to escape, or using the wrong escaping function, will lead to vulnerabilities.

**5.c. Context-Aware Escaping:**

*   **Essential for Manual Escaping:**  If you're manually escaping, you *must* understand the context.
*   **Example (Attribute Context):**

    ```go
    // ... (within a Fiber handler)
    userInput := c.Query("id")
    // Escaping for an HTML attribute:
    escapedID := template.HTMLAttr(userInput)
    data := struct{ ID template.HTMLAttr }{ID: escapedID}
    tmpl, err := template.New("attr").Parse(`<div id="{{ .ID }}">...</div>`)
    // ...
    ```

    `template.HTMLAttr` ensures the ID is properly escaped for use within an HTML attribute.

*   **Other Contexts:**  `html/template` provides specific types for other contexts: `template.HTML`, `template.JS`, `template.CSS`, `template.URL`.

**5.d. Content Security Policy (CSP):**

*   **Defense in Depth:**  CSP is a browser security mechanism that helps mitigate XSS, even if a template injection vulnerability exists.
*   **How it Works:**  CSP defines a whitelist of sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, styles, images, etc.).
*   **Implementation in Fiber:**

    ```go
    app.Use(func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    	c.Set("Content-Security-Policy", "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted.example.com;")
    	return c.Next()
    })
    ```

    This example CSP allows scripts only from the same origin (`'self'`) and `https://trusted.example.com`.  An injected script from an untrusted source would be blocked.

*   **Limitations:**  CSP is not a silver bullet.  It requires careful configuration and can be bypassed in some cases.  It's best used as a *supplement* to proper template escaping.

### 6. Testing and Verification

*   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., `go vet`, `gosec`) to identify potential vulnerabilities in your code.  These tools can detect unsafe string concatenation and other risky patterns.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  Use fuzzing tools to automatically generate a wide range of inputs and test your application for unexpected behavior.  This can help uncover template injection vulnerabilities that might be missed by manual testing.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing, simulating real-world attacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
*   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review all code that handles user input and interacts with template engines.  Look for potential injection points.
*   **Unit and Integration Tests:**  Write unit and integration tests that specifically target template rendering with malicious inputs.  Verify that the output is correctly escaped.  Example:

    ```go
    func TestTemplateEscaping(t *testing.T) {
    	tmpl, _ := template.New("test").Parse("<h1>Hello, {{ .Name }}!</h1>")
    	var buf bytes.Buffer
    	data := struct{ Name string }{Name: "<script>alert(1)</script>"}
    	tmpl.Execute(&buf, data)
    	expected := "<h1>Hello, &lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;!</h1>"
    	if buf.String() != expected {
    		t.Errorf("Expected '%s', got '%s'", expected, buf.String())
    	}
    }
    ```

### 7. Fiber-Specific Considerations

*   **Fiber's `c.Render()`:** Fiber provides a convenient `c.Render()` function for rendering templates.  Ensure you're using it correctly with a properly configured template engine (preferably `html/template`).
*   **Middleware:**  You can use Fiber middleware to globally enforce security policies like CSP.
*   **Error Handling:**  Properly handle errors during template parsing and execution.  Don't leak sensitive information in error messages.
*   **Third-Party Template Engines:** If you choose to use a template engine other than `html/template`, thoroughly research its security features and ensure it provides adequate protection against template injection.  Read the documentation carefully and look for security advisories.

### Conclusion

Template injection is a serious vulnerability that can have devastating consequences.  By understanding the mechanisms of this attack, using secure coding practices (especially auto-escaping template engines like `html/template`), implementing defense-in-depth measures like CSP, and rigorously testing your application, you can effectively mitigate the risk of template injection in your Fiber applications.  Always prioritize security and stay up-to-date on the latest security best practices.
