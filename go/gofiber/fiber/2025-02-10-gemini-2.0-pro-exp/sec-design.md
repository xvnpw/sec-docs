Okay, let's create a design document for the Fiber web framework, keeping in mind its use for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Fiber is a web framework, and its primary business goal is to provide a fast, flexible, and easy-to-use platform for developers to build web applications and APIs.  The success of Fiber hinges on its adoption by the developer community, which in turn depends on its performance, ease of use, and perceived security.

Business Priorities:

*   Performance:  Fiber's core value proposition is speed and efficiency.  It must outperform or at least match competing frameworks.
*   Ease of Use:  A simple, intuitive API and clear documentation are crucial for attracting and retaining users.
*   Flexibility:  The framework should be adaptable to various use cases, from simple APIs to more complex web applications.
*   Community Growth:  A thriving community provides support, contributes to development, and promotes the framework.
*   Maintainability: The codebase should be maintainable and extensible to allow for future growth and feature additions.

Business Risks:

*   Competition:  The web framework landscape is crowded.  Fiber needs to differentiate itself and maintain a competitive edge.
*   Security Vulnerabilities:  Vulnerabilities in the framework could expose applications built with Fiber to attacks, damaging its reputation and adoption. This is the most important risk.
*   Lack of Adoption:  If developers don't find Fiber useful or easy to use, it won't gain traction.
*   Maintenance Burden:  If the codebase becomes too complex or difficult to maintain, development could stall.
*   Dependency Issues:  Vulnerabilities or breaking changes in Fiber's dependencies could impact the framework and applications built on it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Fiber, being a web framework, acts as a foundational component for web applications. Therefore, its security posture is paramount. It needs to provide secure defaults and mechanisms for developers to build secure applications.

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Middleware Support: Fiber's middleware architecture allows developers to implement security controls like authentication, authorization, and input validation. (Described in Fiber documentation and examples).
*   security control: Context Handling: Fiber's `Ctx` object provides methods for securely handling requests and responses, including setting secure headers and managing cookies. (Described in Fiber documentation).
*   security control: Routing: Fiber's router allows for defining specific routes and associating them with handlers, enabling granular control over access. (Described in Fiber documentation).
*   security control: Community Scrutiny: Being open-source, Fiber benefits from community scrutiny, which can help identify and address security vulnerabilities. (Visible on GitHub).
*   security control: Dependency Management: Fiber uses Go modules, which helps manage dependencies and their security. (Visible in `go.mod` file).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Developer Misuse: While Fiber provides security features, developers can still write insecure code using the framework. This is a common risk with any framework.
*   accepted risk: Zero-Day Vulnerabilities: Like any software, Fiber may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Ecosystem security: Fiber ecosystem might contain security vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular internal and external security audits of the Fiber codebase.
*   security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Program: Establish a clear process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Security-Focused Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation and examples on how to use Fiber securely.
*   security control: Automated Security Testing: Integrate security testing tools (SAST, DAST, IAST) into the development pipeline.
*   security control: Dependency Scanning: Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Supply Chain Security: Implement measures to ensure the integrity of the Fiber supply chain.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Fiber should provide or facilitate mechanisms for:
    *   Securely handling user credentials.
    *   Supporting various authentication methods (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
    *   Protecting against common authentication attacks (e.g., brute-force, credential stuffing).
*   Authorization: Fiber should provide or facilitate mechanisms for:
    *   Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) or other authorization models.
    *   Enforcing access control policies consistently.
    *   Protecting against unauthorized access to resources.
*   Input Validation: Fiber should provide or facilitate mechanisms for:
    *   Validating all user input against strict rules.
    *   Sanitizing input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks.
    *   Handling different data types appropriately.
*   Cryptography: Fiber should provide or facilitate mechanisms for:
    *   Using strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    *   Securely managing cryptographic keys.
    *   Protecting sensitive data in transit and at rest.
    *   Supporting HTTPS by default.

## BUILD

The build process for a Fiber application typically involves the following steps:

1.  Developer writes code and commits to a version control system (e.g., Git).
2.  A Continuous Integration (CI) system (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI) detects the changes.
3.  The CI system checks out the code.
4.  The CI system runs linters and static analysis tools (e.g., `go vet`, `staticcheck`).
5.  The CI system runs unit tests and integration tests.
6.  The CI system builds the application using `go build`.
7.  The CI system builds a Docker image containing the compiled application.
8.  The CI system pushes the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry).
9.  The CI system might trigger a deployment to a staging or production environment.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer("Developer") --> Git("Git Repository")
    Git --> CI("CI System\n(e.g., GitHub Actions)")
    CI --> Linter("Linter\n(go vet, staticcheck)")
    CI --> Tests("Tests\n(Unit, Integration)")
    CI --> GoBuild("go build")
    GoBuild --> Binary("Application Binary")
    CI --> DockerBuild("Docker Build")
    Binary --> DockerBuild
    DockerBuild --> DockerImage("Docker Image")
    DockerImage --> ContainerRegistry("Container Registry")

```

Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   security control: Code Review: All code changes should be reviewed by another developer before merging.
*   security control: Static Analysis: Use static analysis tools to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: Dependency Scanning: Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Analyze the software supply chain for vulnerabilities and compliance issues.
*   security control: Container Scanning: Scan the Docker image for vulnerabilities before pushing it to the registry.
*   security control: Least Privilege: The CI system should have the minimum necessary permissions.
*   security control: Secret Management: Secrets (e.g., API keys, database credentials) should be securely managed and not hardcoded in the codebase or CI configuration.
