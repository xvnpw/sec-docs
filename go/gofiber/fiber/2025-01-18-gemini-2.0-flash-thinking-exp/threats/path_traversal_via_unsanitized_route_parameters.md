### 4. Deep Analysis of Path Traversal via Unsanitized Route Parameters

#### 4.1 Understanding the Vulnerability

The core of this vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of route parameters before they are used to construct file paths or access resources. Fiber's router efficiently extracts parameters from the URL, making them readily available to the application's route handlers. However, Fiber itself does not automatically sanitize these parameters for security vulnerabilities like path traversal.

**How it works:**

1. A Fiber route is defined with a parameter, for example: `/files/:filename`.
2. An attacker crafts a malicious URL, replacing the expected filename with a path traversal sequence, such as `/files/../../../../etc/passwd`.
3. The Fiber router extracts the value `../../../../etc/passwd` and makes it available as the `filename` parameter.
4. If the application code directly uses this unsanitized `filename` parameter to construct a file path (e.g., `os.ReadFile("./uploads/" + filename)`), the attacker's malicious path is used.
5. Instead of accessing a file within the intended `./uploads/` directory, the application attempts to access the file at `/etc/passwd`, potentially exposing sensitive system information.

#### 4.2 Fiber's Role and Responsibility

Fiber's router is responsible for parsing the URL and extracting the route parameters. It provides a convenient mechanism for accessing these parameters within the route handlers. However, **Fiber does not inherently sanitize or validate these parameters for security vulnerabilities.** This responsibility falls squarely on the application developer.

The ease of accessing route parameters in Fiber can inadvertently lead to vulnerabilities if developers are not security-conscious and directly use these parameters in file system operations without proper checks.

#### 4.3 Attack Vectors and Scenarios

Several scenarios can illustrate how this vulnerability can be exploited:

* **Direct File Access:** A route like `/download/:filename` intended to download files from a specific directory could be exploited to download arbitrary files from the server's file system.
* **Template Injection (Indirect):** If route parameters are used to select templates or include files, an attacker might be able to include arbitrary files, potentially leading to server-side template injection if the included file contains executable code.
* **Configuration File Access:** Attackers might target configuration files containing sensitive information like database credentials or API keys.
* **Log File Access:** Accessing log files could reveal valuable information about the application's behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

**Example Vulnerable Code Snippet (Conceptual):**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	app := fiber.New()

	app.Get("/files/:filename", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
		filename := c.Params("filename")
		filePath := fmt.Sprintf("./uploads/%s", filename) // Vulnerable: Direct concatenation

		content, err := os.ReadFile(filePath)
		if err != nil {
			return c.Status(fiber.StatusInternalServerError).SendString("Error reading file")
		}
		return c.SendString(string(content))
	})

	app.Listen(":3000")
}
```

In this example, if an attacker sends a request to `/files/../../../../etc/passwd`, the `filePath` will become `./uploads/../../../../etc/passwd`, which resolves to `/etc/passwd`.

#### 4.4 Impact Assessment

A successful path traversal attack can have severe consequences:

* **Information Disclosure:**  Access to sensitive files like configuration files, database credentials, source code, or user data.
* **Data Manipulation:** In some cases, if the attacker can traverse to writable directories, they might be able to upload or modify files, potentially leading to defacement or further compromise.
* **Service Disruption:** Accessing and potentially corrupting critical system files could lead to application or server instability and denial of service.
* **Remote Code Execution (Indirect):** While direct code execution might be less common with path traversal alone, accessing executable files or configuration files that are later interpreted could lead to indirect code execution.

The **Critical** risk severity assigned to this threat is justified due to the potential for significant impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

#### 4.5 Evaluation of Mitigation Strategies

The provided mitigation strategies are crucial for preventing this vulnerability:

* **Thoroughly sanitize and validate all route parameters:** This is the most fundamental mitigation. Techniques include:
    * **Allow Listing:**  Only allow specific, known-good characters or patterns in the parameter.
    * **Deny Listing:**  Remove or reject known malicious sequences like `../`.
    * **Canonicalization:**  Convert the path to its canonical form to resolve relative paths and identify malicious sequences. The `path/filepath` package in Go provides functions like `filepath.Clean` which can be very effective.
* **Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct file paths:**  Instead of directly concatenating user input, use safer methods like:
    * **Indexing:** Map user-provided input to predefined safe file names or identifiers.
    * **UUIDs or Hashes:** Use unique identifiers in URLs and map them internally to the actual file paths.
* **Use secure file access methods that restrict access to specific directories:**  Ensure that the application only has the necessary permissions to access the intended directories. Avoid running the application with overly permissive user accounts.
* **Consider using unique identifiers instead of file names in URLs and map them internally:** This completely abstracts the actual file path from the user input, eliminating the possibility of path traversal.

**Example Secure Code Snippet (Conceptual):**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	app := fiber.New()

	allowedExtensions := []string{".txt", ".pdf"} // Example allow list

	app.Get("/files/:filename", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
		filename := c.Params("filename")

		// Sanitize and validate the filename
		if strings.Contains(filename, "..") {
			return c.Status(fiber.StatusBadRequest).SendString("Invalid filename")
		}

		ext := filepath.Ext(filename)
		isValidExtension := false
		for _, allowedExt := range allowedExtensions {
			if ext == allowedExt {
				isValidExtension = true
				break
			}
		}
		if !isValidExtension {
			return c.Status(fiber.StatusBadRequest).SendString("Invalid file extension")
		}

		// Construct the file path securely
		filePath := filepath.Join("./uploads", filepath.Clean(filename))

		content, err := os.ReadFile(filePath)
		if err != nil {
			return c.Status(fiber.StatusInternalServerError).SendString("Error reading file")
		}
		return c.SendString(string(content))
	})

	app.Listen(":3000")
}
```

This improved example includes basic sanitization by checking for `..` and validates the file extension against an allow list. It also uses `filepath.Join` and `filepath.Clean` for safer path construction.

#### 4.6 Detection Strategies

Identifying this vulnerability requires a combination of techniques:

* **Code Reviews:** Manually reviewing the code, especially route handlers that deal with file system operations, is crucial. Look for direct usage of route parameters in file path construction.
* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** SAST tools can analyze the codebase and identify potential path traversal vulnerabilities by detecting patterns of unsanitized input used in file system calls.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** DAST tools can simulate attacks by sending malicious requests with path traversal sequences to identify vulnerable endpoints.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Engaging security professionals to perform manual penetration testing can uncover vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.

#### 4.7 Prevention Best Practices

To effectively prevent path traversal vulnerabilities in Fiber applications:

* **Adopt a Security-First Mindset:**  Consider security implications during the design and development phases.
* **Input Validation is Key:**  Treat all user input, including route parameters, as potentially malicious.
* **Implement Robust Sanitization:**  Use appropriate sanitization techniques based on the expected input and context.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant the application only the necessary file system permissions.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular code reviews and security testing to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.
* **Stay Updated:** Keep Fiber and its dependencies updated to benefit from security patches.
