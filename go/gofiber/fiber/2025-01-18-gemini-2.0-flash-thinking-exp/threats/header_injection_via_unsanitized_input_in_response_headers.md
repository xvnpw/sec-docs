### 4. Deep Analysis of Header Injection via Unsanitized Input in Response Headers

#### 4.1. Mechanism of Attack

The core of this vulnerability lies in the ability of an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the server's response. This is achieved when user-provided input, without proper sanitization, is directly used to set response headers.

**How it works:**

* **Vulnerable Code:**  A developer might use Fiber's `c.Set()` or similar methods to set a header value based on user input, for example:

   ```go
   app.Get("/search", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
       searchTerm := c.Query("q")
       c.Set("X-Search-Term", searchTerm) // Potentially vulnerable
       return c.SendString("Search results for: " + searchTerm)
   })
   ```

* **Malicious Input:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL like:

   ```
   /search?q=value%0D%0ALocation:%20https://evil.com%0D%0A
   ```

   Here, `%0D%0A` represents the URL-encoded carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`), which are used to separate HTTP headers.

* **Injected Headers:** When the server processes this request, the `searchTerm` variable will contain `value\r\nLocation: https://evil.com\r\n`. If `c.Set()` is used directly, the server will send the following headers:

   ```
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   ...
   X-Search-Term: value
   Location: https://evil.com
   ...
   ```

   The attacker has successfully injected the `Location` header, potentially redirecting the user to a malicious site.

#### 4.2. Impact in Detail

The impact of successful header injection can be significant and multifaceted:

* **HTTP Response Splitting:** This is the most direct consequence. By injecting `\r\n\r\n`, an attacker can terminate the current response and start a new one. This allows them to control the content of subsequent responses, potentially leading to:
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious JavaScript code within the attacker-controlled response.
    * **Cache Poisoning:**  Causing intermediary caches (like CDNs or browser caches) to store the attacker's malicious response, serving it to other users.
* **Cache Poisoning:** Even without full response splitting, injecting specific cache-related headers (e.g., `Cache-Control`, `Expires`) can manipulate how caches store and serve the response. This can lead to:
    * **Serving Stale Content:**  Forcing users to see outdated information.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Causing excessive cache misses and overloading the server.
    * **Serving Malicious Content:**  If the injected headers cause the cache to store a response with malicious content.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** While often a result of response splitting, XSS can also occur if injected headers directly influence how the browser interprets the response. For example, injecting `Content-Type: text/html` when the actual content is plain text could lead to the browser executing the content as HTML.
* **Session Hijacking:** In some scenarios, attackers might be able to inject headers that manipulate session cookies or other authentication mechanisms, potentially leading to session hijacking.
* **Information Disclosure:** Injecting headers that reveal sensitive information about the server or application.

#### 4.3. Fiber-Specific Considerations

While the underlying vulnerability is a general web security issue, certain aspects of Fiber can influence its likelihood and impact:

* **Direct Header Manipulation:** Fiber's `c.Set()` and similar methods provide direct access to setting response headers. While powerful, this requires developers to be vigilant about sanitizing input.
* **No Built-in Sanitization:** Fiber does not automatically sanitize input used for setting headers. This responsibility falls entirely on the developer.
* **Middleware Potential:** Middleware functions in Fiber can also be vulnerable if they process user input and set headers without proper sanitization.
* **Common Use Cases:** Scenarios where user input might be used in headers include:
    * Setting custom tracking headers.
    * Implementing content negotiation based on user preferences.
    * Setting cache-related headers dynamically.

#### 4.4. Real-World Scenarios

Consider these examples of how this vulnerability could manifest in a Fiber application:

* **Personalized Greeting:** An application sets a header like `X-Greeting: Hello, [username]` where `username` is taken from user input. A malicious user could inject control characters to add more headers.
* **Dynamic Cache Control:** An application uses user input to determine caching behavior, setting headers like `Cache-Control: max-age=[duration]`. An attacker could inject headers to bypass caching or poison the cache.
* **Content Negotiation:** An application uses a user-provided language preference to set the `Content-Language` header. An attacker could inject headers to manipulate the response.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The following mitigation strategies should be implemented to prevent header injection vulnerabilities in Fiber applications:

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** This is the most crucial step.
    * **Identify Potential Injection Points:**  Carefully review all code where user-provided input is used to set response headers.
    * **Sanitize Control Characters:**  Remove or encode characters like carriage returns (`\r`, `%0D`) and line feeds (`\n`, `%0A`) from user input before using it in header values.
    * **Use Allow Lists:** If possible, define a set of allowed characters or patterns for header values and reject any input that doesn't conform.
    * **Contextual Escaping:**  While less common for headers, understand the context in which the header is used and escape accordingly if necessary.
* **Avoid Directly Using User Input in Header Values:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly incorporating user input into header values. Instead:
    * **Use Predefined Values:**  If the header value can be chosen from a limited set of options, use a mapping or lookup table to select the appropriate value based on the user input.
    * **Indirectly Derive Header Values:**  Process user input to determine a specific behavior or setting, and then use server-side logic to set the corresponding header value securely.
* **Leverage Fiber's Built-in Methods Carefully:** While `c.Set()` is necessary, be mindful of its potential for abuse.
    * **Review Usage:**  Scrutinize all instances where `c.Set()` and similar methods are used with user input.
    * **Consider Alternatives:**  Explore if there are alternative ways to achieve the desired functionality without directly using user input in headers.
* **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct mitigation for header injection, a properly configured CSP can help mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks that might result from response splitting.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities, including header injection flaws.
* **Security Training for Developers:**  Educate developers about the risks of header injection and secure coding practices for handling user input.
* **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious requests that attempt to inject headers. However, relying solely on a WAF is not a substitute for secure coding practices.

#### 4.6. Detection and Prevention

Identifying and preventing header injection vulnerabilities requires a multi-pronged approach:

* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**  Tools can analyze the source code to identify potential injection points where user input is used to set headers without proper sanitization.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Tools can simulate attacks by sending crafted requests with malicious header values to identify vulnerabilities in a running application.
* **Manual Code Review:**  Careful manual review of the codebase, especially the sections dealing with header manipulation, is crucial.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Engaging security professionals to perform penetration testing can help uncover vulnerabilities that might be missed by automated tools.
* **Secure Development Practices:**  Integrating security considerations throughout the development lifecycle, including threat modeling and secure coding guidelines.
