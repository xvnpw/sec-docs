#### 4.1. Exploit Template Engine Vulnerabilities -> Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)

**Understanding Template Engines in Fiber:**

Fiber itself doesn't have a built-in templating engine. Instead, it provides an interface to integrate with various Go templating libraries. This flexibility allows developers to choose the engine that best suits their needs. Common choices include:

* **`html/template` (Standard Library):**  A basic and widely used template engine.
* **`github.com/CloudyKit/jet`:** A fast and powerful template engine with features like template inheritance.
* **`github.com/valyala/fasttemplate`:**  A very fast but less feature-rich template engine primarily for string interpolation.

**The Core of SSTI:**

Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) occurs when user-controlled data is directly embedded into a template that is then processed by the template engine on the server. If the template engine doesn't properly sanitize or escape this user input, it can be interpreted as template directives or code, leading to unintended execution.

**How it Relates to Fiber:**

In a Fiber application, developers typically pass data to the template engine through the `c.Render()` function (or similar functions provided by the chosen template engine integration). If user input is included in this data without proper sanitization, it becomes a potential SSTI vulnerability.

**Example Scenario (Conceptual using `html/template`):**

Imagine a Fiber route that displays a personalized greeting:

```go
app.Get("/greet", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    name := c.Query("name")
    return c.Render("greet", fiber.Map{
        "Greeting": "Hello, " + name + "!",
    })
})
```

And the `greet.html` template:

```html
<h1>{{.Greeting}}</h1>
```

If an attacker crafts a malicious URL like `/greet?name={{ .Payload }}` and the template engine doesn't escape the `name` parameter, the `{{ .Payload }}` could be interpreted as a template directive.

#### 4.2. Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) -> Execute arbitrary code on the server

**The Power of Template Engines:**

Many template engines, especially the more feature-rich ones, allow for more than just simple variable substitution. They often support:

* **Logic and Control Flow:**  Conditional statements (`if`, `else`), loops (`range`).
* **Function Calls:**  Invoking built-in or custom functions within the template.
* **Access to Object Properties and Methods:**  Navigating data structures passed to the template.

**Exploiting these Features:**

Attackers can leverage these features to inject malicious code. The specific syntax and capabilities depend on the template engine being used.

**Examples of Malicious Payloads (Conceptual):**

* **Using `html/template` (less powerful for direct code execution but can be chained):**  While `html/template` is generally safer due to its auto-escaping by default, vulnerabilities can arise if developers explicitly disable escaping or use unsafe functions. More commonly, attackers might try to leak information or cause denial of service.

* **Using `github.com/CloudyKit/jet` (more powerful):**  Jet allows for more complex expressions and function calls. An attacker might try to execute system commands or access sensitive data using built-in functions or by manipulating the execution context. For instance, they might try to access global variables or call functions that interact with the operating system.

**The Execution Context:**

The key to understanding the severity of SSTI is realizing that the template engine executes on the server. Any code injected and interpreted by the engine runs with the same privileges as the web application process.

**Mechanism of Arbitrary Code Execution:**

1. **Injection:** The attacker injects malicious template code into a vulnerable input field (e.g., query parameter, form field, header).
2. **Processing:** The Fiber application receives the request and passes the user-controlled data to the template engine.
3. **Interpretation:** The template engine, if not properly configured, interprets the malicious input as template directives or code.
4. **Execution:** The template engine executes the injected code on the server.

**Consequences of Successful Code Execution:**

Once an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, the possibilities for damage are extensive:

* **Full System Compromise:** The attacker can gain complete control over the server, potentially installing backdoors, creating new user accounts, and pivoting to other systems on the network.
* **Data Breaches:**  The attacker can access sensitive data stored on the server, including databases, configuration files, and user credentials.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can execute commands that consume server resources, causing the application to become unavailable.
* **Malware Deployment:** The attacker can upload and execute malware on the server.
* **Lateral Movement:** If the server has access to other internal systems, the attacker can use it as a stepping stone to compromise those systems.

#### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies for SSTI in Fiber Applications

Preventing SSTI is crucial for the security of Fiber applications. Here are key mitigation strategies:

* **Input Sanitization and Escaping:**
    * **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  Always escape user input based on the context where it will be used (HTML, JavaScript, URL). Most template engines provide built-in mechanisms for this.
    * **Avoid Raw Output:**  Be extremely cautious when using functions or directives that output raw, unescaped content.
    * **Strict Input Validation:**  Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and doesn't contain potentially malicious characters or patterns.

* **Use Logic-less Template Engines:**
    * Consider using template engines that have limited or no support for complex logic and code execution within templates. This reduces the attack surface significantly.

* **Sandboxing and Secure Template Environments:**
    * If using a powerful template engine, explore options for sandboxing or creating restricted execution environments for templates. This can limit the impact of successful injection.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * Ensure the web application process runs with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve code execution.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential SSTI vulnerabilities and other security weaknesses.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * While not a direct mitigation for SSTI, a properly configured CSP can help limit the impact of successful exploitation by restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources.

* **Fiber-Specific Considerations:**
    * **Careful Use of `fiber.Map`:** When passing data to the template engine using `fiber.Map`, ensure that user-controlled data is properly sanitized before being included.
    * **Secure Configuration of Template Engine:**  Review the documentation for the chosen template engine and configure it with security best practices in mind (e.g., enabling auto-escaping where appropriate).
    * **Avoid Passing Sensitive Objects Directly:**  Be cautious about passing entire database models or other sensitive objects directly to the template. Only pass the necessary data.

**Example of Mitigation (Conceptual):**

Modifying the previous example to sanitize the input:

```go
import "html"

app.Get("/greet", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    name := html.EscapeString(c.Query("name")) // Sanitize the input
    return c.Render("greet", fiber.Map{
        "Greeting": "Hello, " + name + "!",
    })
})
```

By using `html.EscapeString`, any potentially malicious HTML characters in the `name` parameter will be escaped, preventing them from being interpreted as template directives.

### 5. Conclusion

Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) is a critical vulnerability that can have severe consequences for Fiber applications. By understanding the attack vector, mechanism, and potential impact, development teams can implement effective mitigation strategies. Prioritizing secure coding practices, proper input sanitization, and careful configuration of template engines are essential steps in preventing SSTI and protecting the application and its users. Regular security assessments and staying updated on the latest security best practices are also crucial for maintaining a secure Fiber application.
