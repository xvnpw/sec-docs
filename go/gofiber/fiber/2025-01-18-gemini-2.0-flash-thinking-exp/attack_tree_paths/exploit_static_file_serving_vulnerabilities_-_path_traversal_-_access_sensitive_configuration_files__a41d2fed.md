### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

**Attack Tree Path:** Exploit Static File Serving Vulnerabilities -> Path Traversal -> Access sensitive configuration files or application code

**4.1 Stage 1: Exploit Static File Serving Vulnerabilities**

* **Detailed Explanation:** Fiber, like many web frameworks, provides functionality to serve static files such as images, CSS, JavaScript, etc., directly to the client. This is typically done for performance reasons, offloading the task from the application logic. The vulnerability arises when the application relies on user-provided input (the requested file path) without proper validation and sanitization to determine which file to serve.

* **Fiber's Role:** Fiber offers middleware like `fiber.Static` to handle static file serving. Developers configure this middleware with a root directory from which static files should be served. The core issue is that if the application doesn't implement sufficient checks, an attacker can manipulate the requested path to navigate outside this intended root directory.

* **Vulnerability Point:** The primary vulnerability lies in the lack of robust input validation and sanitization of the requested file path before it's used to locate the file on the server's filesystem. If the `fiber.Static` middleware or the application logic doesn't prevent path traversal characters, the attack can proceed.

**4.2 Stage 2: Path Traversal**

* **Detailed Explanation:** Path traversal (also known as directory traversal) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to access files and directories that are located outside the web server's root directory. This is achieved by manipulating file paths using special characters like `..` (dot-dot-slash), which represents the parent directory.

* **Mechanism in Fiber Context:** An attacker crafts HTTP requests targeting the static file serving endpoint. These requests contain manipulated file paths designed to navigate up the directory structure.

    * **Example Attack Request:**
        ```
        GET /static/../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
        Host: vulnerable-app.com
        ```
        In this example, assuming the static file root is `/public`, the `../../../../` sequence attempts to navigate four levels up from `/public` to reach the root directory (`/`) and then access the `/etc/passwd` file.

    * **Variations:** Attackers might also use URL encoding (`%2e%2e%2f`) or other techniques to bypass basic filtering attempts. They might also target specific configuration files they know exist, like `.env` files, database configuration files, or application configuration files.

* **Fiber's Handling (Potential Weakness):** If the `fiber.Static` middleware directly uses the provided path to construct the file system path without proper checks, it will follow the attacker's traversal instructions. A vulnerable configuration might look something like this:

    ```go
    app.Static("/", "./public") // Serving static files from the 'public' directory
    ```

    Without additional security measures, a request for `/static/../../sensitive.conf` could potentially access a file outside the intended `./public` directory.

**4.3 Stage 3: Access Sensitive Configuration Files or Application Code**

* **Detailed Explanation:**  Successful path traversal allows the attacker to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server. The impact of this depends on the sensitivity of the accessible files.

* **Targeted Files:** Attackers often target:
    * **Configuration Files:** Files like `.env`, `config.yaml`, `database.ini`, etc., which may contain database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information.
    * **Application Source Code:** Accessing source code can reveal business logic, security vulnerabilities, and internal implementation details, which can be used for further attacks.
    * **Private Keys and Certificates:**  Compromising these can lead to impersonation and decryption of sensitive communications.
    * **Log Files:** While sometimes less critical, log files can reveal user activity, internal errors, and potentially sensitive data.

* **Impact:**
    * **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive information is exposed to unauthorized individuals.
    * **Credential Compromise:** Database credentials, API keys, and other secrets can be stolen, leading to further unauthorized access.
    * **Intellectual Property Theft:** Accessing source code can lead to the theft of valuable intellectual property.
    * **Further Attacks:**  Information gained from configuration files or source code can be used to launch more sophisticated attacks.
    * **Reputation Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the reputation and trust of the application and the organization.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies

To prevent this attack path in Fiber applications, developers should implement the following mitigation strategies:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Strictly validate the requested file path:**  Ensure the path does not contain any path traversal sequences like `..`, `./`, or absolute paths.
    * **Use allow-listing:** Instead of trying to block malicious patterns, define a set of allowed characters and patterns for file names.
    * **Canonicalization:** Convert the requested path to its canonical (absolute and normalized) form and compare it against the allowed paths. This helps prevent bypasses using URL encoding or other techniques.

* **Restricting Access:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only serve the necessary static files. Avoid serving the entire application directory or sensitive configuration directories.
    * **Dedicated Static File Directory:**  Store static files in a dedicated directory separate from application code and configuration files.
    * **Web Server Configuration:** Configure the web server (if used in front of Fiber) to restrict access to sensitive directories.

* **Secure Configuration of `fiber.Static`:**
    * **Carefully define the `Root` directory:** Ensure it points to the intended directory for serving static files and nothing more.
    * **Consider using `Next` middleware:** Implement custom middleware before `fiber.Static` to perform stricter validation and sanitization of the requested path.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Periodically assess the application for vulnerabilities, including path traversal issues.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF that can detect and block path traversal attempts based on known patterns and anomalies.

* **Avoid Exposing Sensitive Files:**  Never store sensitive configuration files or application code within the static file serving directory.

**Example of Secure Implementation (Illustrative):**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
	"strings"

	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
)

func main() {
	app := fiber.New()

	staticRoot := "./public" // Define the allowed static file root

	app.Use("/static", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
		requestedPath := c.Path()[len("/static"):] // Get the path after /static

		// 1. Basic Sanitization (Remove leading/trailing slashes)
		requestedPath = strings.Trim(requestedPath, "/")

		// 2. Prevent Path Traversal (Check for "..")
		if strings.Contains(requestedPath, "..") {
			return c.SendStatus(http.StatusBadRequest)
		}

		// 3. Construct the absolute path
		absPath := filepath.Join(staticRoot, requestedPath)

		// 4. Check if the resolved path is still within the allowed root
		if !strings.HasPrefix(absPath, filepath.Clean(staticRoot)+string(os.PathSeparator)) {
			return c.SendStatus(http.StatusBadRequest)
		}

		// Serve the file if it exists and is within the allowed root
		return c.Next()
	}, fiber.Static(staticRoot))

	app.Get("/", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
		return c.SendString("Hello, World!")
	})

	app.Listen(":3000")
}
```

**Note:** This is a simplified example. Real-world implementations might require more sophisticated validation and error handling. Consider using established security libraries for path sanitization.

### 6. Conclusion

By understanding the mechanics of this attack and the potential weaknesses in application configuration and framework usage, developers can implement robust mitigation strategies. Prioritizing input validation, restricting access, and following secure configuration practices are crucial steps in preventing this type of vulnerability and protecting sensitive data. Regular security assessments and the use of WAFs can provide additional layers of defense.
