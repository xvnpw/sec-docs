### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Response Splitting

**Attack Tree Path:** Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities -> Header Injection -> Response Splitting

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious data, specifically newline characters (`\r\n`), into HTTP headers that are later used in the response.

**Mechanism:** By injecting these characters, the attacker can trick the server into sending multiple HTTP responses within a single connection.

**Impact:** This can lead to various attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS) by injecting malicious scripts in the injected headers, cache poisoning by manipulating the cached response, and session hijacking by setting malicious cookies.

#### 4.1 Detailed Breakdown of the Attack

1. **Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities:** This is the initial stage where the attacker identifies a weakness in how the Fiber application processes incoming HTTP requests. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the application's failure to properly sanitize or validate data that is used to construct HTTP response headers.

2. **Header Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request containing carefully crafted input designed to be incorporated into a response header. This input includes the control characters `\r` (Carriage Return) and `\n` (Line Feed). The sequence `\r\n` signifies the end of an HTTP header. By injecting two such sequences (`\r\n\r\n`), the attacker can effectively terminate the current set of headers and begin a new HTTP response within the same connection.

   **Example Malicious Input:**

   Imagine a Fiber application that dynamically sets a custom header based on user input, like a referral link:

   ```go
   app.Get("/redirect", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
       ref := c.Query("ref")
       c.Set("X-Custom-Referer", ref) // Potential vulnerability
       return c.SendString("Redirecting...")
   })
   ```

   An attacker could craft a URL like this:

   ```
   /redirect?ref=malicious%0d%0aContent-Type:%20text/html%0d%0a%0d%0a<script>alert('XSS')</script>
   ```

   Here, `%0d` represents `\r` and `%0a` represents `\n`.

3. **Response Splitting:** When the Fiber application processes the malicious request, it incorporates the attacker's input into the HTTP response headers. The injected `\r\n\r\n` sequence causes the server to interpret the subsequent data as the beginning of a new HTTP response.

   **Resulting HTTP Response (Simplified):**

   ```
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
   X-Custom-Referer: malicious
   Content-Type: text/html

   <script>alert('XSS')</script>
   Redirecting...
   ```

   The browser, upon receiving this response, might interpret the part after the injected `\r\n\r\n` as a separate HTTP response.

#### 4.2 Impact Scenarios in Detail

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  As demonstrated in the example above, the attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code within the injected headers. When the browser processes the response, it might execute this script in the context of the application's origin, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions. This is particularly dangerous if the injected script is part of a new HTML document injected via the response splitting.

* **Cache Poisoning:**  If a caching proxy server sits between the user and the Fiber application, the attacker can manipulate the cached response. By injecting malicious headers, they can cause the proxy to cache a response containing malicious content. Subsequent users requesting the same resource will then receive the poisoned response from the cache, even if the original application is no longer serving the malicious content. This can lead to widespread XSS attacks or the distribution of misinformation.

* **Session Hijacking:**  The attacker can inject `Set-Cookie` headers to set their own malicious cookies on the user's browser. This could allow them to hijack the user's session if the injected cookie matches the session cookie name used by the application. Alternatively, they could overwrite existing cookies or set persistent tracking cookies.

#### 4.3 Fiber Framework Considerations

While Fiber itself provides mechanisms for setting headers, the vulnerability typically arises from how developers use these mechanisms and handle user input.

* **Directly Using User Input in `c.Set()`:**  If developers directly use unsanitized user input (from query parameters, request bodies, or other sources) as values for headers using `c.Set()`, they create a direct pathway for header injection.

* **Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization:**  The primary issue is the absence of proper validation and sanitization of user-provided data before it's used in header values.

* **Custom Header Logic:**  Complex logic for constructing headers based on user input increases the risk of overlooking potential injection points.

#### 4.4 Mitigation Strategies for Fiber Applications

To prevent response splitting vulnerabilities in Fiber applications, developers should implement the following strategies:

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided data before using it in HTTP headers. This includes:
    * **Rejecting or escaping newline characters (`\r` and `\n`).**
    * **Using allow-lists for expected characters.**
    * **Encoding special characters appropriately.**

* **Use Fiber's Built-in Header Handling Safely:**
    * **Avoid directly embedding user input into header values without sanitization.**
    * **Consider using predefined header values where possible.**

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks. CSP can restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, reducing the effectiveness of injected scripts.

* **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):** Enforce HTTPS to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks that could facilitate session hijacking.

* **Secure Flag for Cookies:**  Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript access and ensure cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS, respectively.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

* **Framework Updates:** Keep the Fiber framework and its dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches.

* **Leveraging Fiber's Context and Response Features:**  Utilize Fiber's context (`c *fiber.Ctx`) methods for setting headers in a controlled manner. Be mindful of how data flows into these methods.

* **Consider Middleware for Sanitization:**  Develop or use middleware to automatically sanitize specific header values or to detect and block requests containing suspicious characters.

#### 4.5 Example of Secure Header Setting in Fiber

```go
import (
	"net/http"
	"strings"

	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
)

func main() {
	app := fiber.New()

	app.Get("/secure-redirect", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
		ref := c.Query("ref")

		// Sanitize the input by removing newline characters
		sanitizedRef := strings.ReplaceAll(strings.ReplaceAll(ref, "\r", ""), "\n", "")

		// Set the header with the sanitized value
		c.Set("X-Safe-Referer", sanitizedRef)

		return c.SendString("Redirecting securely...")
	})

	app.Listen(":3000")
}
```

In this example, the `strings.ReplaceAll` function is used to remove newline characters from the user-provided `ref` query parameter before setting the header. This prevents the attacker from injecting malicious characters.

### 5. Conclusion

Response splitting via header injection is a serious vulnerability that can have significant consequences for Fiber applications. By understanding the attack mechanism, potential impact, and implementing robust mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack. Prioritizing input validation, secure header handling, and leveraging security features like CSP and HSTS are crucial steps in building secure Fiber applications. Continuous vigilance and regular security assessments are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
