## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities -> Route Hijacking/Spoofing -> Bypass authentication or authorization checks](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities_-_route_hijackingspoofing_-_bypass_authentication_or_authorization_c_b274afea.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts HTTP requests with manipulated URL paths or HTTP methods that are not properly validated by the Fiber application's routing logic.

**Mechanism:** By carefully crafting the request, the attacker can trick the application into routing the request to an unintended endpoint or processing it with an incorrect HTTP verb.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms, gaining access to protected resources or functionalities without proper credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities -> Middleware Bypass -> Access protected resources without proper authorization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_middleware_vulnerabilities_-_middleware_bypass_-_access_protected_resources_without_proper_a_fd85b73a.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts specific requests that exploit weaknesses in the middleware pipeline, causing certain security middleware to be skipped or not executed.

**Mechanism:** This can occur due to logic errors in the middleware, incorrect ordering of middleware, or vulnerabilities in how Fiber handles middleware execution under certain conditions.

**Impact:** Bypassing middleware allows attackers to access resources or functionalities that are intended to be protected by the bypassed middleware, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities -> Logic errors leading to security breaches](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_middleware_vulnerabilities_-_logic_errors_leading_to_security_breaches.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Vulnerabilities exist within custom middleware functions written by the application developers.

**Mechanism:** These vulnerabilities can be due to insecure coding practices, flawed logic, or mishandling of user input within the middleware.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to various security breaches depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the middleware, including authentication bypass, authorization flaws, or data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities -> Header Injection -> Response Splitting](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities_-_header_injection_-_response_splitting.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious data, specifically newline characters (`\r\n`), into HTTP headers that are later used in the response.

**Mechanism:** By injecting these characters, the attacker can trick the server into sending multiple HTTP responses within a single connection.

**Impact:** This can lead to various attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS) by injecting malicious scripts in the injected headers, cache poisoning by manipulating the cached response, and session hijacking by setting malicious cookies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Static File Serving Vulnerabilities -> Path Traversal -> Access sensitive configuration files or application code](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_static_file_serving_vulnerabilities_-_path_traversal_-_access_sensitive_configuration_files__a41d2fed.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts requests with manipulated file paths containing ".." sequences or other path traversal characters.

**Mechanism:** If the Fiber application is configured to serve static files and does not properly sanitize or validate the requested file paths, the attacker can navigate outside the intended static file directory.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to access sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files containing credentials, application source code, or other confidential data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Template Engine Vulnerabilities -> Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) -> Execute arbitrary code on the server](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_template_engine_vulnerabilities_-_server-side_template_injection__ssti__-_execute_arbitrary__1692357e.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious code or template expressions into input fields that are processed by the server-side template engine.

**Mechanism:** If the template engine is not properly configured to escape or sanitize user input, the injected code can be interpreted and executed by the server.

**Impact:** This is a critical vulnerability that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, and complete control over the application and server.
