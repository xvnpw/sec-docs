# Threat Model Analysis for gofiber/fiber

## Threat: [Route Hijacking due to Flexible Route Matching](./threats/route_hijacking_due_to_flexible_route_matching.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a request URL that, due to Fiber's flexible route matching (e.g., optional parameters, wildcards), unintentionally matches a more privileged or sensitive route than intended. This could allow the attacker to access functionality or data they are not authorized for. For example, a poorly defined route like `/users/:id` could potentially be matched by `/users/admin/settings` if not handled carefully.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, potential for privilege escalation.

**Affected Fiber Component:** Router (specifically the route matching logic).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Define specific and unambiguous routes.
* Use route parameters and constraints effectively to limit matching.
* Implement robust authorization middleware that checks permissions based on the matched route and potentially the request context.
* Avoid overly broad or ambiguous route definitions.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Unsanitized Route Parameters](./threats/path_traversal_via_unsanitized_route_parameters.md)

**Description:** If route parameters are used to construct file paths or access resources without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious sequences like `../` to access files or directories outside the intended scope. For example, a route like `/files/:filename` could be exploited if `filename` is not sanitized.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files or directories on the server, potential for information disclosure or even code execution if accessed files are executable.

**Affected Fiber Component:** Router (parameter extraction), any code using route parameters for file system operations.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly sanitize and validate all route parameters used in file system operations or resource access.
* Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct file paths.
* Use secure file access methods that restrict access to specific directories.
* Consider using unique identifiers instead of file names in URLs and map them internally.

## Threat: [Middleware Bypass due to Incorrect Ordering or Logic](./threats/middleware_bypass_due_to_incorrect_ordering_or_logic.md)

**Description:** If middleware functions are not ordered correctly or contain flawed logic, an attacker might be able to craft requests that bypass security checks or modifications intended by earlier middleware in the chain. For example, an authentication middleware placed after a middleware that processes potentially malicious input could be bypassed.

**Impact:** Security vulnerabilities like unauthorized access, data manipulation, or exposure of sensitive information.

**Affected Fiber Component:** Middleware chain, `app.Use()`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully design and order middleware functions.
* Thoroughly test the middleware chain to ensure each middleware function executes as expected and in the correct sequence.
* Ensure that essential security middleware (e.g., authentication, authorization, input validation) is placed early in the chain.

## Threat: [Header Injection via Unsanitized Input in Response Headers](./threats/header_injection_via_unsanitized_input_in_response_headers.md)

**Description:** If user-provided input is directly used to set response headers without proper sanitization (e.g., using `c.Set()`), an attacker could inject malicious headers. This can lead to vulnerabilities like HTTP response splitting, cache poisoning, or cross-site scripting (if the injected header influences how the browser interprets the response).

**Impact:** Potential for various client-side vulnerabilities, including XSS, cache poisoning, and session hijacking.

**Affected Fiber Component:** `c.Set()`, `c.Vary()`, and other methods for setting response headers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sanitize and validate all user-provided input before using it to set response headers.
* Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct header values.
* Use Fiber's built-in methods for setting headers carefully and be aware of potential injection points.

## Threat: [Lack of Built-in CSRF Protection](./threats/lack_of_built-in_csrf_protection.md)

**Description:** Fiber itself does not provide built-in Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. If developers do not implement CSRF protection, attackers can potentially trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on the application.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of legitimate users, potentially leading to data modification, financial loss, or other harmful consequences.

**Affected Fiber Component:** N/A (lack of a built-in feature).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement CSRF protection using a suitable middleware or library (e.g., a dedicated CSRF middleware).
* Ensure all state-changing requests are protected against CSRF attacks using techniques like synchronizer tokens.
