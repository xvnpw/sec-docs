# Threat Model Analysis for gofiber/fiber

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization via `c.BodyParser()`](./threats/insecure_deserialization_via__c_bodyparser___.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON or XML payload in the request body. When the application uses `c.BodyParser()` to automatically bind this data to a Go struct, the malicious payload can trigger the execution of arbitrary code or manipulate application state due to insecure deserialization practices within the framework's data binding mechanism. This exploits how Fiber handles the conversion of request body data into Go objects.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, data corruption, denial of service, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Affected Fiber Component:** `fiber.Ctx`, specifically the `BodyParser()` function.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input data *after* using `c.BodyParser()`, before using the bound data.
*   Avoid directly binding request bodies to complex structs, especially from untrusted sources. Consider using simpler structs for binding and then mapping to more complex types after validation.
*   Be extremely cautious when relying on default deserialization behavior for complex types. Consider custom deserialization logic with security in mind.
*   Regularly audit dependencies for known deserialization vulnerabilities that might be indirectly exploitable through Fiber's data binding.

## Threat: [Header Injection via `c.Get()` leading to Response Header Manipulation](./threats/header_injection_via__c_get____leading_to_response_header_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious characters (like newline characters `%0a` or `%0d`) into HTTP request headers. If the application uses `c.Get()` to retrieve these header values and then directly uses them to set response headers using Fiber's `c.Set()` or similar methods, the attacker can inject arbitrary headers into the response. This is a direct consequence of how Fiber allows setting response headers based on potentially attacker-controlled input.

**Impact:** Setting malicious cookies, redirecting users to attacker-controlled sites, cache poisoning, or bypassing security policies enforced by the browser or intermediary proxies.

**Affected Fiber Component:** `fiber.Ctx`, specifically the `Get()` and `Set()` functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize or validate all header values retrieved using `c.Get()` before using them in response headers. Specifically, strip out newline characters and other potentially harmful characters.
*   Avoid directly copying user-provided headers into response headers. If necessary, use a predefined allow-list of safe headers and values.
*   Utilize Fiber's built-in mechanisms for setting common security-related headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy) instead of manually constructing them from user input.

## Threat: [Middleware Bypass due to Flawed Fiber Middleware Logic](./threats/middleware_bypass_due_to_flawed_fiber_middleware_logic.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities exist within Fiber's own middleware handling logic or within built-in middleware components (if any such exist with security flaws). This could allow attackers to bypass intended security checks implemented via middleware. This is distinct from developer-introduced flaws in custom middleware; it focuses on potential vulnerabilities within the Fiber framework's middleware system itself.

**Impact:** Bypassing authentication or authorization checks, accessing restricted resources, or exploiting vulnerabilities that should have been mitigated by Fiber's middleware.

**Affected Fiber Component:** Fiber's middleware handling mechanism (`app.Use()`) and potentially specific built-in middleware components (if such exist with vulnerabilities).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep your Fiber framework version up-to-date to benefit from security patches and bug fixes in the middleware handling logic.
*   Carefully review the release notes and changelogs for Fiber updates to understand any security-related fixes.
*   Report any suspected vulnerabilities in Fiber's core middleware handling to the project maintainers.
*   While relying on community-vetted middleware is generally good practice, understand that vulnerabilities can exist even in well-regarded components. Regularly audit and update your dependencies.
