## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 1.2 Route Exhaustion (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_2_route_exhaustion__dos_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Sending an excessive number of requests with unique, dynamically generated routes to overwhelm the Fiber application's router.
  - **Vulnerability:** Potential lack of resource limits or efficient handling of a large number of unique routes in Fiber's routing mechanism.
  - **Impact:** Denial of Service, rendering the application unavailable to legitimate users.
  - **Estimations:** Likelihood: Low/Medium, Impact: High (DoS)

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 2.1 Malicious or Vulnerable Custom Middleware -> Inject Malicious Code](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_1_malicious_or_vulnerable_custom_middleware_-_inject_malicious_code.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within custom middleware developed for the Fiber application to inject and execute malicious code.
  - **Vulnerability:** Improper input handling, insecure dependencies, or other coding errors within the custom middleware.
  - **Impact:** Full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and more.
  - **Estimations:** Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 2.2 Bypass Security Middleware -> Exploit Order of Middleware Execution](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_2_bypass_security_middleware_-_exploit_order_of_middleware_execution.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Crafting requests that bypass security middleware due to an incorrect order of middleware registration in the Fiber application.
  - **Vulnerability:** Misconfiguration of the middleware pipeline, allowing requests to reach vulnerable handlers without proper security checks.
  - **Impact:** Circumvention of security controls, potentially leading to various other attacks being successful.
  - **Estimations:** Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 3.2.1 Denial of Service via Large Request Bodies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_2_1_denial_of_service_via_large_request_bodies.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Sending excessively large request bodies to overwhelm the Fiber application's resources during the body parsing process.
  - **Vulnerability:** Lack of proper limits on request body size within the Fiber application's configuration or middleware.
  - **Impact:** Denial of Service, making the application unresponsive.
  - **Estimations:** Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High (DoS)

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 3.2.2 Exploiting Underlying JSON/XML Parsing Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_2_2_exploiting_underlying_jsonxml_parsing_libraries.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Sending specially crafted request bodies (JSON or XML) that exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying parsing libraries used by Fiber.
  - **Vulnerability:** Known vulnerabilities in libraries like `encoding/json` or XML parsing libraries (e.g., Billion Laughs, XML External Entity injection).
  - **Impact:** Can range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution, depending on the specific vulnerability.
  - **Estimations:** Likelihood: Low/Medium, Impact: High

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 4.2 Denial of Service via Error Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_2_denial_of_service_via_error_exploitation.md)

- **Attack Vector:**  Crafting specific input combinations or actions that trigger unhandled exceptions or errors within the Fiber application, leading to a crash.
  - **Vulnerability:** Lack of robust error handling and recovery mechanisms within the application code.
  - **Impact:** Denial of Service, causing the application to become unavailable.
  - **Estimations:** Likelihood: Low/Medium, Impact: High (DoS)

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 5.1 Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_5_1_server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious code into template expressions when user-controlled input is directly embedded into templates without proper sanitization.
  - **Vulnerability:** Failure to properly sanitize or escape user input when rendering templates using a templating engine with the Fiber application.
  - **Impact:** Remote Code Execution on the server, leading to full compromise.
  - **Estimations:** Likelihood: Low/Medium (depends on usage), Impact: High

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 6.2 Lack of Security Headers](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_6_2_lack_of_security_headers.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the absence of important security headers to facilitate other attacks.
  - **Vulnerability:** Failure to configure and set security headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options`, etc., in the Fiber application's responses.
  - **Impact:** Increased susceptibility to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Clickjacking, and other client-side attacks. While the immediate impact might be medium, it significantly increases the likelihood and impact of other attacks.
  - **Estimations:** Likelihood: High, Impact: Medium (increases likelihood of other attacks)
