# Attack Surface Analysis for gofiber/fiber

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_injection.md)

**Description:** Malicious data is injected into route parameters, potentially leading to unintended actions or data breaches.

**How Fiber Contributes:** Fiber's straightforward routing mechanism makes it easy to define and access route parameters (e.g., `/users/:id`). If these parameters are not properly validated and sanitized before being used in database queries or other sensitive operations, it creates an entry point for injection attacks.

**Example:** A route like `/users/:id` might be vulnerable if the `id` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without sanitization: `db.Query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + c.Params("id"))`. An attacker could send a request like `/users/1 OR 1=1--` to potentially bypass authentication or retrieve unauthorized data.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, data manipulation, potential for remote code execution (depending on the context of parameter usage).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation on route parameters to ensure they conform to expected types and formats. Use regular expressions or dedicated validation libraries.
*   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection. This ensures that user-provided data is treated as data, not executable code.

## Attack Surface: [Multipart Form Handling Issues](./attack_surfaces/multipart_form_handling_issues.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities related to handling file uploads and multipart form data.

**How Fiber Contributes:** Fiber provides functionality to handle multipart forms, including file uploads. Lack of proper validation on file types, sizes, and content can introduce risks.

**Example:** An upload endpoint might allow uploading executable files without proper validation. An attacker could upload a malicious script and potentially execute it on the server if the application doesn't handle stored files securely.

**Impact:** Arbitrary file upload, remote code execution, denial of service (by uploading excessively large files), path traversal vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **File Type Validation:**  Implement strict validation of file types based on content (magic numbers) rather than just file extensions.
*   **File Size Limits:** Enforce reasonable limits on the size of uploaded files.
*   **Content Scanning:**  Integrate with antivirus or malware scanning tools to scan uploaded files for malicious content.
*   **Secure File Storage:** Store uploaded files outside the webroot and ensure they are not directly accessible. Use unique and unpredictable filenames.
*   **Sanitize Filenames:** Sanitize uploaded filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Bypass](./attack_surfaces/middleware_bypass.md)

**Description:** Security middleware is bypassed due to incorrect implementation or ordering.

**How Fiber Contributes:** Fiber's middleware system relies on the order in which middleware is registered. Incorrect ordering or conditional application of middleware can lead to situations where security checks are not applied to certain routes or requests.

**Example:** If an authentication middleware is registered *after* a route handler that requires authentication, the authentication check will be bypassed.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, bypassing security controls.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Careful Middleware Ordering:**  Ensure that security-critical middleware (authentication, authorization, rate limiting) is registered early in the middleware chain.
*   **Apply Middleware Globally When Necessary:**  Use `app.Use()` to apply essential security middleware to all routes by default.
*   **Thorough Testing:**  Test different request paths and methods to ensure middleware is applied as expected.
