## Deep Analysis: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in a Fiber Application

This analysis delves into the identified High-Risk Path: **5.1 Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** within a Fiber application. We will dissect the attack vector, vulnerability, impact, and estimations, providing a comprehensive understanding for the development team and outlining necessary mitigation strategies.

**High-Risk Path: 5.1 Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**

**- Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious code into template expressions when user-controlled input is directly embedded into templates without proper sanitization.

**Deep Dive:**

This attack vector exploits the functionality of server-side templating engines. These engines allow developers to embed dynamic content within HTML or other text-based formats. They use specific syntax (e.g., `{{ .Variable }}` in Go's `html/template`, `{% ... %}` in Jinja2, etc.) to evaluate expressions and insert data.

The core issue arises when user-provided data, intended for display, is directly placed within these template expressions *without proper sanitization or escaping*. If the templating engine interprets this user input as code rather than plain text, an attacker can inject malicious commands that the server will execute.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a simple Fiber application displaying a welcome message:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"

	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
	"html/template"
)

func main() {
	app := fiber.New()

	app.Get("/greet/:name", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
		name := c.Params("name")

		// Vulnerable code: Directly embedding user input into the template
		tmpl, err := template.New("greet").Parse("<h1>Hello, {{ . }}!</h1>")
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}

		data := name
		err = tmpl.Execute(c.Response().BodyWriter(), data)
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
		return nil
	})

	log.Fatal(app.Listen(":3000"))
}
```

If a user visits `/greet/John`, the output will be `<h1>Hello, John!</h1>`. However, if an attacker crafts a URL like `/greet/{{ .Payload }}`, where `Payload` contains malicious code specific to the templating engine, the server might execute it.

**- Vulnerability:** Failure to properly sanitize or escape user input when rendering templates using a templating engine with the Fiber application.

**Technical Explanation:**

Fiber itself doesn't have a built-in templating engine. It relies on external libraries like `html/template` (Go's standard library), `Jet`, `Pongo2`, or others. The vulnerability lies within how the developer integrates and utilizes these templating engines.

**Key Vulnerable Points:**

1. **Direct Embedding of User Input:** The most direct vulnerability is passing user-controlled data directly into the `Execute` function of the template without any processing.
2. **Insecure Templating Engine Features:** Some templating engines offer features that allow for more complex logic and code execution within templates. If these features are used carelessly with user input, they become prime targets for SSTI.
3. **Lack of Context-Aware Escaping:** Even if some escaping is applied, it might not be context-aware. For example, escaping for HTML might not prevent injection within JavaScript blocks embedded in the template.
4. **Misconfiguration of Templating Engine:** Incorrect configuration of the templating engine might disable default security features or allow for the execution of unsafe code.

**Fiber's Role:**

While Fiber doesn't introduce the SSTI vulnerability itself, it's the framework within which the vulnerable code resides. Developers using Fiber need to be acutely aware of how they handle user input and integrate templating engines.

**- Impact:** Remote Code Execution on the server, leading to full compromise.

**Detailed Impact Analysis:**

The impact of successful SSTI is severe. By injecting malicious code, an attacker can achieve:

1. **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the most critical consequence. The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the application process. This allows them to:
    * **Read sensitive files:** Access configuration files, database credentials, private keys, etc.
    * **Write files:** Modify application code, inject backdoors, plant malware.
    * **Execute system commands:**  Control the server's operating system, potentially leading to complete takeover.
    * **Establish persistent access:** Create new user accounts, install remote access tools.
2. **Data Breaches:** Accessing sensitive data stored on the server or connected databases.
3. **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Executing commands that consume server resources, causing the application to become unavailable.
4. **Lateral Movement:** If the compromised server has access to other internal systems, the attacker can use it as a pivot point to further compromise the network.
5. **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.

**- Estimations:** Likelihood: Low/Medium (depends on usage), Impact: High

**Justification of Estimations:**

* **Likelihood: Low/Medium (depends on usage):**
    * **Low:** If the application primarily serves static content or uses templating engines solely for rendering pre-defined data without incorporating user input directly into template expressions.
    * **Medium:** If the application utilizes templating engines to display dynamic content based on user input, and developers are not fully aware of SSTI risks or haven't implemented robust sanitization measures. The likelihood increases with the complexity of the application and the frequency of user input being integrated into templates.
* **Impact: High:**  As detailed above, the potential consequences of SSTI are extremely severe, leading to complete server compromise and significant business impact.

**Mitigation Strategies for the Development Team:**

To effectively address the risk of SSTI in the Fiber application, the development team should implement the following strategies:

1. **Input Sanitization and Escaping:**
    * **Context-Aware Escaping:**  Use escaping functions provided by the templating engine that are appropriate for the context (HTML, JavaScript, URL, etc.). Avoid generic escaping that might not be sufficient.
    * **Strict Input Validation:**  Validate all user input against expected formats and types. Reject any input that doesn't conform.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege for Input:** Only accept the necessary data from the user and avoid processing or embedding potentially dangerous characters or patterns.

2. **Templating Engine Selection and Configuration:**
    * **Choose Secure Templating Engines:**  Select templating engines known for their security features and actively maintained by the community.
    * **Disable Dangerous Features:**  If the chosen engine offers features that allow for arbitrary code execution within templates (e.g., accessing arbitrary objects or functions), disable them if not absolutely necessary.
    * **Sandbox Environments (with caution):** Some templating engines offer sandboxing capabilities to restrict the code executed within templates. However, be aware that sandboxes can sometimes be bypassed, so this should not be the sole security measure.

3. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * Implement and enforce a strong CSP to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources. This can help mitigate the impact of injected JavaScript if SSTI occurs.

4. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * Conduct regular security code reviews to identify potential SSTI vulnerabilities.
    * Perform penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and assess the effectiveness of security measures.

5. **Developer Training and Awareness:**
    * Educate developers about the risks of SSTI and secure coding practices for templating.
    * Emphasize the importance of never directly embedding unsanitized user input into template expressions.

6. **Use Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements (if applicable):** While primarily relevant for database interactions, the principle of separating code from data applies here as well. Avoid constructing template strings dynamically using user input.

7. **Consider Logic-less Templates:**  If possible, adopt a logic-less templating approach where templates primarily focus on presentation and minimal logic. This reduces the attack surface for SSTI.

**Detection Strategies:**

Identifying potential SSTI vulnerabilities requires a combination of techniques:

1. **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools that can analyze the application's source code and identify potential instances where user input is directly embedded into templates without proper sanitization.
2. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools that can automatically probe the application with various payloads designed to trigger SSTI vulnerabilities.
3. **Manual Code Review:**  Thoroughly review the code, paying close attention to how user input is handled and how templates are rendered.
4. **Penetration Testing:**  Security professionals can manually attempt to exploit potential SSTI vulnerabilities by injecting malicious payloads.

**Conclusion:**

Server-Side Template Injection poses a significant threat to Fiber applications that utilize templating engines. The potential for Remote Code Execution leading to full server compromise necessitates a proactive and comprehensive approach to mitigation. By implementing robust input sanitization, carefully selecting and configuring templating engines, and fostering security awareness among the development team, the risk of SSTI can be significantly reduced. Continuous monitoring, security audits, and penetration testing are crucial for identifying and addressing any vulnerabilities that may arise. This deep analysis provides a solid foundation for the development team to understand the risks and implement the necessary safeguards to protect the application.
