## Deep Analysis of Header Injection via `c.Get()` in Fiber

This document provides a deep analysis of the threat of Header Injection via `c.Get()` leading to Response Header Manipulation in applications using the Go Fiber framework.

**1. Threat Breakdown:**

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts an HTTP request with malicious characters (specifically newline characters `%0a` or `%0d`, or their URL-encoded variations) within a request header value.
* **Vulnerable Code:** The application uses `c.Get("Header-Name")` to retrieve the value of this manipulated header and then directly uses this value with `c.Set("Response-Header-Name", retrievedValue)` or similar methods to set a response header.
* **Exploitation Mechanism:** The newline characters are interpreted by the HTTP protocol as the end of a header and the beginning of a new header. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary response headers.

**2. Deeper Dive into the Technical Details:**

* **HTTP Header Structure:** HTTP headers are structured as key-value pairs separated by a colon and a space (`:` ). Each header is separated by a carriage return and a line feed (`\r\n`). URL encoding represents these as `%0d%0a`. A single newline (`\n` or `%0a`) might also be sufficient in some implementations.
* **Fiber's `c.Get()` Behavior:** `c.Get()` in Fiber retrieves the value of the specified request header. It returns the raw string value as received from the client. It does *not* perform any sanitization or validation on the header value.
* **Fiber's `c.Set()` Behavior:** `c.Set()` takes a key and a value (both strings) and sets the corresponding response header. It trusts the input provided and directly adds it to the response headers.
* **The Injection Point:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization between the retrieval of the header value using `c.Get()` and its use in setting the response header with `c.Set()`. This direct pass-through of potentially malicious input is the core issue.

**3. Detailed Impact Analysis:**

* **Malicious Cookie Setting:**
    * **How it works:** An attacker can inject a `Set-Cookie` header with arbitrary values.
    * **Impact:** This allows the attacker to set cookies on the user's browser for the application's domain. This can be used for:
        * **Session Hijacking:** If the application relies on client-side session management, the attacker can set a valid session cookie and impersonate the user.
        * **Tracking:** The attacker can set persistent tracking cookies to monitor user activity.
        * **Defacing:** In some cases, manipulating specific application cookies can lead to visual defacement or altered functionality.
* **Redirection to Attacker-Controlled Sites:**
    * **How it works:** Injecting a `Location` header forces the browser to redirect to the specified URL.
    * **Impact:** This can be used for:
        * **Phishing:** Redirecting users to a fake login page to steal credentials.
        * **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to a site hosting malicious software.
        * **Denial of Service:** Redirecting users in a loop or to a resource-intensive page.
* **Cache Poisoning:**
    * **How it works:** By injecting headers like `Vary` or cache control directives, an attacker can manipulate how intermediary caches (like CDNs or browser caches) store and serve responses.
    * **Impact:** This can lead to:
        * **Serving malicious content from the cache:** If the attacker can inject a `Location` header and the response is cached, subsequent users might be redirected to the malicious site even without directly interacting with the vulnerable application.
        * **Denial of Service:** By manipulating cache directives, an attacker might force the cache to constantly revalidate resources, increasing load on the server.
* **Bypassing Security Policies:**
    * **How it works:** Injecting headers can bypass security policies enforced by the browser or intermediary proxies.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP) Bypass:** Injecting a conflicting or overriding CSP header can weaken the application's defenses against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
        * **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) Bypass:** While less likely with header injection alone, manipulating headers could theoretically interfere with HSTS enforcement in complex scenarios.
        * **Other Security Header Manipulation:**  Attackers might try to remove or modify other security-related headers like `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, etc.

**4. Example Attack Scenario:**

Let's assume the following vulnerable code exists in a Fiber application:

```go
app.Get("/profile", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    lang := c.Get("X-Preferred-Language")
    c.Set("Content-Language", lang) // Vulnerable line
    return c.SendString("Your profile page")
})
```

An attacker could send the following request:

```
GET /profile HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable.example.com
X-Preferred-Language: en
Set-Cookie: malicious_cookie=evil; Path=/

```

**Explanation:**

* The attacker injects `Set-Cookie: malicious_cookie=evil; Path=/` into the `X-Preferred-Language` header.
* `c.Get("X-Preferred-Language")` will retrieve the entire string: `en\r\nSet-Cookie: malicious_cookie=evil; Path=/`.
* `c.Set("Content-Language", lang)` will set the `Content-Language` header to this malicious string.
* The server will send the following response (simplified):

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Language: en
Set-Cookie: malicious_cookie=evil; Path=/
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

Your profile page
```

The attacker has successfully injected a `Set-Cookie` header into the response.

**5. Affected Fiber Component Deep Dive:**

* **`fiber.Ctx`:** This is the central context object in Fiber that holds information about the current request and response.
* **`c.Get(key string) string`:** This function retrieves the value of the request header with the given key. It is the entry point for the malicious input. Its design focuses on retrieving the raw value without any inherent security considerations.
* **`c.Set(key string, val string)`:** This function sets the response header with the given key and value. It directly uses the provided value, making it susceptible to header injection if the value originates from an unsanitized source like `c.Get()`.

**6. Risk Severity Justification:**

The risk severity is correctly classified as **High** due to:

* **Ease of Exploitation:** Injecting newline characters into headers is relatively simple for attackers.
* **Significant Impact:** The potential consequences, including session hijacking, redirection, and cache poisoning, can severely compromise the application's security and user trust.
* **Wide Applicability:** This vulnerability can affect any Fiber application that directly copies header values from requests to responses without proper sanitization.

**7. Detailed Mitigation Strategies and Implementation Guidance:**

* **Input Sanitization:**
    * **Technique:**  Strip out newline characters (`\r`, `\n`, `%0d`, `%0a`) and potentially other harmful characters (like colons if you're not careful with your logic).
    * **Implementation:**
        ```go
        import "strings"

        app.Get("/profile", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
            lang := c.Get("X-Preferred-Language")
            // Sanitize the input
            sanitizedLang := strings.ReplaceAll(strings.ReplaceAll(lang, "\r", ""), "\n", "")
            c.Set("Content-Language", sanitizedLang)
            return c.SendString("Your profile page")
        })
        ```
    * **Considerations:** Be mindful of the specific context. While stripping newlines is crucial, other characters might also be problematic depending on how the header is used.
* **Header Allow-listing:**
    * **Technique:**  Instead of directly copying header values, define a list of allowed headers and their permissible values.
    * **Implementation:**
        ```go
        var allowedLanguages = map[string]bool{"en": true, "fr": true, "es": true}

        app.Get("/profile", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
            lang := c.Get("X-Preferred-Language")
            if allowedLanguages[lang] {
                c.Set("Content-Language", lang)
            } else {
                c.Set("Content-Language", "en") // Default or error handling
            }
            return c.SendString("Your profile page")
        })
        ```
    * **Considerations:** This approach provides strong security but might be less flexible if you need to support a wide range of user-provided header values.
* **Leveraging Fiber's Built-in Mechanisms:**
    * **Technique:** Utilize Fiber's helper functions for setting common security-related headers.
    * **Implementation:** For security headers like CSP, HSTS, etc., use middleware or dedicated functions if available in future Fiber versions (currently, manual setting with `c.Set()` is common).
    * **Considerations:**  While Fiber provides the building blocks, developers still need to be responsible for setting these headers correctly.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * **Technique:**  Implement a robust CSP to mitigate the impact of injected content or scripts.
    * **Implementation:**  Set the `Content-Security-Policy` header with appropriate directives.
    * **Considerations:** CSP is a defense-in-depth measure and doesn't prevent the header injection itself, but it can limit the damage.
* **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):**
    * **Technique:** Enforce HTTPS by setting the `Strict-Transport-Security` header.
    * **Implementation:**  Set the `Strict-Transport-Security` header with appropriate directives.
    * **Considerations:** HSTS helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and ensures communication over HTTPS.
* **Secure Cookie Flags:**
    * **Technique:**  When setting cookies, always use the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.
    * **Implementation:**  When using `c.Cookie()`, ensure these flags are set.
    * **Considerations:** These flags mitigate the risk of client-side script access to cookies and ensure cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.
* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    * **Technique:**  Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities like this.
    * **Implementation:**  Use static analysis tools and manual code reviews to check for instances of unsanitized header usage.
    * **Considerations:** Proactive security measures are crucial for preventing vulnerabilities from being introduced in the first place.

**8. Conclusion:**

Header Injection via `c.Get()` is a significant threat in Fiber applications due to the framework's direct access to raw header values and its straightforward mechanism for setting response headers. Developers must be acutely aware of this risk and implement robust mitigation strategies, primarily focusing on input sanitization and avoiding the direct copying of user-provided header values into response headers. By adopting the recommended mitigation techniques and fostering a security-conscious development approach, teams can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this dangerous vulnerability.
