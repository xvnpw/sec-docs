# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for gofiber/fiber

## Mitigation Strategy: [Middleware Security](./mitigation_strategies/middleware_security.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Audit and Update Middleware

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Inventory Middleware:** Create a comprehensive list of all *Fiber middleware* used in the application, including official Fiber middleware and third-party packages specifically designed for Fiber. Document the version of each middleware.
        2.  **Dependency Management:** Utilize `go mod` to track *Fiber middleware* dependencies.
        3.  **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases relevant to Go and *Fiber middleware* packages.
        4.  **Regular Audits:** Schedule periodic reviews of the *Fiber middleware* inventory. Check for updates and known vulnerabilities specifically related to these packages.
        5.  **Update Process:** Establish a process for updating *Fiber middleware*. Test updates in a staging environment before deploying to production. Prioritize security updates for *Fiber middleware*.
        6.  **Retirement of Unused Middleware:** Remove any *Fiber middleware* that is no longer needed to reduce the attack surface related to Fiber's middleware chain.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerable Dependencies (High Severity):** Exploits in outdated *Fiber middleware* can directly compromise the application within the Fiber context.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity):** Compromised third-party *Fiber middleware* can introduce malicious code into the Fiber application's request handling flow.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Vulnerable Dependencies:** High Risk Reduction
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Medium Risk Reduction (reduces the window of opportunity and increases detection chances within the Fiber ecosystem)

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Dependency management with `go mod` is in place for *Fiber middleware*. Regular audits are not formally scheduled but done ad-hoc for *Fiber middleware*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Formal scheduled *Fiber middleware* audits, automated vulnerability scanning specifically targeting *Fiber middleware* dependencies, and a documented update process for *Fiber middleware*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/implement_a_content_security_policy__csp__middleware.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) Middleware

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Choose CSP Middleware:** Select a suitable *Fiber CSP middleware* package (e.g., a community-developed one specifically for Fiber or build custom middleware leveraging Fiber's middleware interface).
        2.  **Define Initial Policy:** Start with a restrictive CSP policy that is compatible with Fiber's routing and asset serving if applicable.
        3.  **Integrate Middleware:** Add the CSP *middleware to the Fiber application's middleware chain*, ensuring it's applied to routes served by Fiber.
        4.  **Testing in Report-Only Mode:** Initially deploy the CSP in `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` mode within the Fiber application. Configure a reporting endpoint to collect violation reports generated by browsers interacting with the Fiber application.
        5.  **Analyze Reports:** Review CSP violation reports to identify legitimate resource loading within the Fiber application that is being blocked or flagged.
        6.  **Policy Refinement:** Adjust the CSP directives based on the report analysis, considering the specific resource loading patterns of the Fiber application.
        7.  **Enforce Policy:** Switch to `Content-Security-Policy` mode to enforce the policy and block violations within the Fiber application's responses.
        8.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review and update the CSP as the *Fiber application evolves* and new resources are added or routing changes.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** CSP significantly reduces the impact of XSS attacks in *Fiber applications* by limiting resource sources, making it harder to inject and execute malicious scripts within the Fiber-served content.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** High Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. CSP is not currently configured in the *Fiber application*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Entire CSP implementation is missing within the Fiber application. No CSP middleware is used within Fiber, and no policy is defined or enforced for Fiber-served content.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Employ Rate Limiting Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/employ_rate_limiting_middleware.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Employ Rate Limiting Middleware

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Choose Rate Limiting Middleware:** Select a *Fiber rate limiting middleware* package (e.g., a community-developed one for Fiber or build custom middleware using Fiber's context and middleware structure).
        2.  **Define Rate Limits:** Determine appropriate rate limits for different *Fiber endpoints* or user roles based on expected traffic and resource capacity of the Fiber application.
        3.  **Configure Middleware:** Configure the *Fiber rate limiting middleware* with the defined limits. Specify which *Fiber routes* or route groups should be rate-limited.
        4.  **Storage Mechanism:** Choose a suitable storage mechanism for rate limiting counters, considering the deployment environment of the *Fiber application*.
        5.  **Error Handling:** Customize the *Fiber rate limiting middleware's* error response to inform users when they are being rate-limited by the Fiber application (e.g., HTTP 429 Too Many Requests).
        6.  **Monitoring and Adjustment:** Monitor rate limiting effectiveness within the *Fiber application* and adjust limits as needed based on traffic patterns and attack attempts targeting Fiber routes.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):** Rate limiting makes brute-force attacks against *Fiber login forms or other sensitive Fiber endpoints* significantly slower and less effective.
        *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting can mitigate some forms of DoS attacks targeting the *Fiber application* by preventing a single source from overwhelming it with requests.
        *   **Excessive API Usage (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting controls API usage of *Fiber-based APIs* and prevents resource exhaustion due to unintended or malicious overuse of Fiber routes.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** High Risk Reduction
        *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** Medium Risk Reduction (mitigates some, not all DoS types targeting Fiber)
        *   **Excessive API Usage:** Medium Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic rate limiting is implemented on the login endpoint *within the Fiber application* using a simple in-memory store.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Rate limiting is not applied to all critical *Fiber endpoints*. More sophisticated rate limiting strategies (e.g., different limits for different user roles accessing Fiber routes, distributed storage for scaled Fiber applications) are missing. Monitoring and adjustment mechanisms for Fiber rate limiting are not formalized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Security Header Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_security_header_middleware.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Security Header Middleware

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Choose Security Header Middleware:** Select a *Fiber security header middleware* package (e.g., a community-developed one for Fiber or build custom middleware to set headers in Fiber responses).
        2.  **Configure Headers:** Configure the *Fiber middleware* to set security headers in *Fiber responses*:
            *   `Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)`: Set for *Fiber responses* to enforce HTTPS connections.
            *   `X-Frame-Options`: Set for *Fiber responses* to prevent clickjacking attacks on Fiber-served pages.
            *   `X-Content-Type-Options`: Set for *Fiber responses* to prevent MIME-sniffing vulnerabilities in Fiber-served content.
            *   `Referrer-Policy`: Set for *Fiber responses* to control referrer information leakage from Fiber-served pages.
            *   `Permissions-Policy`: Configure for *Fiber responses* to control browser features available to the Fiber application.
        3.  **Integrate Middleware:** Add the security header *middleware to the Fiber application's middleware chain*, ensuring it's applied to all *Fiber responses*.
        4.  **Verification:** Use browser developer tools or online header checkers to verify that the security headers are being set correctly in *Fiber responses*.
        5.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review and update the security header configuration for the *Fiber application* as security best practices evolve for web applications served by frameworks like Fiber.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (via HSTS) (High Severity):** HSTS enforces HTTPS for *Fiber applications* and prevents downgrade attacks on Fiber-served content.
        *   **Clickjacking Attacks (via X-Frame-Options) (Medium Severity):** X-Frame-Options prevents clickjacking attacks on *Fiber-served pages*.
        *   **MIME-Sniffing Vulnerabilities (via X-Content-Type-Options) (Medium Severity):** X-Content-Type-Options prevents browsers from incorrectly guessing content types of *Fiber-served content*.
        *   **Referrer Leakage (via Referrer-Policy) (Low to Medium Severity):** Referrer-Policy controls referrer information leakage from *Fiber-served pages*.
        *   **Feature Policy Exploitation (via Permissions-Policy) (Low to Medium Severity):** Permissions-Policy restricts access to browser features for *Fiber applications*.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** High Risk Reduction
        *   **Clickjacking Attacks:** Medium Risk Reduction
        *   **MIME-Sniffing Vulnerabilities:** Medium Risk Reduction
        *   **Referrer Leakage:** Low to Medium Risk Reduction
        *   **Feature Policy Exploitation:** Low to Medium Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `X-Frame-Options` and `X-Content-Type-Options` are set in the *Fiber application's* main handler.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** HSTS, `Referrer-Policy`, and `Permissions-Policy` headers are not currently implemented in *Fiber responses*. A dedicated security header middleware is not used within Fiber for centralized management of these headers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Carefully Order Middleware Execution](./mitigation_strategies/carefully_order_middleware_execution.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Carefully Order Middleware Execution

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Review Middleware Chain:** Examine the order in which *Fiber middleware* is registered in the Fiber application's main file or configuration.
        2.  **Prioritize Security Middleware:** Ensure that security-related *Fiber middleware* is placed strategically in the *Fiber middleware chain*.
            *   **Rate Limiting:** Place *Fiber rate limiting middleware* early in the chain, ideally before authentication middleware, to prevent resource exhaustion of the Fiber application before authentication attempts.
            *   **CORS:** Place *Fiber CORS middleware* before authentication and authorization middleware to control cross-origin access to Fiber routes before further processing by Fiber.
            *   **Security Header Middleware:** Place *Fiber security header middleware* relatively late in the chain, after response generation by Fiber but before sending the response, to ensure headers are applied correctly to Fiber responses.
            *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Place authentication and authorization middleware after rate limiting and CORS but before *Fiber route handlers* that require authentication/authorization.
        3.  **Testing:** Test the *Fiber application* after adjusting middleware order to ensure that *Fiber middleware* functions as expected and that no unintended side effects are introduced within the Fiber application.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Bypass of Security Controls (Medium to High Severity):** Incorrect *Fiber middleware* order can lead to security middleware being bypassed or rendered ineffective within the Fiber application.
        *   **CORS Bypass (Medium Severity):** Incorrect *Fiber CORS middleware* placement can lead to CORS policies not being enforced correctly for Fiber routes.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Bypass of Security Controls:** Medium to High Risk Reduction (depending on the bypassed control within Fiber)
        *   **CORS Bypass:** Medium Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic *Fiber middleware* ordering is considered, but not formally documented or reviewed regularly for the Fiber application.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Formal documentation of *Fiber middleware* order and its security implications within the Fiber application. Regular review of *Fiber middleware* order as the Fiber application evolves.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Request Inputs within Fiber Handlers](./mitigation_strategies/validate_request_inputs_within_fiber_handlers.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Validate Request Inputs within Fiber Handlers

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Input Sources:** For each *Fiber route handler*, identify all sources of user input accessed via *Fiber's `c *fiber.Ctx` context*: `c.Params()`, `c.Query()`, `c.FormValue()`, `c.BodyParser()`, `c.Cookies()`.
        2.  **Define Validation Rules:** For each input source within *Fiber handlers*, define validation rules based on expected data types, formats, ranges, and allowed values relevant to the Fiber route's logic.
        3.  **Implement Validation Logic:** Within each *Fiber route handler*, implement validation logic using Go and potentially data validation libraries to validate inputs obtained from *Fiber's context*.
        4.  **Error Handling:** If validation fails within a *Fiber handler*, return informative error responses to the client (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request) *using Fiber's context* indicating the validation errors.
        5.  **Logging:** Log validation errors on the server-side for monitoring and debugging purposes, including relevant *Fiber context* information.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Injection Attacks (SQL Injection, Command Injection, etc.) (High Severity):** Input validation within *Fiber handlers* prevents attackers from injecting malicious code or commands through user inputs processed by Fiber.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity):** Input validation in *Fiber handlers* can help prevent XSS by rejecting or sanitizing malicious script inputs before they are stored or processed within the Fiber application.
        *   **Business Logic Errors (Medium Severity):** Validation in *Fiber handlers* prevents unexpected application behavior and errors caused by invalid input data received by Fiber routes.
        *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) (Low to Medium Severity):** Validation in *Fiber handlers* can prevent certain DoS attacks that rely on sending malformed or excessively large inputs to Fiber routes.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Injection Attacks:** High Risk Reduction
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Medium Risk Reduction (validation is one layer of defense within Fiber handlers)
        *   **Business Logic Errors:** Medium Risk Reduction
        *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Low to Medium Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic input validation is done in some *Fiber route handlers*, primarily for data type checks using *Fiber's context*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive input validation is not consistently applied across all *Fiber route handlers* and input sources accessed via *Fiber's context*. Data validation libraries are not consistently used within Fiber handlers. Formal validation rules for Fiber route inputs are not documented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User-Provided Data Before Output](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user-provided_data_before_output.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize User-Provided Data Before Output

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Output Contexts:** Determine all contexts where user-provided data, processed within *Fiber handlers*, is output in the application: HTML templates rendered by Fiber, API responses (JSON, XML) generated by Fiber routes, logs generated by the Fiber application, etc.
        2.  **Choose Sanitization Methods:** Select appropriate sanitization methods based on the output context, ensuring compatibility with *Fiber's templating engine* or response formats.
        3.  **Implement Sanitization:** Apply sanitization functions to user-provided data *immediately before* outputting it in the relevant context *within Fiber handlers or response rendering logic*.
        4.  **Template Engine Configuration:** Configure the *Fiber template engine* to use automatic escaping by default, if available, for HTML output.
        5.  **Code Review:** Conduct code reviews to ensure that sanitization is consistently applied in all output contexts *within the Fiber application*.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Sanitization is a crucial defense against XSS attacks in *Fiber applications* by preventing malicious scripts from being rendered as executable code in the user's browser when served by Fiber.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** High Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. HTML template engine (if used with Fiber) likely provides some automatic escaping. Manual sanitization is not consistently applied in all output contexts within the *Fiber application*, especially in API responses generated by Fiber routes.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent and comprehensive sanitization across all output contexts within the *Fiber application*, including API responses and logs generated by Fiber. Formal guidelines and code review processes to ensure sanitization in Fiber applications are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Customize Fiber's Error Handler](./mitigation_strategies/customize_fiber's_error_handler.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Customize Fiber's Error Handler

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Override Default Handler:** In the Fiber application's main file, override the default error handler *provided by Fiber* using `app.ErrorHandler = func(c *fiber.Ctx, err error) error { ... }`.
        2.  **Generic Client Response:** Within the custom *Fiber error handler*, construct a generic error response for clients (e.g., HTTP 500 Internal Server Error) *using Fiber's context*. Avoid exposing detailed error messages or stack traces to clients *via Fiber responses*.
        3.  **Secure Logging:** Log the full error details, including the error message, stack trace, *Fiber request context* (URL, headers, user information if available via Fiber context), and timestamp, to a secure server-side logging system *from within the Fiber error handler*.
        4.  **Error Classification (Optional):** Consider classifying errors into different categories within the *Fiber error handler* to facilitate logging and monitoring of Fiber application errors.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Default *Fiber error handlers* can expose sensitive information in *Fiber responses* like stack traces, internal paths, and database details to attackers.
        *   **Attack Surface Mapping (Low to Medium Severity):** Detailed error messages from *Fiber's default error handler* can help attackers understand the Fiber application's internal workings.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium Risk Reduction
        *   **Attack Surface Mapping:** Low to Medium Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. A custom *Fiber error handler* is in place that returns a generic 500 error to the client *via Fiber*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Detailed error logging is not fully implemented *within the Fiber error handler*. Stack traces and *Fiber request context* are not consistently logged in a secure manner from the Fiber error handler. Error classification is not implemented in the Fiber error handler.
