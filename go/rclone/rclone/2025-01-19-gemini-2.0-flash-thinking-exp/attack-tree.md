## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via rclone (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_rclone__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the root goal of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application through its rclone integration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit rclone Configuration (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rclone_configuration__critical_node_.md)

*   This represents a fundamental attack vector. If the rclone configuration is compromised, the attacker can manipulate how the application interacts with remote storage, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or the introduction of malicious data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Stolen rclone Credentials (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/stolen_rclone_credentials__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains access to the rclone credentials (API keys, passwords, OAuth tokens) used by the application. This could be achieved through various means:
    *   Accessing the stored configuration file directly.
    *   Intercepting credentials during configuration.
    *   Brute-forcing weak passwords (less common for API keys).
*   **Impact:** With stolen credentials, the attacker can impersonate the application's access to the remote storage, allowing them to read, write, modify, or delete data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access stored rclone configuration file (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/access_stored_rclone_configuration_file__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker directly accesses the file where the rclone configuration is stored. This is often a local file on the server.
*   **Impact:** This provides direct access to sensitive information, including credentials and remote storage details, enabling further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured rclone Remotes (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_rclone_remotes__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The rclone configuration is set up incorrectly, leading to unintended access or data flow.
    *   **Pointing rclone to attacker-controlled storage:** The application is configured to interact with a remote storage location controlled by the attacker.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Pointing rclone to attacker-controlled storage:** The application might write sensitive data to the attacker's storage, leading to data breaches. Conversely, the application might read malicious data from the attacker's storage, potentially compromising the application's functionality or introducing malware.

## Attack Tree Path: [Point rclone to attacker-controlled storage (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/point_rclone_to_attacker-controlled_storage__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The rclone configuration is maliciously modified or initially set up to point to a storage location controlled by the attacker.
*   **Impact:** This allows the attacker to directly influence the data the application processes, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or the introduction of malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Storage of rclone Configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_storage_of_rclone_configuration__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The method used to store the rclone configuration is vulnerable, making it accessible to unauthorized parties.
    *   **Configuration file stored with weak permissions:** The configuration file is readable by users or processes that should not have access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Configuration file stored with weak permissions:** Attackers can easily read the configuration file and obtain sensitive information like credentials and remote details.

## Attack Tree Path: [Configuration file stored with weak permissions (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/configuration_file_stored_with_weak_permissions__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The file containing the rclone configuration has insufficient access restrictions, allowing unauthorized users or processes to read its contents.
*   **Impact:** This directly exposes sensitive information, including credentials and remote storage details, enabling further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit rclone Execution (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rclone_execution__critical_node_.md)

*   This represents vulnerabilities in how the application executes rclone commands. If this process is flawed, attackers can inject malicious commands or manipulate the execution flow.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via rclone (HIGH-RISK PATH START, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_rclone__high-risk_path_start__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application constructs rclone commands using user-provided input without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary rclone commands or even shell commands.
    *   **Application uses unsanitized user input in rclone commands:** User-provided data is directly incorporated into rclone commands without being properly escaped or validated.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Application uses unsanitized user input in rclone commands:** Attackers can execute arbitrary rclone commands to exfiltrate data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary shell commands on the server, leading to complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via rclone (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_rclone__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  The application fails to properly sanitize or validate input that is used to construct rclone commands.
*   **Impact:** This allows attackers to inject malicious commands, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or arbitrary code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application uses unsanitized user input in rclone commands](./attack_tree_paths/application_uses_unsanitized_user_input_in_rclone_commands.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application directly incorporates user-provided data into the rclone command string without proper escaping or validation. For example, if a user can specify a filename, and that filename is used directly in an `rclone copy` command, an attacker could inject malicious rclone options or even shell commands.
*   **Impact:** This allows attackers to execute arbitrary rclone commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, data modification, or even arbitrary code execution on the server.
