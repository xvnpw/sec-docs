## Threat Model: Application Using Rclone - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Gain unauthorized access to data managed by the application or disrupt the application's functionality by leveraging vulnerabilities or misconfigurations related to its use of rclone.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

    *   AND
        *   **Exploit Rclone Configuration Vulnerabilities** **(Critical Node)**

                *   Exploit Misconfigured Permissions
                    *   Rclone Config File World-Readable **(High-Risk Path -->)**

                    *   Access Environment Variables (e.g., Process Memory Dump, OS Command Injection in Application) **(High-Risk Path -->)**

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Exploit Rclone Configuration Vulnerabilities:**
    *   This represents a broad category of attacks targeting how rclone is configured. Successful exploitation often leads to direct access to stored credentials, bypassing other security measures. It's critical because it unlocks multiple high-impact attack vectors.

*   **Exploit Stored Credentials:**
    *   This node signifies the direct compromise of the authentication mechanism used by rclone to access cloud storage. Success here grants the attacker full access to the data managed by the application.

*   **Access Stored Credentials File:**
    *   This is a crucial step within the "Exploit Stored Credentials" path. If an attacker can access the `rclone.conf` file (or equivalent secure storage), they can retrieve the stored credentials.

*   **Exploit Rclone Command Injection:**
    *   This critical node represents the ability of an attacker to inject malicious commands or parameters into rclone commands executed by the application. This allows them to control rclone's actions and potentially perform unauthorized operations.

*   **Abuse Rclone Functionality for Malicious Purposes:**
    *   This node highlights the danger of an attacker leveraging rclone's legitimate features for malicious ends once they have gained some level of control. This includes using rclone for data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **Gain File System Access (e.g., Path Traversal, OS Command Injection in Application) --> Exploit Stored Credentials --> Exploit Rclone Configuration Vulnerabilities --> Compromise Application via Rclone:**
    *   Attack Vector: An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application (like path traversal or OS command injection) to gain access to the file system where rclone's configuration file (containing credentials) is stored. They then retrieve these credentials, compromising rclone's access to the cloud storage.

*   **Rclone Config File World-Readable --> Exploit Stored Credentials --> Exploit Rclone Configuration Vulnerabilities --> Compromise Application via Rclone:**
    *   Attack Vector: The `rclone.conf` file is misconfigured with overly permissive read permissions, allowing any user on the system to access and read the stored credentials, leading to a compromise of rclone's access.

*   **Access Environment Variables (e.g., Process Memory Dump, OS Command Injection in Application) --> Exploit Insecure Environment Variables --> Exploit Rclone Configuration Vulnerabilities --> Compromise Application via Rclone:**
    *   Attack Vector: The application stores sensitive rclone configuration (including credentials) in environment variables. An attacker gains access to these environment variables (e.g., through process memory dumping or OS command injection), compromising rclone's access.

*   **Inject Malicious Parameters into Rclone Command --> Exploit Rclone Command Injection --> Compromise Application via Rclone:**
    *   Attack Vector: The application constructs rclone commands dynamically using user-provided input without proper sanitization. An attacker injects malicious parameters into this input, causing rclone to perform unintended actions, such as copying data to an attacker-controlled location or deleting critical files.

*   **Use Rclone to Copy Sensitive Data to Attacker-Controlled Storage --> Data Exfiltration --> Abuse Rclone Functionality for Malicious Purposes --> Compromise Application via Rclone:**
    *   Attack Vector: After gaining control over rclone execution (through configuration vulnerabilities, command injection, etc.), the attacker uses rclone's intended functionality to copy sensitive data from the connected cloud storage to a location they control.

*   **Use Rclone to Modify or Delete Critical Application Data --> Data Modification/Deletion --> Abuse Rclone Functionality for Malicious Purposes --> Compromise Application via Rclone:**
    *   Attack Vector:  Having gained control over rclone execution, the attacker uses rclone's intended functionality to modify or delete critical data stored in the cloud, leading to data corruption, loss, or application malfunction.
