# Attack Surface Analysis for rclone/rclone

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Rclone Configuration File](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_rclone_configuration_file.md)

*   **Description:** The `rclone.conf` file contains sensitive credentials (API keys, tokens, passwords) for accessing various cloud storage providers. If this file is compromised, attackers gain direct access to these storage accounts.
    *   **How Rclone Contributes:** Rclone relies on this configuration file to store connection details for remote storage.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains read access to the server's filesystem and finds `rclone.conf` with unprotected credentials for an S3 bucket containing sensitive customer data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of connected cloud storage accounts, leading to data breaches, data loss, or unauthorized modifications.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store `rclone.conf` with restricted file permissions (e.g., 600 or stricter) accessible only to the application's user.
        *   Encrypt the `rclone.conf` file using OS-level encryption or rclone's built-in encryption features (though this adds complexity to key management).
        *   Avoid storing `rclone.conf` in default or easily guessable locations.
        *   Implement secrets management solutions to handle credentials securely instead of relying solely on `rclone.conf`.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via User Input](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_user_input.md)

*   **Description:** If the application constructs rclone commands dynamically using unsanitized user input, attackers can inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by the system with the application's privileges.
    *   **How Rclone Contributes:** Rclone is a command-line tool, and its functionality is accessed by executing commands. Improper command construction opens this injection vector.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to specify a remote path for a sync operation. An attacker provides input like `; rm -rf /`, which, if not properly sanitized, could be appended to the rclone command, leading to the deletion of the entire filesystem.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server or environment where the application is running, data loss, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never directly embed user input into rclone commands.**
        *   Use rclone's API or library bindings if available and suitable for the task, as they offer more controlled interaction.
        *   If command-line execution is necessary, use parameterized commands or carefully sanitize and validate all user-provided input before incorporating it into the command.
        *   Implement strict input validation and escaping to prevent the injection of malicious characters or commands.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows user-controlled input to define source or destination paths for rclone operations without proper validation, attackers can access or modify files outside the intended scope.
    *   **How Rclone Contributes:** Rclone operates on file paths, and if these paths are not properly controlled, it can be directed to access unintended locations.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to download files from a remote storage. An attacker provides a path like `../../../../etc/passwd`, potentially gaining access to sensitive system files.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, data breaches, potential for modifying or deleting critical data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided paths.**
        *   Use allow-lists of permitted paths or patterns instead of relying on blacklists.
        *   Canonicalize paths to resolve symbolic links and relative paths before using them in rclone commands.
        *   Enforce chroot jails or similar mechanisms to restrict rclone's access to specific directories.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration Options](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_options.md)

*   **Description:** Rclone offers various configuration options that, if set insecurely, can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Rclone Contributes:** Rclone's flexibility allows for configurations that might prioritize convenience over security.
    *   **Example:** Disabling TLS verification (`--no-check-certificate`) to bypass certificate errors, making the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of data in transit, susceptibility to MITM attacks, potential for unauthorized access if security features are disabled.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Review and understand the security implications of all rclone configuration options.**
        *   **Avoid disabling security features like TLS verification unless absolutely necessary and with a clear understanding of the risks.**
        *   Use strong encryption algorithms and protocols when configuring remotes.
        *   Regularly review and audit rclone configurations.
