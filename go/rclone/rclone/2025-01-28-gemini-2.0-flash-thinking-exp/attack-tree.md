Objective: Compromise Application Data via Rclone Exploitation

## Attack Tree Visualization

**Compromise Application Data via Rclone Exploitation** **
*   Exploit Rclone Configuration Vulnerabilities
    *   Insecure Configuration Storage
        *   Configuration File Accessible to Unauthorized Users
            *   Actionable Insight: Ensure rclone configuration files (rclone.conf) are stored with restrictive permissions (e.g., 600 or 400) and are not world-readable.
        *   Actionable Insight: Store configuration files outside of the web application's document root and publicly accessible directories.
    *   Misconfigured Backend Permissions
        *   Overly Permissive Backend Access
            *   Actionable Insight: Configure backend storage (e.g., cloud storage buckets, SFTP servers) with the principle of least privilege. Grant rclone only the necessary permissions (read, write, list, etc.) required for its intended function.
        *   Publicly Accessible Backend Storage (Accidental)
            *   Actionable Insight: Double-check backend storage configurations to ensure they are not accidentally made publicly accessible (e.g., public S3 buckets).
            *   Actionable Insight: Implement bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) to explicitly restrict access to authorized entities only.
*   Exploit Rclone Command Injection Vulnerabilities
    *   Unsanitized Input in Rclone Commands
        *   User-Controlled Input Directly Used in Rclone Command
            *   Actionable Insight: **Critical:** Never directly incorporate user-supplied input into rclone commands without thorough sanitization and validation.
            *   Actionable Insight: Use parameterized commands or escape user input properly to prevent command injection. Consider using a library or function specifically designed for command-line argument escaping for the shell being used.
        *   Input from External, Untrusted Sources Used in Rclone Command
            *   Actionable Insight: Treat data from external sources (databases, APIs, files) with caution and sanitize/validate it before using it in rclone commands.
            *   Actionable Insight: Implement input validation rules based on expected data types and formats to prevent injection attempts.

        *   **2.2.1. Overly Permissive Backend Access (High-Risk Path)**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Rclone is granted broader permissions than necessary on the backend storage (e.g., write access when only read is needed, list access to sensitive directories).
