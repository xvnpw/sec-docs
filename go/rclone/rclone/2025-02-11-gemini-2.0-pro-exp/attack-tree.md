# Attack Tree Analysis for rclone/rclone

Objective: To gain unauthorized access to data stored in or exfiltrate data from cloud storage services accessed via rclone, or to disrupt the application's functionality related to cloud storage interaction.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Rclone Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_rclone_configuration.md)

The attacker gains access to the rclone configuration file, which contains credentials and settings for accessing cloud storage services. This is a critical node because it provides a direct path to unauthorized data access.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **Stolen/Leaked Credentials (Cloud/Rclone)** [CRITICAL]
            *   **Description:** The attacker obtains the cloud storage credentials (e.g., API keys, service account keys) or rclone-specific credentials (e.g., for encrypted remotes). This is a critical node because it grants immediate access to the target data.
            *   **Methods:**
                *   ***Phishing/Social Engineering:*** Tricking the user into revealing their credentials through deceptive emails, websites, or other communication.
                    *   Likelihood: Medium to High
                    *   Impact: High to Very High
                    *   Effort: Low to Medium
                    *   Skill Level: Novice to Intermediate
                    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard
                *   ***Compromised Endpoint (where rclone is running):*** [CRITICAL] Gaining control of the machine where rclone is running, allowing direct access to the configuration file and potentially active rclone processes.
                    *   Likelihood: Low to Medium
                    *   Impact: High to Very High
                    *   Effort: Medium to High
                    *   Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
                    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rclone Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rclone_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** [CRITICAL]
            *   **Description:** A vulnerability in rclone's code allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running rclone.
            *   **Methods:**
                *   Exploiting a buffer overflow, memory corruption, or other code-level vulnerability.
                *   Likelihood: Low
                *   Impact: Very High
                *   Effort: High to Very High
                *   Skill Level: Advanced to Expert
                *   Detection Difficulty: Hard to Very Hard
