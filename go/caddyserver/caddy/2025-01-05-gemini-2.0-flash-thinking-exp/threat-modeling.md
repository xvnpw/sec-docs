# Threat Model Analysis for caddyserver/caddy

## Threat: [Compromised ACME Account](./threats/compromised_acme_account.md)

- **Description:** An attacker gains access to the ACME account credentials used by Caddy (e.g., through exploiting vulnerabilities in how Caddy stores these credentials). The attacker can then revoke certificates for legitimate domains, issue certificates for domains they don't control, or disrupt the automatic certificate renewal process.
  - **Impact:** Service disruption due to revoked or expired certificates, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks if attacker-issued certificates are used, damage to reputation.
  - **Affected Component:** ACME Client (within Caddy)
  - **Risk Severity:** Critical
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Securely store ACME account credentials and registration details, restricting access.
    - Regularly monitor ACME account activity for suspicious actions.
    - Keep Caddy updated to the latest version with security patches related to ACME handling.

## Threat: [Insecure Caddyfile Configuration Leading to Information Disclosure](./threats/insecure_caddyfile_configuration_leading_to_information_disclosure.md)

- **Description:**  A misconfiguration in the Caddyfile, such as incorrect file serving directives or overly permissive access controls *within Caddy*, allows attackers to access sensitive files or directories that should not be publicly accessible (e.g., `.env` files, configuration files).
  - **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, including credentials, API keys, or internal application details.
  - **Affected Component:** Caddyfile Parser, File Server Directive
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Regularly review and audit the Caddyfile for security misconfigurations.
    - Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring file serving directives in Caddy.
    - Avoid serving sensitive files or directories directly through Caddy.
    - Utilize Caddy's built-in security features and directives appropriately.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Caddy Modules](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_caddy_modules.md)

- **Description:** A third-party Caddy module used in the application contains a security vulnerability (e.g., remote code execution, cross-site scripting). If exploited, this vulnerability could compromise the Caddy server and potentially the underlying application.
  - **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the server, data breaches, denial of service, or other impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
  - **Affected Component:**  Specific Third-Party Module, Caddy's Module Loading Mechanism
  - **Risk Severity:**  Critical to High (depending on the vulnerability)
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Thoroughly vet and audit third-party modules before using them.
    - Keep all Caddy modules updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Subscribe to security advisories for the modules being used.
    - Consider using only well-maintained and reputable modules.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on Caddy Modules](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_caddy_modules.md)

- **Description:** The development or distribution process of a Caddy module is compromised, leading to the inclusion of malicious code within the module. When the application uses this compromised module, the malicious code is executed by Caddy.
  - **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the server, data breaches, backdoors, or other malicious activities.
  - **Affected Component:** Specific Third-Party Module, Caddy's Module Loading Mechanism
  - **Risk Severity:** Critical
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Obtain modules from trusted sources.
    - Verify the integrity of module downloads (e.g., using checksums).
    - Implement security scanning and analysis of modules before deployment.
    - Consider using signed modules if available.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Misconfigured Reverse Proxy](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_misconfigured_reverse_proxy.md)

- **Description:**  A misconfigured reverse proxy setup *within Caddy* allows an attacker to manipulate the destination of requests, potentially making requests to internal network resources or external services that should not be accessible.
  - **Impact:** Access to internal services, potential for data exfiltration, abuse of external services, and other security risks depending on the target.
  - **Affected Component:** Reverse Proxy Handler
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict whitelisting of allowed backend targets within Caddy's reverse proxy configuration.
    - Avoid using user input directly in the backend URL within Caddy's configuration.
    - Disable or restrict access to unnecessary proxy features in Caddy.

## Threat: [Header Injection Attacks via Reverse Proxy](./threats/header_injection_attacks_via_reverse_proxy.md)

- **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in how Caddy handles HTTP headers during reverse proxying could allow attackers to inject malicious headers into requests forwarded to backend services. This could lead to various attacks, such as HTTP response splitting or cache poisoning.
  - **Impact:**  Compromise of backend services, cache poisoning leading to serving malicious content, potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) if response headers are manipulated.
  - **Affected Component:** Reverse Proxy Handler, Header Processing
  - **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the vulnerability and backend service)
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Ensure Caddy is updated to the latest version with security patches.
    - Carefully review and sanitize any headers being passed through or modified by the reverse proxy configuration in Caddy.
    - Implement security measures on backend services to mitigate header injection risks.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion.md)

- **Description:**  A malicious actor sends a large number of requests or specially crafted requests that consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) on the Caddy server itself, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
  - **Impact:** Service unavailability, impacting users' ability to access the application.
  - **Affected Component:** Request Handling, Connection Management
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement rate limiting and connection limits within Caddy's configuration.
    - Configure appropriate timeouts and resource limits within Caddy.
    - Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic before it reaches Caddy.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation (Less Likely)](./threats/privilege_escalation__less_likely_.md)

- **Description:** Although Caddy is designed to run with minimal privileges, a vulnerability in Caddy's core or a module could potentially be exploited to gain higher privileges on the server.
  - **Impact:** Full compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to perform any action.
  - **Affected Component:** Core Caddy Functionality, Module Execution
  - **Risk Severity:** Critical (if exploitable)
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Keep Caddy and all modules updated to the latest versions.
    - Follow security best practices for server hardening and privilege management.
    - Run Caddy under a dedicated, non-root user account.
