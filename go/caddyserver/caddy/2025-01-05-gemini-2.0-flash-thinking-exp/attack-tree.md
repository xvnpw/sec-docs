## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Caddy](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_caddy.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. All other nodes and paths aim to achieve this. Securing the application against Caddy-specific threats directly prevents this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Caddy Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_caddy_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers target weaknesses in how Caddy's configuration is managed (Caddyfile, dynamic config, etc.).
Successful exploitation allows attackers to manipulate Caddy's behavior, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Caddy Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_caddy_core_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers exploit flaws within Caddy's main codebase.
This can involve memory corruption bugs, logic errors in request handling, or vulnerabilities in protocol implementations (HTTP/2, QUIC).
Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or bypassing security controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Caddy Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_caddy_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers target vulnerabilities within Caddy plugins (third-party extensions).
Plugins can introduce their own security flaws, which attackers can leverage.
Successful exploitation can range from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the plugin's functionality and the vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Automatic HTTPS Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_automatic_https_management_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers target weaknesses in Caddy's automatic TLS certificate management (using ACME).
This includes vulnerabilities during certificate issuance, domain validation, or the ACME protocol implementation itself.
Successful exploitation can lead to MITM attacks, allowing attackers to intercept and manipulate traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Caddy's Reverse Proxy Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_caddy's_reverse_proxy_functionality.md)

Attackers exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in Caddy's reverse proxy feature.
This can involve manipulating proxy settings to perform SSRF attacks, bypassing path sanitization to achieve path traversal, or crafting ambiguous requests for HTTP request smuggling.
Successful exploitation can lead to accessing internal resources, information disclosure, or bypassing security controls on backend servers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Caddy Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Caddyfile Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_caddy_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_caddyfile_injection.md)

Attackers inject malicious directives into the Caddyfile, potentially through external inputs like environment variables or DNS records.
This allows them to modify Caddy's behavior, potentially executing arbitrary commands or exposing sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Caddy Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Insecure Caddyfile Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_caddy_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_insecure_caddyfile_permissions.md)

Attackers gain unauthorized access to the Caddyfile and directly modify it to inject malicious configurations.
This grants them control over Caddy's behavior and can lead to full server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Caddy Core Vulnerabilities -> Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_caddy_core_vulnerabilities_-_memory_corruption_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers craft specific requests to trigger memory corruption errors (e.g., buffer overflows) in Caddy's core.
Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Caddy Plugin Vulnerabilities -> Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Used Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_caddy_plugin_vulnerabilities_-_exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_used_plugins.md)

Attackers identify and exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the Caddy plugins being used by the application.
The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the plugin, but can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Caddy Plugin Vulnerabilities -> Malicious Plugin Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_caddy_plugin_vulnerabilities_-_malicious_plugin_injection.md)

Attackers, with sufficient access, inject a malicious plugin into the Caddy installation.
This grants them full control over Caddy's functionality and the underlying server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Automatic HTTPS Management Vulnerabilities -> Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack during Certificate Issuance](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_automatic_https_management_vulnerabilities_-_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_during_certific_e44a5246.md)

Attackers intercept the ACME challenge process during certificate issuance, potentially by compromising DNS or network infrastructure.
This allows them to obtain a legitimate certificate for the domain and perform MITM attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Automatic HTTPS Management Vulnerabilities -> Domain Takeover leading to Certificate Issuance](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_automatic_https_management_vulnerabilities_-_domain_takeover_leading_to_certificate_issuance.md)

Attackers gain control of the application's domain (e.g., through registrar compromise) and then trigger certificate issuance for a server they control.
This allows them to impersonate the application and intercept user traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in the Go libraries that Caddy depends on.
The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Caddy's Reverse Proxy Functionality -> Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_caddy's_reverse_proxy_functionality_-_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

Attackers manipulate Caddy's reverse proxy configuration to make requests to internal or external resources that they shouldn't have access to.
This can allow them to access internal services, exfiltrate data, or pivot to other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Caddy's Reverse Proxy Functionality -> HTTP Request Smuggling](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_caddy's_reverse_proxy_functionality_-_http_request_smuggling.md)

Attackers craft ambiguous HTTP requests that are interpreted differently by Caddy and the backend server it proxies to.
This can allow them to bypass security controls or inject malicious requests into the backend.
