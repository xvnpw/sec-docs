            "security model is a crucial factor contributing to this attack surface."

        print("    * Exfiltrate data by configuring Caddy to forward information.")
        print("    * Create backdoors by setting up new admin users (if the module exists and is vulnerable).")
        print("  * **Exploitation:** The attacker sends an HTTP POST request to the `/load` endpoint of the admin API.")
        print("  * **Impact:** Caddy processes the malicious Caddyfile, reconfiguring the server according to the attacker's instructions.")

        print("\n### 4. Deeper Dive into Potential Attack Vectors:")
        print("Beyond the direct `/load` injection, other attack vectors include:")
        print("  * **Configuration Manipulation for DoS:** Modifying the configuration to consume excessive resources.")
        print("  * **Information Disclosure via Configuration Retrieval:** Accessing `/config/` to reveal sensitive data.")
        print("  * **Abuse of Specific Endpoints:** Exploiting other API endpoints for malicious purposes depending on enabled modules.")
        print("  * **Chaining Attacks:** Using the compromised Caddy server as a stepping stone to attack other systems.")

        print("\n### 6. Comprehensive Impact Analysis (Expanded):")
        print("The impact of an unsecured admin API is far-reaching and can be catastrophic:")
        print("  * **Full Server Compromise and Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Gaining complete control over the server.")
        print("  * **Data Exfiltration:** Accessing and stealing sensitive data.")

        print("Implementing the following mitigation strategies is crucial:")
        print("  * **Strong Authentication and Authorization:**")

        print("    * **Mutual TLS (mTLS) Authentication:** The most secure option, requiring client certificates.")
        print("    * **API Keys (with caution):** If programmatic access is needed, use API keys with restricted scopes and secure storage.")
        print("  * **Network Security and Access Control:**")
        print("    * **Restrict Access to Trusted Networks/IP Addresses:** Use firewalls or network segmentation.")
        print("    * **VPNs and Secure Tunnels:** Require administrators to connect through secure channels.")
        print("    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only grant access to authorized personnel.")
        print("  * **Configuration Management and Security Hardening:**")
        print("    * **Disable the Admin API in Production (if not necessary):** The most secure approach if not actively used.")
        print("    * **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC):** Manage configurations securely and consistently.")
        print("    * **Secure Defaults:** Ensure the default configuration does not expose the API.")
        print("  * **Monitoring and Alerting:**")
        print("    * **Log Admin API Access:** Track access attempts for auditing and detection.")
        print("    * **Set Up Alerts for Suspicious Activity:** Monitor for unusual access patterns or failed attempts.")
        print("  * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Proactively identify vulnerabilities.")
        print("  * **Principle of Least Privilege for API Access:** Limit the permissions of any programmatic access.")
        print("  * **Regular Updates and Patching:** Keep Caddy and its dependencies up to date.")
