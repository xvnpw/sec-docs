## Deep Dive Analysis: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Reverse Proxy in Caddy

This document provides a deep analysis of the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack surface within an application utilizing Caddy as a reverse proxy. We will dissect the threat, explore potential vulnerabilities, and outline comprehensive mitigation strategies.

**Understanding the Attack Vector in the Caddy Context:**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the inherent functionality of a reverse proxy. Caddy, when configured as a reverse proxy using the `reverse_proxy` directive, acts as an intermediary, forwarding client requests to backend servers. The danger arises when the *destination* of these forwarded requests can be influenced, directly or indirectly, by attacker-controlled input.

**How Caddy's `reverse_proxy` Facilitates SSRF:**

* **Dynamic Upstream Selection:**  Caddy's `reverse_proxy` directive can be configured to dynamically determine the upstream server based on various factors, including:
    * **Request Headers:**  Attackers might manipulate headers like `Host`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, or custom headers to redirect the proxy to unintended targets.
    * **Request Path/Query Parameters:**  If the upstream target is derived from parts of the URL, attackers can inject malicious URLs.
    * **Template Functions and Placeholders:** Caddy allows the use of template functions and placeholders within the `reverse_proxy` directive. If user-controlled data is incorporated into these templates without proper sanitization, it can lead to SSRF.
    * **Admin API Misuse:** While less direct, if the Caddy Admin API is exposed and credentials are compromised, attackers could reconfigure the `reverse_proxy` to point to malicious servers.

* **Lack of Built-in Input Validation:** Caddy, by default, doesn't impose strict validation on the upstream targets specified in the `reverse_proxy` directive. It trusts the configuration provided. This responsibility falls squarely on the developers configuring Caddy.

* **Default Openness:**  Without specific restrictions, Caddy's reverse proxy will attempt to connect to any valid URL or IP address, both internal and external.

**Detailed Breakdown of Potential Vulnerabilities:**

1. **Header-Based SSRF:**
    * **Scenario:** The `reverse_proxy` directive uses a request header to determine the upstream target.
    * **Caddyfile Example:**
        ```caddy
        example.com {
            reverse_proxy {header.X-Upstream}
        }
        ```
    * **Attack:** An attacker sends a request with a crafted `X-Upstream` header pointing to an internal service (e.g., `http://localhost:6379` for Redis) or an external malicious server.
    * **Impact:** Access to internal services, potential data leakage from internal systems, or launching attacks from the Caddy server's IP.

2. **Path/Query Parameter Based SSRF:**
    * **Scenario:** The upstream target is extracted from the request path or query parameters.
    * **Caddyfile Example:**
        ```caddy
        example.com {
            handle_path /proxy/* {
                reverse_proxy {$path.segments.2}
            }
        }
        ```
    * **Attack:** An attacker crafts a URL like `https://example.com/proxy/http://internal-service/sensitive-data`. Caddy extracts `http://internal-service/sensitive-data` and attempts to proxy the request.
    * **Impact:** Similar to header-based SSRF, potentially exposing internal resources.

3. **SSRF via Template Functions and Placeholders:**
    * **Scenario:** The `reverse_proxy` directive uses template functions or placeholders that incorporate user-provided data without proper sanitization.
    * **Caddyfile Example (Illustrative, might require custom modules):**
        ```caddy
        example.com {
            reverse_proxy {env.UPSTREAM_PREFIX}{query.target}
        }
        ```
    * **Attack:** If the `UPSTREAM_PREFIX` is something like `http://` and the attacker provides `target=internal-service/api`, the resulting upstream becomes `http://internal-service/api`.
    * **Impact:** Highly dependent on the specific template logic, but can lead to arbitrary upstream targets.

4. **SSRF via Open Redirects and Caching:**
    * **Scenario:** While not directly a Caddy vulnerability, if the backend services Caddy proxies to have open redirect vulnerabilities, an attacker could chain these vulnerabilities. They could manipulate Caddy to proxy to a vulnerable backend, which then redirects Caddy to an internal resource.
    * **Attack:** Attacker sends a request that makes Caddy proxy to a vulnerable backend URL, which redirects Caddy to an internal service.
    * **Impact:** Indirect access to internal resources via the backend service.

5. **SSRF via Admin API Misconfiguration:**
    * **Scenario:** The Caddy Admin API is exposed without proper authentication or authorization.
    * **Attack:** An attacker gains access to the Admin API and modifies the Caddy configuration to change the `reverse_proxy` target to a malicious server.
    * **Impact:** Complete control over the reverse proxy functionality, allowing for arbitrary requests.

**Impact Assessment (Expanded):**

* **Access to Internal Resources:** This is the most common and direct impact. Attackers can interact with internal databases, APIs, and other services that are not intended to be publicly accessible. This can lead to:
    * **Data Breaches:** Accessing sensitive data stored within internal systems.
    * **Internal System Compromise:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in internal services.
    * **Lateral Movement:** Using the compromised Caddy server as a pivot point to attack other internal systems.

* **Potential for Further Exploitation of Internal Systems:** Once access to an internal system is gained, attackers can leverage other vulnerabilities within that system to escalate privileges or gain deeper access to the internal network.

* **Data Exfiltration:**  Attackers can use the Caddy server to exfiltrate sensitive data by making requests to external servers under their control, sending the data within the request body or headers.

* **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    * **Internal DoS:**  Flooding internal services with requests via the Caddy server.
    * **External DoS:**  Using the Caddy server to launch attacks against external targets, potentially masking the attacker's origin.

* **Cloud Metadata Exploitation:** In cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure), attackers can use SSRF to access instance metadata endpoints (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254`). This metadata often contains sensitive information like API keys, access tokens, and instance roles, allowing for further compromise of the cloud environment.

**Risk Severity (Justification for High):**

The risk severity is classified as **High** due to the potential for significant impact across confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Successful SSRF exploitation can lead to:

* **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposure of sensitive internal data.
* **Integrity Compromise:** Modification of data within internal systems.
* **Availability Disruption:** Denial of service of both internal and external services.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Breaches of data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
* **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust from users and stakeholders.

**Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and Caddy-Specific):**

1. **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Focus:** Validate all user-provided input that could influence the `reverse_proxy` target (headers, path segments, query parameters).
    * **Implementation:**
        * **Allow Lists:** Define a strict set of allowed upstream hosts or patterns. Reject any requests that don't match. This is the most effective approach.
        * **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to validate the format of the upstream target.
        * **URL Parsing and Validation:**  Parse the potential upstream URL and validate its components (scheme, hostname, port).
        * **Avoid Directly Using User Input:** If possible, avoid directly using user input to construct the upstream target. Instead, map user input to predefined, safe upstream configurations.

2. **Implement Allow Lists for Allowed Upstream Hosts/Networks:**
    * **Focus:** Explicitly define the permissible destinations for the `reverse_proxy`.
    * **Implementation (Caddyfile Example - using a hypothetical plugin or custom logic):**
        ```caddy
        example.com {
            @allowedUpstreams {
                host internal-api.local
                host external-service.com
                ip 192.168.1.0/24
            }
            reverse_proxy @allowedUpstreams {header.X-Upstream}
        }
        ```
    * **Note:** Caddy doesn't have built-in support for complex allow lists based on hosts or IPs directly within the `reverse_proxy` directive. This often requires custom logic or plugins.

3. **Restrict Protocols and Ports:**
    * **Focus:** Limit the protocols and ports that the `reverse_proxy` can connect to.
    * **Implementation (Caddyfile):** While direct port restriction isn't a built-in `reverse_proxy` feature, you can achieve this through network-level firewalls or by proxying through another service that enforces port restrictions. For protocol restriction, ensure your backend services are only accessible via the intended protocol (e.g., HTTPS).

4. **Disable or Restrict Access to the Admin API:**
    * **Focus:** Secure the Caddy Admin API to prevent unauthorized reconfiguration.
    * **Implementation (Caddyfile):**
        ```caddy
        {
            admin off # Disable the admin API entirely
            # OR
            admin 127.0.0.1:2019 # Only allow access from localhost
            # AND
            # Configure authentication (e.g., basic auth)
        }
        ```
    * **Best Practice:** Disable the Admin API in production environments unless absolutely necessary. If required, restrict access to trusted networks and implement strong authentication.

5. **Network Segmentation:**
    * **Focus:** Isolate the Caddy server from sensitive internal networks.
    * **Implementation:** Use firewalls and network policies to control traffic flow, preventing the Caddy server from directly accessing critical internal resources.

6. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Focus:** Run the Caddy process with the minimum necessary privileges.
    * **Implementation:** Avoid running Caddy as root. Use a dedicated user account with limited permissions.

7. **Regular Updates and Patching:**
    * **Focus:** Keep Caddy and its dependencies up-to-date to patch any known vulnerabilities.

8. **Security Headers (Defense in Depth):**
    * **Focus:** While not directly preventing SSRF, security headers like `Content-Security-Policy` can help mitigate the impact of successful exploitation by limiting the actions the browser can take.

9. **Rate Limiting:**
    * **Focus:** Implement rate limiting on the Caddy server to mitigate potential DoS attacks launched through SSRF.

10. **Logging and Monitoring:**
    * **Focus:** Implement comprehensive logging to detect and respond to suspicious activity.
    * **Implementation:** Log all requests handled by the `reverse_proxy`, including the upstream target. Monitor these logs for unusual patterns or attempts to access internal resources.

11. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    * **Focus:** Deploy a WAF in front of Caddy to detect and block malicious requests, including those attempting SSRF.

**Developer Guidance:**

* **Secure Coding Practices:** Educate developers on the risks of SSRF and secure coding practices.
* **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of Caddy configurations, specifically focusing on the `reverse_proxy` directive and how upstream targets are determined.
* **Security Testing:** Implement security testing practices, including static analysis (SAST) and dynamic analysis (DAST), to identify potential SSRF vulnerabilities.
* **Documentation:** Clearly document the intended behavior and security considerations of the Caddy configuration.

**Conclusion:**

SSRF via reverse proxy in Caddy is a significant security risk that demands careful attention during configuration and development. By understanding the attack vectors, implementing robust mitigation strategies, and fostering a security-conscious development culture, organizations can significantly reduce their exposure to this threat. The key lies in treating user-provided input that influences the `reverse_proxy` target with extreme caution and implementing strong allow lists and validation mechanisms. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are crucial for maintaining a secure environment.
