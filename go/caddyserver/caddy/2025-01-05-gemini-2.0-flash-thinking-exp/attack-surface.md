# Attack Surface Analysis for caddyserver/caddy

## Attack Surface: [Caddyfile Misconfigurations](./attack_surfaces/caddyfile_misconfigurations.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect or overly permissive configurations within the Caddyfile that can expose unintended functionality or resources.
    *   **How Caddy Contributes:** Caddy relies heavily on the Caddyfile for routing, access control, and other critical settings. A poorly written Caddyfile directly translates to security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A misconfigured `reverse_proxy` directive that allows access to internal services without proper authentication, or an overly broad `file_server` directive exposing sensitive files.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal resources, data breaches, server-side request forgery (SSRF), or the ability to manipulate server behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege when configuring routing and access controls.
        *   Regularly review and audit the Caddyfile for potential misconfigurations.
        *   Use specific path matching instead of overly broad wildcards.
        *   Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for sensitive endpoints.
        *   Consider using Caddy's `admin` directive to restrict access to the admin API.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Admin API](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_admin_api.md)

*   **Description:** The Caddy admin API, if enabled and accessible without proper authentication or authorization, allows for remote control and reconfiguration of the server.
    *   **How Caddy Contributes:** Caddy provides a powerful admin API for managing the server. Leaving it unprotected allows attackers to exploit this functionality.
    *   **Example:** An attacker accessing the `/load` endpoint of the admin API without authentication to inject a malicious Caddyfile, effectively taking over the server.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, remote code execution, data exfiltration, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the admin API by setting a strong `admin` directive password or using mutual TLS authentication.
        *   Restrict access to the admin API to trusted networks or specific IP addresses.
        *   Disable the admin API in production environments if not strictly necessary.

## Attack Surface: [ACME Protocol Exploits](./attack_surfaces/acme_protocol_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks targeting the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol used by Caddy for automatic TLS certificate issuance.
    *   **How Caddy Contributes:** Caddy's automatic TLS management relies on the ACME protocol. Vulnerabilities in the ACME implementation or the validation process can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploiting a domain control validation bypass in the ACME process to obtain a valid TLS certificate for a domain they don't control, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Impact:**  Loss of trust, man-in-the-middle attacks, impersonation of the legitimate website.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Caddy is updated to the latest version, which includes fixes for known ACME vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor certificate issuance and renewal processes for any anomalies.
        *   Understand the different ACME challenge types and their security implications.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Reverse Proxy](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_reverse_proxy.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigured `reverse_proxy` directives can allow attackers to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources from the Caddy server.
    *   **How Caddy Contributes:** Caddy's reverse proxy functionality, while powerful, can be abused if not configured with proper restrictions.
    *   **Example:** An attacker manipulating a request to the Caddy server to make it forward a request to an internal service that should not be publicly accessible, or to an external service to leak sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential for further exploitation of internal systems, data exfiltration, denial of service of internal or external services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully validate and sanitize any user-provided input that influences the `reverse_proxy` target.
        *   Implement allow lists for allowed upstream hosts or networks.
        *   Restrict the protocols and ports that the reverse proxy can connect to.
        *   Disable or restrict access to the admin API to prevent attackers from reconfiguring the reverse proxy.
