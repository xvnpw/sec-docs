## Attack Tree Path: [Caddyfile Misconfiguration -> Weak/Default Caddyfile -> Expose Internal Services / Default Admin Interface Exposed](./attack_tree_paths/caddyfile_misconfiguration_-_weakdefault_caddyfile_-_expose_internal_services__default_admin_interfa_0e9818fc.md)

*   **[[Weak/Default Caddyfile]] (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** Using a default or overly permissive Caddyfile without proper customization. This is a foundational error that can lead to many other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration, especially in development or less experienced setups)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Can lead to exposure of internal services, admin interface, and other vulnerabilities)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (Using a default file requires no effort)
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires review of the Caddyfile, but might be overlooked)
    *  **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Expose Internal Services:** A weak Caddyfile might inadvertently expose internal services or APIs.
        *   **Default Admin Interface Exposed:** The default admin interface might be accessible without authentication.

*   **[Expose Internal Services] (Part of High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Description:** Internal services or APIs that should not be publicly accessible are exposed due to the weak Caddyfile.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Direct consequence of a weak Caddyfile)
    *   **Impact:** High (Direct access to sensitive data and functionality)
    *   **Effort:** Low (If exposed, access might be trivial)
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Might be detected in access logs)

*   **[[Default Admin Interface Exposed]] (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** The Caddy admin interface is accessible without proper authentication or access control.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Most users are aware of the need to secure it, but it *does* happen)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete control of the Caddy server)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (If exposed, access might be trivial)
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Default admin interface is easily identifiable)

## Attack Tree Path: [Caddyfile Misconfiguration -> Directory Listing Enabled -> Expose Sensitive Files/Dirs](./attack_tree_paths/caddyfile_misconfiguration_-_directory_listing_enabled_-_expose_sensitive_filesdirs.md)

*   **[Directory Listing Enabled] (Part of High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Description:** Directory listing is unintentionally enabled, allowing attackers to browse the file system.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration)
    *   **Impact:** Variable, but potentially High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **[[Expose Sensitive Files/Dirs]] (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** Sensitive files, configuration files, source code, or backup files are exposed due to enabled directory listing.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Direct consequence of enabled directory listing)
    *   **Impact:** High (Exposure of sensitive data)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (Simply browsing directories)
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Might be noticed in logs, but could be missed)

## Attack Tree Path: [Caddyfile Misconfiguration -> Insecure Reverse Proxy Config -> Directly Access Internal Services](./attack_tree_paths/caddyfile_misconfiguration_-_insecure_reverse_proxy_config_-_directly_access_internal_services.md)

*   **[Insecure Reverse Proxy Config] (Part of High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Description:** Misconfigured reverse proxy settings, such as improper header handling or lack of authentication for internal services.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common with complex setups)
    *   **Impact:** Variable, but potentially High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

*   **[[Directly Access Internal Services]] (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** An attacker can bypass security controls and directly access sensitive internal APIs or databases due to the misconfigured reverse proxy.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Direct consequence of insecure reverse proxy configuration)
    *   **Impact:** High (Direct access to sensitive data and functionality)
    *   **Effort:** Low (If misconfigured, access might be trivial)
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Might be detected in access logs)
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Bypassing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   Directly querying internal databases or APIs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Caddy Administration/API -> Unauthorized Access to Admin Interface -> Weak/Default Password](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_caddy_administrationapi_-_unauthorized_access_to_admin_interface_-_weakdefault_password.md)

*    **[[Unauthorized Access to Admin Interface]] (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Caddy admin interface, allowing them to reconfigure the server.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires credential compromise or misconfiguration)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete control of the Caddy server)
    *   **Effort:** Variable (Depends on the method of compromise)
    *   **Skill Level:** Variable (Could range from Script Kiddie to Advanced)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Failed login attempts might be logged)

*   **[[Weak/Default Password]] (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** The default admin password is not changed, or a weak, easily guessable password is used.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Most users are aware of the need to change it, but it still happens)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete control of the Caddy server)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (Trivial if the default password is unchanged)
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Default password usage is easily identifiable)

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Caddy Administration/API -> Brute-Force Admin API Credentials -> Weak/Default Password](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_caddy_administrationapi_-_brute-force_admin_api_credentials_-_weakdefault_password.md)

*   **[Brute-Force Admin API Credentials] (Part of High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** An attacker attempts to guess the admin API credentials.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on password strength and rate limiting)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (If successful, complete control of Caddy)
        *   **Effort:** Medium (Depends on password complexity and rate limiting)
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Failed login attempts might be logged)

*   **[[Weak/Default Password]] (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** The default admin password is not changed, or a weak, easily guessable password is used.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Most users are aware of the need to change it, but it still happens)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete control of the Caddy server)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (Trivial if the default password is unchanged)
