# BUSINESS POSTURE

Caddy is a powerful, open-source web server written in Go. It's designed for ease of use and security, with automatic HTTPS being a core feature. Based on the GitHub repository, here's a breakdown of the business posture:

Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a user-friendly web server that simplifies HTTPS configuration.
*   Offer a secure-by-default experience, minimizing manual configuration for security features.
*   Maintain high performance and efficiency.
*   Support a wide range of use cases, from simple static sites to complex reverse proxy setups.
*   Foster a strong community and ecosystem around the project.
*   Offer commercial options for users who need additional features or support.

Business Risks:

*   Vulnerabilities in the Caddy codebase could lead to server compromise, data breaches, or denial-of-service attacks.
*   Misconfiguration by users (despite the focus on ease of use) could expose sensitive data or create security vulnerabilities.
*   Dependence on third-party libraries (Go modules) introduces supply chain risks.
*   Failure to keep up with evolving web standards and security best practices could render Caddy less effective or secure over time.
*   Competition from other web servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache) could impact adoption and market share.
*   Reputational damage from security incidents could erode trust in the project.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Automatic HTTPS: Caddy obtains and renews TLS certificates automatically via Let's Encrypt or ZeroSSL. This is a core feature and is described extensively in the documentation.
*   security control: Secure defaults: Caddy is designed with secure defaults, minimizing the need for manual security configuration. This is evident throughout the codebase and documentation.
*   security control: Memory safety: Being written in Go, Caddy benefits from Go's memory safety features, reducing the risk of buffer overflows and other memory-related vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Regular updates: The project has a frequent release cycle, indicating that security patches and updates are likely to be addressed promptly.
*   security control: Community scrutiny: As an open-source project, Caddy benefits from scrutiny by a large community of developers and security researchers.
*   security control: HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support: Caddy supports modern HTTP protocols, which offer performance and security improvements.
*   security control: Security headers: Caddy allows easy configuration of security headers like HSTS, CSP, etc. (mentioned in documentation).
*   security control: Access logs: Caddy provides access logging capabilities, which are crucial for auditing and incident response.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Third-party library vulnerabilities: While Go's package management system helps, there's always a risk of vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   accepted risk: User misconfiguration: Even with secure defaults, users can still misconfigure Caddy, creating security risks.
*   accepted risk: Zero-day vulnerabilities: Like any software, Caddy is susceptible to unknown vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Denial of Service: While Caddy is performant, it's still vulnerable to DoS attacks, especially if not properly configured with rate limiting or other mitigation techniques.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a robust vulnerability disclosure program (VDP) to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
*   Perform regular security audits and penetration testing, both internally and by external experts.
*   Integrate Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools into the build process to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
*   Implement fuzzing to proactively discover potential vulnerabilities.
*   Consider developing a formal security model and threat model for Caddy.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Caddy itself primarily deals with serving content and doesn't inherently manage user authentication for websites. Authentication is typically handled by applications behind Caddy or through Caddy modules (plugins).
    *   Requirement: If authentication is implemented via modules, ensure secure storage of credentials (e.g., using appropriate hashing algorithms) and protection against common authentication attacks (e.g., brute-force, credential stuffing).
    *   Requirement: Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be considered where appropriate.

*   Authorization:
    *   Caddy can control access to resources based on various criteria (e.g., IP address, request path).
    *   Requirement: Access control mechanisms should follow the principle of least privilege.
    *   Requirement: Ensure that authorization checks are performed consistently and correctly, avoiding bypass vulnerabilities.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Caddy itself handles incoming HTTP requests and must be robust against malformed or malicious input.
    *   Requirement: All input from clients (headers, request bodies, query parameters) should be strictly validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, command injection).
    *   Requirement: Caddy modules should also perform thorough input validation.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Caddy's core functionality relies on TLS for secure communication.
    *   Requirement: Use strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and protocols (e.g., TLS 1.3).
    *   Requirement: Ensure proper key management and protection.
    *   Requirement: Avoid using weak or deprecated ciphers.
    *   Requirement: If custom cryptography is used in modules, it should be implemented by security experts and thoroughly reviewed.

```

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   Automated Build: GitHub Actions provides a consistent and reproducible build environment.
*   Linters: Code linters (like `golangci-lint`) are used to enforce code style and identify potential issues.
*   Tests: Comprehensive tests are run to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   Static Analysis (SAST): Go's built-in security checks and potentially additional SAST tools are used to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   Software Composition Analysis (SCA): While not explicitly shown in the diagram, SCA should be part of the build process to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies. This is likely done using tools like `go mod`'s vulnerability checking or dedicated SCA tools.
*   Signed Releases: Caddy releases are likely signed to ensure their integrity.
*   Docker Image Security: The Docker build process should follow best practices for creating secure Docker images (e.g., using minimal base images, avoiding running as root).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Serving web content securely and reliably.
*   Automatic HTTPS certificate management.
*   Providing a user-friendly and extensible web server platform.

Data to Protect:

*   TLS certificates and private keys (Highest sensitivity): Compromise would allow attackers to impersonate the server.
*   Website content (Variable sensitivity): Depending on the website, this could range from public information to highly sensitive data.
*   User data (Variable sensitivity): If Caddy is used to proxy requests to applications that handle user data, this data is also at risk.
*   Configuration files (High sensitivity): Contain sensitive information about the server setup, including potentially credentials for backend services.
*   Access logs (Medium sensitivity): Contain information about website visitors, which could be subject to privacy regulations.
