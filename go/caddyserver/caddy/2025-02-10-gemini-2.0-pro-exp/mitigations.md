# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for caddyserver/caddy

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit TLS Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/explicit_tls_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Requirements:** Determine the minimum TLS version and cipher suites required. Prioritize TLS 1.3. If TLS 1.2 is needed, document the specific clients and plan for phasing it out.
    2.  **Caddyfile Modification:** Open your `Caddyfile` (or JSON configuration).
    3.  **`tls` Directive:** Within the relevant site block (or globally), add or modify the `tls` directive.
    4.  **`protocols`:** Set `protocols` to `tls1.3` (or `tls1.2 tls1.3` if TLS 1.2 is *absolutely* required). Example: `protocols tls1.3`
    5.  **`ciphers`:** Set `ciphers` to a list of strong, modern cipher suites. Use a resource like the Mozilla SSL Configuration Generator, and update this list regularly. Example: `ciphers TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`
    6.  **`curves`:** Set `curves` to specify supported elliptic curves. Example: `curves x25519 p256 p384`
    7.  **`client_auth` (Optional):** If using mTLS, configure `client_auth`. This requires careful setup of client CAs and validation.
    8.  **Restart Caddy:** Restart Caddy: `sudo systemctl restart caddy` (or appropriate command).
    9.  **Verification:** Use tools like `ssllabs.com/ssltest` to verify your TLS configuration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Weak Cipher Suites (Severity: High):** Attackers could decrypt intercepted traffic.
    *   **Outdated TLS Versions (Severity: High):** TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are vulnerable to known attacks.
    *   **Downgrade Attacks (Severity: High):** Attackers can force a weaker protocol/cipher.
    *   **Missing Forward Secrecy (Severity: Medium):** Past sessions could be decrypted if the server's private key is compromised.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Weak Cipher Suites:** Risk reduced to near zero.
    *   **Outdated TLS Versions:** Risk eliminated.
    *   **Downgrade Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Missing Forward Secrecy:** Risk mitigated.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `protocols` is set to `tls1.2 tls1.3`. `ciphers` is *not* explicitly defined.

*   **Missing Implementation:** `ciphers` and `curves` are not explicitly defined. Add these to the `tls` directive. No mTLS, so `client_auth` is not relevant yet.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Trusted and Updated Plugins](./mitigation_strategies/trusted_and_updated_plugins.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Inventory:** List all installed Caddy plugins.
    2.  **Source Verification:** Verify each plugin came from a reputable source.
    3.  **Maintenance Check:** Check for recent activity (commits, releases, issue responses).
    4.  **Update Mechanism:** Use `caddy upgrade` (or similar) to update plugins.
    5.  **Regular Updates:** Schedule regular plugin updates.
    6.  **Code Review (Optional):** Review source code of critical plugins.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities (Severity: Variable, potentially High):** Exploitable vulnerabilities in plugins.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Severity: High):** Compromised plugin repositories distributing malicious versions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced by patching.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Risk mitigated by using trusted sources.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Plugins from the official Caddy repository. Updates are manual.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Establish a regular schedule for plugin updates. Consider monitoring plugin repositories for new releases.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Request Limits and Rate Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/request_limits_and_rate_limiting.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Traffic Patterns:** Determine appropriate limits.
    2.  **`limits` Directive:** In your `Caddyfile`, use the `limits` directive.
    3.  **`request_header`:** Set a reasonable maximum size (e.g., `10KB`).
    4.  **`request_body`:** Set a reasonable maximum size (e.g., `10MB`).
    5.  **Rate Limiting Plugin:** Install a rate limiting plugin (e.g., `github.com/mholt/caddy-ratelimit`).
    6.  **`rate_limit` Directive:** Configure rate limiting rules:
        *   **Zone:** Unique identifier.
        *   **Key:** Attribute to use (e.g., client IP).
        *   **Rate:** Max requests within a time window.
        *   **Burst:** Max requests in a short burst.
        *   **Window:** Time window (e.g., 1 minute).
    7.  **Testing:** Test to avoid blocking legitimate users.
    8.  **Monitoring:** Monitor logs and adjust rules.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Large requests/rates overwhelm the server.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: Medium):** Guessing passwords by sending many requests.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):** Excessive requests consume resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk mitigated.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `request_body` limit is `20MB`. No `request_header` limit. No rate limiting.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Add a `request_header` limit. Install/configure a rate limiting plugin and define rules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring (Caddy Configuration Part)](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_logging_and_monitoring__caddy_configuration_part_.md)

*   **Description:** (Focusing on Caddy configuration aspects)
    1.  **Enable Access Logs:** Ensure Caddy's access logs are enabled in the `Caddyfile`. Use a structured format (JSON). Include client IP, method, URL, status, size, user agent.  Use the `log` directive and its sub-directives.
    2.  **Enable Error Logs:** Ensure Caddy's error logs are enabled.
    3.  **Log Rotation (Caddy Config):** Configure log rotation *within Caddy* using the `log` directive's options (if using Caddy's built-in rotation; otherwise, use an external tool like `logrotate`). Specify `roll_size`, `roll_keep`, etc.
    4. **Log format:** Use `format` directive to specify log format.

*   **Threats Mitigated:** (Same as before, but this section focuses on the *Caddy configuration* part of the solution)
    *   **Undetected Attacks (Severity: High):** Attacks may go unnoticed.
    *   **Difficult Incident Response (Severity: High):** Lack of logs hinders investigation.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Severity: Medium):** Logging may be required by regulations.

*   **Impact:** (Same as before)
    *   **Undetected Attacks:** Risk reduced by providing visibility.
    *   **Difficult Incident Response:** Improved incident response.
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Helps meet compliance.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Access/error logs enabled, written to local files. Log rotation configured (likely externally, not within Caddy).

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Ensure log rotation is configured *optimally* within the `Caddyfile` if possible.  Verify the log format includes all necessary fields. The *centralized logging and monitoring tools* are separate and still missing, but those aren't direct Caddy configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Caddy API Security](./mitigation_strategies/caddy_api_security.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Authentication:** Enable authentication (API keys, mTLS).
    2.  **API Key Management:** Generate strong, unique keys. Store securely.
    3.  **mTLS Configuration (If Applicable):** Require/validate client certificates. Secure CA.
    4.  **Authorization:** Restrict API access based on roles/permissions.
    5.  **Network Restrictions:** Restrict access to specific IPs/networks (using Caddy's `remote_ip` matcher if possible, or external firewall rules).
    6.  **Rate Limiting:** Apply rate limiting to the API (using a Caddy plugin if necessary).
    7.  **Auditing:** Enable detailed logging of API requests.
    8.  **Regular Review:** Review API logs and configurations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized API Access (Severity: Critical):** Control of the server.
    *   **Configuration Tampering (Severity: High):** DoS or data breaches.
    *   **API Abuse (Severity: Medium):** Performance degradation or DoS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized API Access:** Risk eliminated.
    *   **Configuration Tampering:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **API Abuse:** Risk mitigated.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not applicable. Not using the Caddy API.

*   **Missing Implementation:** If the Caddy API is enabled, *all* steps are critical.
