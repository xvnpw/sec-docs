# Threat Model Analysis for caddyserver/caddy

## Threat: [Weak TLS Configuration](./threats/weak_tls_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit a weakly configured TLS setup *within Caddy* by performing downgrade attacks (e.g., BEAST, POODLE) to force the use of older, less secure protocols or cipher suites. This allows them to potentially eavesdrop on encrypted communication or perform man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact:** Confidentiality of data transmitted between the client and server is compromised. Attackers can intercept sensitive information like credentials, personal data, or financial details.

**Caddy Component Affected:** `tls` directive, TLS handshake process.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Explicitly configure the `tls` directive in the Caddyfile to enforce strong TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher) and preferred, secure cipher suites.
* Disable support for older, vulnerable protocols like SSLv3 and TLS 1.0 within Caddy's configuration.
* Regularly review and update the TLS configuration based on current security best practices for Caddy.
* Utilize tools like SSL Labs' SSL Server Test to assess the TLS configuration of the Caddy instance.

## Threat: [Exposure of Caddy Admin API without Authentication](./threats/exposure_of_caddy_admin_api_without_authentication.md)

**Description:** If the Caddy Admin API is exposed without proper authentication (e.g., default configuration or misconfiguration *within Caddy*), an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the API. This allows them to reconfigure the server, deploy malicious configurations, or even shut down the service remotely.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Caddy server, potential for data breaches, service disruption, and injection of malicious content.

**Caddy Component Affected:** Admin API, HTTP handlers for API endpoints.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the Caddy Admin API with strong authentication mechanisms, such as API keys or mutual TLS, as configured within Caddy.
* Restrict access to the Admin API to trusted networks or specific IP addresses using Caddy's configuration or firewall rules.
* Avoid exposing the Admin API publicly by configuring Caddy to listen on a non-public interface or using a firewall.
* Regularly review the Admin API configuration within the Caddyfile or via the API itself.

## Threat: [Caddyfile Injection](./threats/caddyfile_injection.md)

**Description:** If parts of the Caddyfile are dynamically generated *by the application interacting with Caddy* based on user input or external data without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious Caddy directives. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the Caddy process, redirection to malicious sites handled by Caddy, or other security breaches.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Caddy server, potential for data breaches, redirection of users to malicious sites, and arbitrary code execution on the server running Caddy.

**Caddy Component Affected:** Caddyfile parsing, dynamic configuration loading.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid dynamically generating Caddyfile content based on untrusted input.
* If dynamic generation is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization *before* passing data to Caddy's configuration mechanisms.
* Use parameterized configuration methods if available within the application's interaction with Caddy.

## Threat: [HTTP Request Smuggling via Caddy](./threats/http_request_smuggling_via_caddy.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit discrepancies in how *Caddy* and the backend application parse HTTP requests to smuggle malicious requests to the backend. This allows them to bypass Caddy's security controls and potentially execute commands or access sensitive data on the backend server. The vulnerability lies in Caddy's handling of HTTP requests.

**Impact:** Compromise of the backend application, potential for data breaches, unauthorized access, and remote code execution on the backend.

**Caddy Component Affected:** Reverse proxy functionality, HTTP request parsing.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Caddy and the backend application have consistent HTTP parsing behavior.
* Configure Caddy to normalize or sanitize incoming requests using available directives or modules.
* Regularly update Caddy to patch known HTTP parsing vulnerabilities.
* Implement strict input validation on the backend application as a defense-in-depth measure.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Caddy Modules](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_caddy_modules.md)

**Description:** Caddy's modular architecture allows for extending its functionality. However, vulnerabilities in third-party or even built-in *Caddy modules* could introduce security risks. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, cause denial of service within Caddy, or execute arbitrary code within the Caddy process.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from denial of service of the Caddy instance to complete server compromise.

**Caddy Component Affected:** Specific Caddy modules (e.g., authentication modules, proxy modules).

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the module and vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully vet and select modules from trusted sources for use with Caddy.
* Keep all Caddy modules updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Regularly review the list of installed modules in Caddy and remove any unnecessary ones.
* Subscribe to security advisories for the Caddy modules being used.

## Threat: [Exposure of Internal Services via Misconfigured Reverse Proxy](./threats/exposure_of_internal_services_via_misconfigured_reverse_proxy.md)

**Description:** If the reverse proxy functionality *within Caddy* is misconfigured, internal services that should not be publicly accessible might be exposed *through Caddy*. Attackers could then directly access these services via Caddy, potentially bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms intended for external access.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal services, potential for data breaches or compromise of internal systems.

**Caddy Component Affected:** Reverse proxy functionality, `reverse_proxy` directive.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully configure the `reverse_proxy` directive in the Caddyfile to only expose intended services.
* Implement strict access controls on internal services, even if they are behind Caddy.
* Regularly review the reverse proxy configuration within Caddy.

## Threat: [Failure to Update Caddy with Security Patches](./threats/failure_to_update_caddy_with_security_patches.md)

**Description:** Running an outdated version of *Caddy* exposes the application to known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases of Caddy. Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities within the Caddy process to compromise the server.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from denial of service to complete server compromise.

**Caddy Component Affected:** All components of Caddy.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Establish a regular update schedule for Caddy.
* Subscribe to Caddy's security advisories and release notes.
* Implement a testing process for Caddy updates before deploying them to production.
