## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Caddy Bugs [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_caddy_bugs__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This involves identifying a publicly known vulnerability in a specific version of Caddy. The attacker then finds if the target application is running that vulnerable version. If so, they either develop an exploit or find an existing one to leverage the vulnerability. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to completely compromise the application and the underlying server.
* **Why High-Risk/Critical:** Known vulnerabilities have public information and often readily available exploits, making them easier to exploit. The impact is typically high, potentially leading to full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Caddy's Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_caddy's_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Caddy relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. If any of these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them through Caddy. This requires identifying a vulnerable dependency that Caddy uses and crafting an attack that leverages Caddy's interaction with that dependency.
* **Why High-Risk/Critical:** Dependency vulnerabilities are common and can be overlooked. Exploiting them can have a similar impact to exploiting Caddy's own vulnerabilities, potentially leading to code execution or other severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigured Admin API [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigured_admin_api__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Caddy has an optional Admin API for runtime configuration. If this API is enabled and uses weak or default credentials, or has no authentication at all, an attacker can gain unauthorized access. Once authenticated (or without needing to authenticate), the attacker can modify Caddy's configuration to redirect traffic, inject malicious headers, or perform other actions that compromise the application.
* **Why High-Risk/Critical:** A misconfigured Admin API provides a direct and powerful control point over Caddy. It requires relatively low skill to exploit if weak credentials are used, and the impact can be immediate and severe.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigured Caddyfile/JSON [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigured_caddyfilejson__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Caddy's behavior is defined by its configuration file (Caddyfile or JSON). Misconfigurations, such as overly permissive reverse proxy rules, incorrect path handling, or failure to sanitize user input in configuration directives, can create vulnerabilities. For example, an open proxy configuration allows the attacker to use the Caddy server to proxy their own malicious traffic.
* **Why Critical:** Misconfiguration is a common issue and can directly expose the application to various attacks. While the likelihood might vary depending on the specific misconfiguration, the potential impact can range from information disclosure to full compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Smuggling Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_smuggling_vulnerability__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Request smuggling occurs when Caddy and the backend application interpret HTTP requests differently. An attacker crafts ambiguous requests that are parsed differently by Caddy and the backend. This allows the attacker to "smuggle" malicious requests to the backend, bypassing Caddy's security checks.
* **Why High-Risk/Critical:** Request smuggling can be difficult to detect and can allow attackers to bypass security controls, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious actions on the backend application. It requires a good understanding of HTTP protocols but can have a significant impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Logic [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_logic__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This involves finding flaws in how Caddy parses or processes incoming HTTP requests. By crafting specific, potentially malformed requests, an attacker can trigger unexpected behavior in Caddy. This could lead to security bypasses, denial of service, or other vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the flaw.
* **Why Critical:**  Flaws in request handling logic can be subtle and difficult to find but can have a significant impact if exploited, potentially allowing attackers to circumvent security measures or cause instability.
