# Attack Surface Analysis for caddyserver/caddy

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Caddyfile Permissions](./attack_surfaces/insecure_caddyfile_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** The Caddyfile, which configures Caddy, contains sensitive information about how the server operates. If the file permissions are too permissive, unauthorized users can read or modify it.
    *   **How Caddy Contributes:** Caddy *directly relies* on the Caddyfile for its configuration. Compromising this file allows for complete control over Caddy's behavior.
    *   **Example:** A user with shell access to the server can read the Caddyfile and discover backend server addresses or API keys. They could modify the Caddyfile to redirect traffic, serve malicious content, or disable security features.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Caddy instance, potential access to backend systems, serving of malicious content, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the Caddyfile has restrictive permissions (e.g., readable only by the Caddy process user).
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the Caddyfile. Use environment variables or external secret management.
        *   Regularly review and audit Caddyfile permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information via Admin API](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_via_admin_api.md)

*   **Description:** Caddy's Admin API allows for runtime configuration and management. If not properly secured, it can expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized control *over Caddy itself*.
    *   **How Caddy Contributes:** Caddy *provides* this API for dynamic management. Lack of proper security on this *Caddy-specific* feature is the vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** The Admin API endpoint is accessible without authentication on the public internet. An attacker can query the API to discover configuration details, loaded modules, or even trigger a configuration reload with malicious settings, directly impacting the Caddy instance.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure about Caddy's configuration and environment, unauthorized modification of server configuration, potential remote code execution if the API has vulnerabilities or allows loading of malicious modules *into Caddy*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the Admin API with strong authentication (e.g., API keys, mutual TLS).
        *   Restrict access to the Admin API to trusted networks or localhost only.
        *   Regularly rotate API keys if used.
        *   Keep Caddy updated to patch any vulnerabilities in the Admin API.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Modules](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_modules.md)

*   **Description:** Caddy's modular architecture allows for extending its functionality with third-party modules. Vulnerabilities in these modules can directly impact the *Caddy process*.
    *   **How Caddy Contributes:** Caddy's design *encourages the use of modules*, directly integrating their code and functionality into the server.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable third-party authentication module allows an attacker to bypass authentication *handled by Caddy* and gain access to protected resources. A logging module might have a vulnerability that allows writing to arbitrary files on the *Caddy server*.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the vulnerability in the module. Could range from information disclosure and unauthorized access to remote code execution *within the Caddy process or on the server*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and select third-party modules from trusted sources.
        *   Keep all modules updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories for the modules you are using.
        *   Consider the principle of least privilege when configuring modules.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration of TLS Automation (ACME)](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_of_tls_automation__acme_.md)

*   **Description:** Caddy's automatic HTTPS relies on the ACME protocol. Misconfigurations can lead to unauthorized certificate issuance or denial of service *affecting Caddy's ability to serve secure content*.
    *   **How Caddy Contributes:** Caddy's ease of TLS setup is a core feature, and incorrect configuration of this *Caddy functionality* creates vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Caddy is configured to use a DNS challenge for ACME, but the DNS provider credentials used *by Caddy* are compromised. An attacker could then issue certificates for arbitrary domains managed by that provider, potentially impersonating the Caddy-served website. Or, rate limiting on the ACME provider could be triggered due to misconfiguration *in Caddy*, leading to an inability to renew certificates and a loss of HTTPS.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks against traffic intended for the Caddy server, denial of service due to inability to obtain or renew certificates, leading to insecure connections.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure ACME account credentials and API keys used by Caddy.
        *   Use appropriate ACME challenge types based on your infrastructure and security requirements.
        *   Understand the rate limits of your ACME provider and configure Caddy accordingly.
        *   Monitor certificate issuance and renewal processes *managed by Caddy*.

## Attack Surface: [Directory Traversal via File Serving](./attack_surfaces/directory_traversal_via_file_serving.md)

*   **Description:** If Caddy is configured to serve static files, misconfigurations can allow attackers to access files outside the intended directory *on the Caddy server*.
    *   **How Caddy Contributes:** Caddy's `file_server` directive is the mechanism that enables this functionality, and its misconfiguration is the direct cause of the vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** The Caddyfile contains a directive like `file_server / *`, allowing access to the entire filesystem *accessible by the Caddy process*. An attacker could then request URLs like `../../../../etc/passwd` to access sensitive system files *on the server running Caddy*.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files *on the Caddy server*, potential for further system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully define the root directory for file serving using the `root` directive.
        *   Avoid using wildcard paths (`*`) for file serving unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        *   Regularly review file serving configurations in the Caddyfile.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./attack_surfaces/http_request_smuggling.md)

*   **Description:** Discrepancies in how Caddy and backend servers parse HTTP requests can be exploited to smuggle malicious requests *through Caddy*.
    *   **How Caddy Contributes:** As a reverse proxy, Caddy *handles and forwards* requests. If its parsing differs from the backend, smuggling is possible *due to Caddy's interpretation*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a request that Caddy interprets differently than the backend server. This allows them to inject a second, malicious request that the backend processes unknowingly, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data manipulation *on the backend via Caddy*.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, gaining unauthorized access to backend systems, cache poisoning, request routing manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Caddy and backend servers have consistent HTTP parsing behavior.
        *   Use HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 where possible, as they are less susceptible to smuggling.
        *   Carefully configure timeouts and request limits *in Caddy*.
        *   Monitor for unusual request patterns *passing through Caddy*.
