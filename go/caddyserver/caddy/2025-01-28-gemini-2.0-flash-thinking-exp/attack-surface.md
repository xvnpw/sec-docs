# Attack Surface Analysis for caddyserver/caddy

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Caddyfile/JSON Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_caddyfilejson_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  Misconfigurations in Caddy's configuration files (Caddyfile or JSON) can expose sensitive information or create security vulnerabilities.
*   **How Caddy Contributes:** Caddy relies on these files for all its behavior. Incorrect directives or exposed secrets within these files directly impact Caddy's security.
*   **Example:**  Including database credentials directly in the Caddyfile for a reverse proxy to a backend application, and then accidentally making the Caddyfile world-readable.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potential for unauthorized access to backend systems, compromise of data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the sensitivity of exposed information).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Storage:** Store Caddy configuration files with restrictive permissions (e.g., readable only by the Caddy user).
    *   **Environment Variables/Secrets Management:**  Utilize environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools to inject sensitive information (API keys, credentials) into Caddy configuration instead of hardcoding them in files.
    *   **Configuration Validation:** Regularly review and validate Caddy configurations for security best practices and potential misconfigurations.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only grant necessary permissions to the Caddy process and configuration files.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Caddy Admin API](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_caddy_admin_api.md)

*   **Description:**  The Caddy Admin API, if enabled without proper authentication, allows unauthorized control over the Caddy server.
*   **How Caddy Contributes:** Caddy provides this API for dynamic configuration and management, but it must be secured.
*   **Example:** Enabling the Admin API on a public interface without setting up authentication. An attacker could then use the API to modify Caddy's configuration, potentially redirecting traffic or causing denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Caddy server, potential for data exfiltration, denial of service, and further attacks on backend systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Admin API (if not needed):** If dynamic configuration is not required, disable the Admin API entirely.
    *   **Enable Authentication:**  Configure strong authentication for the Admin API using API keys or other supported methods.
    *   **Network Restrictions:** Restrict access to the Admin API to trusted networks or specific IP addresses (e.g., localhost or internal management network).
    *   **Regularly Review Access:** Periodically review and audit access controls for the Admin API.

## Attack Surface: [Open Reverse Proxy Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/open_reverse_proxy_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrectly configured `reverse_proxy` directive can turn Caddy into an open proxy, allowing attackers to proxy requests to arbitrary destinations.
*   **How Caddy Contributes:** Caddy's `reverse_proxy` functionality is powerful but requires careful configuration to prevent misuse.
*   **Example:**  Setting up a `reverse_proxy` without any access controls or destination restrictions. An attacker could use this Caddy instance to bypass firewalls, access internal networks, or launch attacks against other systems (SSRF).
*   **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), open proxy abuse, potential for internal network access and further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Proxy Destinations:**  Carefully define allowed backend destinations for the `reverse_proxy` directive. Use allowlists or denylists based on domains or IP ranges.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for proxied requests if necessary.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the reverse proxy to mitigate abuse and DoS potential.
    *   **Regular Configuration Review:** Regularly review and audit reverse proxy configurations to ensure they are secure and aligned with intended use.

## Attack Surface: [Delayed Security Updates](./attack_surfaces/delayed_security_updates.md)

*   **Description:**  Failing to promptly apply security updates to Caddy leaves it vulnerable to known exploits.
*   **How Caddy Contributes:**  Like any software, Caddy requires regular updates to address discovered vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**  A new vulnerability is discovered in Caddy, and an exploit is publicly available.  If the Caddy instance is not updated, it remains vulnerable to this exploit.
*   **Impact:**  Exploitation of known vulnerabilities, potential for full server compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the severity of the unpatched vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Update Schedule:** Establish a regular schedule for checking and applying Caddy updates.
    *   **Monitoring Release Notes:** Subscribe to Caddy's release notes and security announcements to be aware of new updates and security patches.
    *   **Automated Updates (where possible):** Utilize system package managers or container image updates to automate Caddy updates where feasible.
    *   **Testing Updates:** Test updates in a staging environment before applying them to production to ensure compatibility and stability.
