### Vulnerability List for go-toml v2 Project

* Vulnerability Name: Integer Overflow in Date Parsing

* Description:
    The `parseDecimalDigits` function in `/code/unstable/parser.go` converts byte slices representing decimal digits into integer values. When processing date components (year, month, day) in functions like `scanDateTime` (which is used to identify DateTime, LocalDateTime and LocalDate kinds), if an extremely large number is provided as input for these components, the repeated multiplication by 10 (`v *= 10`) in `parseDecimalDigits` could potentially lead to an integer overflow. This overflow might result in incorrect integer values being used for date components, bypassing the subsequent date validity checks (if any are implemented at a later stage, which is not evident in the provided code) or causing unexpected behavior in date/time handling within applications consuming the parsed TOML.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. Prepare a TOML document containing a date with an extremely large year, month, or day value. For example, set year to a value close to the maximum value of `int`.
    2. Send this TOML document to an application that uses `go-toml/v2` to parse the document and specifically processes date or date-time values.
    3. Observe the application's behavior when handling the parsed date. If the integer overflow occurs and is not properly handled, the application might proceed with an invalid or unexpected date.

* Impact:
    An integer overflow in date parsing can lead to several potential impacts:
    - Incorrect date validation: If validation is performed after parsing (which is not evident in the provided `parser.go` but might exist in decoding logic - not provided in PROJECT FILES), the validation logic might receive incorrect date components due to the overflow. If the wrapped-around value happens to fall into a valid range, it will bypass intended date validity checks.
    - Unexpected application behavior: Applications relying on correct date and time parsing might exhibit unexpected behavior or logic errors due to the use of overflowed and thus incorrect date values.
    - Data corruption: In scenarios where parsed dates are used to index or manage data, an integer overflow could lead to data being associated with incorrect dates, effectively causing data corruption from a logical perspective.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None in `/code/unstable/parser.go` or related files provided in PROJECT FILES. The code does not implement any explicit checks for integer overflows during the digit parsing in `parseDecimalDigits` or during the date component parsing in `scanDateTime`. The `isValidDate` function mentioned in the original vulnerability description is not present in the provided PROJECT FILES, implying it might be in a different part of the codebase (possibly in the `decode.go` file from the original vulnerability description which is not in the PROJECT FILES). Even if `isValidDate` exists and performs date validation *after* parsing, it will not prevent or detect integer overflows that occur *during* parsing.

* Missing mitigations:
    - Integer overflow checks within `parseDecimalDigits` function in `/code/unstable/parser.go`: Before or during the multiplication step (`v *= 10`), checks should be implemented to detect potential integer overflows. Go does not panic on integer overflow, it wraps around. Explicitly checking for potential overflow before it occurs would be a more robust mitigation. For example, before `v *= 10`, check if `v > (maxInt / 10)`.
    - Input sanitization and range validation before parsing: Before even calling `parseDecimalDigits`, basic input sanitization could be applied to check for excessively long digit sequences that are likely to cause overflow. For example, limit the number of digits allowed for year, month, and day components.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to control the input TOML document that is parsed by an application using `go-toml/v2`.
    - The application must be processing date or date-time values from the parsed TOML document.

* Source code analysis:
    1. **File**: `/code/unstable/parser.go`
    2. **Function**: `parseDecimalDigits(b []byte) (int, error)`
    ```go
    func parseDecimalDigits(b []byte) (int, error) {
        v := 0
        for i, c := range b {
            if c < '0' || c > '9' {
                return 0, unstable.NewParserError(b[i:i+1], "expected digit (0-9)")
            }
            v *= 10 // Potential integer overflow here
            v += int(c - '0')
        }
        return v, nil
    }
    ```
    - The `parseDecimalDigits` function iterates through the byte slice `b`. In each iteration, it multiplies the current value of `v` by 10 and adds the numeric value of the current digit.
    - If the input `b` contains a long sequence of digits, and the accumulated value `v` becomes very large, the multiplication `v *= 10` can lead to an integer overflow.
    - Go does not inherently prevent integer overflows, and the result will wrap around, leading to an incorrect integer value without an error being explicitly raised by `parseDecimalDigits`.
    3. **Function**: `scanDateTime(b []byte) (reference, []byte, error)` (and potentially other functions that parse dates, though only `scanDateTime` is evident in PROJECT FILES)
    - The `scanDateTime` function identifies potential date and time tokens. It's highly likely that this function, or functions called by it (not fully visible in provided files, but based on the original vulnerability description and common parsing patterns), will use `parseDecimalDigits` to convert date components into integers.
    - The potentially overflowed integer values from `parseDecimalDigits` are then used to determine the `Kind` of the node (DateTime, LocalDateTime, LocalDate) and stored as `Data`.

    **Visualization:**
    ```
    [TOML Date String with large year] --> scanDateTime --> [Date component extraction - potentially using parseDecimalDigits] --> parseDecimalDigits --> [Integer Overflow Possible] --> [Incorrect Year Integer] --> Node{Kind: DateTime/LocalDateTime/LocalDate, Data: Incorrect Date String} --> [Downstream decoding/validation (if any) might be bypassed] --> Application uses incorrect date
    ```

* Security test case:
    1. **Objective**: Verify if providing an extremely large year value in a TOML date string can bypass date validation (or lead to incorrect parsing if no validation exists at parsing stage), due to integer overflow, leading to incorrect date handling.
    2. **Test setup**:
        - Create a simple Go application that uses `go-toml/v2` to unmarshal a TOML document into a struct containing a `time.Time` field or `toml.LocalDate`/`toml.LocalDateTime`/`toml.DateTime` field.
        - The TOML document will contain a date string with a year value designed to be close to the maximum value for `int` in Go, to attempt triggering an integer overflow during parsing.
    3. **Test steps**:
        - Prepare a TOML file (`testcase.toml`) with the following content:
        ```toml
        date_overflow_test = "9223372036854775807-01-01T00:00:00Z" # Max int64 year value - likely to cause overflow if parsed as int during intermediate steps.
        local_date_overflow_test = "9223372036854775807-01-01" # Max int64 year value for local date
        local_datetime_overflow_test = "9223372036854775807-01-01T00:00:00" # Max int64 year value for local date time
        ```
        - Write a Go test function that reads `testcase.toml`, unmarshals it into a struct, and then examines the parsed date/time values. Test with different target types in the struct: `time.Time`, `toml.LocalDate`, `toml.LocalDateTime`.
        - In the test, assert that either an error is returned during unmarshaling (indicating overflow detection, which is not currently implemented but would be a good mitigation) or, if no error is returned, that the parsed year in the date/time value is *not* the extremely large value provided in the TOML, and ideally, it should reflect the maximum possible valid year or some error handling behavior.
    4. **Expected result**:
        - Ideally, the test should result in a `DecodeError` (or similar error from `go-toml/v2`) indicating an invalid year or a range error during integer parsing, as the provided year is excessively large and would likely cause an overflow during intermediate parsing steps.
        - If no error is returned, then it indicates a vulnerability where integer overflow is not properly handled, and the parsed date is likely incorrect. In that case, the assertion should check if the parsed year is not equal to the intended large value, proving the overflow and incorrect parsing.
    5. **Code example for test case (pseudocode - update to test all date types):**
    ```go
    package main_test

    import (
        "testing"
        "time"
        "github.com/pelletier/go-toml/v2"
        "github.com/stretchr/testify/require"
        "os"
    )

    type Config struct {
        DateOverflowTest time.Time `toml:"date_overflow_test"`
        LocalDateOverflowTest toml.LocalDate `toml:"local_date_overflow_test"`
        LocalDateTimeOverflowTest toml.LocalDateTime `toml:"local_datetime_overflow_test"`
    }

    func TestIntegerOverflowDateParsing(t *testing.T) {
        tomlData, err := os.ReadFile("testcase.toml")
        require.NoError(t, err, "Failed to read testcase.toml")

        var cfg Config
        err = toml.Unmarshal(tomlData, &cfg)

        if err == nil {
            t.Logf("No error returned, potential vulnerability. Parsed DateTime year: %d, LocalDate year: %d, LocalDateTime year: %d", cfg.DateOverflowTest.Year(), cfg.LocalDateOverflowTest.Year, cfg.LocalDateTimeOverflowTest.LocalDate.Year)

            // Assert that the parsed year is NOT the large input year, indicating overflow for all date types
            require.NotEqual(t, 9223372036854775807, cfg.DateOverflowTest.Year(), "Integer overflow vulnerability exists in DateTime parsing: Incorrect date parsed.")
            require.NotEqual(t, 9223372036854775807, cfg.LocalDateOverflowTest.Year, "Integer overflow vulnerability exists in LocalDate parsing: Incorrect date parsed.")
            require.NotEqual(t, 9223372036854775807, cfg.LocalDateTimeOverflowTest.LocalDate.Year, "Integer overflow vulnerability exists in LocalDateTime parsing: Incorrect date parsed.")

        } else {
            t.Logf("Expected error returned (Mitigation might be in place or error during parsing): %v", err)
            require.Error(t, err, "Expected a DecodeError due to invalid or out-of-range date/year.")
        }
    }

    func main() {
        // Optional: Run test case directly if needed for quick validation
        // go test -run TestIntegerOverflowDateParsing main_test.go
    }
    ```
    This updated test case will thoroughly check for integer overflow across different date and datetime types supported by `go-toml/v2` and confirm whether the vulnerability is present.
