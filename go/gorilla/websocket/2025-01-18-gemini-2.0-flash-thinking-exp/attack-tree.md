## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application Using Websocket (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_using_websocket__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. All successful high-risk paths lead to this outcome, signifying a significant breach of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Message Handling Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_message_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This category represents a significant attack surface due to the direct interaction with application logic and data. Successful exploitation here often leads to high-impact consequences.

    * **2.1. Send Malicious Payloads:**
        * **2.1.1. Inject Malicious Data (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting in messages interpreted by clients) (CRITICAL NODE):**
            * **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a WebSocket message containing malicious code (e.g., JavaScript) that is then interpreted and executed by the receiving client's browser.
            * **Impact:** Client-side compromise, including session hijacking, data theft, and unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user.
            * **Likelihood:** Medium (common vulnerability if input sanitization is lacking).
            * **Effort:** Low (requires understanding of basic injection techniques).
            * **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate.
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (can be detected by monitoring for suspicious patterns in messages).

        * **2.2. Exploit Lack of Authentication/Authorization on Messages (CRITICAL NODE):**
            * **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends WebSocket messages without proper authentication or authorization, allowing them to perform actions they are not permitted to.
            * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, modification of data, or execution of privileged actions.
            * **Likelihood:** Medium (common vulnerability if not implemented correctly).
            * **Effort:** Low (if no checks are in place, it's trivial).
            * **Skill Level:** Beginner.
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Low (if logging is in place, unauthorized actions might be evident).

        * **2.3. Exploit Server-Side Processing Logic Flaws (CRITICAL NODE):**
            * **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends specially crafted WebSocket messages that exploit vulnerabilities in the server-side code responsible for processing these messages. Examples include command injection, SQL injection (if data is stored based on message content), or insecure deserialization.
            * **Impact:** Server compromise, remote code execution, data breach, complete control over the application and potentially the underlying server.
            * **Likelihood:** Low/Medium (depends on the complexity and security of the server-side code).
            * **Effort:** Medium/High (requires identifying and exploiting specific vulnerabilities).
            * **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Advanced.
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium/High (depends on the nature of the vulnerability and logging practices).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Connection Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_connection_management_vulnerabilities.md)

    * **3.1. Connection Hijacking (if authentication is weak or session management flawed) (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains control of an existing, legitimate WebSocket connection. This can occur through various means, such as stealing session tokens or exploiting weaknesses in the authentication handshake after the initial connection.
        * **Impact:** The attacker can impersonate the legitimate user, gaining access to their data and performing actions on their behalf.
        * **Likelihood:** Low (requires weaknesses in authentication or session management).
        * **Effort:** Medium/High (depends on the specific vulnerabilities).
        * **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Advanced.
        * **Detection Difficulty:** High (difficult to detect without robust session monitoring).

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Specific to Websockets (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/4__denial_of_service__dos__attacks_specific_to_websockets__critical_node_.md)

This category represents attacks aimed at making the application unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming its resources.

    * **4.1. Connection Flooding:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker establishes a large number of WebSocket connections to the server, exceeding its capacity and preventing legitimate users from connecting.
        * **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption.
        * **Likelihood:** High (common and easy to execute).
        * **Effort:** Low (easily automated with scripting tools).
        * **Skill Level:** Beginner.
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (detectable by monitoring connection rates).

    * **4.2. Message Flooding:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a large volume of messages over established WebSocket connections, consuming server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and slowing down or crashing the application.
        * **Impact:** Application slowdown, resource exhaustion, potential service disruption.
        * **Likelihood:** High (easy to execute on established connections).
        * **Effort:** Low (simple to send a large number of messages).
        * **Skill Level:** Beginner.
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (detectable by monitoring message rates per connection).

    * **4.3. Resource Exhaustion through Large Messages:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends excessively large WebSocket messages, consuming significant server memory and potentially leading to crashes or performance degradation.
        * **Impact:** Resource exhaustion, application slowdown, potential denial of service.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium (easy to execute).
        * **Effort:** Low (simple to send large messages).
        * **Skill Level:** Beginner.
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (detectable by monitoring message sizes).
