# Threat Model Analysis for gorilla/websocket

## Threat: [Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH)](./threats/cross-site_websocket_hijacking__cswsh_.md)

**Description:** An attacker hosts a malicious website that attempts to initiate a websocket connection to the vulnerable application on behalf of an authenticated user. The attacker might then send commands or receive data intended for the legitimate user. This is possible due to insufficient `Origin` header validation handled by `gorilla/websocket`.

**Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user, data exfiltration.

**Affected Component:** `github.com/gorilla/websocket/v2.Upgrader` (specifically the `CheckOrigin` function).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict `Origin` header validation within the `Upgrader`'s `CheckOrigin` function. Only allow connections from explicitly trusted domains.

## Threat: [Lack of Proper Authentication/Authorization during Handshake](./threats/lack_of_proper_authenticationauthorization_during_handshake.md)

**Description:** An attacker can establish a websocket connection without proper authentication or authorization, bypassing security measures. This occurs if the application doesn't leverage `gorilla/websocket`'s handshake mechanisms or its own logic to verify user identity before upgrading the connection.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to data and functionalities, potential data breaches, privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** Application-level code integrating with `github.com/gorilla/websocket/v2.Upgrader` (the logic implemented *after* the `Upgrade` call).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Integrate existing authentication mechanisms (e.g., session cookies, JWTs) into the logic handling the websocket handshake *after* the `Upgrader.Upgrade` call. Verify user identity before proceeding with the connection.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Handshake Abuse](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_handshake_abuse.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a large number of invalid or resource-intensive handshake requests, exploiting the `gorilla/websocket`'s `Upgrader` to consume server resources and prevent legitimate users from establishing connections.

**Impact:** Service disruption, inability for legitimate users to access the application's websocket features.

**Affected Component:** `github.com/gorilla/websocket/v2.Upgrader`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on incoming handshake requests *before* they reach the `Upgrader`.
* Set timeouts for the `Upgrader` to handle incomplete handshakes and release resources.

## Threat: [Unencrypted Websocket Communication (ws://)](./threats/unencrypted_websocket_communication__ws_.md)

**Description:** An attacker eavesdrops on network traffic because the application uses `gorilla/websocket` to establish a connection over `ws://` instead of the secure `wss://`, leaving data transmitted in plain text.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the websocket connection.

**Affected Component:** `github.com/gorilla/websocket/v2.Dialer` (on the client-side) and the underlying network connection established by `github.com/gorilla/websocket/v2.Conn`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always use `wss://` for websocket connections. Configure the `Dialer` on the client and ensure the server is configured for secure connections.

## Threat: [Message Injection/Manipulation](./threats/message_injectionmanipulation.md)

**Description:** A malicious client sends crafted or malicious messages through an established websocket connection handled by `gorilla/websocket`. The server, using `gorilla/websocket`'s reading functions, might process these messages without proper validation, leading to unintended actions.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions, potential execution of arbitrary code on the server (depending on how messages are processed).

**Affected Component:** `github.com/gorilla/websocket/v2.Conn` (specifically the `ReadMessage` function).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust server-side input validation and sanitization for all incoming websocket messages received via `Conn.ReadMessage()`.
* Define and enforce a strict message format.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Connection Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_connection_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker opens a large number of websocket connections, potentially exploiting the way `gorilla/websocket` manages connections, to exhaust server resources and prevent legitimate users from connecting.

**Impact:** Service disruption, inability for legitimate users to establish websocket connections.

**Affected Component:** `github.com/gorilla/websocket/v2.Conn` and the application's logic for managing and accepting connections using the `Upgrader`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the maximum number of concurrent websocket connections the server will accept.
* Implement mechanisms to identify and close idle or inactive connections managed by `gorilla/websocket`.
* Consider using authentication to limit the number of connections per authenticated user.
