## Deep Analysis: Handshake Manipulation for Bypassing Security Controls in Gorilla/Websocket Applications

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Handshake Manipulation for Bypassing Security Controls" attack surface for applications utilizing the `gorilla/websocket` library in Go.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack surface related to websocket handshake manipulation within applications built with `gorilla/websocket`.  Specifically, we aim to:

*   **Identify potential vulnerabilities:**  Pinpoint weaknesses in the handshake process that attackers could exploit to bypass security controls.
*   **Understand exploitation techniques:**  Detail how attackers might manipulate handshake parameters to achieve malicious goals.
*   **Assess risk and impact:**  Evaluate the severity of potential attacks and their consequences for application security.
*   **Provide actionable mitigation strategies:**  Offer specific, practical recommendations for developers using `gorilla/websocket` to effectively defend against handshake manipulation attacks.
*   **Focus on `gorilla/websocket` specifics:** Analyze how the library's features and functionalities relate to this attack surface and how to leverage them for secure implementation.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following aspects of the "Handshake Manipulation for Bypassing Security Controls" attack surface within the context of `gorilla/websocket`:

*   **Handshake Headers:**  Specifically, the `Origin`, `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`, and `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` headers, and how their manipulation can lead to security bypasses.
*   **Server-Side Handshake Handling:**  Examination of how `gorilla/websocket` applications typically handle and validate handshake requests on the server side.
*   **Client-Side Handshake Generation:**  Brief consideration of client-side aspects, but with a primary focus on server-side vulnerabilities and mitigations.
*   **Protocol Downgrade Attacks:**  Analysis of how handshake manipulation can facilitate protocol downgrade attacks.
*   **Bypassing Origin-Based Access Control:**  Detailed examination of `Origin` header manipulation and its impact on origin-based security.
*   **Subprotocol and Extension Negotiation:**  Analysis of vulnerabilities related to the negotiation of subprotocols and extensions.

**Out of Scope:**

*   **General Websocket Security:**  This analysis is not a general overview of all websocket security concerns.
*   **Data Transmission Security:**  Focus is on the handshake phase, not the security of data transmitted after the connection is established (e.g., message encryption).
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:**  While handshake manipulation might be used in DoS attacks, this is not the primary focus.
*   **Vulnerabilities in Underlying Network Protocols:**  Analysis is limited to the websocket protocol and application-level security, not vulnerabilities in TCP/IP or TLS.
*   **Specific Application Logic Vulnerabilities:**  While we consider how handshake manipulation can *bypass* application logic, we are not analyzing vulnerabilities *within* the application logic itself beyond handshake handling.

### 3. Methodology

This deep analysis will be conducted using the following methodology:

1.  **Literature Review:**  Review documentation for `gorilla/websocket`, RFC 6455 (WebSocket Protocol), and relevant security best practices for websockets and handshake handling.
2.  **Code Analysis (Conceptual):**  Examine the typical patterns and code structures used when implementing websocket servers with `gorilla/websocket`, focusing on handshake handling logic.  This will be conceptual and not involve analyzing specific application codebases unless necessary for illustrative examples.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Apply threat modeling principles to identify potential attack vectors related to handshake manipulation, considering the functionalities and configurations of `gorilla/websocket`.
4.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Analyze the identified attack vectors to determine potential vulnerabilities in typical `gorilla/websocket` implementations.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Formulation:**  Based on the identified vulnerabilities, formulate specific and actionable mitigation strategies tailored for `gorilla/websocket` applications.
6.  **Example Scenarios and Code Snippets (Illustrative):**  Provide illustrative examples and potentially simplified code snippets (using `gorilla/websocket`) to demonstrate vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques.
7.  **Documentation and Reporting:**  Document the findings, analysis, and mitigation strategies in a clear and structured markdown format.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Handshake Manipulation

#### 4.1. Understanding the Websocket Handshake with Gorilla/Websocket

The websocket handshake is initiated by the client sending an HTTP Upgrade request to the server.  `gorilla/websocket` provides functions to handle this upgrade process on the server side.  Key aspects relevant to handshake manipulation include:

*   **`websocket.Upgrader`:** This struct in `gorilla/websocket` is central to handling websocket upgrades. It allows customization of handshake behavior, including:
    *   `CheckOrigin`: A function to validate the `Origin` header.
    *   `Subprotocols`: A slice of supported subprotocols.
    *   `EnableCompression`:  Enables or disables compression.
    *   `HandshakeTimeout`: Sets a timeout for the handshake process.
*   **`http.ResponseWriter` and `*http.Request`:** The `Upgrader.Upgrade` function takes these standard Go HTTP handler parameters, providing access to the incoming request headers and allowing the server to control the response.
*   **Header Access:**  The `*http.Request` object provides access to all request headers, including `Origin`, `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`, `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions`, and others.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors and Vulnerabilities

**4.2.1. Origin Header Manipulation and Bypassing Origin Checks**

*   **Vulnerability:** If the server relies solely on the `Origin` header for access control and the `CheckOrigin` function in `gorilla/websocket` is not implemented correctly or is bypassed, attackers can forge the `Origin` header to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious webpage or use a tool to send a websocket handshake request with a forged `Origin` header that matches an allowed origin. If the server's `CheckOrigin` function is weak (e.g., simply checks if the `Origin` is present in a list without proper validation or allows null origins), the attacker can bypass origin-based access control.
*   **Gorilla/Websocket Context:**  By default, `gorilla/websocket`'s `Upgrader` has a `CheckOrigin` function that returns `true` (allowing all origins).  **This is insecure by default.** Developers *must* implement a custom `CheckOrigin` function for production applications.  If developers forget to implement or implement a flawed `CheckOrigin`, this vulnerability exists.
*   **Example Vulnerable Code (Conceptual):**

    ```go
    var upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{} // Default CheckOrigin allows all

    func websocketHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        conn, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)
        if err != nil {
            log.Println("upgrade:", err)
            return
        }
        defer conn.Close()
        // ... websocket logic ...
    }
    ```

*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to websocket functionality, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or other malicious activities depending on the application's websocket features.

**4.2.2. Sec-WebSocket-Protocol Header Manipulation and Protocol Downgrade/Unintended Protocol Usage**

*   **Vulnerability:** If the server blindly accepts client-proposed subprotocols from the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header without strict validation and whitelisting, attackers can force the server to use a less secure or vulnerable subprotocol.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker can include a list of subprotocols in the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header, prioritizing a known vulnerable or less secure subprotocol. If the server simply picks the first matching protocol from the client's list and the server supports the attacker's preferred protocol (even if it's not the intended one), a protocol downgrade attack occurs.  Alternatively, an attacker could propose a subprotocol that the server *supports* but is not intended to be used in the current context, potentially bypassing intended application logic or security measures associated with the *intended* subprotocol.
*   **Gorilla/Websocket Context:** `gorilla/websocket`'s `Upgrader` allows specifying `Subprotocols`.  When `Upgrade` is called, it negotiates the subprotocol.  However, the logic for negotiation depends on how the `Subprotocols` slice is configured and how the server handles the client's `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header.  If the server logic is not carefully designed to prioritize secure and intended protocols, vulnerabilities can arise.
*   **Example Vulnerable Code (Conceptual - oversimplified):**

    ```go
    var upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{
        Subprotocols: []string{"chat", "vulnerable-legacy-protocol"}, // Server supports both
    }

    func websocketHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        conn, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)
        if err != nil {
            log.Println("upgrade:", err)
            return
        }
        defer conn.Close()
        protocol := conn.Subprotocol() // Get negotiated protocol
        log.Printf("Negotiated protocol: %s", protocol)
        // ... websocket logic, potentially assuming "chat" protocol ...
    }
    ```
    If the client sends `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: vulnerable-legacy-protocol, chat`, and the server simply picks the first match, it might choose `vulnerable-legacy-protocol` even if `chat` is preferred.

*   **Impact:** Protocol downgrade attacks leading to weaker security or exploitation of vulnerabilities in less secure protocols.  Unintended protocol usage can bypass application logic or security checks designed for specific protocols.

**4.2.3. Sec-WebSocket-Extensions Header Manipulation and Enabling Vulnerable/Unintended Extensions**

*   **Vulnerability:** Similar to subprotocols, if the server blindly accepts client-proposed extensions from the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header without strict validation and whitelisting, attackers can force the server to enable vulnerable or unintended extensions.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker can propose a list of extensions in the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header, prioritizing a known vulnerable or unintended extension. If the server supports and enables the attacker's preferred extension, it can lead to exploitation.  This is less common than subprotocol manipulation as extensions are less frequently used and standardized, but still a potential risk.
*   **Gorilla/Websocket Context:** `gorilla/websocket` supports extensions, but the library itself doesn't provide built-in extension handling beyond negotiation.  Developers are responsible for implementing the logic for any extensions they choose to support.  If extension negotiation and handling are not carefully implemented, vulnerabilities can arise.
*   **Impact:** Enabling vulnerable extensions can introduce new attack vectors. Unintended extensions might interfere with application logic or security mechanisms.

**4.2.4. Manipulation of Other Handshake Headers (Less Common but Possible)**

*   While `Origin`, `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`, and `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` are the primary targets for handshake manipulation, other headers could potentially be exploited depending on custom server-side logic. For example, custom headers might be used for authentication or authorization during the handshake. If these custom headers are not properly validated, they could be manipulated.
*   **Gorilla/Websocket Context:** `gorilla/websocket` provides access to all request headers, allowing developers to implement custom logic based on any header.  The security of such custom logic depends entirely on the developer's implementation.

#### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed for Gorilla/Websocket)

**4.3.1. Strict Handshake Validation:**

*   **`CheckOrigin` Implementation:** **Crucially, implement a custom `CheckOrigin` function in `gorilla/websocket`'s `Upgrader`.** This function should:
    *   **Validate against a whitelist of allowed origins:**  Do not rely on simple string matching if possible. Consider using more robust validation techniques if needed (e.g., regular expressions, domain name resolution checks, although complex checks can introduce performance overhead).
    *   **Reject invalid or unexpected origins:**  Return `false` for any origin that is not explicitly allowed.
    *   **Consider context:**  If possible, base origin validation on the specific application context or user session.
    *   **Example `CheckOrigin` Implementation:**

        ```go
        var allowedOrigins = map[string]bool{
            "https://www.example.com": true,
            "https://example.com":     true,
            // ... more allowed origins ...
        }

        var upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{
            CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool {
                origin := r.Header.Get("Origin")
                if allowedOrigins[origin] {
                    return true
                }
                log.Printf("Rejected origin: %s", origin)
                return false
            },
        }
        ```

*   **Validate Other Headers:**  If your application relies on other handshake headers for security (e.g., custom authentication headers), implement robust validation logic for these headers within your websocket handler before upgrading the connection.

**4.3.2. Whitelist Approved Protocols and Extensions:**

*   **`Subprotocols` Configuration:**  When configuring `gorilla/websocket`'s `Upgrader`, explicitly set the `Subprotocols` slice to contain only the **secure and approved subprotocols** that your application is designed to use.
*   **Server-Side Protocol Selection Logic:**  Instead of blindly accepting the client's preferred protocol order, implement server-side logic to **prioritize secure and intended protocols.**  You can iterate through the client's proposed protocols and select the *first* one that is both supported by the server (in `Subprotocols`) and is considered secure and appropriate for the context.  If no secure/intended protocol is found, reject the handshake.
*   **Example Secure Subprotocol Negotiation (Conceptual):**

    ```go
    var secureSubprotocols = []string{"secure-chat-v2", "secure-chat-v1"} // Preferred order
    var supportedSubprotocols = []string{"secure-chat-v2", "secure-chat-v1", "legacy-chat"} // Server supports more

    var upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{
        Subprotocols: supportedSubprotocols, // Server advertises support
        // ... CheckOrigin ...
    }

    func websocketHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        // ... CheckOrigin ...

        protocols := websocket.NegotiateProtocol(r.Header, upgrader.Subprotocols)
        var negotiatedProtocol string
        for _, p := range protocols {
            for _, secureP := range secureSubprotocols {
                if p == secureP {
                    negotiatedProtocol = p
                    break // Found a secure protocol, prioritize it
                }
            }
            if negotiatedProtocol != "" {
                break
            }
        }

        if negotiatedProtocol == "" {
            log.Println("No secure protocol negotiated, rejecting handshake")
            http.Error(w, "No acceptable protocol", http.StatusBadRequest) // Or appropriate error code
            return
        }

        conn, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, http.Header{"Sec-WebSocket-Protocol": {negotiatedProtocol}}) // Force negotiated protocol
        if err != nil {
            log.Println("upgrade:", err)
            return
        }
        conn.SetSubprotocol(negotiatedProtocol) // Inform connection about negotiated protocol
        defer conn.Close()
        log.Printf("Negotiated protocol: %s", negotiatedProtocol)
        // ... websocket logic ...
    }
    ```

*   **Extension Handling:**  If you use websocket extensions, **explicitly whitelist and validate** the extensions you support.  Implement robust logic to negotiate and handle extensions securely.  If you don't need extensions, avoid enabling them or supporting them in your handshake logic.

**4.3.3. Secure Protocol Negotiation Logic:**

*   **Server-Side Preference:**  As demonstrated in the subprotocol example above, prioritize server-side preferences for security and protocol versions.  Do not solely rely on client-provided preferences.
*   **Reject Unknown Protocols/Extensions:**  If the client proposes subprotocols or extensions that are not on your whitelist or are not understood by the server, reject the handshake with an appropriate error response (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request).
*   **Clear Error Responses:**  Provide informative error responses during handshake failures to aid debugging but avoid revealing sensitive information that could be exploited by attackers.

**4.3.4. Connection Source Verification Beyond Origin (Advanced Mitigation):**

*   **Authenticated HTTP Session:**  For highly sensitive applications, require users to establish an authenticated HTTP session *before* attempting a websocket upgrade.  During the websocket handshake, verify the user's session cookie or token to ensure the connection originates from a legitimate authenticated user.
*   **Server-Generated Tokens:**  Generate a unique, server-side token after successful HTTP authentication.  Require the client to include this token in a custom header during the websocket handshake.  Validate this token on the server side before upgrading the connection.  This provides a stronger link between the HTTP session and the websocket connection.
*   **Mutual TLS (mTLS):**  For very high security requirements, consider using mutual TLS authentication for websocket connections.  This requires both the client and server to present certificates, providing strong authentication at the TLS layer itself.  While `gorilla/websocket` handles TLS, mTLS configuration is typically handled at the HTTP server level.

#### 4.4. Risk Severity Reassessment

While the initial risk severity was assessed as "High," the actual risk level depends heavily on the implementation of mitigation strategies.

*   **Unmitigated:**  High risk. Handshake manipulation can lead to significant security bypasses and potentially severe consequences.
*   **Partially Mitigated (e.g., only `CheckOrigin` implemented):** Medium risk.  Origin-based attacks are mitigated, but protocol downgrade or unintended protocol usage might still be possible if subprotocol/extension handling is weak.
*   **Fully Mitigated (all recommended strategies implemented):** Low risk.  With robust handshake validation, whitelisting, secure negotiation logic, and potentially additional connection source verification, the risk of successful handshake manipulation attacks is significantly reduced.

#### 4.5. Conclusion

Handshake manipulation is a critical attack surface for websocket applications.  By understanding the vulnerabilities associated with handshake headers and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, especially within the context of `gorilla/websocket`, developers can significantly strengthen the security of their websocket applications and prevent attackers from bypassing intended security controls.  **It is crucial to move away from default configurations and implement robust handshake validation and negotiation logic when using `gorilla/websocket` in production environments.**
