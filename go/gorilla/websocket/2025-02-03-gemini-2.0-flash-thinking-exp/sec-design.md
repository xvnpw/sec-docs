# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Priority: Provide a robust, efficient, and widely adopted WebSocket library for the Go programming language.
 - Goal: Enable developers to easily build real-time communication features into their Go applications.
 - Goal: Maintain the library's performance and stability while incorporating new WebSocket standards and features.
 - Goal: Foster a strong community around the library to encourage contributions and ensure long-term maintainability.

- Business Risks:
 - Risk: Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited in applications using it, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other security incidents.
 - Risk: Performance bottlenecks or instability in the library could negatively impact the performance and reliability of applications using it.
 - Risk: Lack of maintenance or slow response to bug fixes and security issues could lead to developer dissatisfaction and migration to alternative libraries.
 - Risk: Incompatibility with new WebSocket standards or Go versions could limit the library's usefulness and adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Code is hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's infrastructure security. Implemented by: GitHub.
 - security control: Publicly accessible repository, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented by: GitHub.
 - security control: Standard Go security practices are likely followed by maintainers. Implemented by: Project maintainers (implicitly).
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability discovery and patching.
 - accepted risk: Open-source nature means vulnerabilities are publicly discoverable, potentially increasing the window of exploitation before patches are available.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated static analysis security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Integrate dependency scanning to detect and alert on known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
 - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, potentially engaging external security experts.
 - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process.
 - security control: Sign releases to ensure integrity and authenticity of the library.
 - security control: Implement fuzz testing to discover unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities caused by malformed inputs.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: The library itself does not handle authentication, but applications using it must implement appropriate authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of WebSocket clients.
  - Requirement: Applications should leverage secure authentication protocols suitable for WebSocket communication, such as OAuth 2.0 or token-based authentication.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: The library itself does not handle authorization, but applications using it must implement authorization controls to manage access to WebSocket resources and operations based on authenticated user identities.
  - Requirement: Applications should enforce the principle of least privilege, granting WebSocket clients only the necessary permissions.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: The library must perform robust input validation on all incoming WebSocket messages to prevent injection attacks, buffer overflows, and other input-related vulnerabilities.
  - Requirement: Applications using the library should also implement application-level input validation to enforce business logic and data integrity.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: The library should support secure WebSocket connections (WSS) using TLS/SSL to encrypt communication between clients and servers, protecting data confidentiality and integrity during transmission.
  - Requirement: The library should correctly handle TLS handshake and certificate validation to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
  - Requirement: If application-level encryption is needed for message payloads, the library should provide mechanisms or guidance for integrating with cryptographic libraries.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Real-time communication features enabled by applications using the `gorilla/websocket` library.
 - Data exchange and interaction between users and applications via WebSockets.
 - Application functionality that relies on bidirectional, low-latency communication.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Data transmitted over WebSockets: Sensitivity depends entirely on the application using the library. It could range from public information to highly sensitive personal data, financial transactions, or confidential business communications.
 - Example data types (application-dependent):
  - Chat messages (potentially sensitive).
  - Real-time sensor data (sensitivity varies).
  - Financial transaction data (highly sensitive).
  - User activity data (potentially sensitive).
 - Sensitivity classification should be determined by the application context, not by the library itself. The library must be secure enough to handle any type of data that an application might transmit over WebSockets.
