## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via WebSocket:](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__compromise_application_via_websocket.md)

This is the root goal of the attacker. Success at any of the sub-branches leads to achieving this goal. It is critical because it represents the overall security objective for the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [CRITICAL NODE] 1. Exploit WebSocket Handshake Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/2___critical_node__1__exploit_websocket_handshake_vulnerabilities.md)

The WebSocket handshake is the initial point of contact and session establishment. Vulnerabilities here are critical as they can allow attackers to bypass security measures from the very beginning, gaining unauthorized access or disrupting service before normal communication even starts.

    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] 1.1. Bypass Authentication/Authorization during Handshake:**
        *   This path is high-risk because successful exploitation directly leads to unauthorized access. If authentication or authorization is bypassed during the handshake, the attacker can establish a WebSocket connection as a legitimate user or without proper permissions.
            *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.1.1. Manipulate Origin Header (if Origin-based auth is weak):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** If the application relies solely or weakly on the `Origin` header for authentication or authorization during the handshake, an attacker can easily manipulate this header in their WebSocket client request.
                *   **Why High-Risk:**  `Origin` header manipulation is trivial. If this is the primary or only security check, it's easily bypassed, leading to unauthorized access with medium impact and low effort.
            *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.1.2. Exploit Weak or Missing Authentication in Upgrade Request:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** The HTTP Upgrade request can carry authentication information (e.g., `Authorization` header, cookies). If these are missing, weak, or improperly validated by the server, an attacker can bypass authentication.
                *   **Why High-Risk:**  Missing or weak authentication is a fundamental security flaw. Exploiting it is straightforward, leading to unauthorized access with medium impact and low effort.

    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.2. Denial of Service during Handshake:**
        *   This path is high-risk because it allows attackers to easily disrupt the service availability. Overloading the server during the handshake phase can prevent legitimate users from establishing connections and using the application.
            *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.2.1. Handshake Flooding (Overwhelm server with upgrade requests):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a large number of WebSocket handshake requests to the server in a short period.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Handshake flooding is easy to execute, even with basic tools. It can quickly overwhelm server resources, causing service disruption (DoS) with medium impact and low effort.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [CRITICAL NODE] 2. Exploit WebSocket Data Frame Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/3___critical_node__2__exploit_websocket_data_frame_vulnerabilities.md)

Data frames are the core of WebSocket communication, carrying application data. Vulnerabilities here are critical because they allow attackers to manipulate the ongoing communication, inject malicious data, or disrupt the service during normal operation.

    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] 2.1. Data Injection/Manipulation:**
        *   This path is high-risk because it encompasses various attack vectors that can lead to significant compromise, including data breaches, unauthorized actions, and further exploitation of application logic.
            *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] 2.1.1. Inject Malicious Payloads (Exploit application logic vulnerabilities):**
                *   This node is critical as it highlights the danger of processing untrusted data from WebSocket messages without proper validation. It opens doors to various application-level vulnerabilities.
                    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1.1.3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (if messages are displayed in web UI without sanitization):**
                        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends malicious JavaScript code within a WebSocket message. If the application displays this message in a web UI without proper output encoding or sanitization, the script will execute in other users' browsers.
                        *   **Why High-Risk:** XSS is a common web vulnerability. Exploiting it via WebSockets can lead to account compromise, data theft, and website defacement with medium impact and low effort.
                    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1.1.4. Business Logic Exploitation (manipulate application state via crafted messages):**
                        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts specific WebSocket messages designed to exploit flaws in the application's business logic, leading to unintended actions, data manipulation, or privilege escalation.
                        *   **Why High-Risk:** Business logic flaws can have significant consequences, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data corruption, or privilege escalation. Exploitation can be medium likelihood and impact, requiring medium effort.

    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.2. Denial of Service via Data Frames:**
        *   This path is high-risk because it allows attackers to disrupt service availability by overwhelming the server with data frames after a connection is established.
            *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 2.2.1. Message Flooding (Send excessive data frames to overwhelm server):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a large volume of data frames to the server after establishing a WebSocket connection.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Message flooding is easy to execute. It can overwhelm server resources (processing, bandwidth, application logic), causing service disruption (DoS) with medium impact and low effort.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [CRITICAL NODE] 3. Exploit Gorilla WebSocket Library Specific Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/4___critical_node__3__exploit_gorilla_websocket_library_specific_vulnerabilities.md)

Using a third-party library introduces potential vulnerabilities within the library itself. This node is critical because vulnerabilities in the Gorilla WebSocket library can directly impact the application's security, potentially affecting all applications using the vulnerable version.

    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] 3.1. Known Gorilla WebSocket Library Vulnerabilities (Check CVE databases):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in specific versions of the Gorilla WebSocket library.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Known vulnerabilities are readily exploitable if the application uses an outdated library version. Exploitation is often easy, and the impact can be high (RCE, DoS, etc.) with low effort and beginner skill level.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [CRITICAL NODE] 4. Exploit Application Logic Flaws Related to WebSocket Usage:](./attack_tree_paths/5___critical_node__4__exploit_application_logic_flaws_related_to_websocket_usage.md)

Application logic flaws are often the most prevalent and easily exploitable vulnerabilities. This node is critical because it highlights the importance of secure coding practices and proper handling of WebSocket messages within the application's own code.

    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] 4.1. Insecure Data Handling in WebSocket Handlers:**
        *   This path is high-risk because it represents a common source of vulnerabilities in web applications, especially when dealing with user-provided data via WebSockets.
            *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] 4.1.1. Lack of Input Validation in Message Processing:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** The application fails to properly validate data received via WebSocket messages before processing it.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Lack of input validation is a fundamental security flaw. It opens the door to various injection attacks (SQL, Command, XSS) and business logic exploitation with medium/high impact and low effort.
