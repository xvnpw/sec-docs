## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Websocket Connection Handling](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_websocket_connection_handling.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities during the initial handshake and the ongoing management of the websocket connection.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Handshake Manipulation -> Downgrade Connection Security](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_handshake_manipulation_-_downgrade_connection_security.md)

An attacker attempts to force the connection to use an unencrypted WebSocket protocol (ws://) instead of the secure version (wss://) by manipulating the handshake request. This allows for eavesdropping on the communication.
        * Intercept and Modify Handshake Request: The attacker intercepts the initial handshake request between the client and server and modifies it to remove or alter the upgrade to a secure websocket connection.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH: Handshake Manipulation -> Bypass Authentication/Authorization (if supported)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_&_high_risk_path_handshake_manipulation_-_bypass_authenticationauthorization__if_suppo_35819a06.md)

If authentication or authorization mechanisms are implemented within the websocket handshake (e.g., using specific headers), an attacker might try to inject malicious headers or parameters to bypass these checks and gain unauthorized access.
        * Inject Malicious Headers/Parameters: The attacker crafts malicious headers or parameters within the handshake request, attempting to impersonate a legitimate user or bypass authentication logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Connection Flooding/DoS (Denial of Service)](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_connection_floodingdos__denial_of_service_.md)

The attacker aims to overwhelm the server with connection requests, preventing legitimate users from connecting or disrupting the application's functionality.
        * Initiate Numerous Connections: The attacker rapidly opens a large number of websocket connections, exhausting server resources like CPU, memory, and file descriptors.
            * Exhaust Server Resources (CPU, Memory, File Descriptors): The influx of connections consumes server resources, leading to performance degradation or complete service outage.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Connection Hijacking -> Session ID Stealing (if used in websocket context)](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_connection_hijacking_-_session_id_stealing__if_used_in_websocket_context_.md)

An attacker attempts to take over an established websocket connection, potentially gaining access to the ongoing communication and actions.
        * Session ID Stealing: If the application uses session IDs within the websocket context, an attacker might try to steal a valid session ID and use it to impersonate the legitimate user.
            * Man-in-the-Middle Attack: The attacker intercepts communication between the client and server, capturing the session ID.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Websocket Message Handling](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_websocket_message_handling.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities in how the application processes the messages exchanged over the websocket connection.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Malformed Message Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_malformed_message_injection.md)

The attacker sends messages that violate the expected format or structure, potentially causing errors or crashes.
        * Send Invalid JSON/Protocol Messages: If the application expects messages in a specific format (e.g., JSON), sending invalidly formatted messages can trigger parsing errors and potentially crash the server or client.
            * Trigger Parsing Errors and Application Crashes: The server or client fails to process the malformed message, leading to errors or a complete crash.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH: Logic Exploitation via Message Content](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_&_high_risk_path_logic_exploitation_via_message_content.md)

The attacker crafts messages with specific content to trigger unintended actions or bypass security checks within the application logic.
        * Inject Malicious Commands/Data: An attacker might try to inject malicious commands or data within the websocket message payload that the server-side application processes without proper sanitization.
            * Bypass Input Validation: The attacker crafts input that circumvents the application's validation checks, allowing malicious data to be processed.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Message Replay Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_message_replay_attacks.md)

An attacker captures valid websocket messages and resends them to execute actions without proper authorization.
        * Capture and Resend Valid Messages: The attacker intercepts legitimate websocket messages.
            * Execute Actions Without Authorization: The attacker resends the captured messages, causing the server to execute the corresponding actions again, potentially without the user's knowledge or consent.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH: Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_&_high_risk_path_cross-site_websocket_hijacking__cswsh_.md)

This attack leverages the trust a browser has in a website. An attacker tricks a user into visiting a malicious website that then establishes a websocket connection to the legitimate application on behalf of the user, allowing the attacker to send arbitrary messages.
        * Trick User into Clicking Malicious Link/Visiting Malicious Site: The attacker uses social engineering or other techniques to lure the user to a malicious webpage.
            * Establish Unauthorized Websocket Connection to Target Application: The malicious website contains code that opens a websocket connection to the target application, impersonating the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Data Injection via Message Interception (if not using TLS properly)](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_data_injection_via_message_interception__if_not_using_tls_properly_.md)

If the websocket connection is not properly secured with TLS (WSS), an attacker performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack can intercept and modify messages being exchanged between the client and server.
        * Man-in-the-Middle Attack to Modify Messages: The attacker intercepts the communication flow and alters the content of websocket messages before they reach their intended recipient.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities Triggered by Websocket](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities_triggered_by_websocket.md)

This category focuses on how malicious websocket activity can directly exploit vulnerabilities in the server-side application.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities Triggered by Websocket -> Resource Exhaustion via Message Bomb](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities_triggered_by_websocket_-_resource_exhaustion_via__bb665ec8.md)

An attacker sends a large number of small, but resource-intensive messages that force the server to perform significant processing, potentially leading to a denial of service.
        * Send a Large Number of Small, Resource-Intensive Messages: The attacker floods the server with messages designed to consume its processing power and resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities Triggered by Websocket -> Code Injection via Unsafe Message Processing](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_&_high_risk_path_exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities_triggered_by_websocket_-_code_inj_450dceff.md)

If the server-side application dynamically interprets data received via the websocket as code (e.g., using `eval()` or similar functions without proper sanitization), an attacker can inject malicious code that will be executed on the server.
        * If Server-Side Code Interprets Websocket Data as Code: The application uses a mechanism that executes data received via the websocket as code.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities (via Websocket)](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities__via_websocket_.md)

This category focuses on how a malicious server (or a compromised legitimate server) can exploit vulnerabilities in the client application interacting with the websocket.
        * Malicious Server Sending Exploit Payloads: A compromised or malicious server can send websocket messages containing payloads designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the client application.
            * Send Messages Containing Client-Side Exploits (e.g., XSS): The server sends messages containing malicious scripts that, when rendered by the client's browser, can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
                * Compromise Client Browser or Application: The malicious script executes in the user's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
