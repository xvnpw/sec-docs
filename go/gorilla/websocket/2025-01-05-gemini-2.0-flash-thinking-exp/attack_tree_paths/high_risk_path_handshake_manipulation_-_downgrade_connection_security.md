## Deep Analysis: Handshake Manipulation - Downgrade Connection Security

This analysis delves into the attack path "Handshake Manipulation -> Downgrade Connection Security" for an application using the `gorilla/websocket` library in Go. We will break down the attack, potential vulnerabilities, impact, and mitigation strategies.

**Attack Tree Path:**

* **HIGH RISK PATH:** Handshake Manipulation -> Downgrade Connection Security
    * **Intercept and Modify Handshake Request:** The attacker intercepts the initial handshake request between the client and server and modifies it to remove or alter the upgrade to a secure websocket connection.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack:**

1. **The WebSocket Handshake:**
   - When a client wants to establish a WebSocket connection over HTTPS (wss://), it starts with a standard HTTP GET request.
   - This request includes specific headers that signal the intention to upgrade to the WebSocket protocol. Key headers include:
     - `Upgrade: websocket`
     - `Connection: Upgrade`
     - `Sec-WebSocket-Key`: A base64-encoded random value.
     - `Sec-WebSocket-Version`: The WebSocket protocol version.

2. **The Attack Scenario:**
   - The attacker positions themselves as a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) between the client and the server. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
     - **Network Intrusion:** Compromising a router or network device.
     - **ARP Spoofing:** Redirecting traffic on a local network.
     - **DNS Spoofing:** Redirecting the client to a malicious server.
     - **Compromised Wi-Fi:** Intercepting traffic on an insecure wireless network.

3. **Intercepting the Handshake Request:**
   - Once in a MITM position, the attacker intercepts the initial HTTP GET request sent by the client intending to establish a secure WebSocket connection (`wss://`).

4. **Modifying the Handshake Request:**
   - The attacker manipulates the intercepted request before forwarding it (or a modified version) to the server. The key modifications would involve:
     - **Removing or Altering `Upgrade` and `Connection` Headers:** By removing or changing these headers, the attacker prevents the server from recognizing the request as a WebSocket upgrade attempt.
     - **Changing the URI Scheme (Potentially):** While the primary focus is on header manipulation, an attacker might also attempt to change the URI scheme from `wss://` to `ws://`. However, modern browsers often prevent this direct downgrade if the initial request was for `wss://`. The header manipulation is the more likely and effective approach.

5. **Server Response and Downgrade:**
   - If the server receives a modified request lacking the necessary upgrade headers, it will likely treat it as a regular HTTP request.
   - The server might respond with a standard HTTP response (e.g., HTTP/1.1 200 OK) instead of the expected `HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols` for a successful WebSocket upgrade.
   - Crucially, if the server is not strictly enforcing `wss://` and allows connections over `ws://`, it might inadvertently establish an unencrypted WebSocket connection.

6. **Eavesdropping on Communication:**
   - With the connection downgraded to `ws://`, all subsequent WebSocket communication between the client and the server will be transmitted in plaintext.
   - The attacker, still in the MITM position, can now eavesdrop on the entire communication, including sensitive data, authentication tokens, and application-specific information.

**Potential Vulnerabilities and Considerations within `gorilla/websocket`:**

* **Server-Side Configuration:** The primary vulnerability lies in the server-side implementation and configuration. If the server is configured to accept `ws://` connections in addition to `wss://`, it becomes susceptible to this downgrade attack.
* **Lack of Strict `wss://` Enforcement:**  If the server doesn't strictly enforce the use of `wss://` for certain endpoints or under specific conditions, attackers can exploit this flexibility.
* **Handling of Modified Requests:** While `gorilla/websocket` itself doesn't inherently create this vulnerability, the application logic built on top of it needs to be robust in handling unexpected or malformed handshake requests.
* **Client-Side Vulnerabilities (Less Direct):** While this attack focuses on manipulating the handshake, client-side vulnerabilities could indirectly contribute. For example, if a client is tricked into initiating a `ws://` connection in the first place, the handshake manipulation isn't necessary for the downgrade.

**Impact of Successful Attack:**

* **Confidentiality Breach:** The most significant impact is the exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the now unencrypted WebSocket connection.
* **Session Hijacking:** If authentication tokens or session IDs are transmitted, the attacker can potentially hijack user sessions.
* **Data Manipulation:** In some scenarios, the attacker might be able to intercept and modify data being exchanged between the client and server.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization behind it.
* **Compliance Violations:** Depending on the nature of the data being transmitted, a successful attack could lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Server-Side:**

* **Strictly Enforce `wss://`:** Configure the server to **only** accept WebSocket connections over `wss://`. This is the most effective defense against this specific attack.
* **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):** Implement HSTS headers on the HTTPS website serving the WebSocket application. This instructs browsers to always use HTTPS for future connections, preventing accidental or forced downgrades to HTTP.
* **Validate Upgrade Requests:** While `gorilla/websocket` handles the basic upgrade process, ensure your application logic validates the incoming upgrade requests and rejects those that don't conform to the expected secure WebSocket handshake.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP that restricts the sources from which the application can load resources and connect to WebSockets, mitigating potential redirection attacks.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the application and its configuration.

**Client-Side:**

* **Always Initiate `wss://` Connections:** Ensure the client-side code always initiates WebSocket connections using the `wss://` protocol.
* **Avoid Mixed Content:**  Ensure that a secure HTTPS page only attempts to establish `wss://` connections. Browsers often block or warn about mixed content (HTTPS page initiating `ws://` connections).
* **Educate Users:** Educate users about the risks of connecting to untrusted networks and the importance of verifying the security of connections.

**Network Security:**

* **TLS Certificates:** Use valid and properly configured TLS certificates for the `wss://` endpoint.
* **Secure Network Infrastructure:** Implement robust network security measures to prevent attackers from positioning themselves as MITM. This includes using firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and secure network configurations.
* **Monitor Network Traffic:** Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity that might indicate a MITM attack.

**Code Example (Illustrative - Server-Side Enforcement):**

While `gorilla/websocket` doesn't have a direct "force wss" setting, you can implement checks in your handler:

```go
import (
	"log"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/gorilla/websocket"
)

var upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{
	// ... other configurations ...
	CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool {
		// Allow all connections for now, consider stricter checks in production
		return true
	},
}

func websocketHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	if r.URL.Scheme != "https" && r.Header.Get("X-Forwarded-Proto") != "https" {
		log.Println("Attempted insecure WebSocket connection rejected")
		http.Error(w, "Secure WebSocket connection required", http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	conn, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println("Upgrade error:", err)
		return
	}
	defer conn.Close()

	// ... handle WebSocket messages ...
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/ws", websocketHandler)
	log.Println("Server starting on :8080")
	err := http.ListenAndServeTLS(":8080", "server.crt", "server.key", nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("ListenAndServe:", err)
	}
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**

* The "Handshake Manipulation -> Downgrade Connection Security" attack is a serious threat to WebSocket applications.
* The primary vulnerability lies in the server's willingness to accept insecure `ws://` connections.
* Strict enforcement of `wss://` on the server-side is the most crucial mitigation strategy.
* Implementing HSTS and other security best practices further strengthens the application's defenses.
* Regular security audits and awareness of potential MITM attack vectors are essential for maintaining a secure WebSocket implementation.

By understanding the mechanics of this attack and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of successful handshake manipulation and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of their WebSocket communication.
