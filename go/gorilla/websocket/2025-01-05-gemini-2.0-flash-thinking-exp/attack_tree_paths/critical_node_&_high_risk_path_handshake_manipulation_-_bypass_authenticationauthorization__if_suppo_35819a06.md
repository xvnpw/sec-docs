## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Handshake Manipulation -> Bypass Authentication/Authorization (if supported)

This analysis delves into the specific attack path "Handshake Manipulation -> Bypass Authentication/Authorization (if supported)" within the context of an application using the `github.com/gorilla/websocket` library. We will break down the attack, its potential mechanics, the role of the library, and effective mitigation strategies.

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

This attack path targets the initial handshake phase of the WebSocket connection. The handshake is essentially an HTTP upgrade request where the client and server negotiate the WebSocket protocol. If the application developers have chosen to implement authentication or authorization checks *during this handshake*, this path becomes a critical vulnerability.

The core idea is that an attacker manipulates the HTTP headers or parameters within this handshake request to circumvent the intended authentication or authorization logic. This allows them to establish a WebSocket connection with potentially elevated privileges or as a different user than intended.

**Detailed Breakdown of "Inject Malicious Headers/Parameters":**

This sub-node describes the primary technique used in this attack path. Here's a more granular look:

* **Target:** The HTTP Upgrade request sent by the client to initiate the WebSocket connection. This request includes standard HTTP headers and potentially custom headers or query parameters used for authentication.
* **Mechanism:** The attacker modifies this request before it reaches the server. This could happen through various means:
    * **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** Intercepting the handshake request and modifying it in transit.
    * **Compromised Client:** The attacker controls the client application and can craft arbitrary handshake requests.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Client-Side Logic:** If the client-side code responsible for generating the handshake is flawed, an attacker might exploit it to inject malicious data.
* **Types of Injected Malicious Data:**
    * **Spoofed Authentication Headers:**  Injecting headers that mimic legitimate authentication credentials. Examples:
        * `Authorization: Bearer <forged_token>`
        * `X-Auth-Token: <known_valid_token_for_another_user>`
        * `Cookie: sessionid=<valid_session_id_of_another_user>`
    * **Bypassing Authorization Headers:** Injecting headers that trick the server into granting access. Examples:
        * `X-Admin: true` (if the server naively checks for this header)
        * `X-Permissions: admin`
    * **Manipulating User Identifiers:**  Injecting headers that specify a different user ID or role. Examples:
        * `X-User-Id: <target_user_id>`
        * `X-Role: administrator`
    * **Exploiting Logic Flaws:** Injecting unexpected or malformed data that exposes vulnerabilities in the server-side authentication/authorization logic. This could involve:
        * Injecting empty or null values for required authentication headers.
        * Injecting excessively long or special characters to cause buffer overflows or other parsing errors.
        * Injecting headers with conflicting information to confuse the server.

**Impact of Successful Bypass:**

Successfully bypassing authentication or authorization during the handshake can have severe consequences:

* **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker gains access to the WebSocket connection as if they were a legitimate user.
* **Data Breach:** The attacker can access sensitive data transmitted over the WebSocket connection.
* **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can send malicious messages to the server, potentially modifying or deleting data.
* **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker might gain access to functionalities or data they are not authorized to access, potentially gaining administrative control.
* **Account Takeover:** If the authentication mechanism is compromised, the attacker could potentially take over legitimate user accounts.
* **Reputation Damage:** Security breaches can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization.

**Role of `github.com/gorilla/websocket`:**

The `gorilla/websocket` library itself provides the foundational building blocks for implementing WebSocket communication in Go. It handles the low-level details of the WebSocket protocol, including the handshake process.

**Key Aspects related to this attack path:**

* **`RequestHeader` in the `Upgrader`:** The `gorilla/websocket` library provides access to the headers of the incoming handshake request through the `RequestHeader` field in the `Upgrader` struct. This is where developers would typically implement their authentication/authorization logic.
* **Flexibility and Responsibility:** The library is designed to be flexible, meaning it doesn't enforce any specific authentication or authorization mechanisms. This responsibility falls entirely on the application developers.
* **No Built-in Security:** The library itself doesn't inherently protect against handshake manipulation. Developers must implement their own security measures to validate the handshake request.

**Potential Attack Scenarios:**

Let's consider some concrete examples of how this attack could be executed:

* **Scenario 1: Custom Header Authentication:**
    * **Implementation:** The server expects a custom header `X-API-Key` with a valid API key during the handshake.
    * **Attack:** An attacker intercepts the handshake and injects a known valid `X-API-Key` belonging to another user or a generic, easily guessable key if the implementation is weak.
* **Scenario 2: Query Parameter Authentication:**
    * **Implementation:** The server checks for an `auth_token` query parameter in the handshake URL.
    * **Attack:** An attacker crafts a malicious handshake URL with a forged or stolen `auth_token`.
* **Scenario 3: Cookie-Based Authentication:**
    * **Implementation:** The server relies on a session cookie set prior to the WebSocket connection.
    * **Attack:** An attacker might attempt to inject a valid session cookie from another user into the handshake request. This is less common in the initial handshake but could be relevant if the server re-validates cookies during the upgrade process.
* **Scenario 4: Exploiting Weak Validation Logic:**
    * **Implementation:** The server checks for the presence of an `Is-Admin` header and grants admin privileges if present.
    * **Attack:** An attacker simply injects the `Is-Admin: true` header to gain unauthorized administrative access.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively mitigate this attack path, developers should implement robust security measures during the WebSocket handshake:

* **Strong Authentication Mechanisms:**
    * **Established Standards:** Prefer well-established authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0 or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securing the handshake.
    * **Mutual Authentication (TLS Client Certificates):**  For highly sensitive applications, consider using TLS client certificates for strong mutual authentication.
* **Secure Header and Parameter Validation:**
    * **Whitelisting:**  Strictly validate only the expected headers and parameters. Reject any unexpected or unknown data.
    * **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize and validate all input from headers and parameters to prevent injection attacks.
    * **Strong Type Checking:**  Ensure that the data types of authentication parameters are as expected.
* **Secure Storage of Secrets:**
    * **Environment Variables or Secrets Management Systems:** Avoid hardcoding API keys or other secrets directly in the code.
    * **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt sensitive authentication data stored on the server.
* **Rate Limiting and Throttling:**
    * **Prevent Brute-Force Attacks:** Implement rate limiting on handshake attempts to prevent attackers from trying multiple authentication credentials.
* **Secure Communication Channels (HTTPS/TLS):**
    * **Mandatory TLS:** Ensure that the WebSocket connection is established over HTTPS (which upgrades to WSS) to protect the handshake from eavesdropping and tampering.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Identify Vulnerabilities:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential weaknesses in the handshake authentication implementation.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Grant Minimal Access:** Only grant the necessary privileges to the established WebSocket connection based on the authenticated user.
* **Contextual Awareness:**
    * **Tie Authentication to the Session:** Ensure that the authentication information provided during the handshake is tied to the subsequent WebSocket session and cannot be easily reused or replayed.
* **Consider Anti-CSRF Tokens:**
    * **Mitigate Cross-Site Attacks:** If the handshake involves cookies, consider using anti-CSRF tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.

**Code Example (Illustrative - Security Best Practices Should be Followed):**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/gorilla/websocket"
)

var upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{
	CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool {
		return true // For demonstration purposes - in production, validate origin
	},
}

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// **Authentication/Authorization Logic during Handshake**
	apiKey := r.Header.Get("X-API-Key")
	if apiKey == "" || !isValidAPIKey(apiKey) {
		http.Error(w, "Unauthorized", http.StatusUnauthorized)
		return
	}

	conn, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("upgrade:", err)
		return
	}
	defer conn.Close()

	// ... rest of your WebSocket handling logic ...
}

func isValidAPIKey(key string) bool {
	// **Implement robust API key validation logic here**
	// This is a simplified example - use secure storage and comparison
	validKeys := map[string]bool{"valid_key_123": true, "another_valid_key": true}
	return validKeys[key]
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/ws", handler)
	fmt.Println("Server started on :8080")
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

**Conclusion:**

The "Handshake Manipulation -> Bypass Authentication/Authorization" attack path is a critical vulnerability that can have significant security implications for applications using `github.com/gorilla/websocket`. Since the library provides flexibility without enforcing specific security measures, it is the responsibility of the developers to implement robust authentication and authorization checks during the handshake phase. By understanding the potential attack vectors and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack and build more secure WebSocket applications.
