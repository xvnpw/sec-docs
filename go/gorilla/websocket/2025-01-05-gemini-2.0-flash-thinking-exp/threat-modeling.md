# Threat Model Analysis for gorilla/websocket

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Connection](./threats/unauthenticated_connection.md)

**Description:** An attacker bypasses authentication mechanisms and establishes a direct websocket connection to the server. They might do this by crafting a websocket handshake request without providing valid credentials or exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication process *before* the `gorilla/websocket` connection is fully established.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to websocket endpoints, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation of data intended for legitimate users, or the ability to perform actions on behalf of others.

**Affected Component:** `gorilla/websocket`'s connection handling logic, specifically the acceptance and management of new connections *before* application-level authentication is enforced.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust authentication before upgrading to the websocket protocol. Verify user identity on each incoming message if necessary. Do not rely solely on the websocket connection being secure; enforce authentication at the application layer.

## Threat: [Origin Spoofing](./threats/origin_spoofing.md)

**Description:** An attacker hosts a malicious webpage on a different domain and crafts websocket handshake requests with a forged `Origin` header, mimicking a legitimate domain. The server, if not properly configured *when using `gorilla/websocket` to handle the handshake*, might accept this connection.

**Impact:** The malicious website can interact with the websocket server as if it were a trusted client, potentially exfiltrating data or performing unauthorized actions.

**Affected Component:** `gorilla/websocket`'s handshake handling, specifically the processing of the `Origin` header.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strict origin validation on the server side *using `gorilla/websocket`'s configuration options or custom handshake handling*. Maintain a whitelist of allowed origins and reject connections from any other origin.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (Handshake Flood)](./threats/denial_of_service__handshake_flood_.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the server with a large number of websocket handshake requests. They might use botnets or automated scripts to overwhelm the server's resources *at the point where `gorilla/websocket` is handling the initial connection attempts*.

**Impact:** The server becomes unresponsive to legitimate connection attempts, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. Server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) can be exhausted.

**Affected Component:** `gorilla/websocket`'s connection acceptance logic, specifically the handling of incoming handshake requests.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement rate limiting on incoming connection requests *before they reach `gorilla/websocket` or within the `gorilla/websocket` configuration if available*. Consider using techniques like SYN cookies or connection queuing to mitigate handshake floods. Implement resource limits on the number of concurrent connections.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (Large Message Attack)](./threats/denial_of_service__large_message_attack_.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends excessively large messages through the websocket connection. They might exploit the lack of proper message size limits on the server *when `gorilla/websocket` is responsible for reading the message*.

**Impact:** The server consumes excessive resources (memory, CPU) trying to process the large messages, potentially leading to performance degradation or a complete denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `gorilla/websocket`'s message reading and processing logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement message size limits on both the client and server sides *that are enforced by the application using `gorilla/websocket`'s configuration or checks*. Reject messages exceeding the defined limits. Implement backpressure mechanisms to control the rate of incoming messages.

## Threat: [Message Injection/Tampering](./threats/message_injectiontampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts websocket messages in transit (though HTTPS encrypts the transport, application-level vulnerabilities can still exist) and modifies their content before they reach the intended recipient. They might use techniques like man-in-the-middle attacks (if HTTPS is not properly implemented or certificate validation is weak) or exploit vulnerabilities in the client or server code *before or after `gorilla/websocket` handles the message*.

**Impact:**  Manipulated data can lead to incorrect application behavior, data corruption, unauthorized actions, or security breaches.

**Affected Component:** `gorilla/websocket`'s message reading and writing logic, as well as the application's message handling logic interacting with the data received/sent by `gorilla/websocket`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement message integrity checks using techniques like HMAC or digital signatures at the application layer. Ensure proper TLS/SSL configuration and certificate validation. Avoid storing sensitive data in a way that allows for easy manipulation if intercepted.

## Threat: [Connection Hijacking](./threats/connection_hijacking.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of an established websocket connection. This could occur due to vulnerabilities in the application's session management or authentication *after* the initial handshake managed by `gorilla/websocket`.

**Impact:** The attacker can impersonate the legitimate user, access their data, and perform actions on their behalf.

**Affected Component:** The application's session management and authentication mechanisms *interacting with the connection established by `gorilla/websocket`*, not directly a `gorilla/websocket` component itself.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong session management and authentication practices. Regularly regenerate session tokens. Enforce secure cookies (HttpOnly, Secure).
