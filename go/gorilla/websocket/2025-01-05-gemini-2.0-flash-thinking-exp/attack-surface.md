# Attack Surface Analysis for gorilla/websocket

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_websocket_hijacking__cswsh_.md)

**Description:** An attacker tricks a user's browser into making a websocket connection to a vulnerable server from a malicious website. The attacker can then intercept or manipulate the websocket communication.

**How Websocket Contributes:** The websocket handshake relies on HTTP, and if the server doesn't properly validate the `Origin` header, a cross-origin request initiated by the attacker's website can be upgraded to a websocket connection.

**Example:** A user is logged into their banking application. They then visit a malicious website. This website contains JavaScript that initiates a websocket connection to the banking application's websocket endpoint. If the banking application doesn't validate the `Origin` header, the connection succeeds, and the attacker can send commands as the logged-in user.

**Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized transactions, data exfiltration.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict `Origin` Header Validation:** The server-side application (using `gorilla/websocket`) must strictly validate the `Origin` header against an allowlist of trusted origins. Reject connections from unexpected origins.
* **Synchronizer Tokens:** Implement synchronizer tokens or similar mechanisms tied to the user's session and require them in websocket messages to verify the message's legitimacy.
* **Avoid Relying Solely on HTTP Cookies for Authentication:** While cookies are often used for initial authentication, consider additional authentication mechanisms within the websocket protocol itself.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Input Validation on WebSocket Messages](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_input_validation_on_websocket_messages.md)

**Description:** The server-side application doesn't properly validate and sanitize data received through websocket messages. This can lead to various injection attacks.

**How Websocket Contributes:** Websockets facilitate bidirectional communication, allowing clients to send arbitrary data to the server. If this data isn't validated, it can be exploited.

**Example:** A chat application receives commands via websockets. An attacker sends a message like `"/execute system('rm -rf /')"` if the server directly executes commands from the message without validation.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, denial of service, privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data received over the websocket connection based on expected formats and values.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the code processing websocket messages operates with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in WebSocket Messages](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_websocket_messages.md)

**Description:** If the application deserializes data received over the websocket (e.g., JSON, Protocol Buffers) without proper safeguards, attackers can send malicious payloads that exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization process.

**How Websocket Contributes:** Websockets often transmit structured data, making deserialization a common operation.

**Example:** An application uses JSON to exchange data. An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload that, when deserialized, triggers a remote code execution vulnerability in the JSON parsing library or application logic.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Use Secure Deserialization Libraries:** Choose deserialization libraries known for their security and keep them updated.
* **Input Validation Before Deserialization:** Perform basic validation on the raw data before attempting deserialization.
* **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data:** If possible, avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources. If necessary, implement robust security measures.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Message Flooding](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_message_flooding.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a large number of messages to the websocket endpoint, overwhelming the server's resources and making it unavailable to legitimate users.

**How Websocket Contributes:** The persistent nature of websocket connections can make it easier for attackers to maintain a high volume of traffic.

**Example:** An attacker script continuously sends small, meaningless messages to the websocket server, consuming processing power and network bandwidth.

**Impact:** Service disruption, resource exhaustion, potential server crashes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on websocket connections to restrict the number of messages a client can send within a specific timeframe.
* **Connection Limits:** Limit the number of concurrent websocket connections from a single IP address or user.
* **Message Size Limits:** Enforce reasonable maximum message sizes to prevent excessively large messages from consuming too many resources.
* **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual spikes in websocket traffic or resource consumption.

## Attack Surface: [WebSocket Message Forgery/Spoofing](./attack_surfaces/websocket_message_forgeryspoofing.md)

**Description:** An attacker can craft and send websocket messages that appear to originate from a legitimate client, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.

**How Websocket Contributes:** If the application doesn't properly authenticate the source of messages after the initial handshake, it's vulnerable to message forgery.

**Example:** In a collaborative editing application, an attacker sends a message pretending to be another user, making unauthorized changes to the document.

**Impact:** Data manipulation, unauthorized actions, impersonation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strong Authentication After Handshake:** Implement mechanisms to authenticate each websocket message, not just the initial connection. This could involve using session tokens, digital signatures, or other cryptographic methods.
* **Mutual TLS (mTLS):** For highly sensitive applications, consider using mTLS to authenticate both the client and the server.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Excessive WebSocket Connections](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_excessive_websocket_connections.md)

**Description:** An attacker opens a large number of websocket connections to the server, consuming resources like memory, CPU, and file descriptors, potentially leading to denial of service.

**How Websocket Contributes:** Websocket connections are persistent and can consume resources for their entire duration.

**Example:** An attacker script rapidly opens and maintains thousands of websocket connections to the server.

**Impact:** Service disruption, resource exhaustion, potential server crashes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Connection Limits:** Implement limits on the number of concurrent websocket connections allowed from a single IP address or user.
* **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for excessive connection counts.
* **Proper Connection Termination and Cleanup:** Ensure the application correctly closes and cleans up resources associated with closed websocket connections.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in `gorilla/websocket` Library Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in__gorillawebsocket__library_itself.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities might exist within the `gorilla/websocket` library code itself.

**How Websocket Contributes:** The application's reliance on this specific library makes it susceptible to vulnerabilities within it.

**Example:** A discovered bug in `gorilla/websocket`'s handling of certain control frames could be exploited by an attacker sending a specially crafted control frame.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep `gorilla/websocket` Up-to-Date:** Regularly update the `gorilla/websocket` library to the latest version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
* **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to the `gorilla/websocket` library and its dependencies.
