# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for gorilla/websocket

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Message Size Limits](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_message_size_limits.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Define Maximum Message Sizes:** Determine appropriate maximum message sizes for both incoming and outgoing websocket messages.
    *   **Step 2: Set `ReadLimit` in `Upgrader`:** When creating the `gorilla/websocket.Upgrader`, set the `ReadLimit` field to the defined maximum incoming message size in bytes. This limit will be applied to all connections upgraded by this `Upgrader`.
    *   **Step 3: Set `WriteLimit` in `Conn` (Optional but Recommended):** After a successful websocket upgrade, obtain the `Conn` object. Optionally, but recommended for consistency and clarity, set the `WriteLimit` on the `Conn` object as well to the defined maximum outgoing message size.
    *   **Step 4: Handle Exceeding Limits:** `gorilla/websocket` will automatically close the connection if the `ReadLimit` is exceeded during a read operation. You can handle this closure gracefully in your connection management logic. For `WriteLimit`, you should ensure your application logic does not attempt to send messages larger than the defined limit.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks via large message flooding (Severity: Medium)
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Memory exhaustion due to processing large messages) (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   DoS attacks via large message flooding: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the impact of attacks using excessively large messages.
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Medium Risk Reduction - Prevents memory exhaustion from processing extremely large messages, improving server stability.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially - `ReadLimit` is set to 512KB in the `Upgrader` configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `WriteLimit` is not explicitly set on the `Conn` object after upgrade. It should be added for clarity and consistent enforcement. The defined limits should be reviewed and potentially increased to 1MB based on application needs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Set Read and Write Timeouts](./mitigation_strategies/set_read_and_write_timeouts.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Define Timeout Durations:** Determine appropriate timeout durations for read and write operations on websocket connections.
    *   **Step 2: Set `ReadDeadline` and `WriteDeadline` on `Conn`:** After a successful websocket upgrade and obtaining the `Conn` object, set `conn.SetReadDeadline(time.Now().Add(readTimeout))` and `conn.SetWriteDeadline(time.Now().Add(writeTimeout))` for each connection. `readTimeout` and `writeTimeout` are `time.Duration` variables holding the defined timeout durations.
    *   **Step 3: Handle Timeout Errors:** When read or write operations time out, they will return an error. Your application's connection handling logic should check for these timeout errors (specifically `net.Error` and check if `Timeout()` is true). Upon timeout, close the connection gracefully and clean up resources.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks via slowloris-style attacks (slow clients holding connections open indefinitely) (Severity: Medium)
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Server resources held by inactive or stalled connections) (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   DoS attacks via slowloris-style attacks: Medium Risk Reduction - Prevents slow clients from holding connections open indefinitely and consuming server resources.
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces resource consumption by proactively closing connections that are not actively communicating.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Read and write deadlines are not currently set on the websocket `Conn` objects after upgrade. This should be implemented in the connection handling logic immediately after a successful upgrade.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Origin Header](./mitigation_strategies/validate_origin_header.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Implement `CheckOrigin` Function in `Upgrader`:** Define a `CheckOrigin` function for your `gorilla/websocket.Upgrader`. This function will be called by the `Upgrader` during the websocket handshake.
    *   **Step 2: Define Allowed Origins:** Create a list or set of allowed origins (domains) that are permitted to connect to your websocket server.
    *   **Step 3: Validate Origin in `CheckOrigin`:** Inside the `CheckOrigin` function, extract the `Origin` header from the `http.Request`. Compare this origin against your list of allowed origins.
    *   **Step 4: Return `true` for Allowed Origins, `false` for Others:** If the `Origin` header matches an allowed origin, return `true` from the `CheckOrigin` function to accept the connection. Otherwise, return `false` to reject the connection.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH): High Risk Reduction - Effectively prevents CSWSH attacks by ensuring connections only originate from trusted domains.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes - A `CheckOrigin` function is implemented in the `Upgrader`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The list of allowed origins is currently hardcoded in the `CheckOrigin` function. This should be moved to a configuration file or environment variable for easier management and updates without code changes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep `gorilla/websocket` Library Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep__gorillawebsocket__library_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Regularly Check for Updates:** Periodically check for new releases of the `gorilla/websocket` library on GitHub or through your Go dependency management tool.
    *   **Step 2: Review Release Notes:** When updates are available, carefully review the release notes to understand what changes are included, especially bug fixes and security patches.
    *   **Step 3: Update the Library:** Update your project's dependency on `gorilla/websocket` to the latest version using your Go dependency management tool.
    *   **Step 4: Test After Update:** After updating, thoroughly test your websocket application to ensure compatibility with the new library version and that no regressions have been introduced.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in `gorilla/websocket` library (Severity: High, if vulnerabilities exist and are exploitable)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of known vulnerabilities: High Risk Reduction - Prevents exploitation of publicly known vulnerabilities in the library itself by applying security patches and bug fixes.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No - The `gorilla/websocket` library version has not been updated in the last 6 months.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A process for regularly checking and updating dependencies, including `gorilla/websocket`, should be established as part of the project's maintenance and security practices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Securely Configure `gorilla/websocket` Upgrader](./mitigation_strategies/securely_configure__gorillawebsocket__upgrader.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Review `Upgrader` Configuration:** Examine the configuration of your `gorilla/websocket.Upgrader` struct in your Go code.
    *   **Step 2: Set Appropriate Buffer Sizes:**
        *   `ReadBufferSize`: Set this to a reasonable value based on your expected message sizes and server memory capacity.
        *   `WriteBufferSize`: Similarly, set `WriteBufferSize` appropriately.
    *   **Step 3: Configure `HandshakeTimeout`:** Set `HandshakeTimeout` to a reasonable duration to prevent slow clients from holding up handshake resources indefinitely.
    *   **Step 4: Implement `CheckOrigin` (as discussed previously):** Ensure `CheckOrigin` is implemented and properly validates allowed origins to prevent CSWSH.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Resource Exhaustion (due to misconfigured buffer sizes or handshake timeouts) (Severity: Medium)
    *   Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (if `CheckOrigin` is not properly configured) (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of resource exhaustion due to inefficient buffer management or handshake handling.
    *   Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking: High Risk Reduction (if `CheckOrigin` is the focus) - Reinforces CSWSH prevention through proper origin validation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially - `ReadBufferSize` and `WriteBufferSize` are set to default values. `HandshakeTimeout` is not explicitly set. `CheckOrigin` is implemented but needs configuration improvements.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicitly set `HandshakeTimeout` in the `Upgrader` configuration. Review and potentially adjust `ReadBufferSize` and `WriteBufferSize` based on application needs and resource constraints. Improve the configuration of `CheckOrigin` as noted earlier.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use WSS (Websocket Secure) with gorilla/websocket](./mitigation_strategies/use_wss__websocket_secure__with_gorillawebsocket.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Obtain SSL/TLS Certificates:** Acquire valid SSL/TLS certificates for your domain or server.
    *   **Step 2: Configure HTTPS Listener:** Configure your Go HTTP server (which `gorilla/websocket` integrates with) to listen for HTTPS connections (port 443 by default). Load your SSL/TLS certificates into the HTTPS listener configuration.
    *   **Step 3: Upgrade to WSS:** When clients connect to your websocket endpoint, ensure they use the `wss://` scheme instead of `ws://`. The `gorilla/websocket.Upgrader` will automatically handle WSS connections when running under an HTTPS listener.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Eavesdropping (interception of websocket communication) (Severity: High)
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks (tampering with websocket communication) (Severity: High)
    *   Data Integrity violations (unauthorized modification of data in transit) (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Eavesdropping: High Risk Reduction - Prevents eavesdropping by encrypting websocket traffic handled by `gorilla/websocket`.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks: High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of MITM attacks for `gorilla/websocket` communication by establishing an encrypted and authenticated channel.
    *   Data Integrity violations: High Risk Reduction - Protects data integrity of `gorilla/websocket` messages by preventing tampering during transmission.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes - WSS is used for production deployments. The server is configured with HTTPS and clients connect using `wss://`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No missing implementation related to WSS itself within `gorilla/websocket` usage. However, ensure that HTTP to HTTPS redirection is in place to enforce WSS usage for all clients accessing the websocket endpoint.
