## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dosddos_.md)

*   **Overall:** A critical threat aiming to make the service unavailable to legitimate users.  High likelihood due to the prevalence of DoS/DDoS attacks.

*   **Resource Exhaustion:**
    *   **Description:** Overwhelming server resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) to prevent it from handling legitimate requests.
    *   **Slowloris-Style Attacks:**
        *   **Description:**  Maintain many WebSocket connections, sending data very slowly to keep connections open and consume resources.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Relatively easy to execute with readily available tools, and highly effective if the server doesn't have proper timeouts and connection limits.
    *   **Large Payloads:**
        *   **Description:** Sending extremely large messages to consume server resources during processing.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Simple to execute, and the impact can be significant if the application doesn't enforce strict message size limits.

*   **Malformed Messages:**
    * **Oversized Payloads:**
        *   **Description:** Sending messages with a declared size larger than what the server can handle, potentially leading to buffer overflows or other memory-related issues.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** While `gorilla/websocket` does some size checks, application-level checks are crucial, and oversights can lead to significant vulnerabilities.

*   **Connection Flooding:**
    *   **Description:** Establishing a large number of WebSocket connections to overwhelm the server's ability to handle new connections.
    *   **Many Clients (DDoS):**
        *   **Description:**  Using multiple compromised machines (a botnet) to simultaneously establish many connections.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  A common and highly effective attack, though it requires more resources from the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Manipulation/Exfiltration](./attack_tree_paths/data_manipulationexfiltration.md)

*   **Overall:**  A critical threat that involves modifying data in transit or stealing sensitive information.

*   **Message Injection:**
    *   **Description:** Injecting malicious messages into the WebSocket stream to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's message handling.
    *   **Craft Malicious Payloads:**
        *   **Description:**  Sending messages specifically designed to trigger vulnerabilities in the application's parsing or processing logic.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  The core of many injection attacks, with potentially very high impact depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Send Unauthorized Messages:**
        *   **Description:**  Sending messages that the attacker shouldn't be allowed to send, bypassing authorization checks.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Directly leads to data manipulation or exfiltration if authorization is flawed.

*   **Bypass Authentication/Authorization:**
    *   **Description:** Accessing WebSocket functionality without proper credentials or permissions.
    *   **No/Weak Authentication:**
        *   **Description:**  The application doesn't properly authenticate WebSocket connections, or uses weak authentication methods.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  A fundamental security flaw that allows unrestricted access.
    *   **Missing Authorization Checks:**
        *   **Description:**  The application authenticates users but doesn't check if they are authorized to perform specific actions via the WebSocket.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  A common oversight that allows attackers to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.
    *   **Exploit Logic Flaws:**
        *   **Description:** Bypassing authentication/authorization through vulnerabilities in the application's logic.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** The impact depends on the specific flaw, but can be very high.
        *   **Session Fixation:**
            *   **Description:**  An attacker sets a known session ID for the victim, allowing them to hijack the session after the victim authenticates.
            *   **Why High-Risk:**  Leads to complete account takeover if session IDs are predictable or not properly managed.
            *   **Predictable Session Tokens:**
                * **Description:** Session tokens that can be easily guessed or brute-forced.
                * **Why High-Risk:** Allows attackers to impersonate legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Overall:** The most critical threat, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

*   **Vulnerable Dependencies:**
    *   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the `gorilla/websocket` library itself or other dependencies.
    *   **Outdated `gorilla/websocket`:**
        *   **Description:**  Using an old version of the library with known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  A direct path to RCE if vulnerabilities exist and are unpatched.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:**
        *   **Description:**  Exploiting publicly disclosed or zero-day vulnerabilities in any dependency.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often readily available.

*   **Exploit Server-Side Logic Flaws:**
    *   **Description:**  Using the WebSocket connection to trigger vulnerabilities in the application's code.
    *   **Input Validation Bypass:**
        *   **Description:**  Sending specially crafted messages that bypass input validation checks, leading to other vulnerabilities.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  A prerequisite for many RCE attacks, enabling the attacker to inject malicious code or commands.
    *   **Unvalidated Data in Business Logic:**
        *   **Description:**  The application uses data received from WebSockets without proper sanitization in critical operations (e.g., database queries, file system access).
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  A common source of vulnerabilities that can lead to RCE if unsanitized data is used in dangerous operations.
