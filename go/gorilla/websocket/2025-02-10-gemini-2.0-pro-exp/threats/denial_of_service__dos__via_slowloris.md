# Deep Analysis: Denial of Service (DoS) via Slowloris

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the Slowloris attack vector as it pertains to applications using the `gorilla/websocket` library.  We aim to:

*   Clearly define how a Slowloris attack manifests against `gorilla/websocket`.
*   Identify the specific vulnerabilities within the `gorilla/websocket` usage that exacerbate the attack.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies.
*   Provide actionable recommendations for developers to harden their application against Slowloris.
*   Go beyond basic mitigation and explore advanced techniques.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the Slowloris attack and its interaction with the `gorilla/websocket` library.  It encompasses:

*   The `gorilla/websocket.Conn` object and its methods related to reading and writing data.
*   Server-side handling of WebSocket connections.
*   The interplay between the application code, `gorilla/websocket`, and any intermediary layers (e.g., reverse proxies).
*   Go-specific implementation details and best practices.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other types of DoS attacks (e.g., volumetric attacks, reflection attacks).
*   Client-side vulnerabilities.
*   General network security best practices unrelated to Slowloris.
*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system or network infrastructure, except where they directly relate to mitigating Slowloris.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Understanding:**  Deep dive into the mechanics of a Slowloris attack.
2.  **Code Analysis:** Examine `gorilla/websocket`'s source code and documentation to pinpoint relevant functions and behaviors.
3.  **Vulnerability Assessment:**  Identify how typical `gorilla/websocket` usage patterns might be vulnerable.
4.  **Mitigation Evaluation:** Analyze the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations (`SetReadDeadline`, `SetWriteDeadline`, reverse proxy configuration).
5.  **Advanced Mitigation Exploration:** Research and propose more sophisticated defense mechanisms.
6.  **Recommendation Synthesis:**  Provide clear, actionable recommendations for developers.
7.  **Testing Considerations:** Outline testing strategies to validate the implemented mitigations.

## 2. Threat Understanding: Slowloris Mechanics

A Slowloris attack is a *low-bandwidth* DoS attack.  It exploits the way servers handle persistent connections (like WebSockets).  The attacker's goal is to exhaust server resources (threads, processes, or connection limits) by opening many connections and keeping them alive for as long as possible, *without* sending complete requests.

Here's how it works:

1.  **Multiple Connections:** The attacker initiates numerous WebSocket connections to the target server.
2.  **Partial Requests:**  Instead of sending a complete HTTP upgrade request (or subsequent WebSocket frames) quickly, the attacker sends data *very slowly*.  For example, they might send one byte every few seconds, or send only part of a header.
3.  **Connection Holding:** The attacker keeps these connections in a "half-open" state.  The server, expecting more data, waits for the request to complete.  It allocates resources (e.g., a thread or process) to handle each connection.
4.  **Resource Exhaustion:**  As the attacker opens more and more slow connections, the server eventually runs out of resources to handle legitimate requests.  New connection attempts are refused, and existing, legitimate connections may be dropped.

**Key Characteristics:**

*   **Low Bandwidth:**  Slowloris doesn't require a large amount of bandwidth, making it difficult to detect based on network traffic volume alone.
*   **Targeted:** It specifically targets the application layer and the server's ability to handle concurrent connections.
*   **Persistent Connections:** It leverages the persistent nature of protocols like WebSockets.
*   **Incomplete Requests:** The core principle is sending incomplete or extremely slow requests.

## 3. Code Analysis: `gorilla/websocket`

The `gorilla/websocket` library provides the `Conn` struct, which represents a WebSocket connection.  Key methods relevant to Slowloris are:

*   **`Conn.ReadMessage()`:**  Reads a single WebSocket message from the connection.  This function blocks until a complete message is received *or an error occurs*.  This is the primary point of vulnerability.
*   **`Conn.WriteMessage()`:** Writes a WebSocket message to the connection.  While less directly vulnerable to Slowloris *itself*, improper use can contribute to resource exhaustion.
*   **`Conn.SetReadDeadline(time.Time)`:** Sets a deadline for future read operations.  If a read operation doesn't complete before the deadline, a timeout error is returned.  This is a *crucial* mitigation.
*   **`Conn.SetWriteDeadline(time.Time)`:** Sets a deadline for future write operations.  Important for preventing slow writes from blocking resources.
*   **`Conn.Close()`:** Closes the WebSocket connection.  Essential for releasing resources after a timeout or error.
*   **`Conn.NextReader()` and `Conn.NextWriter()`:** Used for lower-level control over reading and writing, and are also subject to deadlines.

The `gorilla/websocket` library itself *does not* inherently protect against Slowloris.  It provides the *tools* (deadlines) to mitigate the attack, but it's the developer's responsibility to use them correctly.  The default behavior, without deadlines, is to wait indefinitely for data.

## 4. Vulnerability Assessment

A typical, vulnerable `gorilla/websocket` implementation might look like this:

```go
func handleConnection(conn *websocket.Conn) {
    for {
        messageType, p, err := conn.ReadMessage()
        if err != nil {
            log.Println(err)
            return // Or break, depending on error handling
        }
        // Process the message...
    }
}
```

This code is highly vulnerable because `conn.ReadMessage()` will block *indefinitely* if the client sends data very slowly (or stops sending data altogether).  An attacker can open many connections, send a few bytes, and then wait, tying up server resources.

Other vulnerability factors:

*   **Lack of Connection Limits:**  If the server doesn't have a reasonable limit on the maximum number of concurrent WebSocket connections, the attacker can easily exhaust resources.
*   **Long-Lived Connections:**  Applications that expect WebSocket connections to remain open for extended periods are inherently more susceptible.
*   **Insufficient Error Handling:**  Not properly handling errors (especially timeouts) can lead to resource leaks.
*   **No Monitoring:**  Without monitoring connection counts, durations, and read/write activity, it's difficult to detect a Slowloris attack in progress.

## 5. Mitigation Evaluation

### 5.1. `SetReadDeadline` and `SetWriteDeadline`

These are the *primary* and most effective application-level mitigations.

*   **Effectiveness:**  High.  By setting appropriate deadlines, the server can forcibly close connections that are not sending or receiving data within a reasonable timeframe.
*   **Implementation:**

    ```go
    func handleConnection(conn *websocket.Conn) {
        conn.SetReadDeadline(time.Now().Add(30 * time.Second)) // Example: 30-second read deadline
        conn.SetWriteDeadline(time.Now().Add(10 * time.Second)) // Example: 10-second write deadline

        for {
            messageType, p, err := conn.ReadMessage()
            if err != nil {
                if netErr, ok := err.(net.Error); ok && netErr.Timeout() {
                    log.Println("Read timeout:", err)
                    conn.Close() // Crucial: Close the connection on timeout
                    return
                }
                log.Println("Other read error:", err)
                return // Or break, depending on error handling
            }
            // Process the message...

            // Reset the read deadline for the next message
            conn.SetReadDeadline(time.Now().Add(30 * time.Second))
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Deadline Values:**  Choosing appropriate deadline values is crucial.  Too short, and legitimate clients might be disconnected.  Too long, and the mitigation becomes ineffective.  The ideal values depend on the application's specific requirements and expected client behavior.  Start with conservative values and adjust based on monitoring and testing.
    *   **Deadline Reset:**  It's important to *reset* the read deadline after each successful read.  Otherwise, the deadline will apply to the *entire* connection duration, not just individual reads.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Properly handle `net.Error` and check for timeouts.  Always close the connection on a read timeout.
    *   **Write Deadlines:**  While Slowloris primarily targets reads, setting write deadlines is still good practice to prevent slow clients from blocking write operations.

### 5.2. Reverse Proxy Configuration

Reverse proxies (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy, Apache) can provide an additional layer of defense.

*   **Effectiveness:**  High, when configured correctly.  Reverse proxies can handle many connections more efficiently than the application server and can be configured to drop slow connections.
*   **Implementation (Example - Nginx):**

    ```nginx
    http {
        # ... other configurations ...

        server {
            # ... other configurations ...

            location /ws {  # Assuming your WebSocket endpoint is /ws
                proxy_pass http://backend;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";

                # Slowloris protection:
                proxy_read_timeout 60s;  # Timeout for reading from the backend
                proxy_send_timeout 60s;  # Timeout for sending to the backend
                client_body_timeout 60s; # Timeout for reading the client request body
                send_timeout 60s;        # Timeout for sending to the client

                # Connection limits (optional, but recommended):
                limit_conn addr 10;     # Limit connections per IP address
                limit_req zone=mylimit burst=20 nodelay; # Rate limiting
            }
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Proxy-Specific Settings:**  The specific configuration options vary depending on the reverse proxy used.  Consult the documentation for your chosen proxy.
    *   **Layered Defense:**  Reverse proxy protection should be used *in conjunction with* application-level mitigations (deadlines), not as a replacement.
    *   **Configuration Tuning:**  Like deadlines, proxy timeout values need to be carefully tuned to balance security and usability.

## 6. Advanced Mitigation Exploration

Beyond the basic mitigations, consider these more advanced techniques:

*   **Connection Rate Limiting:**  Limit the *rate* at which new WebSocket connections are accepted from a single IP address.  This can prevent an attacker from rapidly opening many connections.  This can be implemented at the reverse proxy level (e.g., `limit_req` in Nginx) or within the application using a rate-limiting library.
*   **IP Address Blacklisting/Whitelisting:**  Maintain lists of known malicious or trusted IP addresses.  This is reactive (requires identifying attackers) but can be effective in blocking persistent attackers.
*   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement robust monitoring of:
    *   Number of active WebSocket connections.
    *   Connection duration.
    *   Read/write rates per connection.
    *   Server resource utilization (CPU, memory, threads).
    Set up alerts to notify administrators when suspicious activity is detected (e.g., a sudden spike in connection counts or many long-lived, low-activity connections).
*   **Dynamic Deadline Adjustment:**  Instead of fixed deadlines, consider dynamically adjusting deadlines based on observed network conditions and client behavior.  This is more complex to implement but can provide a more adaptive defense.  For example, if the server is under heavy load, deadlines could be shortened.
*   **CAPTCHA or Proof-of-Work:**  For very high-risk applications, consider requiring clients to solve a CAPTCHA or perform a small proof-of-work calculation before establishing a WebSocket connection.  This adds computational overhead for the attacker, making it more difficult to launch a large-scale Slowloris attack.
* **Go's `net/http` Server Timeouts:** While `gorilla/websocket` handles the WebSocket protocol, the underlying HTTP server in Go (`net/http.Server`) also has timeout settings that are relevant:
    *   `ReadTimeout`:  Timeout for reading the entire request, *including the body*.  This applies to the initial HTTP upgrade request.
    *   `ReadHeaderTimeout`: Timeout for reading just the request headers.  This is often more relevant for Slowloris protection at the HTTP level.
    *   `WriteTimeout`: Timeout for writing the response.
    *   `IdleTimeout`:  Timeout for idle connections *after* the request has been handled.  This is important for closing idle WebSocket connections.

    These timeouts should be configured on the `http.Server` instance:

    ```go
    server := &http.Server{
        Addr:              ":8080",
        Handler:           myHandler,
        ReadTimeout:       10 * time.Second,
        ReadHeaderTimeout: 5 * time.Second,
        WriteTimeout:      10 * time.Second,
        IdleTimeout:       120 * time.Second,
    }
    ```

## 7. Recommendation Synthesis

1.  **Implement Read and Write Deadlines:**  This is the *most critical* mitigation.  Use `conn.SetReadDeadline` and `conn.SetWriteDeadline` within your connection handling logic.  Choose appropriate deadline values based on your application's requirements and expected client behavior.  Reset the read deadline after each successful read.
2.  **Configure Reverse Proxy Timeouts:**  If you're using a reverse proxy, configure appropriate timeouts (e.g., `proxy_read_timeout`, `client_body_timeout` in Nginx) to drop slow connections.
3.  **Set `net/http` Server Timeouts:** Configure `ReadTimeout`, `ReadHeaderTimeout`, `WriteTimeout`, and `IdleTimeout` on your `http.Server` instance.
4.  **Implement Connection Rate Limiting:**  Limit the rate of new connections per IP address, either at the reverse proxy level or within your application.
5.  **Monitor Connections and Resources:**  Implement robust monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious activity.
6.  **Handle Errors Properly:**  Always check for errors (especially `net.Error` timeouts) and close the connection when appropriate.
7.  **Consider Connection Limits:**  Set a reasonable limit on the maximum number of concurrent WebSocket connections.
8.  **Test Thoroughly:**  Use specialized tools to simulate Slowloris attacks and verify the effectiveness of your mitigations.

## 8. Testing Considerations

Testing is crucial to ensure that your mitigations are effective and don't negatively impact legitimate clients.

*   **Slowloris Simulation Tools:**  Use tools specifically designed to simulate Slowloris attacks, such as:
    *   **Slowhttptest:**  A highly configurable tool that can simulate various slow attack scenarios, including Slowloris.
    *   **Custom Scripts:**  You can write your own scripts (e.g., in Python or Go) to simulate slow connections.

*   **Testing Methodology:**
    1.  **Baseline Testing:**  Establish a baseline for your application's performance under normal load.
    2.  **Slowloris Attack Simulation:**  Use a Slowloris tool to launch an attack against your application *without* mitigations in place.  Observe the impact on resource utilization and availability.
    3.  **Mitigation Implementation:**  Implement the recommended mitigations (deadlines, reverse proxy configuration, etc.).
    4.  **Repeat Attack Simulation:**  Run the Slowloris attack again with the mitigations in place.  Verify that the attack is mitigated and that the application remains available.
    5.  **Load Testing:**  Perform load testing with legitimate client traffic to ensure that the mitigations don't negatively impact performance under normal conditions.
    6.  **Edge Case Testing:**  Test with various deadline values and connection rates to identify potential edge cases or unexpected behavior.
    7.  **Monitoring Validation:**  Ensure that your monitoring system correctly detects and reports Slowloris attacks.

*   **Test Environment:**  Ideally, perform testing in a dedicated test environment that mirrors your production environment as closely as possible.

By following this comprehensive analysis and implementing the recommended mitigations, you can significantly reduce the risk of Slowloris attacks against your `gorilla/websocket`-based application. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and continuous monitoring and testing are essential to maintain a robust defense.
