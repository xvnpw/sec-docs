Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the "Unauthorized Actions (Elevation of Privilege)" threat for a WebSocket application using the `gorilla/websocket` library.

## Deep Analysis: Unauthorized Actions (Elevation of Privilege) in Gorilla/WebSocket Applications

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Unauthorized Actions" threat, identify specific vulnerabilities within the context of a `gorilla/websocket` application, and propose concrete, actionable steps to mitigate the risk.  We aim to move beyond the general threat description and delve into practical attack scenarios and defense mechanisms.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses on server-side vulnerabilities related to authorization checks within a `gorilla/websocket` application.  It specifically addresses scenarios where a malicious client attempts to elevate privileges by sending crafted WebSocket messages.  The scope includes:

*   **Message Handling Logic:**  The code responsible for receiving, parsing, and processing WebSocket messages.
*   **Authorization Checks:**  The mechanisms (or lack thereof) used to verify user permissions before executing actions triggered by messages.
*   **Session Management:** How user sessions are established, maintained, and used for authorization decisions.  (While session hijacking is a separate threat, *how* session data is used for authorization is relevant here).
*   **Data Validation:**  While input validation is primarily a defense against injection attacks, it also plays a role in preventing unexpected behavior that could lead to privilege escalation.
*   **`gorilla/websocket` Library Usage:**  We'll examine how the library is used and if any misconfigurations or improper usage patterns contribute to the vulnerability.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review (Hypothetical & Example-Based):**  We'll analyze hypothetical code snippets and, where possible, examine real-world examples (anonymized and generalized) to identify potential vulnerabilities.
2.  **Threat Modeling (Scenario-Based):** We'll construct specific attack scenarios to illustrate how a malicious client might exploit weaknesses in authorization.
3.  **Best Practices Analysis:** We'll compare the application's implementation against established security best practices for WebSocket applications and authorization in general.
4.  **Vulnerability Research:** We'll check for any known vulnerabilities or common weaknesses associated with `gorilla/websocket` or related libraries that could contribute to privilege escalation.  (Note: `gorilla/websocket` itself is generally well-regarded, but *how* it's used is crucial).
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:** We'll refine the initial mitigation strategies into more specific, actionable recommendations.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1.  Understanding the Attack Vector**

The core attack vector is the WebSocket connection itself.  Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which are typically stateless and self-contained, a WebSocket connection is persistent.  This persistence allows for a continuous stream of messages between the client and server.  A malicious client can exploit this by:

*   **Sending Unexpected Message Types:**  The server might expect messages of type "A" and "B," but the attacker sends a message of type "C" that triggers unintended behavior.
*   **Manipulating Message Data:**  The attacker sends a valid message type but modifies the data within the message to request unauthorized actions (e.g., changing a user ID to an administrator's ID).
*   **Bypassing Client-Side Checks:**  Even if the client-side application has UI elements that restrict certain actions, the attacker can bypass these by directly crafting and sending WebSocket messages.
*   **Exploiting Race Conditions:** In some cases, rapidly sending multiple messages might expose race conditions in the server's authorization logic, allowing the attacker to slip through checks.

**2.2.  Hypothetical Vulnerable Code Examples**

Let's illustrate with some hypothetical (and simplified) Go code examples using `gorilla/websocket`:

**Example 1: Missing Authorization Check**

```go
func handleMessage(conn *websocket.Conn, messageType int, p []byte) {
	var msg map[string]interface{}
	if err := json.Unmarshal(p, &msg); err != nil {
		// Handle error
		return
	}

	switch msg["action"].(string) {
	case "deleteUser":
		userID := int(msg["userID"].(float64)) // Type assertion
		deleteUserFromDatabase(userID) // No authorization check!
	case "promoteUser":
		userID := int(msg["userID"].(float64))
		promoteUserToAdmin(userID) // No authorization check!
	// ... other cases ...
	}
}
```

**Vulnerability:**  This code directly executes `deleteUserFromDatabase` and `promoteUserToAdmin` based on the `action` field in the message, *without* verifying if the connected user has the necessary permissions to perform these actions.  An attacker could send a message with `{"action": "deleteUser", "userID": 123}` to delete any user, regardless of their own privileges.

**Example 2:  Insufficient Authorization Check (Role-Based)**

```go
func handleMessage(conn *websocket.Conn, messageType int, p []byte, user *User) { // Assume 'user' is retrieved from session
	var msg map[string]interface{}
	if err := json.Unmarshal(p, &msg); err != nil {
		return
	}

	switch msg["action"].(string) {
	case "createResource":
		if user.Role == "user" { // Only checks for 'user' role
			createResource(msg["data"].(string))
		}
	case "deleteResource":
		resourceID := int(msg["resourceID"].(float64))
		if user.Role == "admin" {
			deleteResource(resourceID)
		}
	}
}
```

**Vulnerability:** While this code *does* check the user's role, it might be insufficient.  For example:

*   **Missing Resource Ownership Check:**  The `deleteResource` function only checks if the user is an admin.  It *doesn't* check if the user actually *owns* the resource they're trying to delete.  An admin could delete resources belonging to other admins.
*   **Granularity Issues:**  The roles ("user" and "admin") might be too broad.  Perhaps there should be a "resourceCreator" role that can only create resources, and a separate "resourceDeleter" role with specific permissions.

**Example 3:  Trusting Client-Provided Data**

```go
func handleMessage(conn *websocket.Conn, messageType int, p []byte) {
	var msg map[string]interface{}
	if err := json.Unmarshal(p, &msg); err != nil {
		return
	}

	if msg["action"].(string) == "updatePermissions" {
		targetUserID := int(msg["targetUserID"].(float64))
		newPermissions := msg["newPermissions"].(string) // Directly from client!
		updateUserPermissions(targetUserID, newPermissions)
	}
}
```

**Vulnerability:** This code blindly trusts the `newPermissions` value provided by the client.  An attacker could send a message to grant themselves (or another user) administrator privileges.

**2.3.  Attack Scenarios**

*   **Scenario 1:  Deleting Other Users' Accounts:**  A regular user sends a crafted WebSocket message with the `action` set to `deleteUser` and the `userID` set to the ID of another user (obtained, for example, from a user list exposed elsewhere in the application).
*   **Scenario 2:  Accessing Restricted Data:**  A user sends a message requesting data that should only be accessible to administrators.  If the server doesn't properly check permissions before returning the data, the attacker gains unauthorized access.
*   **Scenario 3:  Modifying System Configuration:**  An attacker sends a message designed to modify server configuration settings (e.g., changing database connection strings, disabling security features).  If the server doesn't properly authorize these actions, the attacker can compromise the entire system.
*   **Scenario 4:  Impersonating Another User:** If the authorization check relies solely on a user ID provided in the message, an attacker can change their own user ID to that of another user (e.g., an administrator) to gain their privileges.

**2.4.  Refined Mitigation Strategies**

Based on the analysis above, we can refine the initial mitigation strategies into more concrete steps:

1.  **Fine-Grained Authorization Checks:**

    *   **Implement a robust authorization framework:**  Consider using a dedicated authorization library (e.g., Casbin, OPA) or building a custom solution that supports fine-grained permissions.
    *   **Check permissions for *every* action:**  No action triggered by a WebSocket message should be executed without a corresponding authorization check.
    *   **Resource-Based Authorization:**  Authorize actions based not only on the user's role but also on the specific resource being accessed (e.g., "Can user X delete resource Y?").  This often involves checking ownership or other relationships between users and resources.
    *   **Contextual Authorization:**  Consider factors beyond role and resource, such as the user's current state, IP address, or time of day, if relevant to the application's security model.

2.  **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):**

    *   **Minimize User Permissions:**  Grant users only the absolute minimum permissions required to perform their legitimate tasks.  Avoid overly broad roles like "admin" if more specific roles can be defined.
    *   **Regularly Review Permissions:**  Periodically audit user permissions to ensure they are still appropriate and haven't been accidentally elevated.

3.  **Secure Session Management:**

    *   **Use Secure, Server-Side Sessions:**  Store user session data (including roles and permissions) securely on the server, not in cookies or client-side storage.
    *   **Validate Session Tokens:**  Ensure that session tokens are properly validated on every request to prevent session hijacking.
    *   **Associate Connections with Sessions:**  When a WebSocket connection is established, securely associate it with the corresponding user session.  This association should be used for all subsequent authorization checks.

4.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**

    *   **Validate Message Structure:**  Ensure that incoming messages conform to the expected format and data types.  Reject messages that don't match the schema.
    *   **Sanitize Data:**  Even if data is validated, sanitize it to prevent potential injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Never Trust Client-Provided Data for Authorization:**  Do *not* use data directly from the client (e.g., user IDs, roles, permissions) in authorization decisions without first verifying it against server-side data.

5.  **Code Review and Testing:**

    *   **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough code reviews, focusing on message handling logic and authorization checks.
    *   **Security-Focused Testing:**  Include security-specific tests (e.g., penetration testing, fuzzing) to identify potential vulnerabilities.  Specifically test for unauthorized actions.
    *   **Automated Security Analysis:**  Consider using static analysis tools to automatically detect potential security issues in the codebase.

6.  **`gorilla/websocket` Specific Considerations:**

    *   **Read and Write Deadlines:**  Set appropriate read and write deadlines on the WebSocket connection to prevent slowloris attacks and resource exhaustion. While not directly related to authorization, this improves overall security.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Handle errors gracefully and avoid leaking sensitive information in error messages.

7. **Logging and Monitoring:**
    *   Log all authorization attempts, both successful and failed.
    *   Monitor logs for suspicious activity, such as repeated failed authorization attempts or unusual message patterns.
    *   Implement alerting for critical security events.

### 3. Conclusion

The "Unauthorized Actions (Elevation of Privilege)" threat is a serious concern for any WebSocket application. By understanding the attack vectors, implementing robust authorization checks, adhering to the principle of least privilege, and employing secure coding practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability.  The key is to never trust client-provided data for authorization and to verify permissions for *every* action triggered by a WebSocket message.  Regular security reviews and testing are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.
