Okay, let's create a design document for the Gorilla WebSocket project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a robust, efficient, and well-maintained WebSocket implementation for Go applications.
*   Enable real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
*   Offer a developer-friendly API that simplifies WebSocket usage.
*   Maintain high performance and low resource consumption.
*   Ensure compatibility with relevant WebSocket standards (RFC 6455).
*   Foster a strong community and encourage contributions.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the WebSocket implementation could lead to data breaches, denial-of-service attacks, or other security incidents.
*   Performance bottlenecks or resource exhaustion could impact the scalability and responsiveness of applications using the library.
*   Lack of compatibility with evolving WebSocket standards or browser implementations could limit the library's usefulness.
*   Inadequate documentation or support could hinder adoption and lead to developer frustration.
*   Failure to address reported bugs or security issues in a timely manner could damage the library's reputation.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Follows secure coding practices, as evidenced by the project's maturity and community scrutiny. (Implicit in the project's history and community involvement)
*   security control: Offers TLS support for secure communication. (Mentioned in the README and examples)
*   security control: Handles cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). (Mentioned in the documentation and implemented in the `gorilla/websocket` package)
*   security control: Provides options for setting read and write deadlines to mitigate slowloris attacks. (Available through the `Conn` type)
*   security control: Includes checks for valid UTF-8 in text messages. (Implemented in the message reading functions)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The library relies on the underlying Go standard library's `net/http` and TLS implementations for security. Any vulnerabilities in those libraries could potentially impact Gorilla WebSocket.
*   accepted risk: Developers are responsible for implementing appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms in their applications. Gorilla WebSocket itself does not provide these features.
*   accepted risk: Developers are responsible for handling potential denial-of-service attacks beyond the basic protections provided (e.g., rate limiting, connection limits).

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement fuzz testing to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Conduct regular security audits and code reviews.
*   security control: Provide clear guidance on secure configuration and usage in the documentation.
*   security control: Establish a security reporting process for handling vulnerability disclosures.
*   security control: Consider integrating with a static analysis tool to automatically detect potential security issues.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The library itself does not handle authentication. Applications using Gorilla WebSocket MUST implement their own authentication mechanisms.
    *   Authentication SHOULD be performed before establishing the WebSocket connection (e.g., using cookies, tokens, or other standard HTTP authentication methods).

*   Authorization:
    *   The library itself does not handle authorization. Applications MUST implement their own authorization logic to control access to resources and operations.
    *   Authorization checks SHOULD be performed based on the authenticated user's identity and permissions.

*   Input Validation:
    *   The library MUST validate incoming data according to the WebSocket protocol (RFC 6455).
    *   Applications MUST validate application-specific data received over WebSocket connections to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    *   Input validation SHOULD include checks for data type, length, format, and allowed values.

*   Cryptography:
    *   The library MUST support TLS for secure communication.
    *   Applications SHOULD use TLS for all WebSocket connections.
    *   Applications MUST use strong cryptographic algorithms and key management practices.
    *   The library SHOULD use the Go standard library's crypto packages, which are regularly reviewed and updated.
