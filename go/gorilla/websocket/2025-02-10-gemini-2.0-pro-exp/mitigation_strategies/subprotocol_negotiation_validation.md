# Deep Analysis: Subprotocol Negotiation Validation for Gorilla Websocket

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Subprotocol Negotiation Validation" mitigation strategy for applications using the `gorilla/websocket` library.  This includes understanding its purpose, implementation details, effectiveness against specific threats, potential limitations, and practical considerations for development teams.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable guidance for securely implementing and maintaining this strategy.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the subprotocol negotiation feature of the `gorilla/websocket` library and its role in mitigating security risks.  It covers:

*   The mechanism of subprotocol negotiation in WebSockets.
*   How `gorilla/websocket` handles subprotocol negotiation.
*   The threats that subprotocol validation addresses.
*   The correct implementation of subprotocol validation using `gorilla/websocket`.
*   Potential edge cases and limitations.
*   Integration with existing application logic.
*   Testing and verification of the implementation.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General WebSocket security best practices unrelated to subprotocol negotiation (e.g., origin validation, input sanitization, rate limiting).  These are important but are separate mitigation strategies.
*   Specific vulnerabilities within individual subprotocols themselves.  This analysis assumes that *if* a subprotocol is used, it is implemented securely.
*   Other WebSocket libraries besides `gorilla/websocket`.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Documentation Review:**  Thorough examination of the official `gorilla/websocket` documentation, relevant RFCs (specifically RFC 6455), and any related security advisories.
2.  **Code Analysis:**  Inspection of the `gorilla/websocket` source code to understand the internal workings of subprotocol negotiation and validation.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identification of potential attack vectors that could exploit weaknesses in subprotocol handling.
4.  **Best Practices Research:**  Review of established security best practices for WebSocket implementations and subprotocol usage.
5.  **Practical Implementation Guidance:**  Development of clear, concise, and actionable steps for implementing the mitigation strategy.
6.  **Testing Recommendations:**  Suggestions for testing the implementation to ensure its effectiveness.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Subprotocol Negotiation Validation

### 4.1.  WebSocket Subprotocol Negotiation: The Basics

The WebSocket protocol allows clients and servers to negotiate a *subprotocol* during the handshake.  This subprotocol defines the format and semantics of the messages exchanged over the WebSocket connection.  Think of it as a higher-level application protocol *layered on top of* the raw WebSocket connection.  Common examples include `soap`, `wamp`, or custom application-specific protocols.

The client initiates the negotiation by including the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header in its handshake request, listing the subprotocols it supports (in order of preference).  The server then selects *one* of these subprotocols (or none) and includes it in the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header of its response.  If the server doesn't support any of the client's proposed subprotocols, it *omits* the header entirely.

### 4.2.  `gorilla/websocket` and Subprotocols

The `gorilla/websocket` library provides mechanisms for both clients and servers to handle subprotocol negotiation.

*   **Server-Side:**  The `websocket.Upgrader` struct has a `Subprotocols` field, which is a `[]string`.  This field is used to specify the subprotocols the server *supports*.  The `Upgrader.Upgrade` method automatically handles the negotiation:
    *   It checks the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header in the client's request.
    *   It selects the first matching subprotocol from the client's list that is also present in the `Upgrader.Subprotocols` slice.
    *   It includes the selected subprotocol in the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header of the response.
    *   If no match is found, it omits the header.
    *   The selected subprotocol (or an empty string if none was selected) is available in the `websocket.Conn` via the `Subprotocol()` method.

*   **Client-Side:**  The `websocket.Dialer` struct also has a `Subprotocols` field (`[]string`).  This field is used to specify the subprotocols the client *requests*.  The `Dialer.Dial` method:
    *   Includes the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header in the handshake request.
    *   Checks the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header in the server's response.
    *   The negotiated subprotocol is available in the `websocket.Conn` via the `Subprotocol()` method.

### 4.3.  Threats Mitigated and Rationale

The mitigation strategy addresses the following threats:

*   **Exploitation of Unsupported Subprotocols (Medium Severity):**  An attacker might attempt to force the server to use a subprotocol that it *doesn't actually support* or that has known vulnerabilities.  This could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even code execution if the server's handling of unknown subprotocols is flawed.  By explicitly validating the negotiated subprotocol against a whitelist, we prevent the server from ever entering a state where it's processing messages according to a protocol it doesn't understand.

*   **Application Logic Errors (Variable Severity):**  Even if the server *technically* supports a subprotocol, the application logic might not be prepared to handle it in a specific context.  For example, a particular endpoint might only be designed for the "chat" subprotocol, while another might be for "file-transfer."  Without validation, a client could connect to the "chat" endpoint using the "file-transfer" subprotocol, potentially bypassing security checks or causing unexpected behavior.  Subprotocol validation ensures that the application logic only receives messages conforming to the expected subprotocol for that specific part of the application.

### 4.4.  Implementation Steps (Server-Side)

Here's a detailed breakdown of the implementation steps, with code examples:

1.  **Define Allowed Subprotocols:** Create a constant or configuration variable holding a slice of strings representing the allowed subprotocols.  This is your whitelist.

    ```go
    const (
        AllowedSubprotocols = "chat,file-transfer" // Example: Only allow "chat" and "file-transfer"
    )
    ```

2.  **Configure the Upgrader:** Set the `Subprotocols` field of your `websocket.Upgrader` instance to your allowed subprotocols.

    ```go
    var upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{
        ReadBufferSize:  1024,
        WriteBufferSize: 1024,
        Subprotocols:    strings.Split(AllowedSubprotocols, ","),
    }
    ```

3.  **Upgrade the Connection:** Use the `Upgrader.Upgrade` method as usual.

    ```go
    func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        conn, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)
        if err != nil {
            log.Println(err)
            return
        }
        defer conn.Close()

        // ... (rest of your handler)
    }
    ```

4.  **Validate the Negotiated Subprotocol:**  *After* the connection is upgraded, check the negotiated subprotocol using `conn.Subprotocol()`.  Compare it against your whitelist.

    ```go
    negotiatedSubprotocol := conn.Subprotocol()
    allowed := false
    for _, subprotocol := range strings.Split(AllowedSubprotocols, ",") {
        if negotiatedSubprotocol == subprotocol {
            allowed = true
            break
        }
    }

    if !allowed {
        // Close the connection with a protocol error.
        err := conn.WriteControl(websocket.CloseMessage, websocket.FormatCloseMessage(websocket.CloseProtocolError, "Unsupported subprotocol"), time.Now().Add(time.Second))
        if err != nil {
            log.Println("Error closing connection:", err)
        }
        return // Important: Stop processing after closing.
    }
    ```

5.  **Handle the Connection:** If the subprotocol is valid, proceed with your application logic, knowing that the connection is using an expected subprotocol.

    ```go
    // If we reach here, the subprotocol is valid.
    log.Printf("Connection established with subprotocol: %s", negotiatedSubprotocol)

    // ... (your application logic, specific to the subprotocol)
    ```

### 4.5.  Implementation Steps (Client-Side)

While the server is primarily responsible for enforcing subprotocol validation, the client should also be aware of the negotiated subprotocol:

1.  **Specify Requested Subprotocols:** Set the `Subprotocols` field of your `websocket.Dialer` instance.

    ```go
    dialer := websocket.Dialer{
        Subprotocols: []string{"chat", "file-transfer"},
    }
    ```

2.  **Dial the Server:** Use the `Dialer.Dial` method as usual.

    ```go
    conn, _, err := dialer.Dial("ws://example.com/ws", nil)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal("Dial:", err)
    }
    defer conn.Close()
    ```

3.  **Check the Negotiated Subprotocol:**  Use `conn.Subprotocol()` to get the negotiated subprotocol.

    ```go
    negotiatedSubprotocol := conn.Subprotocol()
    log.Printf("Negotiated subprotocol: %s", negotiatedSubprotocol)
    ```

4.  **Handle the Result:**  The client should be prepared to handle cases where the server doesn't select any subprotocol (empty string) or selects a different subprotocol than expected.  This might involve displaying an error message to the user or attempting to reconnect with a different set of subprotocols.

### 4.6.  Edge Cases and Limitations

*   **Empty Subprotocol:**  An empty string for `conn.Subprotocol()` means *no* subprotocol was negotiated.  Your application logic should handle this case gracefully, either by treating it as a default subprotocol or by rejecting the connection.

*   **Case Sensitivity:**  Subprotocol names are case-sensitive.  Ensure consistency in your whitelist and client requests.

*   **Order of Preference:**  The server selects the *first* matching subprotocol from the client's list.  The client should list its preferred subprotocols in order of preference.

*   **Subprotocol-Specific Security:**  This mitigation strategy only validates the *selection* of the subprotocol.  It does *not* guarantee the security of the subprotocol itself.  You must ensure that any subprotocol you use is implemented securely and handles data appropriately.

*  **Dynamic Subprotocol Requirements:** If the allowed subprotocols need to change dynamically (e.g., based on user roles or application state), you'll need a more sophisticated mechanism than a simple constant. Consider using a configuration file, database, or a dedicated service to manage the whitelist.

### 4.7.  Integration with Existing Application Logic

The subprotocol validation should be integrated early in the connection handling process, *before* any application-specific logic that depends on the subprotocol.  This prevents any potentially malicious messages from being processed before the subprotocol is validated.  The `conn.Subprotocol()` value can be used to route messages to different handlers or to configure the connection based on the selected subprotocol.

### 4.8.  Testing and Verification

Thorough testing is crucial to ensure the effectiveness of the subprotocol validation:

*   **Positive Tests:**  Test with clients requesting each of the allowed subprotocols.  Verify that the connection is established and the correct subprotocol is negotiated.

*   **Negative Tests:**
    *   Test with clients requesting unsupported subprotocols.  Verify that the connection is closed with a `CloseProtocolError`.
    *   Test with clients requesting no subprotocols.  Verify that the connection is handled appropriately (either rejected or treated as a default subprotocol).
    *   Test with clients requesting subprotocols in different case variations.
    *   Test with a large number of subprotocols in request.

*   **Integration Tests:**  Test the entire application flow, including the subprotocol negotiation and subsequent message handling, to ensure that everything works correctly together.

*   **Fuzz Testing:** Consider using a fuzzer to send malformed or unexpected `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` headers to the server to test its robustness.

## 5. Conclusion

Subprotocol Negotiation Validation is a valuable mitigation strategy for applications using `gorilla/websocket`.  By explicitly defining and validating the allowed subprotocols, you can significantly reduce the risk of attacks that exploit unsupported or misconfigured subprotocols.  Proper implementation, thorough testing, and careful integration with application logic are essential for maximizing the effectiveness of this strategy.
