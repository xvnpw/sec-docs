### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Gorilla/Websocket

Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the `gorilla/websocket` library:

1. **Threat:** Origin Spoofing leading to Unauthorized Access
    *   **Description:** A malicious client or attacker crafts a websocket handshake request with a forged `Origin` header, attempting to bypass server-side origin checks. If the server relies solely on the `Origin` header for authorization without additional validation, the attacker might gain unauthorized access to websocket endpoints.
    *   **Impact:** Circumvention of intended access controls, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
    *   **Affected Component:** `gorilla/websocket`'s `Upgrader` component, specifically the `CheckOrigin` function (if implemented incorrectly or not at all).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust server-side authentication and authorization mechanisms beyond just checking the `Origin` header.
        *   Carefully implement or override the `CheckOrigin` function in the `Upgrader` to perform thorough validation, potentially against a whitelist of allowed origins.
        *   Consider using other authentication methods in conjunction with or instead of origin checks for sensitive endpoints.

2. **Threat:** Message Tampering via Man-in-the-Middle (if not using WSS)
    *   **Description:** If the websocket connection is established over `ws://` (unencrypted), an attacker performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack can intercept and modify messages in transit between the client and the server.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, potential for manipulating application state or injecting malicious commands.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `gorilla/websocket` connection, as the underlying TCP connection is not secure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use `wss://` for websocket connections to ensure encryption.** This is the primary and most effective mitigation.
        *   If `ws://` is absolutely necessary for legacy reasons, implement end-to-end encryption at the application layer.

3. **Threat:** Data Disclosure via Eavesdropping (if not using WSS)
    *   **Description:** Similar to message tampering, if the connection uses `ws://`, an attacker performing a MITM attack can eavesdrop on the communication and read sensitive data being exchanged between the client and the server.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality, exposure of sensitive user data or application secrets.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `gorilla/websocket` connection.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use `wss://` for websocket connections.**
        *   Avoid transmitting sensitive information over unencrypted websocket connections.

4. **Threat:** Denial of Service via Message Flooding
    *   **Description:** An attacker, either through a compromised client or a malicious client, sends a large volume of messages to the server over the websocket connection. This can overwhelm the server's processing capacity, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Service unavailability, performance degradation.
    *   **Affected Component:** `gorilla/websocket`'s connection handling logic, specifically the message reading and processing functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on incoming messages per connection.
        *   Set maximum message size limits to prevent processing of excessively large messages.
        *   Implement backpressure mechanisms to handle bursts of messages.
        *   Monitor websocket connection metrics and alert on unusual traffic patterns.
