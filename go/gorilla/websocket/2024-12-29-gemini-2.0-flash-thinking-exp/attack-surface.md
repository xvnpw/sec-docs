* **Attack Surface: Handshake Manipulation**
    * **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in the initial WebSocket handshake process to bypass security measures or cause unexpected behavior.
    * **How WebSocket Contributes:** The WebSocket handshake introduces a new point of interaction beyond standard HTTP requests, with specific headers like `Upgrade`, `Connection`, and `Sec-WebSocket-Key`. Improper validation or handling of these headers can be exploited.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts a handshake request with a forged `Origin` header, and the server incorrectly trusts it, allowing cross-origin access that should be blocked.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access, cross-site scripting (if the server reflects the origin), or denial of service if the handshake process is resource-intensive.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strictly validate the `Origin` header** against an allowlist of trusted origins.
        * **Implement proper CORS policies** in conjunction with WebSocket origin validation.
        * **Avoid reflecting the `Origin` header** in responses without proper sanitization.
        * **Rate-limit handshake requests** to prevent resource exhaustion.

* **Attack Surface: Unvalidated Message Content**
    * **Description:** Sending malicious or unexpected data within WebSocket messages that the server-side application doesn't properly sanitize or validate.
    * **How WebSocket Contributes:** WebSockets enable persistent, bidirectional communication, allowing attackers to send a stream of potentially harmful data after the initial handshake. The server must handle diverse message types and content.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends a WebSocket message containing a command injection payload that the server-side application executes without proper sanitization.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, application crashes, or other application-specific vulnerabilities.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement robust input validation** for all incoming WebSocket messages.
        * **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements** if message data is used in database interactions.
        * **Sanitize user-provided data** before processing or displaying it.
        * **Enforce strict message formats and types.**
        * **Consider using a message queue or intermediary** for processing complex or untrusted messages.

* **Attack Surface: Denial of Service via Message Flooding**
    * **Description:** Overwhelming the server with a large number of WebSocket messages, consuming resources and potentially causing service disruption.
    * **How WebSocket Contributes:** The persistent nature of WebSocket connections allows attackers to maintain connections and send a continuous stream of messages, making DoS attacks easier to sustain compared to stateless HTTP requests.
    * **Example:** An attacker establishes multiple WebSocket connections and sends a high volume of messages, exceeding the server's processing capacity and causing it to become unresponsive.
    * **Impact:** Service unavailability, resource exhaustion, and potential application crashes.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement rate limiting** on incoming WebSocket messages per connection and globally.
        * **Set reasonable message size limits.**
        * **Implement connection limits** per client IP address.
        * **Use load balancing and auto-scaling** to handle increased traffic.
        * **Employ connection monitoring and anomaly detection** to identify and mitigate malicious activity.

* **Attack Surface: Connection Hijacking/Man-in-the-Middle**
    * **Description:** An attacker intercepts or takes over an established WebSocket connection to eavesdrop on communication or inject malicious messages.
    * **How WebSocket Contributes:**  Like any network communication, WebSocket connections are vulnerable to interception if not properly secured. The persistent nature of the connection makes it a valuable target for attackers.
    * **Example:** An attacker on the same network as a client intercepts the WebSocket handshake and subsequent communication, gaining access to sensitive data being exchanged.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, and manipulation of communication.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Always use TLS (HTTPS/WSS)** for WebSocket connections to encrypt communication.
        * **Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms** to verify the identity of clients.
        * **Educate users about the risks of connecting to untrusted networks.**
        * **Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for enhanced security.**

* **Attack Surface: Exploiting Library Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:**  Leveraging known or unknown vulnerabilities within the `gorilla/websocket` library itself.
    * **How WebSocket Contributes:** The security of the application directly depends on the security of the underlying WebSocket library. Bugs or flaws in the library can introduce vulnerabilities that are not directly related to the application's logic.
    * **Example:** A discovered vulnerability in `gorilla/websocket` allows an attacker to send a specially crafted control frame that crashes the server application.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, remote code execution, or other unexpected behavior depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep the `gorilla/websocket` library updated** to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * **Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases** for reports related to the library.
        * **Consider using static analysis tools** to identify potential vulnerabilities in the application's use of the library.

* **Attack Surface: Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH)**
    * **Description:** An attacker tricks a user's browser into initiating a WebSocket connection to an attacker-controlled server, potentially exposing sensitive information.
    * **How WebSocket Contributes:**  Similar to CSRF, the browser might automatically send cookies and authentication headers when establishing a WebSocket connection, even to a malicious server if initiated from a compromised context.
    * **Example:** A user visits a malicious website that contains JavaScript code that opens a WebSocket connection to an attacker's server, sending the user's session cookies along with the handshake.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement anti-CSWSH tokens** or challenges that the client must include in the WebSocket handshake or initial messages.
        * **Validate the `Origin` header** on the server-side to prevent connections from unexpected domains.
        * **Ensure that sensitive actions performed over WebSockets require explicit user confirmation.**
        * **Set the `SameSite` attribute for authentication cookies** to `Strict` or `Lax` to prevent them from being sent in cross-site requests.
