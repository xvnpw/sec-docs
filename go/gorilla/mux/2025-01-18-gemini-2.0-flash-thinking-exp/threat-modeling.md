# Threat Model Analysis for gorilla/mux

## Threat: [Ambiguous Route Matching](./threats/ambiguous_route_matching.md)

**Threat:** Ambiguous Route Matching

* **Description:** An attacker can craft requests that match multiple defined routes due to overlapping or insufficiently specific route patterns. The attacker might probe the application to identify these ambiguities and then exploit the route that provides unintended access or functionality.
* **Impact:**  Access to unauthorized resources, execution of unintended code paths, potential security bypasses if a less secure route is matched over a more secure one.
* **Affected Component:** `Router.Handle`, `Route.Match`
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Define route patterns as specifically as possible.
    * Avoid overlapping route definitions.
    * Utilize `mux`'s features for matching based on HTTP methods, headers, or schemes to disambiguate routes.
    * Carefully review the order of route registration, as the first matching route wins.

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Route Patterns](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_route_patterns.md)

**Threat:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Route Patterns

* **Description:** An attacker sends requests with URLs that are specifically crafted to cause the regular expression engine used in route matching to consume excessive CPU time. This can lead to a denial of service.
* **Impact:** Application slowdown, resource exhaustion, and potential service unavailability.
* **Affected Component:** `Route.Match` (when using regular expressions in path patterns)
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Avoid overly complex or nested quantifiers in regular expressions used for route patterns.
    * Thoroughly test regular expressions for performance against various inputs, including potentially malicious ones.
    * Consider using simpler, non-regex-based route matching where possible.
    * Implement timeouts for route matching operations if feasible.

## Threat: [Unvalidated Route Parameters Leading to Downstream Vulnerabilities](./threats/unvalidated_route_parameters_leading_to_downstream_vulnerabilities.md)

**Threat:** Unvalidated Route Parameters Leading to Downstream Vulnerabilities

* **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious data into URL parameters that are extracted by `mux` and subsequently used by application logic without proper validation. This can lead to vulnerabilities like command injection, SQL injection (if used in database queries), or path traversal in file system operations. While the vulnerability manifests downstream, `mux`'s parameter extraction is the initial point of entry for this malicious data.
* **Impact:**  Data breaches, unauthorized access to system resources, remote code execution.
* **Affected Component:** `Route.Vars`, `RequestVars` middleware
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement robust input validation for all route parameters extracted by `mux`.
    * Sanitize and encode parameters before using them in sensitive operations.
    * Follow the principle of least privilege when accessing resources based on route parameters.

## Threat: [Incorrect Middleware Ordering Bypassing Security Checks](./threats/incorrect_middleware_ordering_bypassing_security_checks.md)

**Threat:** Incorrect Middleware Ordering Bypassing Security Checks

* **Description:** An attacker can exploit a misconfiguration in the middleware stack where security-related middleware (e.g., authentication, authorization) is placed after middleware that processes the request or makes decisions based on potentially malicious input. This allows the attacker to bypass security checks.
* **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to protected resources, execution of privileged actions without proper authentication or authorization.
* **Affected Component:** `MiddlewareStack`, `Router.Use`
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Carefully plan and document the order of middleware execution.
    * Ensure that security-related middleware is placed early in the stack.
    * Thoroughly test the middleware stack to verify the intended order of execution and security enforcement.
