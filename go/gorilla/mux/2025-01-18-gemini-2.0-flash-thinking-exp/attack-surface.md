# Attack Surface Analysis for gorilla/mux

## Attack Surface: [Overly Broad or Overlapping Route Definitions](./attack_surfaces/overly_broad_or_overlapping_route_definitions.md)

**Description:**  Defining routes that are too general or have overlapping patterns can lead to unintended handlers being executed for specific requests.

**How Mux Contributes:** Mux's flexible routing allows for complex patterns, but if not carefully designed, these patterns can inadvertently match unintended paths.

**Example:** Defining routes `/users/{id}` and `/users/admin` where a request to `/users/admin` might be incorrectly routed to the handler for `/users/{id}` if the order is not correct or the patterns are too similar.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, unintended actions being performed, or denial of service if a resource-intensive handler is triggered unexpectedly.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Define routes with the most specific patterns first.
* Use more restrictive regular expressions in route definitions.
* Thoroughly test route definitions to ensure they behave as expected.
* Avoid overly generic catch-all routes unless absolutely necessary and with strict validation within the handler.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Proper Sanitization of Path Parameters](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_proper_sanitization_of_path_parameters.md)

**Description:** Mux extracts path parameters as strings. If these strings are directly used in sensitive operations without sanitization, it can lead to vulnerabilities.

**How Mux Contributes:** Mux provides the mechanism to extract path parameters, but it's the developer's responsibility to handle them securely.

**Example:** A route `/files/{filename}` where the `filename` parameter is directly used to open a file without checking for path traversal characters like `../`. An attacker could request `/files/../../etc/passwd` to access sensitive files.

**Impact:** File system access, information disclosure, potential remote code execution depending on the context of usage.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always sanitize and validate path parameters before using them in any sensitive operations.
* Use allow-lists for expected characters or patterns in path parameters.
* Employ secure file handling practices, avoiding direct concatenation of user input into file paths.

## Attack Surface: [Bypassing Authentication/Authorization through Header Manipulation in Route Matching](./attack_surfaces/bypassing_authenticationauthorization_through_header_manipulation_in_route_matching.md)

**Description:** If routing logic relies on specific headers for authentication or authorization without proper validation, attackers might bypass these checks.

**How Mux Contributes:** Mux allows matching routes based on header values using methods like `Headers()`. If these values are not strictly validated, they can be manipulated.

**Example:** A route accessible only to administrators is defined with a header check: `router.HandleFunc("/admin", adminHandler).Headers("X-Admin", "true")`. An attacker could send a request with the header `X-Admin: true` to access the admin handler without proper authentication.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources or functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Do not rely solely on header-based routing for authentication or authorization.
* Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms within the handler functions.
* If using header-based routing, strictly validate the header values against expected values.

## Attack Surface: [Security Flaws in Custom Matcher Logic](./attack_surfaces/security_flaws_in_custom_matcher_logic.md)

**Description:** If developers implement custom matchers, vulnerabilities in their logic can introduce new attack vectors.

**How Mux Contributes:** Mux provides the `MatcherFunc` interface for creating custom matching logic, offering flexibility but also the potential for introducing flaws.

**Example:** A custom matcher that checks for a specific pattern in the request body but has a vulnerability allowing for bypass with a specially crafted payload.

**Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability in the custom matcher, potentially leading to bypasses, resource exhaustion, or even code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the flaw)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Exercise extreme caution when implementing custom matchers.
* Thoroughly review and test custom matcher logic for potential vulnerabilities.
* Follow secure coding practices when developing custom matchers.
* Consider the performance implications of custom matchers.

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect Order of Middleware Execution](./attack_surfaces/incorrect_order_of_middleware_execution.md)

**Description:** The order in which middleware is added to the router matters. Incorrect ordering can lead to security vulnerabilities.

**How Mux Contributes:** Mux executes middleware in the order they are added using `Use()`. Misordering can bypass intended security checks.

**Example:** A logging middleware is added *before* an authentication middleware. This could log requests from unauthenticated users that should have been blocked. Or, a sanitization middleware is added *after* a middleware that uses the unsanitized input.

**Impact:** Bypassing authentication or authorization, logging sensitive information unnecessarily, vulnerabilities due to unsanitized input.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully plan the order of middleware execution based on their function (e.g., authentication before authorization, sanitization before processing).
* Document the intended middleware execution order.
* Thoroughly test the middleware chain to ensure it behaves as expected.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Short-Circuiting Issues](./attack_surfaces/middleware_short-circuiting_issues.md)

**Description:** If middleware doesn't properly handle the request lifecycle (e.g., not calling `next.ServeHTTP`), it can prevent subsequent middleware from executing, potentially bypassing security checks.

**How Mux Contributes:** Mux relies on middleware to call the `next.ServeHTTP` handler to proceed down the chain. If this is omitted conditionally, it can create vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An authentication middleware that returns an error response for unauthorized users but forgets to return, allowing subsequent middleware to execute unintentionally.

**Impact:** Bypassing security checks, unintended execution of handlers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure all middleware that intends to terminate the request lifecycle does so explicitly (e.g., by returning after writing the response).
* Carefully review middleware logic to ensure `next.ServeHTTP` is called appropriately.
* Consider using middleware patterns that enforce proper request handling.
