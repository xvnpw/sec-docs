## Attack Tree Path: [Route Overlap/Shadowing Vulnerability (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/route_overlapshadowing_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

**Goal:** Force execution of an unintended route handler due to ambiguous route definitions.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Define multiple routes that match the same incoming request.
    *   Mux might execute a less secure or malicious handler instead of the intended one.
    *   This can be due to:
        *   The order of route registration.
        *   Overly broad matching patterns (e.g., using wildcards too liberally).
*   **Example:**
    *   Define a specific route: `/admin/settings` (intended for authorized users).
    *   Define a more general route: `/admin/{page}`.
    *   An attacker might access `/admin/settings`, intending to hit the specific route, but Mux could match the more general route, potentially leading to an unauthorized handler or unexpected behavior.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common developer mistake).
*   **Impact:** High (Bypass authentication/authorization, execute unintended logic).
*   **Effort:** Low (Requires understanding of route definitions).
*   **Skill Level:** Low/Medium.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires careful analysis of route configurations and access logs).

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal via Path Variables (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_via_path_variables__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Goal:** Access resources outside the intended scope by manipulating path variables.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Path variables extracted by Mux are used to construct file paths or access resources.
    *   If these variables are not properly sanitized or validated:
        *   An attacker can inject path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
        *   This allows them to access files or directories outside the intended scope.
*   **Example:**
    *   A route `/files/{filename}` is intended to serve files from a specific directory.
    *   An attacker sends a request like `/files/../../../../etc/passwd`.
    *   If the `filename` variable is not sanitized, the application might attempt to access the sensitive `/etc/passwd` file.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common vulnerability if input validation is missing).
*   **Impact:** High (Access to sensitive files, potential code execution if accessed files are scripts).
*   **Effort:** Low (Requires basic understanding of path traversal).
*   **Skill Level:** Low.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires inspection of request paths and file access logs).

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via Mux Error Handling (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_mux_error_handling__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Goal:** Obtain sensitive information through error messages or debugging information exposed by Mux.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Trigger errors within Mux's routing or middleware handling.
    *   If error handling is not properly configured in production:
        *   Mux might expose detailed error messages to the user.
        *   These messages can reveal:
            *   Internal application details.
            *   Configuration information.
            *   Stack traces (potentially revealing code structure and vulnerabilities).
            *   Sometimes even credentials or API keys.
*   **Example:**
    *   Send a malformed request that causes Mux to throw an exception.
    *   Instead of a generic error page, the user sees a detailed stack trace revealing the application's file paths, library versions, and potentially sensitive data in variables.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration, especially in development or early deployment stages).
*   **Impact:** Medium (Information about application internals, potential credentials, can facilitate further attacks).
*   **Effort:** Low (Simple malformed requests can trigger errors).
*   **Skill Level:** Low.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Error logs will show the exposed information, and users might report seeing detailed error pages).
