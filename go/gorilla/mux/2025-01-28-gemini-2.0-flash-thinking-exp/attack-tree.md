## Attack Tree Path: [1. [HIGH-RISK PATH] 2. Exploit Mux Misconfiguration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1___high-risk_path__2__exploit_mux_misconfiguration__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Attackers target weaknesses arising from how developers configure Gorilla Mux, rather than inherent flaws in Mux itself. Misconfigurations are common and often easier to exploit.
* **Breakdown:**
    * **2.1. Insecure Route Definitions [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **2.1.2. Access Unintended Functionality via Broad Routes [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **2.1.2.1. Craft Request to Access Admin/Internal Endpoints [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                * **Attack Description:** Developers define overly broad route patterns (e.g., using wildcards too liberally, not being specific enough in path matching). Attackers exploit these broad routes to access endpoints that should be restricted, such as administrative panels, internal APIs, or debugging interfaces.
                * **Example:** A route defined as `/admin/{path}` might unintentionally expose all files under an admin directory if not properly secured later in the handler.
                * **Mitigation:** Define routes as narrowly and specifically as possible. Avoid excessive use of wildcards. Regularly review route configurations to ensure they only expose intended functionality. Implement strong authorization checks in route handlers.
    * **2.2. Missing Security Middleware/Handlers [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **2.2.2. Exploit Missing Security Measures [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **2.2.2.1. Perform Unauthorized Actions on Unprotected Routes [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                * **Attack Description:** Developers fail to implement necessary security measures (like authentication, authorization, rate limiting, input validation, CSRF protection, etc.) in route handlers or middleware associated with Mux. Attackers directly access these unprotected routes and perform unauthorized actions.
                * **Example:** A route for deleting user accounts might be exposed without any authentication or authorization checks, allowing anyone to delete accounts by simply sending a request to that route.
                * **Mitigation:** Implement security middleware or handlers for all routes that require protection. Ensure authentication and authorization are enforced. Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse. Implement input validation to protect against injection attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HIGH-RISK PATH] 3. Exploit Application Logic via Mux Routing [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2___high-risk_path__3__exploit_application_logic_via_mux_routing__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage Mux's routing mechanisms to manipulate application logic and trigger vulnerabilities within the application's code, even if Mux itself is working correctly.
* **Breakdown:**
    * **3.1. Route Parameter Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **3.1.2. Manipulate Route Parameters to Trigger Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **3.1.2.1. Inject Malicious Data via Route Parameters (e.g., Path Traversal, Command Injection) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                * **Attack Description:** Applications use route parameters to dynamically handle requests. If application logic processes these parameters without proper validation and sanitization, attackers can inject malicious data through route parameters to exploit vulnerabilities like Path Traversal, Command Injection, SQL Injection (if parameters are used in database queries), or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if parameters are reflected in responses.
                * **Example:** A route `/files/{filename}` might be vulnerable to path traversal if the application directly uses `filename` to access files without validating that it stays within the intended directory.  Similarly, if a parameter is used in a system command without sanitization, command injection is possible.
                * **Mitigation:**  Always validate and sanitize all input received from route parameters. Use parameterized queries for database interactions. Avoid directly executing system commands with user-provided input. Implement robust input validation libraries and practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [HIGH-RISK PATH] 1.3. Vulnerabilities in Middleware Integration (if applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/3___high-risk_path__1_3__vulnerabilities_in_middleware_integration__if_applicable_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Applications often use middleware with Gorilla Mux to handle cross-cutting concerns. Vulnerabilities in these middleware components, especially if they are external or third-party packages, can be exploited.
* **Breakdown:**
    * **1.3.2.1. Identify Vulnerable Middleware Packages (if external) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Description:** Applications integrate third-party middleware packages with Mux for functionalities like authentication, logging, CORS, etc. If these middleware packages contain known vulnerabilities (due to outdated versions, insecure code, or newly discovered flaws), attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application. This is not a vulnerability in Mux itself, but a risk introduced by the application's dependency on external components used with Mux.
        * **Example:** An outdated version of a popular authentication middleware might have a known bypass vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access, even if the Mux routing is correctly configured.
        * **Mitigation:**  Carefully select and vet middleware packages. Keep all middleware dependencies updated to the latest secure versions. Regularly monitor security advisories for used middleware packages. Implement security best practices when integrating and configuring middleware. Consider security audits of middleware configurations and usage.
