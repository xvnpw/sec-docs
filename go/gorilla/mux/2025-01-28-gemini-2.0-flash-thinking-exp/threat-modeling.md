# Threat Model Analysis for gorilla/mux

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Route Misconfiguration](./threats/path_traversal_via_route_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts URLs exploiting poorly defined routes to access unintended resources. They might manipulate path variables or leverage overly broad route patterns to bypass access controls and reach sensitive files or functionalities not meant for public access.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, configuration files, or internal functionalities. Potential data breaches, system compromise, or disruption of service.

**Mux Component Affected:** Route Definition, Path Matching

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict and specific route definitions.
*   Validate path parameters rigorously within handlers.
*   Avoid overly broad wildcard patterns in routes.
*   Conduct thorough testing of route configurations, especially edge cases and boundary conditions.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege when defining route access.

## Threat: [Middleware Bypass due to Route Ordering or Conditional Middleware](./threats/middleware_bypass_due_to_route_ordering_or_conditional_middleware.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits incorrect middleware ordering or flawed conditional logic to bypass security middleware. By targeting specific routes or manipulating request conditions, they can reach handlers without security checks being applied, potentially gaining unauthorized access or exploiting vulnerabilities in unprotected handlers.

**Impact:** Bypassing authentication, authorization, input validation, or other security measures. Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, or exploitation of application vulnerabilities.

**Mux Component Affected:** Middleware Application, Route Handling, Middleware Ordering

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully plan and enforce middleware execution order, ensuring security-critical middleware is applied early.
*   Thoroughly review conditional middleware logic for potential bypasses.
*   Use consistent middleware application patterns across the application.
*   Implement automated tests to verify middleware is applied correctly to all intended routes.

## Threat: [Middleware Vulnerabilities](./threats/middleware_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities present in custom or third-party middleware used with `mux`. These vulnerabilities could range from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the nature of the flaw in the middleware.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, data breaches, remote code execution, server compromise, denial of service, or other impacts depending on the specific middleware vulnerability.

**Mux Component Affected:** Middleware Integration, External Middleware Libraries

**Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and audit custom middleware code for security vulnerabilities.
*   Use well-vetted and reputable third-party middleware libraries.
*   Keep middleware libraries updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Implement security scanning and vulnerability management for middleware dependencies.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to middleware functionality.
