### High and Critical Attack Surfaces Directly Involving Mux

This list focuses on high and critical severity attack surfaces where the `gorilla/mux` library directly contributes to the vulnerability.

*   **Description:** Overlapping Route Definitions
    *   **How Mux Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `mux` matches routes based on the order of registration. If multiple routes match the same incoming request path, the first registered route will handle the request. This can lead to unintended handlers being invoked if route definitions are not specific enough.
    *   **Impact:** Access control bypass, unintended functionality execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define routes with sufficient specificity to avoid overlaps (e.g., using different HTTP methods or more specific path patterns).
        *   Carefully review the order of route registration to ensure the intended handler is invoked.
        *   Utilize `mux`'s features for method matching (`Methods()`) and other constraints to differentiate routes.

*   **Description:** Path Traversal via Path Variables
    *   **How Mux Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `mux` allows capturing parts of the URL path as variables. If these variables are directly used to access files or resources without proper sanitization, attackers can manipulate them to access unauthorized files or directories.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive files or resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate path variables before using them to access resources.
        *   Use allow-lists of allowed characters or patterns for path variables.
        *   Avoid directly using path variables for file system operations. Consider using an index or mapping to access resources.

*   **Description:** Bypassing Middleware due to Incorrect Configuration
    *   **How Mux Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  `mux` relies on the developer to correctly apply middleware to the appropriate routes or routers. Misconfiguration can lead to middleware not being applied to certain routes, potentially bypassing security checks.
    *   **Impact:** Access control bypass, security features not being enforced.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review the application of middleware to routes and routers.
        *   Use subrouters effectively to group routes with common middleware.
        *   Implement integration tests to verify that middleware is applied as expected.
