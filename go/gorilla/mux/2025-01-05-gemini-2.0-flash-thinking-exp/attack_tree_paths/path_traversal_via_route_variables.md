## Deep Analysis: Path Traversal via Route Variables in Gorilla Mux Application

This analysis delves into the specific attack tree path "Path Traversal via Route Variables" within an application utilizing the `gorilla/mux` library in Go. We will examine the mechanics of the attack, its potential impact, and provide recommendations for mitigation.

**ATTACK TREE PATH:**

* **Identify routes using variables for file paths:** The application uses route variables to construct file paths, for example, `/files/{filename}`.
* **Inject malicious path traversal sequences in variables:** An attacker injects sequences like `../` into the route variable, for example, `/files/../../etc/passwd`.
* **Access or modify unauthorized files (Critical Node):** The attacker gains access to sensitive files or directories outside the intended scope, potentially exposing configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive data.

**Detailed Analysis of Each Step:**

**1. Identify routes using variables for file paths:**

* **Mechanism:**  `gorilla/mux` allows defining routes with variables using the `{variable}` syntax. These variables capture parts of the URL path. Developers might use these variables to dynamically construct file paths on the server.
* **Example:**
    ```go
    r := mux.NewRouter()
    r.HandleFunc("/files/{filename}", serveFileHandler)

    func serveFileHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        vars := mux.Vars(r)
        filename := vars["filename"]
        // Potentially vulnerable code:
        filePath := "/var/www/uploads/" + filename
        // ... process and serve the file at filePath ...
    }
    ```
* **Attacker Perspective:** The attacker analyzes the application's routes, either through documentation, API exploration, or by observing network traffic. They identify routes where variables seem to be used for accessing files or resources. The naming convention of the variable (e.g., `filename`, `path`, `resource`) can be a strong indicator.

**2. Inject malicious path traversal sequences in variables:**

* **Mechanism:** The attacker crafts a request where the route variable contains path traversal sequences like `../`, `..\\`, or URL-encoded equivalents (`%2e%2e%2f`, `%2e%2e%5c`). These sequences instruct the operating system to move up one directory level in the file system hierarchy.
* **Example:**
    * Instead of requesting `/files/document.txt`, the attacker sends a request like `/files/../../../../etc/passwd`.
    * The `filename` variable in the `serveFileHandler` will contain `../../../../etc/passwd`.
* **Attacker Perspective:** The attacker leverages their understanding of file system navigation. They strategically inject `../` sequences to escape the intended base directory (`/var/www/uploads/` in the example) and access files or directories outside of it. The number of `../` sequences depends on the directory structure and the target file's location. They might use automated tools to try various combinations.

**3. Access or modify unauthorized files (Critical Node):**

* **Mechanism:** If the application directly uses the unsanitized route variable to construct the file path and attempts to access the file, the operating system will resolve the path according to the injected traversal sequences. This allows the attacker to read or potentially write to files they shouldn't have access to.
* **Example:**
    * In the `serveFileHandler` example, if the code proceeds to open the file at `/var/www/uploads/../../../../etc/passwd`, it will effectively try to open `/etc/passwd`.
    * Depending on the application's permissions and the file system permissions, the attacker might be able to read the contents of `/etc/passwd`, which contains user account information (though often hashed passwords).
* **Impact:** This is the critical node because it represents the successful exploitation of the vulnerability. The impact can be severe, depending on the sensitivity of the accessed files:
    * **Reading Sensitive Data:** Accessing configuration files with database credentials, API keys, or other secrets.
    * **Reading System Files:** Gaining information about the operating system, installed software, and user accounts.
    * **Modifying Critical Files:** In some cases, if write permissions are misconfigured, attackers could modify configuration files, leading to application malfunction or further compromise.
    * **Remote Code Execution (Indirect):** While not a direct code execution vulnerability, accessing or modifying certain files (e.g., web server configuration) could indirectly lead to code execution.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

* **Root Cause:** The core issue is the **lack of proper input validation and sanitization** of the route variable before using it to construct file paths. Developers often assume that the input received through route variables is safe and within the expected scope.
* **Gorilla Mux Specifics:** `gorilla/mux` itself doesn't inherently protect against path traversal. It provides the mechanism to extract route variables, but the responsibility of handling these variables securely lies with the application developer.
* **Operating System Behavior:** The operating system's file system API interprets `../` sequences to navigate up the directory tree. Without proper safeguards, the application blindly follows these instructions.
* **Common Mistakes:**
    * **Direct Concatenation:** Directly concatenating the base directory with the unsanitized route variable.
    * **Insufficient Filtering:** Implementing weak filtering that can be bypassed by different encoding or variations of traversal sequences.
    * **Trusting User Input:** Assuming that users will only provide valid filenames.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Input Validation and Sanitization (Crucial):**
    * **Whitelist Allowed Characters:**  Restrict the characters allowed in the route variable to only those expected for valid filenames (alphanumeric, underscores, hyphens, dots, etc.). Reject any request containing suspicious characters like `/`, `\`, `.`.
    * **Regular Expression Matching:** Use regular expressions to enforce the expected format of the filename.
    * **Blacklist Dangerous Sequences:**  Explicitly reject requests containing `../`, `..\\`, and their encoded equivalents. However, relying solely on blacklisting can be easily bypassed.
* **Path Canonicalization:**
    * **`filepath.Clean()` in Go:** This function is essential. It normalizes the path by removing redundant separators and `.` and `..` elements. **Always use `filepath.Clean()` on user-provided path segments before using them in file system operations.**
    * **Example:**
        ```go
        func serveFileHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            vars := mux.Vars(r)
            filename := vars["filename"]
            // Secure code:
            filePath := filepath.Clean("/var/www/uploads/" + filename)

            // Check if the cleaned path is still within the allowed directory
            if !strings.HasPrefix(filePath, "/var/www/uploads/") {
                http.Error(w, "Unauthorized access", http.StatusForbidden)
                return
            }

            // ... process and serve the file at filePath ...
        }
        ```
* **Sandboxing and Chroot:**
    * Restrict the application's access to only the necessary parts of the file system. This can be achieved using chroot jails or containerization technologies.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary permissions. This limits the potential damage if a path traversal vulnerability is exploited.
* **Secure File Handling Libraries:**
    * If dealing with complex file operations, consider using libraries that provide built-in security features and handle path manipulation safely.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * While not a direct mitigation for path traversal, CSP can help prevent the execution of malicious scripts injected through other vulnerabilities that might be facilitated by path traversal.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * Proactively identify potential path traversal vulnerabilities through code reviews and security testing.

**Code Examples:**

**Vulnerable Code (Direct Concatenation):**

```go
func serveFileHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    vars := mux.Vars(r)
    filename := vars["filename"]
    filePath := "/var/www/uploads/" + filename // Vulnerable!
    // ... attempt to open and serve filePath ...
}
```

**Secure Code (Using `filepath.Clean()` and Prefix Check):**

```go
import (
	"net/http"
	"path/filepath"
	"strings"

	"github.com/gorilla/mux"
)

func serveFileHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    vars := mux.Vars(r)
    filename := vars["filename"]

    // Sanitize and normalize the path
    filePath := filepath.Clean("/var/www/uploads/" + filename)

    // Ensure the resolved path is still within the intended directory
    if !strings.HasPrefix(filePath, "/var/www/uploads/") {
        http.Error(w, "Unauthorized access", http.StatusForbidden)
        return
    }

    // ... attempt to open and serve filePath ...
}
```

**Further Considerations:**

* **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement robust logging to detect suspicious activity, including attempts to access unusual file paths.
* **Regular Updates:** Keep `gorilla/mux` and other dependencies updated to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
* **Security Headers:** While not directly related to path traversal, implementing security headers like `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` can enhance overall application security.

**Conclusion:**

The "Path Traversal via Route Variables" attack path highlights a common and critical vulnerability in web applications. While `gorilla/mux` provides a flexible routing mechanism, it's the developer's responsibility to handle route variables securely. By implementing robust input validation, utilizing path canonicalization functions like `filepath.Clean()`, and adhering to the principle of least privilege, developers can effectively mitigate this risk and protect their applications from unauthorized file access. This analysis emphasizes the importance of secure coding practices and a proactive approach to security in the development lifecycle.
