## Attack Tree Path: [Route Collision](./attack_tree_paths/route_collision.md)

* **Craft ambiguous routes:** Developers might define multiple routes that could potentially match the same incoming request due to overlapping patterns or insufficient specificity.
* **Trigger request matching multiple routes:** An attacker crafts a request that satisfies the conditions of more than one defined route.
* **Achieve unintended handler execution (Critical Node):** The application executes a handler that the attacker was not supposed to access. This can lead to information disclosure, unauthorized actions, or further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal via Route Variables](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_via_route_variables.md)

* **Identify routes using variables for file paths:**  The application uses route variables to construct file paths, for example, `/files/{filename}`.
* **Inject malicious path traversal sequences in variables:** An attacker injects sequences like `../` into the route variable, for example, `/files/../../etc/passwd`.
* **Access or modify unauthorized files (Critical Node):** The attacker gains access to sensitive files or directories outside the intended scope, potentially exposing configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Parameter Injection](./attack_tree_paths/parameter_injection.md)

* **Identify routes using variables in database queries or commands:** The application directly uses route variables in constructing database queries or system commands without proper sanitization.
* **Inject malicious code or commands in route variables:** An attacker crafts malicious input within the route variable, such as SQL code or shell commands.
* **Achieve SQL Injection, Command Injection, etc. (Critical Node):**  The injected code is executed by the application, allowing the attacker to manipulate the database, execute arbitrary system commands, or gain further access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Middleware Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/middleware_bypass.md)

* **Identify vulnerabilities in middleware ordering or logic:**  Flaws exist in how middleware components are ordered or in the logic of individual middleware, allowing for bypass.
* **Craft requests that bypass intended middleware processing:** An attacker crafts requests that exploit these flaws to skip certain middleware components.
* **Circumvent authentication, authorization, or sanitization (Critical Node):**  Crucial security checks are bypassed, allowing unauthorized access to resources or the injection of malicious data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Middleware Vulnerability Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/middleware_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

* **Identify vulnerable middleware integrated with Mux:** A specific middleware component used by the application has known security vulnerabilities.
* **Exploit vulnerabilities within the middleware itself:** The attacker leverages known exploits for the identified middleware component.
* **Achieve code execution or data access (Critical Node):** Successful exploitation of the middleware vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or gain direct access to sensitive data.
