# Threat Model Analysis for gorilla/mux

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Route Patterns](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_route_patterns.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a URL containing a string that causes a poorly written regular expression within a `mux` route pattern to take an excessively long time to evaluate. This consumes significant CPU resources on the server, potentially leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. The attacker targets the route matching functionality of `mux`.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, resource exhaustion, application slowdown or unresponsiveness.
    *   **Affected `mux` Component:** Route Matching (specifically the regular expression matching engine used by `Path`, `Host`, and custom matchers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully design and test regular expressions used in `mux` route patterns.
        *   Avoid overly complex or nested patterns known to be vulnerable to ReDoS.
        *   Consider using simpler string matching techniques where possible in `mux` routes.
        *   Implement timeouts for regular expression matching operations, potentially requiring custom middleware or wrapping `mux`'s internal logic.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Unsanitized Path Parameters](./threats/path_traversal_via_unsanitized_path_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates path parameters extracted from the URL by `mux` (using variable syntax like `{param}`) to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`). If the application directly uses these unsanitized parameters to access files or resources, the attacker can potentially access files outside the intended directory. This threat directly involves how `mux` extracts and provides path parameters.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential code execution if the attacker can access executable files.
    *   **Affected `mux` Component:** Route Matching (specifically the extraction of path variables).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize and validate path parameters extracted by `mux` before using them to access files or resources.
        *   Use secure file access methods that prevent traversal (e.g., using absolute paths or whitelisting allowed file paths).
        *   Avoid directly concatenating user-supplied path parameters into file paths.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Strict Slash Option leading to security bypass](./threats/misconfiguration_of_strict_slash_option_leading_to_security_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a misconfigured or inconsistently applied "strict slash" option in `mux`. If some routes accept URLs with trailing slashes while others don't, and different security measures are applied to these variations, an attacker might bypass security checks by accessing the resource with or without the trailing slash. This directly involves `mux`'s routing behavior based on this configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Potential bypass of security checks, access to unintended functionalities.
    *   **Affected `mux` Component:** Router configuration (specifically the `StrictSlash` option) and Route Matching.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the security implications of the bypassed checks).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully consider the application's requirements and consistently configure the `StrictSlash` option across all `mux` routes.
        *   Avoid having different security logic applied to the same logical resource based solely on the presence or absence of a trailing slash in the `mux` configuration.
        *   Enforce a consistent URL structure throughout the application.
