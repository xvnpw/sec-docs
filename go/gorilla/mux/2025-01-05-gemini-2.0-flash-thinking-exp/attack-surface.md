# Attack Surface Analysis for gorilla/mux

## Attack Surface: [Ambiguous Route Definitions](./attack_surfaces/ambiguous_route_definitions.md)

**Description:** Overlapping or poorly defined route patterns can lead to the router matching a request to an unintended handler.

**How Mux Contributes:** `mux` relies on the order of route registration and pattern matching. If patterns are too similar, the first matching route will be executed, potentially bypassing intended access controls or logic.

**Example:**
*   Route 1: `/users/{id}`
*   Route 2: `/users/admin`
An attacker requesting `/users/admin` might unintentionally hit the handler for `/users/{id}` with `id` set to "admin", if Route 1 is registered before Route 2 and the handler doesn't properly validate the `id`.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, execution of unintended code paths, potential data manipulation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Define specific and non-overlapping route patterns.
*   Register more specific routes before more general ones.
*   Use the `UseEncodedPath()` option if dealing with encoded characters in paths to avoid ambiguity.
*   Thoroughly test all route combinations to ensure expected behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Route Matching](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_route_matching.md)

**Description:** Using complex or poorly written regular expressions in route definitions can make the router vulnerable to ReDoS attacks.

**How Mux Contributes:** `mux` allows the use of regular expressions within route patterns. A maliciously crafted URL can cause the regex engine to consume excessive CPU time, leading to denial of service.

**Example:** A route defined as `/api/data/{param:.*(a+)+b}`. An attacker could send a URL like `/api/data/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac` which could cause the regex engine to hang.

**Impact:** Service disruption, resource exhaustion, potential server crash.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid overly complex regular expressions in route definitions.
*   Thoroughly test regular expressions for performance with various inputs, including potentially malicious ones.
*   Consider alternative, simpler route matching strategies if possible.
*   Implement timeouts for request processing to limit the impact of ReDoS.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Path Variables](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_path_variables.md)

**Description:** If path variables extracted by `mux` are used directly in file system operations or other sensitive contexts without proper sanitization, attackers can perform path traversal attacks.

**How Mux Contributes:** `mux` facilitates the extraction of variables from the URL path. If the application doesn't sanitize these extracted variables before using them, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** A route defined as `/files/{filepath}`. The handler uses the `filepath` variable to read a file. An attacker could send a request to `/files/../../../../etc/passwd` to access sensitive files.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to files and directories, potential execution of arbitrary code if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never directly use path variables in file system operations without strict validation and sanitization.**
*   Use allow-lists for allowed file paths or names.
*   Utilize secure file handling libraries that prevent path traversal.
*   Implement proper access controls on the file system.

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect Middleware Ordering](./attack_surfaces/incorrect_middleware_ordering.md)

**Description:** Applying middleware in the wrong order can lead to security bypasses.

**How Mux Contributes:** `mux` executes middleware in the order they are added to the router or subrouter. Incorrect ordering can negate the intended security benefits of middleware.

**Example:** An authentication middleware is placed *after* a logging middleware that logs request bodies. Sensitive data in the request body might be logged even for unauthenticated requests.

**Impact:** Security checks being bypassed, exposure of sensitive information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully plan the order of middleware execution.
*   Ensure authentication and authorization middleware are applied early in the chain.
*   Test different middleware orderings to verify the intended security behavior.
