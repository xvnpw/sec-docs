## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Incorrect Route Ordering (Less Restrictive First)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_incorrect_route_ordering__less_restrictive_first_.md)

*   **Description:** The developer defines a less restrictive route (e.g., `/public`) *before* a more restrictive route that requires authentication (e.g., `/public/admin`).  `gorilla/mux` matches routes in the order they are defined, so the less restrictive route will *always* match first, bypassing the authentication requirement for the more specific route.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   `[!! Exploit Mux Misconfigurations !!]`: The root cause is a developer error in configuring `gorilla/mux`.
    *   `[!! Bypass Authentication/Authorization via !!]`: The ultimate consequence of this misconfiguration.
    *   `[!! Incorrect Route Ordering/Matching !!]`: The specific type of misconfiguration.
    *   `[!! Place Less Restrictive Route *Before* More Specific !!]`: The precise coding error.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   `[!! Place Less Restrictive Route *Before* More Specific !!]`: The developer makes the initial mistake.
    *   `[Craft Input]`: The attacker crafts a request (usually just a URL) that matches the less restrictive route but targets a resource that *should* be protected.  For example, they might access `/public/admin` directly.
    *   `[Bypass Auth]`: The attacker successfully accesses the protected resource without authentication.
*   **Likelihood:** High (Very common mistake)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete authentication bypass)
*   **Effort:** Very Low (Just visiting a URL)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (Might be visible in access logs, but could be mistaken for legitimate traffic)

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Incorrect Route Ordering (More Specific Last)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_incorrect_route_ordering__more_specific_last_.md)

*   **Description:**  Similar to Path 1, but the developer defines a more specific route (e.g., `/admin/users/{id:[0-9]+}`) *after* a less specific route (e.g., `/admin/users/{id}`).  The less specific route will match first, even if the input matches the more specific (and potentially more restrictive) route.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   `[!! Exploit Mux Misconfigurations !!]`:  Developer error.
    *   `[!! Bypass Authentication/Authorization via !!]`:  Consequence.
    *   `[!! Incorrect Route Ordering/Matching !!]`:  Type of misconfiguration.
    *   `[!! Place More Specific Route *After* Less Specific !!]`:  The coding error.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   `[!! Place More Specific Route *After* Less Specific !!]`: Developer error.
    *   `[Craft Input]`: Attacker crafts a request that matches the *less* specific route, but targets a resource that should be handled by the *more* specific (and potentially authenticated) route.
    *   `[Bypass Auth]`: Attacker bypasses authentication.
*   **Likelihood:** High (Common mistake)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Authentication bypass)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Path Traversal via Custom Handler](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_path_traversal_via_custom_handler.md)

* **Description:** A custom handler registered with `gorilla/mux` uses user-provided input to construct a file path without proper sanitization. An attacker can manipulate this input to access files outside the intended directory.
* **Critical Nodes:**
    *  `[Exploit Mux-Specific Vulnerabilities]`: While not a direct vulnerability in `mux` itself, the router directs traffic to the vulnerable handler.
    * `[Path Traversal via Custom Handlers]`: The specific vulnerability type.
* **Attack Steps:**
    * `[Bypass Sanitization in Custom Handler]`: The attacker finds a way to circumvent any input validation or escaping mechanisms in the custom handler. This often involves using special characters like `../` to traverse the directory structure.
    * The attacker then uses this to read or write arbitrary files.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the quality of the custom handler)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Arbitrary file read/write, potential code execution)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires finding and exploiting a sanitization flaw)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Might be hidden in logs, requires careful analysis)

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Incorrect Middleware Leading to Auth Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_incorrect_middleware_leading_to_auth_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Authentication or authorization middleware is either implemented incorrectly, placed in the wrong order in the middleware chain, or has logic flaws that allow an attacker to bypass it.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   `[!! Exploit Mux Misconfigurations !!]`: Developer error in configuring or implementing middleware.
    *   `[!! Bypass Authentication/Authorization via !!]`: The ultimate consequence.
    *   `[Incorrect Middleware]`: The general category of the misconfiguration.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   `[Bypass Auth Checks in Custom Handler]`: The attacker finds a flaw in the middleware's logic. This could be due to incorrect session handling, improper validation of tokens, or other vulnerabilities.
    *   `[Craft Input to Bypass Auth]`: The attacker crafts a request that exploits the flaw in the middleware to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common mistake in middleware implementation)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Unauthorized access to protected resources)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Depends on the complexity of the bypass)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires analyzing logs and request patterns)
