# Threat Model Analysis for gorilla/mux

## Threat: [Threat: Unexpected Route Matching (Path Traversal/Confusion)](./threats/threat_unexpected_route_matching__path_traversalconfusion_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing special characters (e.g., `../`, `%2e%2e%2f`, encoded slashes) or unexpected patterns.  These exploit poorly defined regular expressions or path variable handling within `mux`'s route definitions. The attacker aims to bypass intended access controls, reach unintended handlers, or access files outside the intended directory, leveraging `mux`'s routing logic.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
        *   Execution of unintended code (if the handler is reached).
        *   Potential for server-side request forgery (SSRF).
        *   Information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `mux.Router.HandleFunc()` and related methods (e.g., `Handle()`, `Path()`, `PathPrefix()`) *specifically* when used with regular expressions or path variables.
        *   The regular expression engine within `mux` (Go's `regexp` package) as used by `mux` for route matching.
        *   `mux`'s path variable extraction logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strict, well-defined regular expressions. Avoid overly permissive patterns.
        *   Employ `StrictSlash(true)` to enforce consistent trailing slash behavior.
        *   Validate and sanitize *all* path variable inputs within the handler *after* the route matches (defense in depth, even though `mux` does some parsing).  Do *not* rely solely on the route matcher.
        *   Use `mux.Vars(r)` to safely retrieve path variables.
        *   Extensive testing, including fuzz testing, with a focus on path traversal payloads.
        *   Avoid complex nested routers.

## Threat: [Threat: HTTP Method Confusion](./threats/threat_http_method_confusion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a request using an unexpected HTTP method (e.g., `POST` instead of `GET`, or a custom method) to a route.  The route *might* be defined in `mux` for a different method, but the handler doesn't check, or `mux` isn't configured to enforce methods. The attacker bypasses security checks implemented only for the intended method(s) or triggers unexpected behavior. This exploits a lack of method enforcement *within the context of how `mux` is used*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Bypass of authentication or authorization checks.
        *   Unexpected state changes.
        *   Potential denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `mux.Router.HandleFunc()` and related methods, *specifically* in how they are used (or not used) with `.Methods()`.
        *   `mux.Router.Methods()` - if *not* used, or used incorrectly, to restrict allowed methods.  This is a direct `mux` feature.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   *Always* explicitly define allowed HTTP methods using `.Methods("GET", "POST", ...)` for *each* route within `mux`. This is the primary mitigation.
        *   Within the handler, check `r.Method` (defense in depth, but the primary mitigation is correct `mux` usage).

## Threat: [Threat: Host/Scheme Confusion (Direct `mux` Misuse)](./threats/threat_hostscheme_confusion__direct__mux__misuse_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker manipulates the `Host` header or uses an unexpected scheme. The application *incorrectly* uses `mux.Router.Host()` or `mux.Router.Scheme()` for *security-critical* decisions (e.g., authorization, tenant isolation) *instead of just routing*. This is a direct misuse of `mux` features.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Access to resources intended for a different domain/tenant.
        *   Bypass of HTTPS enforcement (if `mux.Scheme()` is misused for security).
        *   Incorrect authorization decisions.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `mux.Router.Host()` and `mux.Router.Scheme()` - *specifically* when used inappropriately for security decisions instead of just routing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use `mux.Host()` and `mux.Scheme()` for routing *only*.  *Never* use them directly for security-critical decisions.
        *   Validate the `Host` header against a known-good list *within the handler*, completely independent of `mux`'s routing.
        *   Enforce HTTPS using middleware *before* the `mux` router (this is a general best practice, but the *direct* `mux` threat is misusing `Scheme()`).

## Threat: [Threat: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) within `mux` Route Matching](./threats/threat_regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__within__mux__route_matching.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious input string that exploits a poorly written regular expression *within a `mux` route matcher*. This causes excessive backtracking and CPU consumption, leading to a denial of service. This is a direct threat to `mux`'s use of regular expressions.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of service.
        *   Resource exhaustion.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `mux.Router.HandleFunc()` and related methods (e.g., `Path()`, `PathPrefix()`, `Queries()`) *specifically* when they use vulnerable regular expressions *within the route definition*. This is the core issue.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid complex, nested regular expressions *within `mux` route matchers*. Favor simple, specific patterns.
        *   Use a regular expression analysis tool.
        *   Set a timeout on regular expression matching (this is a general Go best practice, but it's crucial when using regexes *within `mux` for routing*).
