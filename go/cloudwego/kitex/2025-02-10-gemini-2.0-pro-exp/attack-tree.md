## Attack Tree Path: [1. Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__remote_code_execution__rce___critical_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]**

    *   **Description:** This is the most critical attack vector.  Deserialization vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by providing a maliciously crafted serialized object.  Kitex uses Thrift and Protobuf, which *can* be vulnerable if not handled carefully.  The biggest risk is often in *custom* deserialization logic implemented by the application developers.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **1.1.1 Kitex's Handling of Thrift/Protobuf Deserialization:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Kitex's default deserialization process.
            *   **1.1.1.1 Craft Malicious Thrift/Protobuf Payload (Gadget Chain) [CRITICAL]:**  The attacker creates a serialized object that, when deserialized, will execute a chain of existing code snippets ("gadgets") to achieve RCE.
                *   **1.1.1.1.1 Send Payload:** The crafted payload is sent to a Kitex endpoint that will deserialize it.
        *   **1.1.2 Exploit Custom Deserialization Logic:**  Targeting vulnerabilities in application-specific deserialization code.
            *   **1.1.2.2 Craft Payload Targeting Custom Logic [CRITICAL]:**  Similar to 1.1.1.1, but tailored to the specific flaws in the custom code.
                *   **1.1.2.3 Send Payload:** The crafted payload is sent to trigger the vulnerable custom deserialization.
    *   **Mitigations:**
        *   Strict input validation *before* deserialization.
        *   Use a whitelist of allowed classes for deserialization, if possible.
        *   Avoid custom deserialization logic if at all possible.
        *   Keep Kitex and all dependencies up-to-date.
        *   Regular security audits and penetration testing.

*   **1.3 Exploit Kitex Middleware/Extensions (IF vulnerable)**
    *   **Description:** Kitex middleware can intercept and modify requests and responses.  If a middleware component is vulnerable, it can be exploited to achieve RCE.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **1.3.2 Craft Payload to Exploit Middleware Vulnerability [CRITICAL]:** The attacker crafts a payload specifically designed to trigger a vulnerability in a particular middleware.
            *   **1.3.3 Send Payload to Trigger Middleware:** The crafted payload is sent.
    *   **Mitigations:**
        *   Use only well-vetted and maintained middleware.
        *   Thoroughly review the source code of any custom middleware.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to middleware.

*   **1.4 Exploit Kitex Server/Client Configuration [HIGH-RISK]**

    *   **Description:** Misconfigurations can create vulnerabilities.  The most critical is the lack of TLS.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **1.4.2 Insecure Transport Configuration (e.g., no TLS) [HIGH-RISK]:**  If TLS is not used, communication is unencrypted.
            *   **1.4.2.1 Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) to Inject Malicious Payloads [CRITICAL]:**  An attacker can intercept the communication and inject malicious data, potentially leading to RCE.
    *   **Mitigations:**
        *   **Enforce TLS for all communication.**
        *   Use strong cipher suites and proper certificate validation.
        *   Regularly audit configuration settings.

*  **1.5 Exploit Kitex's internal RPC mechanism (IF vulnerable)**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerability in Kitex RPC protocol implementation.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **1.5.2 Craft malicious RPC request [CRITICAL]:** The attacker crafts a malformed RPC request.
            *   **1.5.2.1 Send crafted request to Kitex server:** The crafted request is sent to Kitex server.
    *   **Mitigations:**
        *   Regularly update Kitex and its dependencies to get the latest security patches.
        *   Report any found vulnerabilities to Kitex developers.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Data Exfiltration [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3__data_exfiltration__critical_.md)

*   **3.2 Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Indirect Data Exfiltration) [HIGH-RISK]**

    *   **Description:**  Deserialization vulnerabilities can be used not only for RCE but also to leak data.  An attacker might craft a payload that, upon deserialization, reads sensitive files or accesses internal data structures.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **3.2.1 Use Gadget Chains to Read Files or Access Internal Data:**  The attacker uses a gadget chain to access and exfiltrate data.
            *   **3.2.1.1 Craft Payload to Exfiltrate Data [CRITICAL]:**  The payload is specifically designed to read and return sensitive information.
    *   **Mitigations:**  Same as for RCE via deserialization (1.1).
