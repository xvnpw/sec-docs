## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Deserialization Handling within Kitex](./mitigation_strategies/robust_deserialization_handling_within_kitex.md)

*   **1. Mitigation Strategy: Robust Deserialization Handling within Kitex**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Dependency Management (Kitex & Related):** Continuously monitor and update Kitex itself, Thrift/Protobuf compilers (`thriftgo`/`protoc`), and *Kitex-related* runtime libraries. This includes any Kitex plugins or extensions you are using. Use `go mod tidy` and `go mod vendor` regularly.
        2.  **Schema-Based Validation (Kitex-Generated Code):** Leverage the validation provided by the code generated by `thriftgo` or `protoc` from your Thrift/Protobuf schemas. Ensure schemas are well-defined and strictly enforced. This validation happens *within* Kitex's deserialization process.
        3.  **Post-Deserialization Input Validation (Within Kitex Handlers):** Implement custom validation logic *after* Kitex has deserialized the request, but *within* your Kitex service handlers (the functions that implement your service interface). This is crucial for handling logic-level vulnerabilities.
            *   Check size limits on strings, arrays, and maps.
            *   Validate data types beyond what the schema enforces.
            *   Enforce range constraints.
            *   Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks *if that data is passed to other systems*.
            *   Reject unexpected fields.
        4.  **Safe Deserialization Libraries (Verify Kitex Usage):** Confirm that Kitex is using the standard, recommended deserialization libraries for Thrift and Protobuf.  Avoid any custom Kitex configurations that might bypass these libraries.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Critical):** Deserialization vulnerabilities within Kitex's handling of Thrift/Protobuf data.
        *   **Denial of Service (High):** Malformed input causing Kitex's deserialization to crash or consume excessive resources.
        *   **Data Corruption (High):** Invalid data bypassing Kitex's initial checks.
        *   **Injection Attacks (High/Medium):** If data is passed to other systems without further sanitization.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
        *   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced from High to Medium/Low.
        *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduced from High/Medium to Low (with proper sanitization *in later stages*).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Dependency Management: Implemented for Kitex and related libraries.
        *   Schema-Based Validation: Implemented automatically by Kitex-generated code.
        *   Post-Deserialization Input Validation: Partially implemented in `service/handler.go`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Post-Deserialization Input Validation: Missing comprehensive checks in `service/handler.go` and `api/handler.go`.
        *   Verification of Safe Deserialization Libraries: Need to confirm Kitex configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Kitex Client-Side Service Discovery](./mitigation_strategies/secure_kitex_client-side_service_discovery.md)

*   **2. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Kitex Client-Side Service Discovery**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Client-Side TLS Verification (Kitex Configuration):** Configure the Kitex *client* to verify the server's TLS certificate. This is done within the Kitex client configuration (e.g., using `client.WithTLSConfig`). Ensure:
            *   The certificate is signed by a trusted CA.
            *   The certificate's hostname matches the server's address (obtained from service discovery).
            *   The certificate is valid (not expired or revoked).
        2.  **mTLS (Kitex Client and Server Configuration):** If using mutual TLS, configure the Kitex *client* with its own certificate and private key, and configure the Kitex *server* to require client certificates. This is done using Kitex's TLS configuration options.
        3. **Service Identity Verification (Custom Kitex Logic - Optional):** If you need to verify the service's identity beyond TLS, implement custom logic *within your Kitex client code* (potentially using a Kitex middleware or interceptor).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (Critical):** Attackers redirecting traffic to a malicious service, mitigated by Kitex client-side checks.
        *   **Service Impersonation (High):** Attackers registering a malicious service, mitigated by Kitex client verification.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
        *   **Service Impersonation:** Risk reduced from High to Low/Medium.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Client-Side TLS Verification: Implemented in Kitex client configuration.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   mTLS: Not implemented.
        *   Service Identity Verification (Custom): Not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Kitex Middleware and Interceptors](./mitigation_strategies/secure_kitex_middleware_and_interceptors.md)

*   **3. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Kitex Middleware and Interceptors**

    *   **Description:** This strategy remains largely the same, but the focus is on the *Kitex-specific* aspects:
        1.  **Third-Party Kitex Middleware Review:** Thoroughly review the code of any third-party *Kitex* middleware.
        2.  **Custom Kitex Middleware Secure Coding:** Follow secure coding practices when writing custom *Kitex* middleware.
        3.  **Least Privilege (Kitex Middleware Context):** Ensure your Kitex middleware only accesses the data it needs from the Kitex `context.Context`. Avoid accessing or modifying parts of the context that are not relevant to the middleware's function.
        4.  **Monitoring and Alerting (Kitex Middleware):** Monitor the behavior of your *Kitex* middleware.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:** (Same as before, but specific to Kitex middleware)
        *   **Information Leakage (High/Medium)**
        *   **Request/Response Modification (High/Medium)**
        *   **Denial of Service (High)**
        *   **Introduction of New Vulnerabilities (High/Medium)**

    *   **Impact:** (Same as before)
        *   **Information Leakage:** Risk reduced.
        *   **Request/Response Modification:** Risk reduced.
        *   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced.
        *   **Introduction of New Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Custom logging middleware: Implemented. Basic review.
        *   Basic monitoring.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Thorough review of custom middleware.
        *   Strict Least Privilege within middleware context.
        *   Alerting.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Kitex-Specific Denial of Service Protection (Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/kitex-specific_denial_of_service_protection__configuration_.md)

*   **4. Mitigation Strategy: Kitex-Specific Denial of Service Protection (Configuration)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Connection Limits (Kitex Server Options):** Configure Kitex server options (`server.WithLimit`) to limit the maximum number of concurrent connections *handled by Kitex*.
        2.  **Request Rate Limiting (Kitex Built-in):** Use Kitex's built-in rate limiting features (`server.WithLimit` and `limit.Option`). This is the *Kitex-specific* way to implement rate limiting.
        3.  **Request Size Limits (Kitex Server Options):** Configure Kitex to reject requests that exceed a specified size limit (`server.WithLimit`). This is a *Kitex-level* configuration.
        4.  **Timeouts (Kitex Client and Server Options):** Set appropriate timeouts for Kitex client and server operations (connection, read, write, idle) using Kitex's configuration options (e.g., `client.WithConnectTimeout`, `client.WithRPCTimeout`, `server.WithReadWriteTimeout`). This is entirely within Kitex's configuration.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Connection Exhaustion (High):** Specifically within Kitex's connection handling.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (High):** Due to Kitex processing large requests or many requests.
        *   **Slowloris Attacks (High):** Against Kitex's connection handling.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Connection Exhaustion:** Risk reduced.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced.
        *   **Slowloris Attacks:** Risk reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Timeouts: Basic timeouts configured.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Connection Limits: Not configured.
        *   Request Rate Limiting (Kitex Built-in): Not implemented.
        *   Request Size Limits: Not configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Error Handling within Kitex](./mitigation_strategies/secure_error_handling_within_kitex.md)

*   **5. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Error Handling within Kitex**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Generic Error Messages (Kitex Handlers):** In your Kitex service handlers, catch errors and return generic error messages to clients.  Do *not* include any internal details in the response sent *through Kitex*.
        2.  **Error Handling Middleware (Kitex Middleware):** Create a *Kitex* middleware to centralize error handling. This middleware can catch errors *within the Kitex pipeline*, log details, and return generic responses *through Kitex*.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Leakage (Medium):** Through Kitex error responses.
        *   **Attacker Reconnaissance (Medium):** Using Kitex error responses.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Leakage:** Risk reduced.
        *   **Attacker Reconnaissance:** Risk reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic generic error messages: Partially.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Consistent generic error messages.
        *   Error Handling Kitex Middleware.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong TLS Configuration within Kitex](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_tls_configuration_within_kitex.md)

* **6. Mitigation Strategy: Enforce Strong TLS Configuration within Kitex**

    * **Description:**
        1. **Enable TLS (Kitex Client and Server):** Ensure TLS is enabled for all Kitex communication using Kitex's configuration options.
        2. **Strong Ciphers (Kitex Configuration):** Configure Kitex (both client and server) to use only strong cipher suites. This is done through Kitex's TLS configuration.
        3. **Modern TLS Versions (Kitex Configuration):** Configure Kitex to use TLS 1.3 if possible and disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1. This is controlled by Kitex's TLS settings.
        4. **Certificate Validation (Kitex Client):** Ensure the Kitex client is configured to validate the server's certificate (hostname, CA trust, validity). This is part of the Kitex client's TLS configuration.
        5. **Mutual TLS (mTLS - Kitex Client and Server):** Configure both the Kitex client and server to use certificates for mutual authentication using Kitex's TLS configuration options.
        6. **Regular Key Rotation:** Rotate TLS certificates and private keys regularly.

    * **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (Critical):** Specifically for Kitex communication.
        *   **Eavesdropping (High):** On Kitex communication.

        *   **Man-in-the-Middle:** Risk reduced.
        *   **Eavesdropping:** Risk reduced.
        *   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduced.

    * **Currently Implemented:**

        *   Certificate Validation: Implemented.

    * **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Strong Ciphers: Need explicit configuration.
        *   Modern TLS Versions: Need to enforce TLS 1.3.
        *   Mutual TLS (mTLS): Not implemented.
        *   Regular Key Rotation: Not implemented.
