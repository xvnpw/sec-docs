# Threat Model Analysis for cloudwego/kitex

## Threat: [Client Spoofing](./threats/client_spoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker impersonates a legitimate Kitex client to gain unauthorized access. They might replay or forge requests to access server resources without proper authorization.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or service disruption.
    *   **Kitex Component Affected:** Client-Server Communication, Authentication Middleware (if used).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong client authentication mechanisms using Kitex middleware (e.g., token validation, mutual TLS).
        *   Enforce TLS for all communication to encrypt traffic and prevent eavesdropping.
        *   Consider request signing or Message Authentication Codes (MACs) for request origin verification.

## Threat: [Server Spoofing](./threats/server_spoofing.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious server impersonates a legitimate Kitex server. Clients connecting to this rogue server might send sensitive data to the attacker or receive malicious responses.
    *   **Impact:** Clients may expose sensitive data to attackers, receive manipulated data, or be subject to further attacks by interacting with a malicious server.
    *   **Kitex Component Affected:** Client-Server Communication, Connection Establishment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement server authentication for clients using TLS certificate verification.
        *   Ensure clients are configured to connect to the correct and trusted server endpoints.
        *   Utilize secure service discovery mechanisms that include server identity verification.

## Threat: [Request/Response Tampering in Transit](./threats/requestresponse_tampering_in_transit.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between Kitex clients and servers and modifies requests or responses. This can lead to data corruption, unauthorized actions, or information disclosure.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, unauthorized actions performed on the server, information leaks, or denial of service due to manipulated communication.
    *   **Kitex Component Affected:** Network Communication Layer, Serialization/Deserialization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory TLS:** Enforce TLS encryption for all Kitex communication channels to protect data integrity and confidentiality in transit.
        *   Implement input validation on both client and server sides to detect and reject potentially tampered data.
        *   Consider message signing or MACs to ensure message integrity is verifiable upon receipt.

## Threat: [IDL Tampering (Supply Chain Risk)](./threats/idl_tampering__supply_chain_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the Interface Definition Language (IDL) files used by Kitex. By modifying the IDL, they can inject vulnerabilities or backdoors into the generated client and server code.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities or backdoors directly into the application codebase, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Kitex Component Affected:** Code Generation Tooling (Kitex CLI), IDL Definition Files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store IDL files in version control systems with strict access controls.
        *   Implement IDL integrity checks (e.g., checksums, digital signatures) before code generation.
        *   Use only trusted and verified sources for IDL files.
        *   Regularly audit IDL files for unauthorized modifications.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization](./threats/insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** Kitex, using Thrift by default, deserializes data. Vulnerabilities in Thrift's deserialization process or improper usage can be exploited by attackers who send malicious serialized data. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server or client, potentially leading to complete system compromise and data breaches.
    *   **Kitex Component Affected:** Serialization/Deserialization (Thrift Library).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the underlying Thrift library and Kitex framework updated to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Minimize deserialization complexity by avoiding overly complex data structures in IDL definitions.
        *   Implement robust input validation on deserialized data to ensure it conforms to expected values and formats.
        *   Consider alternative serialization methods if Thrift vulnerabilities become a significant and persistent concern, if supported by Kitex.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Requests](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_requests.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods a Kitex server with a large volume of malicious or malformed requests, overwhelming server resources (CPU, memory, network) and causing a denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, making the Kitex application unavailable to legitimate clients.
    *   **Kitex Component Affected:** Server Request Handling, Network Listener.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given timeframe.
        *   Enforce request size limits to prevent excessively large requests.
        *   Limit concurrent connections to the server to prevent connection flooding.
        *   Implement resource monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks.
        *   Utilize load balancing and horizontal scaling to distribute traffic and improve resilience.

## Threat: [Exploiting Kitex Protocol Vulnerabilities for DoS](./threats/exploiting_kitex_protocol_vulnerabilities_for_dos.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Kitex RPC protocol implementation itself to cause a denial of service. This could involve sending specially crafted requests that trigger bugs or resource exhaustion within the Kitex framework's core logic.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, server crashes, or instability due to vulnerabilities in the Kitex framework itself.
    *   **Kitex Component Affected:** Kitex Core Protocol Implementation, Network Layer.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Kitex updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches addressing protocol vulnerabilities.
        *   Conduct security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the Kitex protocol implementation.
        *   Monitor Kitex community and security advisories for reported protocol-level vulnerabilities and apply recommended mitigations.
