## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Client-Side Interactions **HIGH RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/attack_client-side_interactions_high_risk_path.md)

*   Malicious Server Response Handling (CRITICAL NODE):
    *   Attack Vector: A compromised or malicious server sends crafted responses to the client application.
    *   Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Response (CRITICAL NODE):
        *   Attack Vector: The crafted response exploits flaws in how the client deserializes data (e.g., using `Thrift`). This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the client machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Server-Side Implementation **HIGH RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/attack_server-side_implementation_high_risk_path.md)

*   Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Request Handling (CRITICAL NODE):
    *   Attack Vector: A malicious client sends crafted requests to the server. These requests exploit flaws in how the server deserializes data, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   Resource Exhaustion on Server (HIGH RISK PATH):
    *   Send Large Number of Requests (DoS):
        *   Attack Vector: The attacker floods the server with a high volume of requests, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network) and making it unavailable to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Communication Channel Vulnerabilities **HIGH RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_communication_channel_vulnerabilities_high_risk_path.md)

*   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (CRITICAL NODE):
    *   Attack Vector: The attacker intercepts communication between the client and the server. If the communication is not properly encrypted (e.g., using HTTPS/TLS), the attacker can eavesdrop on sensitive data or even modify requests and responses in transit.
