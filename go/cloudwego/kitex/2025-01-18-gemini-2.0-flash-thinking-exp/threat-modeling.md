# Threat Model Analysis for cloudwego/kitex

## Threat: [Malicious IDL Definition](./threats/malicious_idl_definition.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a crafted IDL file that, when processed by Kitex's code generation tools, exploits vulnerabilities in the parser or code generation logic. This could lead to the generation of insecure code.

**Impact:** Generation of vulnerable code leading to potential remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure in the deployed application.

**Affected Kitex Component:** Kitex Code Generator

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict validation and sanitization of IDL files before processing.
*   Regularly update Kitex to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the code generator.
*   Control access to the IDL files and the code generation environment.
*   Consider using static analysis tools on IDL files.

## Threat: [Payload Injection via Deserialization](./threats/payload_injection_via_deserialization.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious payload within an RPC request that, when deserialized by the receiving service using Kitex's mechanisms, exploits vulnerabilities in the deserialization library (e.g., Thrift, Protobuf) or the service's handling of the deserialized data. This can lead to arbitrary code execution or other malicious actions on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server, access sensitive data, or disrupt service.

**Affected Kitex Component:** RPC Handler, Serialization/Deserialization mechanisms

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid deserializing data directly into complex objects without proper validation.
*   Implement input validation and sanitization on all data received via RPC.
*   Keep the underlying serialization libraries (Thrift, Protobuf) up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Consider using safer serialization methods if possible.
*   Implement robust error handling during deserialization to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts communication facilitated by Kitex between a client and a server (or between two services) to eavesdrop on sensitive data or modify requests and responses. This is possible if the Kitex communication channel is not encrypted.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the network. Manipulation of requests and responses, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data corruption.

**Affected Kitex Component:** RPC Transport Layer

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Enforce TLS encryption for all RPC communication configured through Kitex.
*   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication within Kitex.
*   Ensure proper certificate management and validation for Kitex's TLS configuration.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_middleware.md)

**Description:** Developers might introduce security flaws in custom middleware integrated with Kitex, used for authentication, authorization, logging, or other cross-cutting concerns. These vulnerabilities could be exploited to bypass security controls or gain unauthorized access within the Kitex application.

**Impact:** Bypassing authentication or authorization, leading to unauthorized access to resources or data managed by the Kitex service.

**Affected Kitex Component:** Kitex Middleware

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Conduct thorough security reviews and testing of custom middleware integrated with Kitex.
*   Follow secure coding practices when developing Kitex middleware.
*   Avoid storing sensitive information in logs within Kitex middleware or ensure proper sanitization and encryption.
*   Leverage existing, well-vetted middleware libraries where possible within the Kitex framework.

## Threat: [Compromised Code Generation Tools](./threats/compromised_code_generation_tools.md)

**Description:** If the Kitex code generation tools or their dependencies are compromised, they could inject malicious code into the generated service implementations.

**Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities into the application during the build process, potentially leading to remote code execution or other malicious activities within the Kitex service.

**Affected Kitex Component:** Kitex Code Generator, Build Process

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Obtain Kitex and its dependencies from trusted sources.
*   Verify the integrity of downloaded binaries using checksums or signatures.
*   Secure the build environment and restrict access to Kitex code generation tools.
*   Regularly scan the build environment for malware.
