**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit LazyGit's Interaction with Git Repository -> [CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious Code via Git Hooks:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker aims to inject and execute malicious code by manipulating Git hooks. Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, etc.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   **Compromise Developer Machine:** The attacker gains access to a developer's machine that has write access to the shared Git repository. They then modify a hook script (e.g., `pre-commit`, `post-receive`) within the `.git/hooks` directory. This script now contains malicious code.
        *   **Influence Git Operations:** The attacker influences the application's Git operations to target a repository they control or have compromised. This repository contains malicious hooks. When the application performs Git operations on this repository, the malicious hooks are triggered.
        *   **Automatic Execution:** The application automatically executes Git commands (e.g., `git pull`, `git push`) as part of its functionality. This execution triggers the modified hook script, leading to the execution of the attacker's malicious code on the server or application host.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful execution allows the attacker to run arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application's Git commands, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit LazyGit's Custom Command Functionality -> [CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious Commands via Custom LazyGit Configuration:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages LazyGit's ability to define custom commands to inject and execute malicious commands.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   **Modify Configuration:** If the application allows users to configure custom LazyGit commands or reads configuration from untrusted sources, the attacker modifies the LazyGit configuration file (typically `.gitconfig` or a project-specific configuration). They add a custom command definition that executes malicious commands. For example, they might define a custom command `!rm -rf /`.
        *   **Trigger Execution:** The application then uses this custom command through LazyGit's interface or by programmatically invoking LazyGit with the custom command.
    *   **Impact:** Successful execution allows the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the server or application host with the privileges of the user running LazyGit.

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit LazyGit's Interaction with External Tools -> [CRITICAL NODE] Command Injection via External Tool Integration:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how LazyGit interacts with external tools (like diff or merge tools) to inject and execute malicious commands.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   **Identify Integration Points:** The attacker identifies points where the application uses LazyGit features that integrate with external tools.
        *   **Craft Malicious Input:** The attacker crafts specific input (e.g., specially crafted filenames, commit messages, or diff content) that, when passed to the external tool by LazyGit, is interpreted as a command. For example, a filename containing backticks or shell metacharacters might be used.
        *   **Trigger Execution:** When the application triggers the integration with the external tool using the attacker-controlled input, LazyGit passes this input to the external tool without proper sanitization. The external tool then executes the injected command.
    *   **Impact:** Successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server or application host with the privileges of the user running the external tool.

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Information Disclosure via LazyGit Output -> Leak Sensitive Information in LazyGit's Output:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits the application's failure to sanitize LazyGit's output, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   **Sensitive Information in Output:** LazyGit's output (e.g., from `git log`, `git diff`, error messages) might inadvertently contain sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, internal paths, or other confidential data. This could be due to developers accidentally committing secrets or the nature of the information being displayed.
        *   **Exposed Output:** The application exposes this output to users (e.g., in a web interface, logs, error messages displayed to the user) without proper sanitization or filtering.
        *   **Information Access:** The attacker gains access to this exposed output and retrieves the sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful exploitation leads to the disclosure of sensitive information, which can be used for further attacks, unauthorized access, or data breaches.
