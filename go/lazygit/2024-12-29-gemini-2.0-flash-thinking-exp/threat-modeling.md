### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving LazyGit

This list focuses on high and critical severity threats that are directly introduced or facilitated by the LazyGit application itself.

*   **Threat:** Arbitrary Command Execution via Malicious Git Configuration Triggered by LazyGit
    *   **Description:** While the malicious Git configuration (in `.gitconfig`) is the initial vulnerability, LazyGit's execution of Git commands can trigger these malicious configurations (e.g., via aliases). An attacker could craft a malicious `.gitconfig` that, when a specific Git command is executed by LazyGit, runs arbitrary commands on the user's system.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data exfiltration, installation of malware, denial of service.
    *   **Affected LazyGit Component:** Git Command Execution Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust sanitization and validation of Git commands before execution, even when those commands are seemingly standard Git operations. Warn users about the potential dangers of untrusted Git configurations and consider providing mechanisms to inspect or bypass aliases when executing commands.
        *   **Users:** Exercise extreme caution when cloning or working with repositories from untrusted sources, as they might contain malicious `.gitconfig` files. Regularly review their global and local `.gitconfig` files for unexpected or suspicious entries.

*   **Threat:** Arbitrary Command Execution via Malicious Git Hooks Triggered by LazyGit Actions
    *   **Description:** Similar to the configuration threat, the malicious Git hooks reside within the repository. However, LazyGit's actions (like committing, pushing, etc.) can trigger these hooks. An attacker could introduce malicious scripts into `.git/hooks` that are executed with the user's privileges when LazyGit performs certain Git operations.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data exfiltration, installation of malware, denial of service.
    *   **Affected LazyGit Component:** Git Command Execution Module (specifically when triggering Git lifecycle events).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement warnings to users about the presence of local Git hooks before performing actions that might trigger them. Consider providing options to inspect the contents of local hooks or to temporarily disable them.
        *   **Users:** Be highly suspicious of repositories from untrusted sources. Always review the contents of the `.git/hooks` directory before performing actions with LazyGit. Avoid working with repositories that contain untrusted or unknown Git hooks.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information Directly Through LazyGit's User Interface
    *   **Description:** LazyGit directly renders information from the Git repository, including file contents, commit messages, and diffs. If a repository inadvertently contains sensitive information (like API keys, passwords, or other secrets), LazyGit will display this information in its UI, making it potentially visible to anyone viewing the screen or through screen sharing/recording.
    *   **Impact:** Leakage of credentials, API keys, intellectual property, or other confidential data.
    *   **Affected LazyGit Component:** User Interface Rendering Module (specifically components displaying file contents, commit details, and diffs).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Provide options to redact or mask potentially sensitive information in the UI based on configurable patterns or file extensions. Implement warnings when displaying files or commits that are likely to contain sensitive data.
        *   **Users:** Be extremely cautious about the content of repositories they are working with in LazyGit. Avoid displaying sensitive information in public or insecure environments. Utilize tools and practices to prevent the accidental inclusion of secrets in the repository.
