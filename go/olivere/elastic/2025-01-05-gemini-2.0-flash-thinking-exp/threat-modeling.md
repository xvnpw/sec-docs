# Threat Model Analysis for olivere/elastic

## Threat: [Plaintext Communication](./threats/plaintext_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could eavesdrop on network traffic between the application and Elasticsearch to intercept sensitive data like queries, data, or credentials. This occurs because the `olivere/elastic` client is not configured to use secure communication (HTTPS/TLS).
    *   **Impact:** Confidential data can be exposed, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Client` component, specifically the connection setup and transport layer within `olivere/elastic`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS/HTTPS by configuring the `Transport` option in the `elastic.Client` to use `https`.
        *   Ensure proper certificate verification is enabled within the `olivere/elastic` client configuration to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Threat: [Insecure Credentials Management](./threats/insecure_credentials_management.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could gain access to Elasticsearch credentials if they are stored insecurely in the application and then used by the `olivere/elastic` client to connect. This allows them to impersonate the application and access or manipulate Elasticsearch data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Elasticsearch data, potential data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Client` component, specifically the authentication configuration functions within `olivere/elastic` (`SetBasicAuth`, `SetAPIKey`, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the application code that interacts with `olivere/elastic`.
        *   Use secure methods for providing credentials to the `olivere/elastic` client, such as environment variables or secure secrets management tools.

## Threat: [Insufficient Authentication](./threats/insufficient_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch cluster if the `olivere/elastic` client is configured to connect with weak or default credentials. They could exploit these weak credentials to perform any action the authenticated user is permitted through the `olivere/elastic` client.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Elasticsearch data, potential data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Client` component, specifically the authentication configuration functions within `olivere/elastic` (`SetBasicAuth`, `SetAPIKey`, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, unique credentials when configuring authentication for the `olivere/elastic` client.
        *   Regularly rotate Elasticsearch credentials used by the `olivere/elastic` client.

## Threat: [Query Injection](./threats/query_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate user input that is directly incorporated into Elasticsearch queries constructed using `olivere/elastic` without proper sanitization. They could craft malicious query clauses to retrieve unauthorized data, modify data, or even delete indices through the `olivere/elastic` client.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, data deletion, and potential disruption of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Functions within `olivere/elastic` used to build and execute queries (e.g., `Search`, `Get`, `Update`, `Delete` and their associated builders like `Query`, `BoolQuery`, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize and validate user input before using it to construct Elasticsearch queries with `olivere/elastic`.
        *   Prefer using parameterized queries or the `olivere/elastic` query builder with its built-in escaping mechanisms to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Avoid string concatenation for building queries directly from user input when using `olivere/elastic`.

## Threat: [Excessive Permissions](./threats/excessive_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who compromises the application could gain access to Elasticsearch with overly broad permissions if the credentials used by the `olivere/elastic` client have more privileges than necessary. This allows them to perform actions beyond the application's intended scope through the `olivere/elastic` client.
    *   **Impact:** Increased potential for damage in case of a compromise, including unauthorized data access, modification, deletion, and cluster management.
    *   **Affected Component:** The authenticated user configured within the `olivere/elastic` `Client` component and the permissions associated with that user in Elasticsearch.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege by granting the Elasticsearch user used by the `olivere/elastic` client only the necessary permissions for the application's specific functions.
        *   Regularly review and audit the permissions assigned to the Elasticsearch user used by the `olivere/elastic` client.
