## Attack Tree Path: [***Compromise Application via olivere/elastic*** (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_olivereelastic__critical_node_.md)

This represents the attacker's ultimate goal. Success means gaining unauthorized access to application data or functionality by exploiting weaknesses related to the `olivere/elastic` library.

## Attack Tree Path: [***Exploit Insecure Connection Handling*** (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_connection_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities related to how the application establishes and maintains connections with the Elasticsearch server.

## Attack Tree Path: [*****Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack*** (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker intercepts communication between the application and Elasticsearch. This is possible if:
*   The application does not enforce TLS/SSL encryption for communication with Elasticsearch.
*   The application does not properly verify the Elasticsearch server's TLS/SSL certificate, allowing the attacker to impersonate the server.
**Potential Impact:**  The attacker can eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted (queries and responses), modify queries to retrieve unauthorized information, or even inject malicious queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [*****Credential Theft*** (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/credential_theft__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker gains access to the credentials used by the application to authenticate with Elasticsearch. This can occur if:
*   Credentials are stored insecurely in application configuration files (e.g., plaintext or weakly encrypted).
*   Credentials are hardcoded directly into the application's source code.
*   Credentials are inadvertently exposed in application logs.
*   Credentials are leaked through other vulnerabilities in the application (e.g., SQL Injection in a different part of the application).
**Potential Impact:**  With valid credentials, the attacker can directly access and manipulate data within Elasticsearch, bypassing application-level security controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [***Exploit Elasticsearch Injection Vulnerabilities*** (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_elasticsearch_injection_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This path centers on the ability of an attacker to inject malicious code into Elasticsearch queries executed by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [*****Unsanitized User Input in Query Parameters*** (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/unsanitized_user_input_in_query_parameters__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application directly incorporates user-provided data into Elasticsearch queries without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary Elasticsearch query syntax.
**Potential Impact:**  The attacker can retrieve more data than intended, modify or delete data, or even perform actions outside the intended scope of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [*****Exploiting Query DSL Features for Malicious Purposes (e.g., script queries)*** (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_query_dsl_features_for_malicious_purposes__e_g___script_queries___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application allows the execution of Elasticsearch script queries, and an attacker can inject malicious scripts. This often occurs when user input influences the script parameters or the script itself is dynamically generated without proper validation.
**Potential Impact:**  This can lead to *****Execute Arbitrary Code on Elasticsearch*** (Critical Node), allowing the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the Elasticsearch server's underlying operating system.

## Attack Tree Path: [*****Execute Arbitrary Code on Elasticsearch*** (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_elasticsearch__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Achieved primarily through successful Elasticsearch Injection, particularly by exploiting script queries.
**Potential Impact:**  This grants the attacker complete control over the Elasticsearch server. They can:
*   Gain direct access to all data stored in Elasticsearch, potentially including sensitive application data.
*   Modify or delete data within Elasticsearch.
*   Disrupt the Elasticsearch service, leading to a denial of service for the application.
*   Potentially pivot to other systems if the Elasticsearch server has network access.
