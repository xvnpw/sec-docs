# Attack Surface Analysis for olivere/elastic

## Attack Surface: [Hardcoded Elasticsearch Credentials in Connection String](./attack_surfaces/hardcoded_elasticsearch_credentials_in_connection_string.md)

**Description:** The Elasticsearch connection string, including sensitive credentials (username and password), is directly embedded in the application's source code or configuration files without proper encryption or secure storage.

**How Elastic Contributes:** The `olivere/elastic` library requires connection details to initialize the client. If these details are hardcoded, they become easily accessible.

**Example:**  `client, err := elastic.NewClient(elastic.SetURL("https://user:password@localhost:9200"))` within the application code.

**Impact:**  Full compromise of the Elasticsearch cluster. Attackers can read, modify, or delete any data, and potentially disrupt service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use Environment Variables: Store credentials in environment variables and access them programmatically.
* Utilize Secrets Management Systems: Employ dedicated secrets management tools like HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider secrets managers.
* Encrypt Configuration Files: If storing credentials in configuration files is necessary, encrypt them securely.
* Avoid Storing Credentials Directly in Code: Never hardcode credentials directly in the source code.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Transport Protocol (HTTP) for Elasticsearch Connection](./attack_surfaces/insecure_transport_protocol__http__for_elasticsearch_connection.md)

**Description:** The application is configured to connect to Elasticsearch over `http` instead of `https`.

**How Elastic Contributes:** The `olivere/elastic` library allows specifying the connection protocol in the client configuration.

**Example:** `client, err := elastic.NewClient(elastic.SetURL("http://localhost:9200"))`

**Impact:**  Credentials and data exchanged between the application and Elasticsearch are transmitted in plain text, vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always Use HTTPS: Configure the `olivere/elastic` client to use `https` for all connections.
* Enforce TLS/SSL on Elasticsearch: Ensure the Elasticsearch cluster itself is configured to use TLS/SSL.

## Attack Surface: [Elasticsearch DSL Injection](./attack_surfaces/elasticsearch_dsl_injection.md)

**Description:** User-provided input is directly incorporated into Elasticsearch queries constructed using the `olivere/elastic` library without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**How Elastic Contributes:** The `olivere/elastic` library provides methods for building complex queries programmatically. Improper use can lead to vulnerabilities if user input is directly injected into the query structure.

**Example:**  Constructing a search query like: `client.Search().Index("my_index").QueryStringQuery("field1:" + userInput)` where `userInput` comes directly from a user. An attacker could input `value1 OR _exists_:field2` to bypass intended filtering.

**Impact:**
* Data Exfiltration: Attackers can craft queries to retrieve sensitive data they should not have access to.
* Data Modification/Deletion: Malicious queries can update or delete data within Elasticsearch.
* Denial of Service: Complex or resource-intensive injected queries can overload the Elasticsearch cluster.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use Parameterized Queries (if available, though less direct in Elasticsearch DSL):  While not direct parameters in the SQL sense, use the library's query builders to construct queries programmatically, avoiding string concatenation of user input.
* Sanitize User Input:  Carefully validate and sanitize all user-provided input before using it in queries. Implement whitelisting of allowed characters and patterns.
* Use Specific Query Types: Leverage specific query types provided by `olivere/elastic` (e.g., `TermQuery`, `MatchQuery`) with properly escaped or parameterized values instead of raw string queries where possible.
* Principle of Least Privilege for Queries: Ensure the application's Elasticsearch user has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended queries.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Authentication/Authorization on Elasticsearch Connection](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_authenticationauthorization_on_elasticsearch_connection.md)

**Description:** The application connects to Elasticsearch with overly permissive credentials or roles.

**How Elastic Contributes:** The `olivere/elastic` library uses the provided credentials to authenticate with Elasticsearch. If these credentials have excessive permissions, the application (and potentially an attacker compromising it) can perform unauthorized actions.

**Example:** Connecting with the `elastic` superuser account for all application interactions.

**Impact:**  Attackers gaining access through the application's Elasticsearch connection can perform any action on the cluster, including reading, modifying, or deleting data, and potentially disrupting service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Principle of Least Privilege: Create dedicated Elasticsearch users with specific roles and permissions tailored to the application's needs.
* Regularly Review Permissions: Periodically review and adjust the permissions of the application's Elasticsearch user.

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Administrative Actions via `olivere/elastic`](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_administrative_actions_via__olivereelastic_.md)

**Description:** The application exposes endpoints that utilize `olivere/elastic` for administrative tasks on the Elasticsearch cluster without proper authentication and authorization.

**How Elastic Contributes:** The `olivere/elastic` library can be used to perform administrative tasks like creating/deleting indices, managing mappings, etc. If these functionalities are exposed without protection, they become attack vectors.

**Example:** An API endpoint that allows users to create new Elasticsearch indices using the `olivere/elastic` client without proper authentication.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized users can manipulate the Elasticsearch cluster's structure and configuration, potentially leading to data loss, service disruption, or security breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization: Secure administrative endpoints with robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) and enforce authorization to restrict access to authorized users only.
* Separate Administrative Functionality: Isolate administrative functionalities from regular user interactions and implement strict access controls.
* Principle of Least Privilege for Administrative Actions: Ensure the credentials used for administrative actions have only the necessary privileges.
