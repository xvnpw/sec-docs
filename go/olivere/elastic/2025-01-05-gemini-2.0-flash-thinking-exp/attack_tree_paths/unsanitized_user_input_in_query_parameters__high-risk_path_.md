## Deep Analysis: Unsanitized User Input in Query Parameters (High-Risk Path)

This analysis delves into the attack tree path "Unsanitized User Input in Query Parameters" for an application utilizing the `olivere/elastic` Go library. We will explore the technical details, potential impacts, mitigation strategies, and detection methods for this high-risk vulnerability.

**1. Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Vector:**

The core issue lies in the application's failure to properly sanitize or escape user-provided data before incorporating it directly into Elasticsearch query parameters. This means an attacker can manipulate the intended query logic by injecting malicious Elasticsearch syntax.

**How it Works with `olivere/elastic`:**

The `olivere/elastic` library provides various ways to construct Elasticsearch queries. The vulnerability arises when developers use string concatenation or formatting techniques to build queries using user input directly, instead of leveraging the library's built-in query builders and parameterization features.

**Example of Vulnerable Code:**

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/olivere/elastic/v7"
)

func searchHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	queryParam := r.URL.Query().Get("q")

	// Vulnerable code: Directly embedding user input
	queryString := fmt.Sprintf(`{"query": {"query_string": {"query": "%s"}}}`, queryParam)

	client, err := elastic.NewClient()
	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, "Error connecting to Elasticsearch", http.StatusInternalServerError)
		log.Println(err)
		return
	}

	res, err := client.Search().
		Index("my_index").
		Source(queryString). // Directly using the unsanitized string
		Do(context.Background())

	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, "Error executing search", http.StatusInternalServerError)
		log.Println(err)
		return
	}

	// Process and return results (omitted for brevity)
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Search results: %d hits\n", res.Hits.TotalHits.Value)
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/search", searchHandler)
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

In this example, the `queryParam` from the URL is directly inserted into the `queryString`. An attacker could provide a malicious value for `q` to manipulate the query.

**2. Exploitation Scenarios and Potential Impact:**

The ability to inject arbitrary Elasticsearch query syntax opens up a wide range of potential attacks:

* **Data Exfiltration (Reading Unauthorized Data):**
    * **Injecting `match_all` with `size`:** An attacker could provide `q: "*"` to retrieve all documents in the index, bypassing intended search filtering.
    * **Using `_source` filtering:** They could manipulate the `_source` field to retrieve specific fields they shouldn't have access to.
    * **Exploiting scripting capabilities (if enabled):**  If scripting is enabled in Elasticsearch, attackers could inject scripts to extract sensitive data.

    **Example Attack Payload:** `?q=*`

* **Data Modification or Deletion:**
    * **Using `delete_by_query`:**  If the Elasticsearch user has delete permissions, an attacker could craft a query to delete specific or all documents.

    **Example Attack Payload:** `?q=*&_source=false&script=ctx._source.remove('sensitive_field')` (This example attempts to remove a field, assuming scripting is enabled and the user has necessary permissions). A more direct deletion payload would involve manipulating the query to target specific documents for deletion using `delete_by_query` API.

* **Resource Exhaustion and Denial of Service (DoS):**
    * **Crafting computationally expensive queries:** Attackers can inject complex queries that consume significant Elasticsearch resources, potentially leading to a denial of service.
    * **Using wildcard queries on unanalyzed fields:** This can be very resource-intensive.

    **Example Attack Payload:** `?q=field1:* AND field2:* AND field3:* ...` (with many wildcard fields)

* **Privilege Escalation (Less Likely but Possible):**
    * In highly specific scenarios where the application interacts with Elasticsearch in a complex manner and the Elasticsearch user has excessive permissions, it might be theoretically possible to leverage injected queries to perform actions beyond the application's intended scope. This is less common but worth noting.

**3. Mitigation Strategies:**

Preventing this vulnerability requires a multi-layered approach focused on secure query construction and input validation:

* **Parameterized Queries and Query Builders:** The primary defense is to **never directly embed user input into query strings.** Instead, leverage the `olivere/elastic` library's robust query builder API. This allows you to construct queries programmatically, treating user input as data rather than code.

    **Example of Secure Code using Query Builders:**

    ```go
    package main

    import (
    	"context"
    	"fmt"
    	"log"
    	"net/http"

    	"github.com/olivere/elastic/v7"
    )

    func searchHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    	queryParam := r.URL.Query().Get("q")

    	client, err := elastic.NewClient()
    	if err != nil {
    		http.Error(w, "Error connecting to Elasticsearch", http.StatusInternalServerError)
    		log.Println(err)
    		return
    	}

    	// Secure code: Using Query Builders
    	query := elastic.NewQueryStringQuery(queryParam)

    	res, err := client.Search().
    		Index("my_index").
    		Query(query). // Using the constructed query object
    		Do(context.Background())

    	if err != nil {
    		http.Error(w, "Error executing search", http.StatusInternalServerError)
    		log.Println(err)
    		return
    	}

    	// Process and return results (omitted for brevity)
    	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Search results: %d hits\n", res.Hits.TotalHits.Value)
    }

    func main() {
    	http.HandleFunc("/search", searchHandler)
    	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
    }
    ```

    The `elastic.NewQueryStringQuery(queryParam)` function will properly escape and handle the user input, preventing direct injection of arbitrary Elasticsearch syntax. Consider using more specific query types like `elastic.NewMatchQuery` or `elastic.NewTermQuery` for more controlled searching.

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  While query builders are the primary defense, validating and sanitizing user input provides an additional layer of security.
    * **Whitelist acceptable characters and patterns:**  Define what characters and patterns are allowed in the user input. Reject or escape anything outside this whitelist.
    * **Limit the scope of user-provided data:**  Instead of allowing free-form queries, offer specific search fields and options that the user can interact with.
    * **Consider using a dedicated sanitization library:**  While `olivere/elastic` handles escaping when using query builders, general input validation can benefit from dedicated libraries.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the Elasticsearch user account used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended tasks. Avoid granting overly broad permissions like `all` or `manage_index`.

* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify potential instances of unsanitized user input in query construction.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious requests attempting to inject Elasticsearch syntax. Configure the WAF with rules that look for common Elasticsearch query keywords and patterns in request parameters.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not directly related to this vulnerability, a strong CSP can help mitigate the impact of other potential attacks.

**4. Detection Methods:**

Identifying this vulnerability requires a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques:

* **Static Code Analysis:** Use static analysis tools that can identify potential instances where user input is directly incorporated into strings used for Elasticsearch queries. Look for patterns like string concatenation or formatting with user-provided data.

* **Dynamic Analysis and Penetration Testing:**  Perform penetration testing by attempting to inject various Elasticsearch query syntax into the application's search parameters. Common payloads to try include:
    * `*` (match all)
    * `_source:false` (hide source fields)
    * `OR true` (logical OR injection)
    * Malicious scripts (if scripting is enabled)

* **Code Reviews:** Manual code reviews are crucial for identifying subtle instances of this vulnerability that automated tools might miss. Focus on sections of the code that handle user input and interact with the `olivere/elastic` library.

* **Logging and Monitoring:** Monitor Elasticsearch logs for unusual or unexpected query patterns. Look for queries containing suspicious keywords or syntax that might indicate an attempted injection.

**5. Real-World Examples (Conceptual):**

While specific publicly disclosed vulnerabilities directly related to `olivere/elastic` and unsanitized input might be less common due to the library's design encouraging safe practices, similar vulnerabilities are prevalent in web applications interacting with databases in general (e.g., SQL Injection). Imagine a scenario where an e-commerce site allows users to search products. If the search term is directly embedded into an Elasticsearch query, an attacker could manipulate the query to retrieve all product data, including sensitive pricing or inventory information.

**Conclusion:**

The "Unsanitized User Input in Query Parameters" attack path is a significant security risk for applications using `olivere/elastic`. Failing to properly sanitize user input can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service. By adopting secure coding practices, primarily utilizing the library's query builders, and implementing robust input validation, development teams can effectively mitigate this vulnerability and ensure the security and integrity of their applications and data. Regular security assessments and code reviews are essential to proactively identify and address potential weaknesses.
