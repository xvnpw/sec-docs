# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for olivere/elastic

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries via `olivere/elastic` Query Builders](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries_via__olivereelastic__query_builders.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify User Input Points:** Pinpoint all locations in your Go code where user-provided data is intended to be used within Elasticsearch queries constructed using `olivere/elastic`.
2.  **Utilize `olivere/elastic` Query Builders:**  Instead of manually constructing query strings by concatenating user input, leverage the query builder functions provided by `olivere/elastic`.  This includes functions like `elastic.TermQuery()`, `elastic.MatchQuery()`, `elastic.RangeQuery()`, `elastic.BoolQuery()`, and many others.
3.  **Pass User Input as Arguments:**  When using these query builder functions, pass the user-provided data as arguments to the functions. `olivere/elastic` will handle the proper parameterization and escaping internally.
4.  **Example:** Instead of:
    ```go
    query := fmt.Sprintf(`{"query": {"term": {"field": "%s"}}}`, userInput) // Vulnerable
    ```
    Use:
    ```go
    query := elastic.NewTermQuery("field", userInput) // Parameterized - Secure
    ```
5.  **Apply to All Query Types:** Ensure this approach is consistently applied across all query types used in your application where user input is involved, including searches, aggregations, and filters.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Elasticsearch Injection (High Severity):**  Malicious users could inject arbitrary Elasticsearch query syntax if user input is directly embedded into query strings. Parameterized queries prevent this by separating query structure from data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Elasticsearch Injection (High Impact):** Effectively eliminates the risk of Elasticsearch injection vulnerabilities arising from query construction within the application using `olivere/elastic`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in the product catalog module for basic keyword searches using `elastic.MatchQuery`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Not consistently applied in more complex search functionalities, reporting module query construction, and data aggregation logic where queries might be built dynamically based on user selections.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Timeouts using `olivere/elastic` Context Handling](./mitigation_strategies/query_timeouts_using__olivereelastic__context_handling.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Import `context` Package:** Ensure you are importing the `context` package in your Go files where you are using `olivere/elastic`.
2.  **Create Context with Timeout:** Before executing any Elasticsearch operation using `olivere/elastic` (e.g., `client.Search()...Do(ctx)`), create a `context.Context` with a timeout using `context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), timeoutDuration)`.
3.  **Pass Context to `Do()` Method:** Pass this context to the `Do(ctx)` method of your `olivere/elastic` operations. This will ensure that the operation is cancelled if it exceeds the specified timeout duration.
4.  **Example:**
    ```go
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second) // 5-second timeout
    defer cancel() // Important to release resources

    res, err := client.Search().
        Index("my_index").
        Query(elastic.NewMatchAllQuery()).
        Do(ctx) // Pass the context here

    if err == context.DeadlineExceeded {
        // Handle timeout error - query took too long
        fmt.Println("Elasticsearch query timed out")
    } else if err != nil {
        // Handle other errors
        fmt.Println("Elasticsearch query error:", err)
    }
    ```
5.  **Configure Appropriate Timeouts:**  Determine reasonable timeout durations for different Elasticsearch operations based on expected query complexity and performance requirements.
6.  **Handle Timeout Errors:** Implement error handling to gracefully manage `context.DeadlineExceeded` errors, indicating that a query timed out.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Queries (High Severity):** Prevents excessively long-running or stuck queries from consuming Elasticsearch resources indefinitely and potentially causing service degradation or outage.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Queries (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks caused by resource exhaustion from runaway queries initiated through `olivere/elastic`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Timeouts are generally configured for HTTP client connections used by `olivere/elastic`, but explicit context-based timeouts are not consistently applied to individual Elasticsearch operations throughout the application.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Context-based timeouts using `context.WithTimeout` are not systematically implemented for all `olivere/elastic` operations, especially in background tasks, reporting queries, and less frequently used functionalities.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Connection via `olivere/elastic` HTTPS Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_connection_via__olivereelastic__https_configuration.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Use HTTPS URLs:** When creating a new `elastic.Client` in your Go code, ensure that the Elasticsearch endpoint URLs provided in the `elastic.SetURL()` option (or environment variables) start with `https://` instead of `http://`.
2.  **Example:**
    ```go
    client, err := elastic.NewClient(
        elastic.SetURL("https://your-elasticsearch-host:9200"), // Use HTTPS
        // ... other options ...
    )
    ```
3.  **TLS Configuration (Optional but Recommended):** For more advanced TLS configuration (e.g., custom certificates, certificate pinning), you can use `elastic.SetHttpClient()` option and configure the underlying `http.Client`'s `Transport` field with custom TLS settings. However, for most cases, simply using `https://` URLs is sufficient if Elasticsearch is properly configured with TLS.
4.  **Verify Elasticsearch TLS Setup:** Ensure that TLS/HTTPS is correctly configured and enabled on your Elasticsearch cluster itself.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and reading sensitive data transmitted between the application and Elasticsearch over the network.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Protects against attackers intercepting and manipulating communication between the application and Elasticsearch.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eavesdropping (High Impact):** Effectively prevents eavesdropping on network traffic between the application and Elasticsearch when using `olivere/elastic`.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Impact):** Provides strong protection against MitM attacks on the communication channel facilitated by `olivere/elastic`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** `olivere/elastic` client is configured to use HTTPS URLs for connecting to Elasticsearch in production environments.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  While HTTPS is used, more advanced TLS configurations (like certificate pinning or custom certificate handling via `elastic.SetHttpClient()`) are not implemented.  Configuration might not be consistently enforced across all environments (e.g., development, staging).
