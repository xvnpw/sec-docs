## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Insecure Configuration leading to Data Breach](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_insecure_configuration_leading_to_data_breach.md)

* T1.1: Hardcoded Credentials **(Critical Node)**
    * Attack Vector: Attacker discovers Elasticsearch credentials directly embedded in the application's source code or configuration files.
    * Likelihood: High
    * Impact: Critical (Full, unrestricted access to the Elasticsearch cluster and its data).
    * Effort: Low (Simple code or configuration review).
    * Skill Level: Basic.
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Requires code review or static analysis).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Insecure Configuration potentially leading to Query Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_insecure_configuration_potentially_leading_to_query_injection.md)

* T1.1: Hardcoded Credentials **(Critical Node)**
    * Attack Vector: As described above, gaining initial access through hardcoded credentials. This access could then be used to modify application code or configuration related to query construction, potentially bypassing input sanitization.
    * Likelihood: High (for credential compromise)
    * Impact: High (Ability to manipulate queries leading to data breach or DoS).
    * Effort: Low (initial access), Medium (for code/config manipulation).
    * Skill Level: Basic (initial access), Intermediate (for manipulation).
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium (initial access), Hard (for subsequent manipulation).
* T2.1: Elasticsearch Query Injection **(Critical Node)**
    * Attack Vector: After potentially gaining access or identifying vulnerable code, the attacker crafts malicious input that is not properly sanitized and is directly incorporated into an Elasticsearch query. This allows them to execute arbitrary Elasticsearch commands.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High (Ability to read, modify, or delete data in Elasticsearch, potentially leading to application compromise or denial of service).
    * Effort: Medium (Requires understanding of Elasticsearch query syntax and application logic).
    * Skill Level: Intermediate.
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Requires careful logging and analysis of Elasticsearch queries).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Lack of Input Sanitization leading to Data Breach/DoS](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_lack_of_input_sanitization_leading_to_data_breachdos.md)

* T2.1: Elasticsearch Query Injection **(Critical Node)**
    * Attack Vector: The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input before using it in Elasticsearch queries. An attacker can inject malicious query fragments to extract sensitive data, modify existing data, or overload the Elasticsearch cluster, causing a denial of service.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High (Data breach, data manipulation, or application unavailability).
    * Effort: Medium (Requires understanding of Elasticsearch query syntax and application logic).
    * Skill Level: Intermediate.
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Requires careful logging and analysis of Elasticsearch queries).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Outdated Dependencies leading to Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_outdated_dependencies_leading_to_exploitation.md)

* T4.1: Using Outdated Version with Known Vulnerabilities **(Critical Node)**
    * Attack Vector: The application uses an outdated version of the `olivere/elastic` library or one of its dependencies that has publicly known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but can be Critical (including remote code execution).
    * Effort: Low (Identifying known vulnerabilities is often automated).
    * Skill Level: Basic (Exploiting known vulnerabilities may require more skill depending on the specific case).
    * Detection Difficulty: Easy (Vulnerability scanners can easily identify outdated libraries with known vulnerabilities).
