### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Elasticsearch Query Injection

**Attack Tree Node:** T2.1: Elasticsearch Query Injection **(Critical Node)**

**Description:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input before using it in Elasticsearch queries. An attacker can inject malicious query fragments to extract sensitive data, modify existing data, or overload the Elasticsearch cluster, causing a denial of service.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

* **Attack Vector Mechanics:**
    * **Unsanitized Input:** The core of this vulnerability lies in directly incorporating user-supplied data (e.g., from web forms, API requests, or other input sources) into Elasticsearch query strings or query DSL structures without proper validation or escaping.
    * **Exploiting Elasticsearch Query Syntax:** Attackers leverage their understanding of Elasticsearch's query syntax (using the Query DSL) to inject malicious clauses. This can involve:
        * **Logical Operators:** Injecting `OR` or `AND` conditions to bypass intended filtering or access data they shouldn't. For example, if a query is intended to fetch only the user's own data, an attacker might inject `OR user_id != 'current_user_id'` to retrieve data from other users.
        * **Scripting:**  Elasticsearch allows scripting (e.g., Painless). If user input is directly used in script parameters or within the script itself without sanitization, attackers can execute arbitrary code within the Elasticsearch context.
        * **Aggregation Manipulation:** Injecting malicious aggregations to extract sensitive data that wouldn't normally be returned by the application.
        * **`match_all` or similar:** Injecting clauses that effectively bypass intended filtering and return all data.
        * **`delete_by_query` or `update_by_query`:**  In cases where the application allows for data modification based on user input, attackers could inject queries to delete or modify arbitrary data.
        * **Resource Exhaustion:** Crafting complex or inefficient queries that consume excessive resources on the Elasticsearch cluster, leading to a denial of service. This could involve deeply nested queries, large aggregations, or wildcard queries on large text fields.

* **Likelihood (Medium):**
    * While not as prevalent as basic SQL injection in web applications, Elasticsearch Query Injection is a significant risk, especially in applications that heavily rely on user input for search and filtering functionalities.
    * Developers might not be fully aware of the potential for injection vulnerabilities within the Elasticsearch query context.
    * The `olivere/elastic` library provides tools for building queries programmatically, which can help prevent injection if used correctly. However, if developers construct query strings manually or directly embed unsanitized input into the query DSL, the risk remains.

* **Impact (High):**
    * **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive data by manipulating queries to bypass access controls or retrieve information they are not authorized to see. This could include personal information, financial data, or confidential business data.
    * **Data Manipulation:**  If the application allows for data modification based on user input in queries, attackers can inject malicious queries to alter or delete data, leading to data corruption or loss.
    * **Application Unavailability (DoS):** By injecting resource-intensive queries, attackers can overload the Elasticsearch cluster, causing it to become unresponsive and rendering the application unusable. This can severely impact business operations and user experience.

* **Effort (Medium):**
    * Requires a good understanding of Elasticsearch query syntax and the application's logic for constructing queries.
    * Attackers need to identify the specific input fields that are used in Elasticsearch queries and experiment with different injection techniques.
    * Tools and techniques for analyzing network traffic and application behavior can aid in identifying vulnerable endpoints.

* **Skill Level (Intermediate):**
    * Requires more than basic web application hacking skills. Attackers need to understand the nuances of Elasticsearch queries and how the application interacts with the Elasticsearch cluster.
    * Familiarity with Elasticsearch's Query DSL and scripting capabilities is beneficial.

* **Detection Difficulty (Medium):**
    * **Challenges:**  Identifying malicious queries within a large volume of legitimate Elasticsearch traffic can be challenging. Simple pattern matching might not be sufficient, as attackers can obfuscate their payloads.
    * **Potential Detection Methods:**
        * **Logging and Analysis of Elasticsearch Queries:**  Detailed logging of all queries sent to Elasticsearch is crucial. Analyzing these logs for unusual patterns, unexpected keywords (like `delete_by_query` when not intended), or excessively long or complex queries can help detect attacks.
        * **Anomaly Detection:** Implementing anomaly detection systems that monitor query patterns and flag deviations from normal behavior.
        * **Input Validation and Sanitization on the Application Side:**  While primarily a preventative measure, robust input validation can also aid in detecting attempts to inject malicious code.
        * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:** Integrating Elasticsearch logs with a SIEM system can provide a centralized platform for analysis and correlation of security events.

**Example Scenario:**

Consider an e-commerce application where users can search for products. The application might construct an Elasticsearch query like this using the `olivere/elastic` library:

```go
query := elastic.NewBoolQuery().
    Must(elastic.NewMatchQuery("product_name", userInput)).
    Filter(elastic.NewTermQuery("category", categoryFilter))

searchResult, err := client.Search().
    Index("products").
    Query(query).
    Do(ctx)
```

If `userInput` is taken directly from the user without sanitization, an attacker could input something like: `" OR category: "malicious"`. This would result in the following Elasticsearch query (simplified):

```json
{
  "bool": {
    "must": {
      "match": {
        "product_name": "\" OR category: \\\"malicious\\\""
      }
    },
    "filter": {
      "term": {
        "category": "electronics"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Depending on how Elasticsearch parses this, it could potentially return products from the "malicious" category, bypassing the intended filtering. More sophisticated injections could involve scripting or data modification.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the risk of Elasticsearch Query Injection, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Input Sanitization and Validation:**
    * **Whitelisting:** Define allowed characters, patterns, and values for user input. Reject any input that does not conform to these rules.
    * **Escaping Special Characters:**  Escape characters that have special meaning in Elasticsearch query syntax (e.g., `*`, `?`, `:`, `(`, `)`, `+`, `-`, `=`, `^`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `"`, `~`). The `olivere/elastic` library provides methods for building queries programmatically, which can handle some escaping automatically, but careful attention is still required when incorporating user input.
    * **Contextual Sanitization:** Sanitize input based on how it will be used in the query. For example, if the input is expected to be a product name, sanitize it differently than if it's expected to be a numerical ID.

* **Parameterized Queries (Using the `olivere/elastic` Library Effectively):**
    * **Avoid String Concatenation:**  Never directly concatenate user input into query strings.
    * **Utilize Query Builders:** Leverage the query builder functions provided by the `olivere/elastic` library to construct queries programmatically. This approach helps prevent injection by treating user input as data rather than executable code.

    ```go
    // Example of using query builders with user input
    userInput := "example product"
    query := elastic.NewMatchQuery("product_name", userInput)

    searchResult, err := client.Search().
        Index("products").
        Query(query).
        Do(ctx)
    ```

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Restrict Elasticsearch User Permissions:**  Ensure that the application's Elasticsearch user has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended operations. Avoid granting overly broad permissions that could be exploited in case of a successful injection. For example, if the application only needs to read data, the user should not have permissions to delete or update data.

* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    * Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify potential injection vulnerabilities in the application's codebase, particularly in areas where user input is processed and used to construct Elasticsearch queries.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    * Implement a WAF that can inspect incoming requests and filter out potentially malicious payloads before they reach the application. Configure the WAF with rules to detect common Elasticsearch injection patterns.

* **Error Handling and Logging:**
    * Implement robust error handling to prevent sensitive information about the Elasticsearch setup or query execution from being exposed to attackers.
    * Log all Elasticsearch queries (both successful and failed) with sufficient detail to facilitate detection and analysis of potential attacks.
