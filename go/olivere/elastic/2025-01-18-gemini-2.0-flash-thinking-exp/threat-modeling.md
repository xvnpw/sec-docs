# Threat Model Analysis for olivere/elastic

## Threat: [Unencrypted Communication with Elasticsearch](./threats/unencrypted_communication_with_elasticsearch.md)

**Description:** An attacker could perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to intercept communication between the application and the Elasticsearch cluster if the `elastic.Client` is not configured to use TLS/SSL. The attacker could eavesdrop on sensitive data being indexed or queried, potentially stealing credentials or confidential information transmitted via the `olivere/elastic` client. They might also modify data in transit through the unencrypted connection.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data integrity compromise, potential credential theft.

**Affected `olivere/elastic` Component:** The underlying HTTP client used by the `elastic.Client`, specifically the transport layer configuration within the `elastic` package.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure the `elastic.Client` to use `https://` URLs for the Elasticsearch cluster. This ensures the `olivere/elastic` client initiates a secure connection.
* Utilize the `elastic.SetURL` or `elastic.SetSniff` options with `https://` URLs.
* Consider using `elastic.SetBasicAuth` or other authentication mechanisms provided by `olivere/elastic` in conjunction with HTTPS.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Elasticsearch Data via Application](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_elasticsearch_data_via_application.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the application's logic or authentication/authorization mechanisms to craft and send unauthorized queries or indexing requests to Elasticsearch *through* the `olivere/elastic` client. This means the attacker leverages the application's use of `olivere/elastic` to bypass intended access controls on the Elasticsearch cluster.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, data loss, compliance violations.

**Affected `olivere/elastic` Component:** The `elastic.Client`'s query and indexing functions (e.g., `Search`, `Index`, `Update`, `Delete`) are the direct interface used to interact with Elasticsearch.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust authentication and authorization within the application *before* interacting with `olivere/elastic`. Ensure only authorized actions are translated into Elasticsearch operations.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring the `elastic.Client` and the Elasticsearch user it uses.
* Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs *before* constructing Elasticsearch queries or indexing requests using `olivere/elastic`'s query builders or string manipulation.

## Threat: [Data Injection through Malicious Input via `olivere/elastic`](./threats/data_injection_through_malicious_input_via__olivereelastic_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious data into Elasticsearch by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's data handling *before* it's indexed using the `olivere/elastic` client. The `olivere/elastic` library then becomes the conduit for inserting this malicious data into Elasticsearch. This could lead to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the data is later retrieved and displayed, or other forms of data corruption within Elasticsearch.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, data corruption within Elasticsearch, potential for further attacks leveraging the injected data.

**Affected `olivere/elastic` Component:** The `elastic.Client`'s indexing functions (e.g., `Index`, `Bulk`) are the direct components used to send data to Elasticsearch.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the application side *before* passing data to `olivere/elastic` for indexing.
* Utilize `olivere/elastic`'s query builders and parameterized queries to avoid direct string concatenation of potentially malicious user input into indexing requests.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion through `olivere/elastic`](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion_through__olivereelastic_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could send a large number of resource-intensive queries or indexing requests *through* the `olivere/elastic` client, overwhelming the Elasticsearch cluster and causing a denial of service for legitimate users. The `olivere/elastic` library facilitates the sending of these malicious requests.

**Impact:** Service disruption, unavailability of search functionality, potential data loss if indexing queues are overwhelmed due to the volume of requests sent via `olivere/elastic`.

**Affected `olivere/elastic` Component:** The `elastic.Client`'s query and indexing functions are the components used to send requests that can exhaust resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on the application side *before* requests are sent using `olivere/elastic`.
* Configure appropriate timeouts and retry mechanisms within the `elastic.Client` to prevent indefinite blocking.
* Design application logic to avoid sending excessively large or complex queries through `olivere/elastic`.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `olivere/elastic` Library](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in__olivereelastic__library.md)

**Description:** The `olivere/elastic` library itself might contain security vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit if the application uses a vulnerable version. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the library's behavior, potentially leading to unauthorized actions on the Elasticsearch cluster or exposing sensitive information handled by the library.

**Impact:** Potentially a wide range of impacts, including unauthorized data access, manipulation of Elasticsearch state, or denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability within `olivere/elastic`.

**Affected `olivere/elastic` Component:** Any part of the library depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the `olivere/elastic` library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
* Monitor the library's release notes and security advisories for any reported vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in `olivere/elastic`'s Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in__olivereelastic_'s_dependencies.md)

**Description:** The `olivere/elastic` library relies on other Go packages. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited, indirectly affecting the security of the application's interaction with Elasticsearch *through* `olivere/elastic`. An attacker might target a vulnerability in a dependency that `olivere/elastic` uses for network communication or data handling.

**Impact:** Potentially a wide range of impacts, depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, including but not limited to remote code execution or data breaches affecting the communication with Elasticsearch.

**Affected `olivere/elastic` Component:** Indirectly affects the entire library as it relies on its dependencies for various functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly scan the application's dependencies (including `olivere/elastic`'s dependencies) for known vulnerabilities using tools like `govulncheck` or similar.
* Keep dependencies updated to their latest stable versions.

## Threat: [Exposure of Elasticsearch Management APIs via `olivere/elastic`](./threats/exposure_of_elasticsearch_management_apis_via__olivereelastic_.md)

**Description:** If the application uses the `olivere/elastic` client to interact with Elasticsearch management APIs (e.g., cluster settings, index management) and the application itself has vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to use the `olivere/elastic` client to perform unauthorized administrative actions on the Elasticsearch cluster. The `olivere/elastic` library becomes the tool for this unauthorized management.

**Impact:** Cluster instability, data loss due to accidental or malicious deletion, configuration changes leading to security weaknesses in the Elasticsearch cluster.

**Affected `olivere/elastic` Component:** The `elastic.Client`'s functions for interacting with Elasticsearch's cluster and index APIs are the components used to access these management functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Restrict access to Elasticsearch management APIs within the application's logic. Only allow authorized users or processes to trigger these actions via `olivere/elastic`.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring the Elasticsearch user used by the `olivere/elastic` client, limiting its permissions to only the necessary actions.
* Carefully audit any application code that interacts with Elasticsearch management APIs through `olivere/elastic`.
