# Attack Surface Analysis for olivere/elastic

## Attack Surface: [Elasticsearch Query Injection](./attack_surfaces/elasticsearch_query_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  The application constructs Elasticsearch queries by directly embedding user-provided input without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    *   **How Elastic Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `olivere/elastic` library provides methods for building queries, but if developers use string concatenation or other insecure methods to incorporate user input into these queries, it creates an injection point.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could manipulate a search query by injecting malicious Elasticsearch syntax, such as `* OR _id:malicious_id`, to bypass intended search filters or access unauthorized data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, potential for denial-of-service on the Elasticsearch cluster depending on the injected query.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Parameterized Queries/Query Builders:**  Utilize the query builder methods provided by `olivere/elastic` to construct queries programmatically. This ensures that user input is treated as data and not executable code.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Implement strict input validation on the application side to ensure user-provided data conforms to expected formats and does not contain potentially malicious characters or syntax.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Elasticsearch Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_elasticsearch_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**  Credentials used to authenticate with the Elasticsearch cluster are exposed or stored insecurely.
    *   **How Elastic Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `olivere/elastic` library requires credentials (username/password, API keys) to establish a connection. If these are mishandled, the library becomes a conduit for their misuse.
    *   **Example:** Hardcoding Elasticsearch credentials directly in the application code or storing them in easily accessible configuration files without proper encryption.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch cluster, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial-of-service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Utilize Secure Credential Management:** Employ secure credential management mechanisms like environment variables (with proper restrictions), secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault), or configuration files with restricted access.
        *   **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials:** Never hardcode credentials directly in the application code.
        *   **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) on Elasticsearch:**  Limit the permissions of the credentials used by the application to the minimum necessary for its functionality.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Transport Layer Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_transport_layer_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between the application and the Elasticsearch cluster is not encrypted using TLS/SSL.
    *   **How Elastic Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `olivere/elastic` library needs to be configured to use HTTPS for secure communication. If this is not explicitly configured, the connection defaults to unencrypted HTTP.
    *   **Example:**  Connecting to an Elasticsearch cluster using `http://` instead of `https://` in the client configuration.
    *   **Impact:**  Eavesdropping on communication, interception of sensitive data (including queries and results), potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce HTTPS:**  Always configure the `olivere/elastic` client to use HTTPS for connecting to the Elasticsearch cluster.
        *   **Verify TLS Certificates:** Ensure that the TLS certificates used by the Elasticsearch cluster are valid and trusted. Configure the client to verify the server's certificate.
