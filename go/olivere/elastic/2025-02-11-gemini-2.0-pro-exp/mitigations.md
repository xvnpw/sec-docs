# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for olivere/elastic

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Error Handling (with `olivere/elastic`)](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_error_handling__with__olivereelastic__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Check Every `olivere/elastic` Error:** After *every* call to an `olivere/elastic` function (e.g., `client.Index()`, `client.Search()`, `client.Get()`), immediately check the returned `error` value using `if err != nil`.
2.  **Log with `olivere/elastic` Context:** Inside the `if err != nil` block, log the error, including:
    *   The specific `olivere/elastic` function that failed.
    *   The parameters passed to the function (excluding sensitive data).
    *   A descriptive message explaining the context.
    *   *Never* log raw data from Elasticsearch or user input.
3.  **Differentiate `olivere/elastic` Error Types:** Use Go's error handling:
    *   Use `errors.Is` and `errors.As` to check for specific error types.
    *   Use type assertions (e.g., `if _, ok := err.(*elastic.Error); ok { ... }`) to check for `elastic.Error` and extract details like the status code. This is crucial for understanding Elasticsearch-specific errors.
4.  **Implement Graceful Degradation (based on `olivere/elastic` errors):**
    *   **Network Errors:** Retry with exponential backoff (using `olivere/elastic`'s retry mechanisms if available, or custom logic).
    *   **"Not Found" Errors (404):** Handle gracefully (return a default value, user-friendly message).
    *   **Server Errors (5xx):** Log and potentially alert an administrator.
    *   **Client Errors (4xx, excluding 404):** Investigate (likely an application bug or incorrect Elasticsearch configuration).
    *   **Permission Errors (403):** Return an "access denied" message.
5. **Centralized `olivere/elastic` Error Handling (Optional):** Consider a helper function or middleware to handle common `olivere/elastic` error patterns.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Leakage (Severity: Medium):** Prevents sensitive Elasticsearch cluster details or data snippets from being exposed in error messages.
*   **Application Instability (Severity: High):** Prevents unhandled `olivere/elastic` errors from crashing the application.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Prevents repeated `olivere/elastic` errors from causing resource exhaustion.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Leakage:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Application Instability:** Risk eliminated.
*   **DoS:** Risk reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic error checking (`if err != nil`) in `data_ingestion`.
*   Logging with `logrus`, but context is sometimes missing.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Error type differentiation is inconsistent.
*   Graceful degradation is missing in `search_api`.
*   Centralized error handling is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Query Construction (using `olivere/elastic` Builders)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_query_construction__using__olivereelastic__builders_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Avoid String Concatenation:** *Never* build Elasticsearch queries by concatenating strings, especially with user input.
2.  **Exclusively Use `olivere/elastic` Query Builders:**
    *   `elastic.NewMatchQuery`, `elastic.NewTermQuery`, `elastic.NewBoolQuery`, `elastic.NewRangeQuery`, etc.  Use the appropriate builder for each query type.  This is the *core* of preventing query injection.
3.  **Sanitize Input (if unavoidable, with `olivere/elastic`):** If you *must* use user input (e.g., for a field name), sanitize it *before* passing it to an `olivere/elastic` builder:
    *   **Whitelist:** Define allowed values.
    *   **Validation:** Validate against the whitelist.
    *   **Rejection:** Reject invalid input.
4.  **Avoid `elastic.NewRawStringQuery`:** Do not use `elastic.NewRawStringQuery` or similar constructs with user-provided data. This bypasses the safety of the builders.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Query Injection (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious Elasticsearch query clauses.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Prevents expensive query attacks.

**Impact:**
*   **Query Injection:** Risk almost entirely eliminated.
*   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Query builders are used in most of `search_api`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Input sanitization is missing for some fields in `advanced_search`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Connection Configuration (with `olivere/elastic`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_connection_configuration__with__olivereelastic__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **HTTPS with `olivere/elastic`:** Use HTTPS: `elastic.SetScheme("https")`.
2.  **Authentication with `olivere/elastic`:**
    *   `elastic.SetBasicAuth("username", "password")` (less preferred).
    *   `elastic.SetAPIKey("your-api-key")` (recommended).
3.  **Disable Sniffing (if appropriate) with `olivere/elastic`:** If *not* using a load balancer that handles node discovery: `elastic.SetSniff(false)`.
4.  **Certificate Validation with `olivere/elastic`:**
    *   Create an `http.Client` with proper TLS configuration (including CA certificates).
    *   Use `elastic.SetHttpClient(yourHttpClient)` to set the custom client. This is *essential* for preventing MitM attacks.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Critical):** Prevents unauthorized connections.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Severity: Critical):** Prevents interception and modification of communication.
*   **Data Breaches (Severity: Critical):** Protects data in transit.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk eliminated.
*   **MitM Attacks:** Risk eliminated.
*   **Data Breaches:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   HTTPS is enabled.
*   Basic authentication is used.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Certificate validation is not explicitly configured.
*   API key authentication should be implemented.
*   Sniffing is enabled incorrectly.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Excessive Data Retrieval (using `olivere/elastic` features)](./mitigation_strategies/excessive_data_retrieval__using__olivereelastic__features_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Pagination with `olivere/elastic`:**
    *   `elastic.SearchService.From(offset)`
    *   `elastic.SearchService.Size(limit)`
    *   Handle multiple pages in your application logic.
2.  **Scroll API with `olivere/elastic` (for very large datasets):**
    *   `elastic.ScrollService`
    *   Iterate with `scrollService.Do(ctx)`.
    *   Clear with `scrollService.Clear(ctx)`.
3.  **Aggregations with `olivere/elastic`:** Use aggregations instead of retrieving all documents when possible:
    *   `elastic.NewSumAggregation`, `elastic.NewAvgAggregation`, `elastic.NewTermsAggregation`, etc.
    *   Add to search: `searchService.Aggregation("name", aggregation)`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Performance Degradation (Severity: Medium):** Prevents slow queries.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Prevents out-of-memory errors.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Prevents data-based DoS attacks.

**Impact:**
*   **Performance Degradation:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **DoS:** Risk reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Pagination in main search.
*   Aggregations for some reports.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Scroll API is not used.
