# Attack Surface Analysis for olivere/elastic

## Attack Surface: [Query Injection](./attack_surfaces/query_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate user-supplied input to alter the intended Elasticsearch query, potentially accessing, modifying, or deleting data.  This is the most critical vulnerability.
*   **How `olivere/elastic` Contributes:** The library provides the API for interacting with Elasticsearch; *incorrect* use of this API (string concatenation instead of query builders) creates the vulnerability. The library *itself* is not vulnerable, but its *misuse* is.
*   **Example:**
    ```go
    // VULNERABLE: Direct string concatenation
    userInput := `"malicious_input" OR 1=1`
    query := `{"query": {"match": {"field": "` + userInput + `"}}}`
    // ... use query with elastic.NewSearchService ...

    // SAFE: Using query builders
    userInput := "malicious_input" // Still needs validation, but is safer
    query := elastic.NewMatchQuery("field", userInput)
    // ... use query with elastic.NewSearchService ...
    ```
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, data modification/deletion, denial of service, potential full cluster compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory: Always use `olivere/elastic`'s query builders (e.g., `elastic.NewTermQuery`, `elastic.NewBoolQuery`, `elastic.NewMatchQuery`) to construct queries programmatically.**  This is the *only* reliable way to prevent query injection.
    *   **Never** directly concatenate user-supplied input into raw query strings.  This is fundamentally insecure.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization *before* using any user input, even with query builders. Validate data types, lengths, and allowed characters. This is a defense-in-depth measure.
    *   Employ a "least privilege" principle for Elasticsearch users and roles. The application's Elasticsearch user should only have the minimum necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Error Handling](./attack_surfaces/improper_error_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Failure to properly handle errors returned by `olivere/elastic` can lead to information leakage, potentially revealing sensitive details about the cluster or queries.
*   **How `olivere/elastic` Contributes:** The library returns errors that *must* be handled; ignoring or improperly handling them creates the vulnerability. The library's behavior is correct; the application's handling is the issue.
*   **Example:**
    ```go
    result, _ := client.Search().Index("myindex").Do(ctx) // Ignoring the error!
    fmt.Println(result.Hits.TotalHits.Value) // Potential panic if result is nil, or leak of error details
    ```
*   **Impact:** Information leakage (revealing cluster configuration, query structure, or data snippets through error messages), potential bypass of security checks (if errors related to authorization are ignored).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Check for errors after *every* `olivere/elastic` call.** Never ignore the returned error. Use `if err != nil { ... }` blocks.
    *   Implement robust error handling: log errors (using structured logging, *without* exposing sensitive information), and return user-friendly error messages (without revealing internal details).  *Never* expose raw error messages from `olivere/elastic` to end-users.
    *   Consider using a centralized error handling mechanism for consistency.

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Connections (Lack of HTTPS)](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_connections__lack_of_https_.md)

*   **Description:** Connecting to Elasticsearch without HTTPS allows attackers to intercept and potentially modify data in transit (Man-in-the-Middle attack).
*   **How `olivere/elastic` Contributes:** The library *allows* connections without HTTPS; it's the developer's responsibility to *enforce* HTTPS. The library doesn't *force* insecure connections, but it doesn't prevent them either.
*   **Example:** Using `http://` instead of `https://` in the Elasticsearch URL when creating the client.
*   **Impact:** Data theft (credentials, sensitive data), data manipulation, man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use HTTPS to connect to Elasticsearch.** Ensure the `olivere/elastic` client is configured with an `https://` URL. This is non-negotiable.
    *   **Enable and enforce certificate validation.** Do *not* disable certificate verification. Use a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) for your Elasticsearch cluster's certificates.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in `olivere/elastic` itself or its dependencies can be exploited.
*   **How `olivere/elastic` Contributes:** The library and its dependencies are the potential source of the vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in a JSON parsing library used by `olivere/elastic` could allow for remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update `olivere/elastic` and all its dependencies to the latest versions.** Use `go get -u ./...` or `go mod tidy` followed by `go mod vendor`.
    *   **Use a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., `go list -m -u all`, Snyk, Dependabot, Trivy) to identify and track known vulnerabilities.** Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Consider using a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track all dependencies.
