# Threat Model Analysis for olivere/elastic

## Threat: [Elasticsearch Query Injection](./threats/elasticsearch_query_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Elasticsearch Query Injection (Spoofing/Tampering/Information Disclosure/DoS)

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that is directly incorporated into an Elasticsearch query constructed using `olivere/elastic`. The attacker can manipulate the query's logic to bypass intended access controls, retrieve unauthorized data, modify data, or cause a denial-of-service by executing resource-intensive queries. For example, an attacker might inject a wildcard query or a complex aggregation into a search field intended for simple text matching. This leverages the *direct interaction* with Elasticsearch via the client.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach (unauthorized data access).
        *   Data modification or deletion.
        *   Service disruption (DoS).
        *   Exposure of internal Elasticsearch schema.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any `olivere/elastic` function that constructs queries from user input, particularly those involving `QueryStringQuery`, `RawStringQuery`, or direct string concatenation to build queries. This affects any part of the application that uses these functions without proper sanitization. The *vulnerability exists in how the application uses the client*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation to ensure that user-provided data conforms to expected types, lengths, and formats *before* it is used in any query.
        *   **Parameterized Queries/Query Builders:** Use `olivere/elastic`'s query builders (e.g., `NewTermQuery`, `NewMatchQuery`, `NewBoolQuery`) whenever possible. These builders automatically handle escaping and formatting, reducing the risk of injection. *Avoid* direct string concatenation.
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Characters:** If direct string manipulation is unavoidable, use a whitelist of allowed characters and escape or reject any other characters.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the application's Elasticsearch credentials have only the minimum necessary permissions.

## Threat: [Credential Exposure](./threats/credential_exposure.md)

*   **Threat:** Credential Exposure (Spoofing)

    *   **Description:** The application's Elasticsearch credentials (API keys, usernames/passwords, or TLS certificates) are exposed due to insecure storage or transmission. An attacker could obtain these credentials and impersonate the application, *directly* using the `olivere/elastic` client with the stolen credentials. This is a direct threat because the client *requires* these credentials to function.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete compromise of the Elasticsearch cluster.
        *   Unauthorized access to all data.
        *   Ability to modify or delete data.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `olivere/elastic.NewClient` function and any code that handles the configuration of the client, including how credentials are provided (e.g., `elastic.SetURL`, `elastic.SetBasicAuth`, `elastic.SetAPIKey`, `elastic.SetSniff`, `elastic.SetHealthcheck`). The client *itself* is the component being misused.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Credential Storage:** *Never* hardcode credentials in the source code. Use environment variables, a secrets management service (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault), or a secure configuration file with appropriate permissions.
        *   **TLS Encryption:** Always use HTTPS (TLS) for communication with Elasticsearch. Ensure the client is configured to verify the server's certificate.
        *   **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate API keys or certificates.

## Threat: [Unencrypted Communication](./threats/unencrypted_communication.md)

*   **Threat:** Unencrypted Communication (Tampering/Information Disclosure)

    *   **Description:** The application communicates with Elasticsearch over an unencrypted channel (HTTP instead of HTTPS). An attacker could intercept the communication using a man-in-the-middle attack, capturing sensitive data or modifying requests and responses *sent through the `olivere/elastic` client*. This is a direct threat because the client handles the communication.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach (e.g., sensitive data transmitted in queries or responses).
        *   Data modification (attacker could alter queries or results).
    *   **Affected Component:** The `olivere/elastic.NewClient` function and the underlying HTTP transport used by the client. Specifically, the URL provided to `elastic.SetURL` should use `https://`. The client's *communication mechanism* is the affected component.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS (TLS) for communication with Elasticsearch. Configure the `olivere/elastic` client to use an `https://` URL.
        *   **Certificate Verification:** Ensure the client is configured to verify the Elasticsearch server's certificate to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Use `elastic.SetHttpClient` to provide a custom `http.Client` with appropriate TLS configuration if needed.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (DoS)

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests or crafts computationally expensive queries (e.g., deeply nested aggregations, wildcard queries on large indices) *through the `olivere/elastic` client* to overwhelm the Elasticsearch cluster. This directly exploits the client's ability to send requests to Elasticsearch.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Service unavailability.
        *   Performance degradation.
    *   **Affected Component:** All `olivere/elastic` functions that interact with Elasticsearch, particularly those that execute searches or aggregations. The client is the *conduit* for the DoS attack.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting (Application Level):** Implement rate limiting in the application to restrict the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a given time period.
        *   **Query Optimization:** Design efficient queries. Avoid overly broad or complex queries.
        *   **Query Sanitization (Again):** Prevent query injection, which can be used to craft DoS attacks.
        *   **Elasticsearch Resource Limits:** Configure resource limits within Elasticsearch (circuit breakers, thread pool sizes).
        *   **Timeouts:** Set appropriate timeouts on requests made via `olivere/elastic`.

## Threat: [Outdated `olivere/elastic` Version](./threats/outdated__olivereelastic__version.md)

*   **Threat:** Outdated `olivere/elastic` Version (Elevation of Privilege)

    *   **Description:** The application uses an outdated version of the `olivere/elastic` library that contains known security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities *within the client itself* to gain unauthorized access or control. This is a direct threat to the client library.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to complete cluster compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `olivere/elastic` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the `olivere/elastic` library up to date. Use Go modules to manage dependencies and regularly run `go get -u` to update them.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify outdated or vulnerable dependencies.
