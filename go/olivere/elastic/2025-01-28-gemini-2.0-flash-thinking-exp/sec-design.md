# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `olivere/elastic`, provides a Go client for Elasticsearch.

- Business Priorities:
  - Provide a comprehensive and feature-rich Go client that supports the full functionality of Elasticsearch.
  - Ensure the client is reliable, performant, and easy to use for Go developers.
  - Maintain compatibility with various versions of Elasticsearch.
  - Foster an active and supportive community around the client library.

- Business Goals:
  - Enable Go developers to seamlessly integrate Elasticsearch into their applications.
  - Reduce the complexity of interacting with Elasticsearch APIs from Go.
  - Offer a well-documented and actively maintained Go client as a preferred choice for Elasticsearch integration.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the client library could expose applications using it to risks.
  - Incompatibility with new Elasticsearch versions could lead to application failures or require significant updates.
  - Performance issues in the client could negatively impact applications relying on it.
  - Lack of maintenance or community support could make the client less attractive and reliable over time.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Code is hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's security features for repository management and access control. (Implemented: GitHub)
  - security control:  Likely uses standard Go security practices for code development. (Implemented: Development Process)
  - security control:  Relies on HTTPS for communication with Elasticsearch, ensuring data in transit is encrypted. (Implemented: Client Library Code)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in dependencies of the client library.
  - accepted risk: Misuse of the client library by developers leading to insecure application configurations.
  - accepted risk:  Vulnerabilities in the underlying Elasticsearch service itself are outside the scope of this client library.
  - accepted risk:  Security of the Go runtime environment and the host system where the client library is used.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
  - security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the development pipeline to detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control:  Consider providing security guidelines and best practices documentation for developers using the client library, focusing on secure Elasticsearch integration.
  - security control:  Establish a process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in the client library.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: The client library must support Elasticsearch authentication mechanisms (e.g., Basic Authentication, API keys, OAuth) to securely connect to Elasticsearch clusters.
    - Requirement:  Authentication credentials should be handled securely and not hardcoded in the client code.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: The client library should facilitate the implementation of Elasticsearch's role-based access control (RBAC) by allowing users to specify roles and permissions when interacting with Elasticsearch.
    - Requirement:  The client should not bypass or weaken Elasticsearch's authorization mechanisms.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The client library should provide mechanisms to help developers sanitize and validate user inputs before sending them to Elasticsearch queries to prevent injection attacks.
    - Requirement:  The client itself should validate inputs it receives from developers to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: All communication between the client library and Elasticsearch should be encrypted using HTTPS to protect data in transit.
    - Requirement:  If the client library handles sensitive data locally (e.g., temporary caching), consider encryption at rest. (Note: unlikely for a client library).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For the `olivere/elastic` project itself, the critical business process is providing a functional, reliable, and secure Go client library for Elasticsearch.  Reputation and user trust are key assets.
  - For users of the library, critical business processes will vary widely depending on their applications.  Any application that relies on Elasticsearch for core functionality (e.g., search, data analytics, logging) and uses this client library is potentially impacted by vulnerabilities in the client.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - The `olivere/elastic` client library itself does not store or directly handle sensitive data. It facilitates access to data stored in Elasticsearch.
  - The sensitivity of the data depends entirely on the data stored in the Elasticsearch clusters that users connect to. This could range from publicly available data to highly sensitive personal or financial information.
  - The primary data to protect in the context of the client library is the integrity and security of the library code itself, to prevent vulnerabilities that could be exploited by users and potentially compromise the security of applications and the Elasticsearch clusters they interact with.
