## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Elasticsearch (using olivere/elastic) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_elasticsearch__using_olivereelastic___critical_node_.md)

*   This is the overarching goal. Success means the attacker has achieved unauthorized access to sensitive data or disrupted application functionality by exploiting Elasticsearch related vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Elasticsearch Server-Side Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_elasticsearch_server-side_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Exploit Publicly Known Vulnerability (CVEs) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Identify the Elasticsearch version in use (through reconnaissance). Search for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) affecting that version. Utilize available exploits (publicly available or custom-developed) to target the vulnerability.
    *   **Examples:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), arbitrary file read, data breach vulnerabilities.

*   **Exploit Elasticsearch Misconfigurations [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Exploit Insecure Elasticsearch Settings [CRITICAL NODE]:**
