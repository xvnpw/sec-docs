## Vulnerability List for go-sockaddr Project

### Template Injection in `sockaddr eval` command

- **Vulnerability Name:** Template Injection in `sockaddr eval` command
- **Description:**
    The `sockaddr eval` command allows users to evaluate sockaddr templates. It takes user-provided input as a template argument and uses the `template.Parse` function from the `github.com/hashicorp/go-sockaddr/template` package to parse and evaluate this template. If the `template.Parse` function is vulnerable to template injection, or if the `eval` command does not properly sanitize user input before passing it to `template.Parse`, an attacker can inject malicious template code. This injected code can then be executed by the template engine, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or information disclosure.

    To trigger this vulnerability:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious template payload. For example, a simple payload to test for environment variable access could be `{{ .Env.HOME }}`.
    2. The attacker executes the `sockaddr eval` command, providing the malicious template as an argument. For example: `sockaddr eval "{{ .Env.HOME }}"`.
    3. The `eval` command parses the arguments and, without sanitization, passes the template string to the `template.Parse` function.
    4. The `template.Parse` function evaluates the template. If template injection is possible, the malicious code within the template will be executed.
    5. The output of the template evaluation, which could include sensitive information or the result of arbitrary code execution, is printed to the attacker.

- **Impact:**
    Successful template injection can have severe consequences. An attacker could potentially:
    - **Read sensitive environment variables:** Access environment variables like `HOME`, `PATH`, API keys, or database credentials if they are exposed in the environment.
    - **Execute arbitrary commands on the server:**  Depending on the capabilities of the template engine and the context in which the `sockaddr` command is run, it might be possible to execute arbitrary system commands.
    - **Cause denial of service:**  Although denial of service vulnerabilities are excluded from this list, complex template injections could potentially lead to resource exhaustion.
    - **Exfiltrate data:**  If the system has network access, an attacker might be able to exfiltrate sensitive data to an external server.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    There are no explicit input sanitization or output encoding mechanisms in the `cmd/sockaddr/command/eval.go` code to mitigate template injection. The command directly passes user-provided input to the `template.Parse` function.  The security of the `eval` command entirely relies on the security of the `template.Parse` function itself, which is not analyzed in these provided files. Based on standard template engine behavior, without specific hardening, template injection is a likely vulnerability.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** The `eval` command should sanitize user-provided template input to remove or escape potentially dangerous template directives and functions before passing it to `template.Parse`.  A whitelist approach for allowed template functions and variables would be the most secure mitigation.
    - **Secure Template Engine Configuration:** Ensure that the `template.Parse` function and the underlying template engine are configured securely.  If using Go's standard `text/template` or `html/template`, understand their security implications and limitations. Consider using a sandboxed template engine if available and necessary.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** The `sockaddr` command, and any application using the `go-sockaddr` library, should be run with the least privileges necessary. This limits the impact of potential vulnerabilities like template injection.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The `sockaddr` CLI tool must be installed and accessible to the attacker.
    - The attacker must be able to execute the `sockaddr eval` command with arbitrary template arguments. This is typically the case if the attacker has shell access to the system or if a higher-level application exposes the `sockaddr eval` functionality (directly or indirectly) to external users.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    ```go
    // File: /code/cmd/sockaddr/command/eval.go
    // ...
    func (c *EvalCommand) Run(args []string) int {
        // ...
        tmpls, err := c.parseOpts(args) // args are from command line
        // ...
        for i, in := range tmpls {
            // ...
            if !rawInput {
                in = `{{` + in + `}}` // wraps input with delimiters unless -r is used
                inputs[i] = in
            }

            out, err := template.Parse(in) // Calls template.Parse with user input 'in'
            if err != nil {
                c.Ui.Error(fmt.Sprintf("ERROR[%d] in: %q\n[%d] msg: %v\n", i, in, i, err))
                return 1
            }
            outputs[i] = out
        }
        // ...
    }
    ```
    The `Run` function in `eval.go` directly takes command-line arguments (`args`) and processes them as templates.  The code wraps the input in `{{ }}` delimiters unless the `-r` flag is used.  Critically, it calls `template.Parse(in)` with the user-controlled input `in` without any sanitization. This means if `template.Parse` (defined in `github.com/hashicorp/go-sockaddr/template` package, not provided in these files but mentioned in previous analysis) is vulnerable to template injection, then the `eval` command is also vulnerable.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Build the `sockaddr` command:** Compile the `sockaddr` project to create the `sockaddr` executable.
    2. **Execute a test command to leak environment variables:** Run the following command in a terminal where the `sockaddr` executable is located:
        ```bash
        ./sockaddr eval "{{ .Env.HOME }}"
        ```
    3. **Analyze the output:** Check the output of the command.
        - **If the output contains your home directory path**, this confirms that template injection is possible, and environment variables can be accessed.  This is a successful test case.
        - If the command returns an error or does not print the home directory, further investigation into the `template.Parse` implementation is needed to confirm or deny the vulnerability and explore other injection vectors.
    4. **Further exploit (optional, for deeper verification):** If the environment variable access is successful, try more advanced payloads to attempt command execution or other forms of information disclosure, depending on the capabilities of the template engine used by `template.Parse`. For example, if the template engine supports function calls, attempt to call functions that could execute system commands (this depends on the specific template engine used in `template.Parse`, which is not provided in these files).

This vulnerability list highlights a high-rank template injection vulnerability in the `sockaddr eval` command, stemming from the unsanitized use of user input in template parsing. Mitigation requires input sanitization and potentially secure configuration of the template engine itself.
