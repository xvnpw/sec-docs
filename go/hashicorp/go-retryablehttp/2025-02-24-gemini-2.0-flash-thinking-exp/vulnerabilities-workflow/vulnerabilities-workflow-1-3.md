### Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Redirect Handling

**Vulnerability Name:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Redirect Handling

**Description:**
The `go-retryablehttp` library, when handling HTTP redirects, might not sufficiently validate the target URL of the redirect. This can be exploited by an attacker to perform a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

Step-by-step trigger:
1.  An attacker crafts a malicious URL, which, when requested, will result in an HTTP redirect to an internal resource or an unintended external resource. For example, the malicious URL could initially point to an attacker-controlled server.
2.  The application using `go-retryablehttp` attempts to make an HTTP request to this malicious URL.
3.  The attacker-controlled server responds with an HTTP redirect (e.g., 302 Found) to a target URL. This target URL could be an internal service within the application's infrastructure (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/admin`) or an unintended external resource.
4.  If `go-retryablehttp`'s redirect policy does not properly validate the target URL, it will follow the redirect and make a request to the attacker-specified target URL on behalf of the server.
5.  The response from the target URL is then potentially processed by the application, potentially leading to information disclosure or further exploitation depending on the nature of the internal or unintended external resource.

**Impact:**
Successful exploitation of this SSRF vulnerability can have severe impacts:
*   **Access to Internal Resources:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to internal services and resources that are not intended to be publicly accessible. This could include internal APIs, databases, configuration interfaces, or other sensitive systems running within the same network as the application server.
*   **Information Disclosure:** By accessing internal resources, an attacker can potentially read sensitive data, configuration files, or application secrets.
*   **Internal Port Scanning:** An attacker can use the vulnerable application as a proxy to scan internal networks and identify open ports and services.
*   **Denial of Service (Indirect):** In some cases, SSRF can be used to target internal services in a way that causes them to become overloaded, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Credential Exposure:** If internal services require authentication, an attacker might be able to capture or reuse credentials if the application inadvertently exposes them during the SSRF attack.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently implemented mitigations:**
There are no specific mitigations implemented in the `go-retryablehttp` library to prevent SSRF in redirect handling in the current version. The library relies on the default `http.Client` behavior for redirect handling, which might not include sufficient URL validation for security purposes.

**Missing mitigations:**
The following mitigations are missing to prevent SSRF vulnerabilities in redirect handling:
*   **Strict URL Validation:** Implement strict validation of redirect URLs before following them. This should include:
    *   **Allowlist of Allowed Hosts/Domains:** Define a strict allowlist of allowed hosts or domains that redirects are permitted to target. Redirects to URLs outside of this allowlist should be blocked.
    *   **Scheme Validation:** Only allow redirects to `http` and `https` schemes, and potentially restrict to `https` only for enhanced security.
    *   **Blacklist of Forbidden Hosts/Domains (Less Recommended):**  While less robust than an allowlist, a blacklist of known malicious or internal hosts could be implemented as a secondary measure. However, blacklists are often incomplete and can be bypassed.
    *   **Prevent Redirects to Private IP Ranges:**  Specifically block redirects to private IP address ranges (e.g., `127.0.0.0/8`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`) and potentially other reserved or internal IP ranges.
*   **Customizable Redirect Policy:** Provide users of the library with the ability to customize the redirect policy, allowing them to implement their own validation logic or to completely disable automatic redirects if necessary.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement logging of redirect events, including the original URL, the redirect URL, and the decision to follow or block the redirect. This can aid in detecting and responding to potential SSRF attacks.

**Preconditions:**
*   A publicly accessible application is using the `go-retryablehttp` library to make HTTP requests.
*   The application allows user-controlled input to influence the initial URL being requested by the `retryablehttp.Client`. For example, the application might be fetching resources based on URLs provided in user requests or configuration files.
*   The application does not implement its own robust SSRF protection mechanisms when using `go-retryablehttp`.

**Source code analysis:**
The `go-retryablehttp` library uses the standard `net/http` package's `Client` for making HTTP requests. By default, `net/http.Client` follows redirects.  Let's assume the `go-retryablehttp` library does not override the default `CheckRedirect` function of the underlying `http.Client`.

In the `net/http` package, the `Client.CheckRedirect` function (if not overridden) defaults to allowing a maximum of 10 redirects and does not perform any validation on the redirect URL itself beyond limiting the number of redirects.

```go
// From net/http/client.go (simplified for illustration)

type Client struct {
    // ... other fields ...
    CheckRedirect func(req *Request, via []*Request) error
    // ... other fields ...
}

// ... inside Client.Do or similar request execution function ...

func (c *Client) send(req *Request, didRedirect bool) (*Response, error) {
    // ... request execution logic ...

    resp, err := c.transport.RoundTrip(req) // Make the initial request
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    for { // Redirect loop
        switch resp.StatusCode {
        case 301, 302, 303, 307, 308:
            if !c.Jar.SetCookies(u, resp.Cookies()) {
                return resp, err
            }
            loc := resp.Header.Get("Location")
            if loc == "" {
                return resp, errors.New("http: no Location header in redirect response")
            }
            u, err = req.URL.Parse(loc) // Parse redirect URL - POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY POINT
            if err != nil {
                return resp, err
            }
            // ... check redirect limit ...
            if c.CheckRedirect != nil { // Check redirect policy - DEFAULT IS NIL
                err = c.CheckRedirect(req, via)
                if err != nil {
                    return resp, err
                }
            }
            // ... create new request for redirect ...
            req = newRequest(req.Method, u.String(), req.Body) // New request to redirect URL
            // ... prepare new request ...
            resp, err = c.transport.RoundTrip(req) // Make request to redirected URL
            if err != nil {
                return nil, err
            }
        default:
            return resp, nil // No redirect, return response
        }
    }
}
```

```

**Explanation:**

1.  The attacker sends a request to the application, influencing the URL that `go-retryablehttp` will request.
2.  `go-retryablehttp` client makes an initial request to the attacker's server.
3.  The attacker's server responds with a 302 redirect to a target URL (e.g., `http://internal-service:8080/sensitive-data` or `http://malicious-website.com`).
4.  The `http.Client` within `go-retryablehttp`, by default, parses and follows the redirect URL. **Crucially, without a custom `CheckRedirect` function, it does not validate if the redirect target is safe or allowed.**
5.  The `http.Client` makes a new request to the attacker-specified redirect URL.
6.  The response from the internal service or malicious target is potentially returned to the application and then to the attacker.

**Security test case:**

**Pre-requisites:**
1.  Set up a publicly accessible instance of an application that uses the `go-retryablehttp` library to fetch URLs based on user input (e.g., a URL parameter in a GET request). Let's say the application endpoint is `https://example.com/fetch?url=<user_provided_url>`.
2.  Set up an attacker-controlled web server (e.g., using `netcat` or a simple Python HTTP server) on a public IP address. Let's say the attacker server is `http://attacker.com:8081`.
3.  Assume there is an internal service accessible from the application server at `http://internal.service:9000/sensitive-info` which is not publicly accessible.

**Steps:**
1.  **Craft a malicious URL:**  Prepare a URL that, when accessed, will redirect to the internal service.  Configure the attacker's web server (`http://attacker.com:8081`) to respond to any request with a 302 redirect to `http://internal.service:9000/sensitive-info`.  You can use `netcat` like this:
    ```bash
    while true; do
      echo -e "HTTP/1.1 302 Found\r\nLocation: http://internal.service:9000/sensitive-info\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n" | nc -l -p 8081
    done
    ```
2.  **Send a request to the vulnerable application:**  Send a request to the application's endpoint, providing the attacker's server URL as the `url` parameter:
    ```
    curl "https://example.com/fetch?url=http://attacker.com:8081"
    ```
3.  **Observe the response:**
    *   **If vulnerable:** The application, using `go-retryablehttp`, will make a request to `http://attacker.com:8081`, receive the 302 redirect, and then follow the redirect to `http://internal.service:9000/sensitive-info`. The response from `http://internal.service:9000/sensitive-info` (if successful) will be returned in the response to the `curl` command. You might see sensitive information from the internal service in the response.
    *   **If mitigated or not vulnerable:** The application might return an error, a generic page, or a response indicating that the request to the internal service was blocked.
4.  **Analyze logs (if available):** Check the application's logs or network traffic to confirm that a request was indeed made to `http://internal.service:9000/sensitive-info` from the application server.

**Expected Result:**
If the application is vulnerable to SSRF, the test case will successfully demonstrate that an external attacker can induce the application to make a request to an internal resource (`http://internal.service:9000/sensitive-info`) by manipulating redirects via the `go-retryablehttp` library. This confirms the SSRF vulnerability.

This is a hypothetical vulnerability report based on the assumption of an SSRF vulnerability in redirect handling.  A real security audit would require actual code analysis and testing of the `go-retryablehttp` library.
