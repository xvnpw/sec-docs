## Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Leak of Basic Authentication Credentials in Logs
- Description: While the `redactURL` function is used to mask passwords in URLs within log messages, it's possible that basic authentication credentials embedded directly within the URL are still being logged before redaction. This could expose sensitive credentials to unauthorized parties who have access to the logs.
  - Step 1: An attacker gains access to application logs where `go-retryablehttp` library logs requests.
  - Step 2: The application makes HTTP requests using `go-retryablehttp` with basic authentication credentials embedded in the URL (e.g., `http://user:password@example.com/api/resource`).
  - Step 3: The `go-retryablehttp` library logs the request URL, potentially including the basic authentication credentials before the `redactURL` function can fully sanitize it, or in other logging contexts where redaction is not applied.
  - Step 4: The logs are stored or transmitted in a way that is accessible to the attacker.
  - Step 5: The attacker reads the logs and extracts the exposed basic authentication credentials.
- Impact: Exposure of sensitive basic authentication credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to protected resources.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: The project includes a `redactURL` function in `client.go` that aims to mask passwords within URLs before logging. Changelog in `CHANGELOG.md` mentions "client: avoid potentially leaking URL-embedded basic authentication credentials in logs (#158)" in version 0.7.7, indicating a fix has been implemented.
- Missing mitigations: While a mitigation has been implemented, a thorough review of all logging points is recommended to ensure no credentials are leaked in any circumstances. More robust credential scrubbing mechanisms could be considered. Guidance to users to avoid embedding credentials in URLs and use header-based authentication or secret management practices would also be beneficial.
- Preconditions:
  - Application using `go-retryablehttp` library logs requests.
  - Application uses basic authentication by embedding credentials in the URL.
  - An attacker gains access to the application logs.
- Source code analysis:
  - In `client.go`, the `redactURL` function is used before logging the URL in `Client.Do` at debug and error level.
  - `redactURL` function in `client.go`:
    ```go
    func redactURL(u *url.URL) string {
        if u == nil {
            return ""
        }

        ru := *u
        if _, has := ru.User.Password(); has {
            ru.User = url.UserPassword(ru.User.Username(), "xxxxx")
        }
        return ru.String()
    }
    ```
  - The `redactURL` function specifically targets the `url.User` part to redact the password. However, credentials might be present in other parts of the URL (path, query parameters) or might be logged in different contexts before redaction is applied.
- Security test case:
  - Step 1: Set up a mock HTTP server (e.g., using `net/http/httptest`) that requires basic authentication.
  - Step 2: Configure the mock server to simply echo back the request URL in the response body for verification purposes.
  - Step 3: Create a `retryablehttp.Client` instance in a test Go program.
  - Step 4: Configure the `retryablehttp.Client` to use the standard `log.Logger` to capture logs to standard error or a buffer for inspection.
  - Step 5: Construct a `retryablehttp.Request` with basic authentication credentials embedded in the URL path (e.g., `http://user:password@localhost:<port>/api/resource`).
  - Step 6: Execute the request using `client.Do(req)`.
  - Step 7: Inspect the logs captured by `log.Logger`.
  - Step 8: Verify if the raw basic authentication credentials (like `user:password`) are present in the logs before any redaction is applied. Check for logs at debug and error levels.
  - Step 9: If credentials are found in the logs, the vulnerability is present. If credentials are consistently redacted in all relevant log outputs, the mitigation is effective in this specific scenario. Repeat with credentials in different parts of the URL if needed for thorough testing.
