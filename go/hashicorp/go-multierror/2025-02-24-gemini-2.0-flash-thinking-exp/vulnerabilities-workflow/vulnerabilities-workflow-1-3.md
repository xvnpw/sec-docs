### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Format String Vulnerability in Error Formatting
- Description: The `ListFormatFunc` in `format.go`, which serves as the default error formatter for `multierror.Error`, utilizes `fmt.Sprintf` to format each error within the error list. If an error string in the `multierror.Error` contains format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%v`, `%x`), these specifiers will be interpreted by `fmt.Sprintf`. This behavior can lead to a format string vulnerability, potentially enabling information disclosure or causing unexpected program behavior. An attacker who can control the error messages added to a `multierror.Error` could exploit this vulnerability when the error message is displayed or logged.
- Impact: Information Disclosure. A malicious actor might be able to craft specific error messages containing format specifiers to potentially leak sensitive information from the application's memory or internal state. In less critical scenarios, this could result in malformed error messages or program crashes if invalid format strings are used.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None. The code directly employs `fmt.Sprintf` within the `ListFormatFunc` without any input sanitization or escaping of error strings, leaving the system vulnerable to format string injection.
- Missing mitigations: To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to sanitize or escape error strings before they are processed by `fmt.Sprintf` in `ListFormatFunc`. This could involve replacing format specifiers with their escaped equivalents or using a safer formatting approach that does not interpret format specifiers in the error messages. For instance, using `%q` format specifier in `fmt.Sprintf` would escape the error strings, preventing interpretation of format specifiers.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to have the ability to influence or control the content of error messages that are subsequently added to a `multierror.Error` instance. This could occur in scenarios where error messages are generated based on user input or external data.
    - The `Error()` method of the `multierror.Error` object must be invoked, and the resulting error string must be utilized in a context where the attacker can observe it. Common examples include logging systems, error responses in APIs, or displayed error messages in user interfaces.
    - The application must be using the default `ListFormatFunc` or a custom `ErrorFormatFunc` that unsafely employs `fmt.Sprintf` to format error messages without proper sanitization.
- Source code analysis:
    - In the file `/code/format.go`, the `ListFormatFunc` is defined as follows:
      ```go
      func ListFormatFunc(es []error) string {
          if len(es) == 1 {
              return fmt.Sprintf("1 error occurred:\n\t* %s\n\n", es[0])
          }

          points := make([]string, len(es))
          for i, err := range es {
              points[i] = fmt.Sprintf("* %s", err) // Vulnerable line
          }

          return fmt.Sprintf(
              "%d errors occurred:\n\t%s\n\n",
              len(es), strings.Join(points, "\n\t"))
      }
      ```
      The line `points[i] = fmt.Sprintf("* %s", err)` is the source of the vulnerability. It uses the `%s` format specifier to incorporate the error string `err.Error()` into the formatted output. If `err.Error()` itself contains format specifiers, `fmt.Sprintf` will interpret them, leading to the format string vulnerability.
    - In `/code/multierror.go`, the `Error()` method is defined to use `ListFormatFunc` as the default formatter:
      ```go
      func (e *Error) Error() string {
          fn := e.ErrorFormat
          if fn == nil {
              fn = ListFormatFunc // Default formatter
          }

          return fn(e.Errors)
      }
      ```
      This confirms that by default, `ListFormatFunc` is used to format the error message, and therefore, the format string vulnerability is present by default.
- Security test case:
    1. Create a Go file named `main.go` with the following content:
       ```go
       package main

       import (
           "errors"
           "fmt"
           "github.com/hashicorp/go-multierror"
       )

       func main() {
           var multiErr *multierror.Error
           payloadErr := errors.New("Format string: %s%s") // Error with format specifiers
           multiErr = multierror.Append(multiErr, payloadErr)
           errorString := multiErr.Error() // Get the formatted error string
           fmt.Println(errorString)       // Print the error string
       }
       ```
    2. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing `main.go`, and run the program using `go run main.go`.
    3. Observe the output in the terminal. If the output is similar to:
       ```text
       1 error occurred:
       	* Format string: %!s(MISSING)%!s(MISSING)
       ```
       This indicates that `fmt.Sprintf` has interpreted `%s%s` as format specifiers, even though no arguments were provided for them, thus confirming the format string vulnerability. If the output is exactly `1 error occurred:\n\t* Format string: %s%s\n\n`, then the vulnerability is not present or the test case is not correctly demonstrating it. However, based on the code analysis, the interpretation of `%s%s` is expected, confirming the vulnerability.
