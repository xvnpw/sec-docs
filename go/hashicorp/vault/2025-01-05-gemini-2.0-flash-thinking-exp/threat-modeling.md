# Threat Model Analysis for hashicorp/vault

## Threat: [Compromised Application Authentication to Vault](./threats/compromised_application_authentication_to_vault.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gains access to Vault by compromising the authentication method used by the application. This could involve stealing an authentication token, exploiting a vulnerability in the authentication process (e.g., replay attack), or compromising the credentials used for AppRole login. Once authenticated as the application, the attacker can perform actions authorized for that application.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to secrets intended for the application, potential data breaches if those secrets are sensitive, ability to manipulate Vault configurations if the application has write permissions.
* **Affected Component:** Authentication Modules (e.g., Token, AppRole, Kubernetes auth method).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Utilize strong authentication methods and adhere to the principle of least privilege when configuring authentication.
    * Regularly rotate authentication tokens and credentials.
    * Consider using short-lived tokens where applicable.
    * Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious authentication attempts.

## Threat: [Insufficiently Granular Access Control Policies](./threats/insufficiently_granular_access_control_policies.md)

* **Description:** Vault policies grant the application broader access than necessary. An attacker who successfully compromises the application (or otherwise gains access to Vault with the application's identity) could then leverage these overly permissive policies to access secrets beyond the application's intended scope.
* **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information that the application should not have access to, potentially leading to wider data breaches.
* **Affected Component:** Policy Engine, specific Vault Policies associated with the application.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement fine-grained access control policies based on the principle of least privilege.
    * Regularly review and audit Vault policies to ensure they are still appropriate.
    * Use path-based policies to restrict access to specific secrets or secret paths.

## Threat: [Compromised Transit Key (if using Transit Secrets Engine)](./threats/compromised_transit_key__if_using_transit_secrets_engine_.md)

* **Description:** If the application utilizes Vault's Transit Secrets Engine for encryption/decryption, and the Transit key is compromised, an attacker could decrypt data previously encrypted with that key or encrypt data to impersonate the application.
* **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data encrypted using the compromised Transit key, ability for attackers to encrypt malicious data.
* **Affected Component:** Transit Secrets Engine, specific named encryption keys.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strong key management practices for Transit keys, including secure storage of the root key and regular key rotation.
    * Follow HashiCorp's recommendations for key derivation and configuration.
    * Implement audit logging for Transit key usage.

## Threat: [Leaked Dynamic Credentials (if using Dynamic Secrets)](./threats/leaked_dynamic_credentials__if_using_dynamic_secrets_.md)

* **Description:** If the application uses Vault's dynamic secrets feature (e.g., database credentials), vulnerabilities within the dynamic secrets engine or its configuration could lead to the exposure of these credentials. An attacker could then use these credentials to directly access the underlying resource (e.g., the database).
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend systems, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
* **Affected Component:** Dynamic Secrets Engines (e.g., database secrets engine).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Configure dynamic secrets engines with appropriate security settings and lease durations.
    * Regularly review and audit the configuration of dynamic secrets engines.

## Threat: [Vault Service Availability Issues](./threats/vault_service_availability_issues.md)

* **Description:** If the Vault service becomes unavailable due to a denial-of-service attack or infrastructure failure targeting Vault itself, the application will be unable to retrieve necessary secrets.
* **Impact:** Application failure, inability to perform critical functions, potential security degradation if the application relies on Vault for authorization or encryption.
* **Affected Component:** Entire Vault service and its underlying infrastructure.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement high availability for the Vault infrastructure.
    * Monitor Vault's health and performance.
    * Have contingency plans in place for Vault outages.

## Threat: [Compromised Vault Infrastructure](./threats/compromised_vault_infrastructure.md)

* **Description:** If the underlying infrastructure hosting the Vault service is compromised, an attacker could potentially gain access to Vault's data, including secrets and configuration.
* **Impact:** Catastrophic data breach, complete compromise of all secrets managed by Vault.
* **Affected Component:** The entire Vault service, its storage backend, and the underlying operating system and network infrastructure.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement robust security measures for the Vault infrastructure, including network segmentation, access control, and regular security patching.
    * Follow security best practices for the operating system and any other software components involved.
    * Regularly audit the security of the Vault infrastructure.

## Threat: [Key Management Issues for Vault (Unseal Keys, Root Token)](./threats/key_management_issues_for_vault__unseal_keys__root_token_.md)

* **Description:** If the unseal keys or the initial root token for the Vault instance are compromised, an attacker could gain complete control over the Vault instance, including the ability to decrypt secrets and modify configurations.
* **Impact:** Complete compromise of all secrets managed by Vault.
* **Affected Component:** Core Vault functionality related to sealing and unsealing, the storage of unseal keys and the root token.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement secure key management practices for Vault's unseal keys, following HashiCorp's recommendations (e.g., Shamir Secret Sharing).
    * Securely store and manage the initial root token and rotate it as needed.
    * Restrict access to the machines and systems where unseal keys are managed.
