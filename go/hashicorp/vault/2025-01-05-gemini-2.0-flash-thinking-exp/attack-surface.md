# Attack Surface Analysis for hashicorp/vault

## Attack Surface: [Unpatched Vault Server Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/unpatched_vault_server_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws or bugs within the Vault server software itself that can be exploited by attackers.
    *   **How Vault Contributes:**  The dependency on the Vault binary introduces the risk of vulnerabilities within that specific codebase.
    *   **Example:** A remote code execution vulnerability in the Vault API allows an attacker to gain control of the Vault server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Vault server, leading to unauthorized access to all secrets, potential data breaches, and disruption of services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Vault to the latest stable version, applying security patches promptly.
        *   Subscribe to Vault security advisories and mailing lists to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a robust patching process and schedule for Vault infrastructure.

## Attack Surface: [Vault Server Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/vault_server_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured settings on the Vault server that create security weaknesses.
    *   **How Vault Contributes:** The complexity of Vault's configuration options introduces the possibility of human error and misconfiguration.
    *   **Example:** Leaving the root token enabled in production, using default listener configurations without TLS, or misconfiguring audit logging.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to Vault, exposure of secrets, difficulty in detecting attacks, and potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow Vault's security hardening guidelines and best practices.
        *   Disable the root token after initial setup and rely on other authentication methods.
        *   Enforce TLS for all Vault communication.
        *   Properly configure and monitor audit logs.
        *   Use infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to manage Vault configuration and ensure consistency.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Compromised Vault Authentication Credentials/Tokens](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_compromised_vault_authentication_credentialstokens.md)

*   **Description:**  Using easily guessable or stolen authentication credentials or Vault tokens.
    *   **How Vault Contributes:** Vault's reliance on authentication mechanisms makes it vulnerable to attacks targeting these mechanisms.
    *   **Example:** An attacker obtains a long-lived Vault token through phishing or by compromising a developer's machine and uses it to access secrets.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to secrets based on the permissions associated with the compromised credentials or token.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for authentication methods like username/password (if used).
        *   Implement robust token management practices, including short-lived tokens and regular rotation.
        *   Utilize secure token storage mechanisms on client applications.
        *   Leverage authentication methods that integrate with existing identity providers (e.g., LDAP, OIDC, cloud IAM).
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Secrets Engine Configuration or Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/insecure_secrets_engine_configuration_or_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigured secrets engines or vulnerabilities within the specific secrets engine implementation.
    *   **How Vault Contributes:** The use of various secrets engines expands the attack surface to include the specific implementation and configuration of each engine.
    *   **Example:**  Storing sensitive information directly within the configuration of a secrets engine, using default credentials for backend services managed by a secrets engine, or a bug in a custom secrets engine allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of secrets managed by the affected secrets engine, potential compromise of backend systems if their credentials are leaked.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow the security guidelines specific to each secrets engine being used.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive data directly in secrets engine configurations.
        *   Rotate credentials managed by secrets engines regularly.
        *   Carefully evaluate and audit custom secrets engines for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement least privilege principles for access to secrets engine configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of the Vault Server's Underlying Infrastructure](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_the_vault_server's_underlying_infrastructure.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gaining access to the host machine, container, or virtual machine running the Vault server.
    *   **How Vault Contributes:** Vault relies on the security of the underlying infrastructure it's deployed on.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the operating system or container runtime hosting the Vault server, gaining root access and the ability to access Vault's data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Vault server and its data, including the ability to decrypt secrets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the operating system and infrastructure hosting the Vault server.
        *   Keep the underlying infrastructure patched and up-to-date.
        *   Implement strong access controls and network segmentation for the Vault infrastructure.
        *   Use secure container images and regularly scan them for vulnerabilities.
