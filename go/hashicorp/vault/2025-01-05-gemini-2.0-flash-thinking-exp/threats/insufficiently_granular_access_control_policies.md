        )
        print(
            "* **Stolen Application Credentials:** If the application's authentication credentials for Vault are compromised (e.g., leaked AppRole Secret ID), an attacker can impersonate the application."

        )
        print(
            "* **Compliance Violations:** Accessing and potentially exposing data that the application shouldn't have access to can lead to regulatory compliance issues (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)."

        print(
            "* **Grant Minimal Capabilities:** Only grant the necessary capabilities (e.g., `read` only, not `create` or `update`) for each path. Review the available capabilities for each secret engine."
        )
        print(
            "* **Leverage Parameterized Policies:**  Utilize templating to create policies that are specific to the application instance or environment. For example, use `auth.accessor` or `identity.entity.name` in policy paths to restrict access based on the application's identity."
