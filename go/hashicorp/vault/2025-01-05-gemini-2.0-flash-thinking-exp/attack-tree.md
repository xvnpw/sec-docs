## Attack Tree Path: [Steal Vault Token](./attack_tree_paths/steal_vault_token.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within the application itself to gain access to a valid Vault token. This could involve the application unintentionally logging the token, storing it in an insecure location (e.g., easily accessible configuration files), or exposing it through an API endpoint without proper authorization.

**Why High-Risk:** The likelihood is medium because application vulnerabilities are common, and the impact is high as a valid token grants significant access to Vault resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit AppRole Authentication Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_approle_authentication_weaknesses.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker targets the AppRole authentication method. This path involves either obtaining valid Role ID and Secret ID through application vulnerabilities or exploiting known vulnerabilities in the authentication plugin used by Vault to verify AppRole credentials.

**Why High-Risk:** The likelihood is medium due to potential weaknesses in application security for managing AppRole credentials and the possibility of unpatched vulnerabilities in authentication plugins. The impact is high as successful exploitation grants access to resources authorized for that AppRole.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vault API or Feature Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vault_api_or_feature_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker directly interacts with the Vault API to exploit known vulnerabilities (CVEs) that haven't been patched or abuses misconfigured features within Vault. This could involve exploiting weaknesses in secrets engine configurations or manipulating audit logging settings.

**Why High-Risk:** The likelihood is medium due to the continuous discovery of new vulnerabilities in software and the potential for misconfigurations. The impact is high as successful exploitation can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or the ability to hide malicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Policy Definition Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_policy_definition_weaknesses.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages weaknesses in how Vault policies are defined. This involves crafting or manipulating policies to grant themselves excessive or unintended permissions within Vault, allowing them to bypass intended access controls.

**Why High-Risk:** The likelihood is medium as policy definition can be complex and prone to errors. The impact is high as successful exploitation can lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Vault Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_vault_credentials.md)

**Attack Vector:**  This represents the overarching goal of obtaining valid credentials to authenticate to Vault. This can be achieved through various methods.

**Why Critical:**  Successful credential compromise grants direct access to Vault's resources, bypassing intended security controls and enabling further malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application Vulnerability Exposing Token (e.g., logging, insecure storage)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application_vulnerability_exposing_token__e_g___logging__insecure_storage_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  The application inadvertently reveals a valid Vault token through insecure practices like logging it or storing it in an easily accessible location.

**Why Critical:** This is a common and often easily exploitable weakness in application security, directly leading to credential compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain AppRole Role ID and Secret ID](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_approle_role_id_and_secret_id.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker successfully retrieves the necessary Role ID and Secret ID for an AppRole. This could be through exploiting application vulnerabilities or other means.

**Why Critical:**  Having both the Role ID and Secret ID allows an attacker to authenticate as that AppRole and access associated secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application Vulnerability Exposing Role ID/Secret ID](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application_vulnerability_exposing_role_idsecret_id.md)

**Attack Vector:** Similar to token exposure, the application might insecurely handle or expose AppRole credentials.

**Why Critical:** This is a direct route to obtaining valid AppRole credentials, bypassing intended security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Standard Authentication Plugins (e.g., LDAP, Kubernetes)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_standard_authentication_plugins__e_g___ldap__kubernetes_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the authentication plugins used by Vault to verify user or application identities.

**Why Critical:** These are often widely known and potentially easily exploitable if Vault and its plugins are not kept up-to-date. Successful exploitation can grant broad access to Vault.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vault Vulnerabilities (CVEs)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vault_vulnerabilities__cves_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the Vault software itself.

**Why Critical:** Unpatched vulnerabilities in Vault can provide direct pathways for attackers to compromise the system, potentially gaining access to all stored secrets and configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in Secrets Engine Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_secrets_engine_configuration.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers take advantage of misconfigurations within specific secrets engines. This could involve using default credentials, exploiting weak access controls, or finding ways to access secrets they shouldn't.

**Why Critical:** Secrets engines are where sensitive data is stored. Weaknesses here directly expose that data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Default Credentials in Database Secrets Engines](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_default_credentials_in_database_secrets_engines.md)

**Attack Vector:**  A common misconfiguration where default credentials provided by the secrets engine are not changed, allowing attackers to easily access the underlying database.

**Why Critical:** This is a very low-effort attack with a high impact, granting direct access to the often critical databases managed by the secrets engine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in Audit Logging Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_audit_logging_configuration.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate the audit logging configuration to disable logging or tamper with existing logs to hide their malicious activity.

**Why Critical:** While not directly leading to data compromise, disabling or tampering with audit logs severely hinders detection and incident response, allowing attackers to operate undetected.
