# Attack Surface Analysis for hashicorp/vault

## Attack Surface: [Vault API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/vault_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of security flaws within Vault's HTTP API endpoints.
    *   **How Vault Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Vault exposes a comprehensive API for managing secrets, authentication, and policies. Vulnerabilities in this API can directly lead to unauthorized access or control.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits an unpatched vulnerability in the `/v1/auth/token/create` endpoint to generate tokens with elevated privileges.
    *   **Impact:**  Critical. Could lead to complete compromise of secrets, policies, and potentially the underlying infrastructure managed by Vault.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Vault server updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application side when interacting with the Vault API.
        *   Enforce strict authentication and authorization for all API requests.
        *   Regularly audit Vault's API access logs for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Vault Token Compromise](./attack_surfaces/vault_token_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized acquisition of Vault authentication tokens.
    *   **How Vault Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Vault relies on tokens for authentication. If these tokens are compromised, attackers can impersonate legitimate users or applications.
    *   **Example:** A developer accidentally commits a Vault token to a public Git repository.
    *   **Impact:** High. Attackers can gain access to secrets and perform actions authorized by the compromised token. The scope depends on the token's policies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce short token TTLs (Time-to-Live) and encourage frequent token renewal.
        *   Implement secure token storage and handling practices within the application. Avoid storing tokens in plain text or easily accessible locations.
        *   Utilize Vault's token revocation mechanisms when tokens are suspected of being compromised.
        *   Consider using more secure authentication methods like AppRoles or cloud provider-specific authentication.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Vault ACL Policies](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_vault_acl_policies.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured Access Control List (ACL) policies granting excessive permissions.
    *   **How Vault Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Vault's security model heavily relies on ACL policies to control access to secrets and operations. Misconfigurations can inadvertently grant unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** An overly permissive policy allows a development team to access production database credentials.
    *   **Impact:** High. Unauthorized access to sensitive secrets, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining ACL policies. Grant only the necessary permissions.
        *   Implement a review process for all ACL policy changes.
        *   Use Vault's policy templating features to manage policies effectively.
        *   Regularly audit and review existing ACL policies to ensure they are still appropriate.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Vault Authentication Methods](./attack_surfaces/compromised_vault_authentication_methods.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the authentication methods used to access Vault.
    *   **How Vault Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Vault supports various authentication methods (e.g., username/password, LDAP, Kubernetes). Weaknesses in these methods can allow attackers to bypass authentication.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits an LDAP injection vulnerability in the configured LDAP authentication method to gain access to Vault.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Allows attackers to authenticate as legitimate users or applications, gaining access to secrets and potentially administrative control.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the underlying authentication infrastructure (e.g., secure LDAP servers, enforce strong password policies).
        *   Keep authentication method plugins updated to the latest versions.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where supported by the authentication method.
        *   Regularly review and audit the configuration of authentication methods.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage Backend (Focus on Vault's Contribution)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_backend__focus_on_vault's_contribution_.md)

*   **Description:** Compromise of the underlying storage backend used by Vault, potentially exposing encrypted data if encryption keys are also compromised or weak.
    *   **How Vault Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Vault relies on a storage backend (e.g., Consul, etcd) to store its *encrypted* data. Weaknesses in Vault's encryption key management or the ability to access the storage backend directly bypasses Vault's intended security.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the etcd cluster used by Vault and, through separate means, compromises the Vault's encryption key, allowing decryption of the stored secrets.
    *   **Impact:** High. Exposure of sensitive secrets if the storage backend is compromised and encryption is broken.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the storage backend infrastructure with strong authentication, authorization, and network segmentation.
        *   Ensure Vault's encryption keys are securely managed and rotated regularly.
        *   Encrypt the storage backend data at rest using strong encryption algorithms, independent of Vault's encryption if possible (defense in depth).
        *   Regularly back up the storage backend data and store backups securely.
        *   Monitor the storage backend for unauthorized access or suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Vault Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/vault_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of security flaws within custom or third-party Vault plugins (authentication methods, secrets engines).
    *   **How Vault Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Vault's extensibility through plugins introduces a potential attack surface if these plugins contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited to bypass Vault's security controls.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a custom secrets engine allows an attacker to bypass access controls and retrieve secrets managed by that engine.
    *   **Impact:** High. Could lead to unauthorized access to secrets or other sensitive data managed by the vulnerable plugin.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit all custom or third-party Vault plugins before deployment.
        *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow secure development practices when creating custom plugins.
        *   Limit the use of non-essential plugins to reduce the attack surface.
