# Threat Model Analysis for hashicorp/vault

## Threat: [Compromised Unseal Keys](./threats/compromised_unseal_keys.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the Shamir secret sharing key shares or the auto-unseal mechanism's decryption key. They can then use these keys to unseal the Vault without proper authorization.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of Vault, allowing the attacker to access all stored secrets.

**Affected Component:** Unseal Process/Key Management

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Securely store and manage unseal key shares, following best practices for key management (e.g., physical security, separation of duties).
*   For auto-unseal, use robust KMS solutions with strong access controls and auditing.
*   Regularly review and audit access to unseal keys and auto-unseal configurations.

## Threat: [Policy Injection](./threats/policy_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates input used in policy path lookups or policy definitions, potentially through vulnerabilities in the application's interaction with the Vault API. This allows them to bypass intended access controls or create malicious policies.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to secrets, potential for privilege escalation within Vault, ability to disrupt Vault operations.

**Affected Component:** Policy Engine, API

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize all inputs used when interacting with the Vault API, especially for policy paths and data.
*   Implement the principle of least privilege when designing and assigning policies.
*   Regularly review and audit policy definitions for unexpected or overly permissive rules.

## Threat: [Compromised Authentication Method Credentials](./threats/compromised_authentication_method_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to credentials used by an application or user to authenticate with Vault (e.g., AppRole Role ID and Secret ID, Kubernetes service account tokens).

**Impact:** The attacker can impersonate the legitimate application or user and access secrets they are authorized for.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Methods (e.g., AppRole, Kubernetes, LDAP)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Securely manage and rotate authentication credentials.
*   For AppRole, use Secret ID wrapping and consider using the `renewable` option.
*   For Kubernetes authentication, follow best practices for securing service accounts.
*   Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication where applicable for user-based authentication methods.

## Threat: [Token Leaks](./threats/token_leaks.md)

**Description:** Vault tokens are unintentionally exposed through logging, insecure storage, or transmission. An attacker who obtains a valid token can use it to access secrets.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to secrets associated with the leaked token.

**Affected Component:** Token Management, API

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid logging Vault tokens.
*   Do not store tokens persistently unless absolutely necessary, and if so, encrypt them at rest.
*   Use short-lived tokens with appropriate TTLs.
*   Implement token revocation mechanisms and use them when necessary.
*   Ensure secure communication channels (HTTPS) are used for all Vault API interactions.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage Backend Configuration](./threats/insecure_storage_backend_configuration.md)

**Description:** The underlying storage backend used by Vault (e.g., Consul, etcd) is misconfigured or lacks proper security measures. An attacker could potentially bypass Vault and directly access the stored secrets.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of Vault secrets.

**Affected Component:** Storage Backend

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the misconfiguration)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Harden the storage backend according to its security best practices.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to the storage backend.
*   Encrypt data at rest within the storage backend.
*   Regularly patch and update the storage backend software.

## Threat: [Failure to Rotate Root Token](./threats/failure_to_rotate_root_token.md)

**Description:** The initial root token is not rotated after initial setup and remains in use. If this token is compromised, an attacker gains full administrative control over Vault.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of Vault, allowing the attacker to access all stored secrets and modify configurations.

**Affected Component:** Token Management

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Rotate the root token immediately after initial Vault setup.
*   Securely store the new root token (ideally, it should be used very rarely).
*   Prefer using more granular authentication methods and policies for day-to-day operations.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Vault Client Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_vault_client_libraries.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the client libraries used by the application to interact with the Vault API.

**Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution within the application, leading to secret exfiltration or other malicious actions.

**Affected Component:** API Clients (language-specific libraries)

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use official and well-maintained Vault client libraries.
*   Keep client libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Follow secure coding practices when using client libraries.
