## Attack Tree Path: [Steal Vault Token](./attack_tree_paths/steal_vault_token.md)

Attackers aim to obtain a valid Vault token to impersonate an authorized entity.
    * **Application Logs Token (High-Risk Path):** If the application inadvertently logs Vault tokens, attackers can retrieve them.
        * **Actionable Insight:** Implement strict logging practices, ensuring sensitive data like tokens are masked or excluded from logs.
    * **Memory Dump of Application Process (Critical Node):** Attackers with access to the application server could dump the process memory and potentially find tokens.
        * **Actionable Insight:** Employ memory protection techniques and secure coding practices to minimize the risk of exposing secrets in memory.
    * **Network Interception (Critical Node):** If communication between the application and Vault isn't properly secured (e.g., missing TLS), attackers can intercept tokens.
        * **Actionable Insight:** Enforce TLS encryption for all communication with Vault. Consider mutual TLS for enhanced security.
    * **Compromise Developer Machine (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):** If a developer's machine with access to Vault tokens is compromised, attackers can steal them.
        * **Actionable Insight:** Implement strong endpoint security measures, including MFA, on developer machines.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Authentication Method](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_authentication_method.md)

Attackers target inherent weaknesses in the chosen authentication method.
    * **Default/Weak AppRole Credentials (High-Risk Path):** If default or easily guessable AppRole IDs and Secret IDs are used, attackers can authenticate.
        * **Actionable Insight:** Ensure strong, unique, and randomly generated AppRole IDs and Secret IDs. Rotate them regularly.
    * **Exploitable Authentication Plugin (Critical Node):** Vulnerabilities in custom or third-party authentication plugins could be exploited.
        * **Actionable Insight:** Regularly update Vault and all its plugins. Review the security of any custom plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Existing Valid Token](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_existing_valid_token.md)

Attackers might obtain a legitimate token and misuse it.
    * **Token with Excessive Permissions (High-Risk Path):** If a token has more permissions than necessary, attackers can access resources beyond their intended scope.
        * **Actionable Insight:** Implement the principle of least privilege when granting token permissions. Use granular policies to restrict access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Unauthorized Secrets](./attack_tree_paths/access_unauthorized_secrets.md)

Attackers aim to access secrets they are not authorized to view.
    * **Policy Misconfiguration (High-Risk Path):** Incorrectly configured Vault policies can grant unintended access to secrets.
        * **Actionable Insight:** Implement thorough policy reviews and use automated tools to test policy effectiveness.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Secrets Through Application Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/expose_secrets_through_application_vulnerability.md)

The application itself might inadvertently expose secrets retrieved from Vault.
    * **Logging Secrets (High-Risk Path):** The application might log the actual secret values retrieved from Vault.
        * **Actionable Insight:** Implement secure logging practices, ensuring secrets are never logged in plain text. Use masking or redaction techniques.
    * **Insecure Secret Handling in Application Code (High-Risk Path):** Vulnerabilities in how the application handles secrets in memory or during processing could lead to exposure.
        * **Actionable Insight:** Provide secure coding training to developers and conduct thorough code reviews to identify and fix insecure secret handling practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Vault's Backend Storage](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_vault's_backend_storage.md)

If the underlying storage for Vault (e.g., Consul, etcd) is compromised, attackers can gain access to the encrypted secrets.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Implement strong encryption at rest for Vault's backend storage and enforce strict access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Vault Itself](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_vault_itself.md)

Attackers might exploit known vulnerabilities in the Vault software.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Regularly update Vault to the latest stable version and subscribe to HashiCorp's security advisories to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle_attack.md)

Attackers intercept communication between the application and Vault to steal tokens or secrets.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Enforce TLS encryption for all communication with Vault. Consider using mutual TLS for stronger authentication.
