# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for hashicorp/vault

## Mitigation Strategy: [Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Vault Deployment and Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/infrastructure_as_code__iac__for_vault_deployment_and_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose an IaC tool:** Select a suitable Infrastructure as Code tool like Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager, or Google Cloud Deployment Manager.
    2.  **Define Vault Infrastructure:**  Write IaC code to provision the underlying infrastructure for Vault, including virtual machines or containers, networking components (VPCs, subnets, security groups), and storage.
    3.  **Define Vault Configuration:**  Use IaC to configure Vault settings such as:
        *   Storage backend (e.g., Consul, etcd, file).
        *   Listener configuration (ports, TLS settings).
        *   Audit logging configuration.
        *   Initial policies and authentication methods.
    4.  **Version Control IaC Code:** Store all IaC code in a version control system like Git.
    5.  **Automate Deployment:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy and update Vault infrastructure and configuration from the version-controlled IaC code.
    6.  **Regularly Review and Update IaC:** Periodically review and update the IaC code to reflect changes in security best practices, application requirements, or infrastructure needs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misconfiguration (High Severity):** Manual configuration is prone to errors, leading to insecure Vault setups (e.g., weak TLS, permissive policies, disabled audit logs).
    *   **Inconsistent Deployments (Medium Severity):** Manual deployments across different environments (dev, staging, production) can lead to inconsistencies and security gaps.
    *   **Lack of Auditability for Configuration Changes (Low Severity):**  Manual changes are harder to track and audit, making it difficult to identify and revert misconfigurations.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Misconfiguration (High):** High impact reduction. IaC enforces consistent and predefined configurations, minimizing manual errors.
    *   **Inconsistent Deployments (Medium):** High impact reduction. IaC ensures identical configurations across environments, reducing environment-specific vulnerabilities.
    *   **Lack of Auditability for Configuration Changes (Low):** Medium impact reduction. Version control provides a clear audit trail of all configuration changes.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Vault infrastructure is provisioned manually using cloud provider consoles. Basic configuration is managed through shell scripts executed during initial setup.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Full IaC adoption for both Vault infrastructure and configuration. Automation of deployments and updates via a CI/CD pipeline is missing. Version control is not consistently used for configuration scripts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Apply the Principle of Least Privilege for Vault Policies](./mitigation_strategies/apply_the_principle_of_least_privilege_for_vault_policies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Application Needs:** For each application or service that interacts with Vault, clearly define the specific secrets and operations it requires.
    2.  **Create Granular Policies:** Design Vault policies that grant only the minimum necessary permissions to access those specific secrets and perform required operations.
        *   Use specific path prefixes and capabilities (e.g., `read`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `list`) in policies.
        *   Avoid wildcard paths (`*`) and overly broad capabilities unless absolutely necessary.
    3.  **Assign Policies to Roles/Groups:**  Create Vault roles or groups and assign the finely-grained policies to these roles/groups.
    4.  **Map Applications to Roles/Groups:**  Configure applications to authenticate to Vault using methods that associate them with the appropriate roles/groups (e.g., AppRole, Kubernetes Service Account tokens).
    5.  **Regularly Review and Refine Policies:** Periodically review Vault policies to ensure they remain aligned with application needs and security best practices. Remove any unnecessary permissions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Secret Access (High Severity):** Permissive policies can allow applications or compromised tokens to access secrets they shouldn't, leading to data breaches or privilege escalation.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):** If one application is compromised, overly broad policies could allow the attacker to access secrets intended for other applications, facilitating lateral movement within the system.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Secret Access (High):** High impact reduction. Least privilege policies significantly limit the scope of access, minimizing the impact of compromised applications or tokens.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium):** Medium to High impact reduction. Restricting access reduces the potential for attackers to move laterally and access sensitive data across different applications.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic policies are in place, but they are somewhat broad and not always strictly adhering to least privilege. Some applications might have more permissions than strictly necessary.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Refinement of existing policies to be more granular and strictly adhere to least privilege.  Regular policy reviews and automated policy enforcement are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Enforce TLS for All Vault Communication](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_enforce_tls_for_all_vault_communication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate TLS Certificates:** Obtain or generate TLS certificates for the Vault server and any clients that will communicate with it. Use a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or a private CA within your organization.
    2.  **Configure Vault Listener for TLS:** Configure the Vault listener to use TLS. Specify the paths to the server certificate and private key in the Vault listener configuration.
    3.  **Enforce TLS in Vault Configuration:**  Set Vault configuration options to enforce TLS for all client communication. This might involve settings like `tls_disable = false` and ensuring proper `tls_min_version` and `tls_cipher_suites`.
    4.  **Configure Clients to Use TLS:**  Configure all Vault clients (applications, command-line tools) to communicate with Vault over TLS. This typically involves specifying the Vault server address with `https://` and potentially providing the CA certificate to verify the Vault server's certificate.
    5.  **Regularly Rotate TLS Certificates:** Implement a process for regularly rotating TLS certificates for both the Vault server and clients to minimize the impact of certificate compromise.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Without TLS, communication between clients and Vault is in plaintext, allowing attackers to intercept sensitive secrets (tokens, database credentials, API keys) in transit.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** Without TLS, attackers can intercept and modify communication between clients and Vault, potentially stealing secrets or injecting malicious data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eavesdropping (High):** High impact reduction. TLS encrypts all communication, making it extremely difficult for attackers to eavesdrop on secret exchanges.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High):** High impact reduction. TLS provides authentication and integrity, making it very difficult for attackers to perform MITM attacks successfully.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Fully implemented. TLS is enabled for Vault listener and enforced for client communication. Certificates are managed manually.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Automation of TLS certificate rotation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Vault Audit Logging and Monitoring](./mitigation_strategies/enable_vault_audit_logging_and_monitoring.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Audit Logging:** Configure Vault to enable audit logging to a secure and reliable backend (e.g., file, syslog, cloud storage).
    2.  **Configure Comprehensive Audit Logging:** Ensure audit logging captures all relevant events, including:
        *   Authentication attempts (successful and failed).
        *   Policy changes.
        *   Secret access (read, create, update, delete, list).
        *   Token creation and revocation.
        *   Vault configuration changes.
    3.  **Integrate with SIEM System:** Integrate Vault audit logs with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.
    4.  **Set Up Real-time Monitoring and Alerting:** Configure the SIEM system to monitor Vault audit logs in real-time and generate alerts for suspicious activities, such as:
        *   Failed authentication attempts from unusual locations.
        *   Policy violations.
        *   Unusual secret access patterns.
        *   Changes to critical Vault configurations.
    5.  **Regularly Review Audit Logs:** Periodically review Vault audit logs to proactively identify and investigate potential security incidents or anomalies.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unnoticed Security Breaches (High Severity):** Without audit logging and monitoring, security breaches or malicious activities within Vault might go undetected for extended periods, leading to significant data loss or damage.
    *   **Delayed Incident Response (Medium Severity):** Lack of real-time monitoring delays incident detection and response, increasing the potential impact of security incidents.
    *   **Difficulty in Forensics and Post-Incident Analysis (Medium Severity):** Without comprehensive audit logs, it's challenging to perform effective forensics and post-incident analysis to understand the scope and root cause of security incidents.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unnoticed Security Breaches (High):** High impact reduction. Audit logging and monitoring provide visibility into Vault activity, enabling early detection of breaches.
    *   **Delayed Incident Response (Medium):** High impact reduction. Real-time alerts enable faster incident response and containment.
    *   **Difficulty in Forensics and Post-Incident Analysis (Medium):** High impact reduction. Comprehensive audit logs provide valuable data for incident investigation and analysis.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Audit logging is enabled to a local file. Basic monitoring of server health metrics is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Integration with a SIEM system. Real-time alerting for security events. Regular review of audit logs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Vault Disaster Recovery and High Availability](./mitigation_strategies/implement_vault_disaster_recovery_and_high_availability.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** Determine the acceptable data loss (RPO) and downtime (RTO) for Vault in case of a disaster.
    2.  **Choose a Disaster Recovery Strategy:** Select a suitable DR strategy, such as:
        *   **Warm Standby:** Maintain a secondary Vault cluster that is synchronized with the primary cluster and can be quickly activated in case of primary failure.
        *   **Cold Standby:**  Regularly back up Vault data and configuration to a separate location. In case of disaster, restore Vault from backup.
    3.  **Implement High Availability (HA):** Deploy Vault in an HA configuration with multiple active Vault servers to ensure continuous availability in case of individual server failures.
    4.  **Regularly Back Up Vault Data:** Implement a robust backup strategy to regularly back up Vault data (secrets, configuration, audit logs). Store backups securely and offsite.
    5.  **Test Disaster Recovery Plan Regularly:** Periodically test the disaster recovery plan to ensure it is effective and meets the defined RPO and RTO. Practice failover and failback procedures.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vault Service Outage (High Severity):** Hardware failures, software bugs, or natural disasters can cause Vault service outages, disrupting applications that rely on it and potentially leading to data unavailability or application downtime.
    *   **Data Loss (Medium Severity):** In case of catastrophic failures without proper backups, Vault data (secrets, configuration) could be lost, requiring manual recovery or data re-entry.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vault Service Outage (High):** High impact reduction. HA and DR strategies minimize downtime and ensure continuous Vault availability.
    *   **Data Loss (Medium):** High impact reduction. Regular backups and DR plans prevent permanent data loss in case of failures.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No implementation. Vault is running as a single instance without HA or DR capabilities. Backups are not regularly performed.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Implementation of Vault HA configuration. Development and testing of a disaster recovery plan. Automated backup process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Vault Client Libraries and SDKs](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_vault_client_libraries_and_sdks.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Appropriate Client Library/SDK:** Choose the official Vault client library or SDK provided by HashiCorp for the programming language used in your application (e.g., Go, Python, Java, Ruby, Node.js).
    2.  **Integrate Library/SDK into Application:**  Include the chosen Vault client library/SDK as a dependency in your application project.
    3.  **Use Library/SDK Functions for Vault Interaction:**  Utilize the functions and methods provided by the library/SDK for all interactions with Vault, including:
        *   Authentication.
        *   Token management (renewal, revocation).
        *   Secret retrieval (read, list).
        *   Secret writing (create, update).
    4.  **Avoid Custom Vault Client Logic:** Refrain from implementing custom logic for Vault interaction. Rely solely on the features provided by the official client library/SDK.
    5.  **Keep Library/SDK Updated:** Regularly update the Vault client library/SDK to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes, security patches, and new features.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerability in Custom Client Logic (Medium Severity):** Implementing custom Vault client logic can introduce security vulnerabilities due to improper handling of authentication, token management, or secret retrieval.
    *   **Inefficient or Insecure Vault Interaction (Medium Severity):** Custom client logic might not be as efficient or secure as optimized official libraries, potentially leading to performance issues or security weaknesses.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerability in Custom Client Logic (Medium):** Medium to High impact reduction. Using official libraries eliminates the risk of introducing vulnerabilities in custom client code.
    *   **Inefficient or Insecure Vault Interaction (Medium):** Medium impact reduction. Official libraries are designed for performance and security best practices.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Applications are using some Vault client libraries, but in some cases, direct HTTP API calls are still being made for certain operations.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Complete adoption of Vault client libraries/SDKs for all Vault interactions across all applications. Removal of direct HTTP API calls.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Short-Lived Tokens and Token Renewal](./mitigation_strategies/implement_short-lived_tokens_and_token_renewal.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Default Token TTLs:** Configure Vault to issue tokens with short default Time-To-Live (TTL) values. This can be set globally or per authentication method.
    2.  **Implement Token Renewal in Applications:**  Integrate token renewal logic into applications using Vault client libraries/SDKs.
        *   Before a token expires, the application should automatically renew it using the renewal endpoint provided by Vault.
        *   Implement error handling for token renewal failures and fallback mechanisms (e.g., re-authentication).
    3.  **Avoid Long-Lived Tokens:**  Minimize the use of long-lived tokens. Prefer short-lived tokens with automatic renewal whenever possible.
    4.  **Monitor Token Usage and Renewal:** Monitor token usage and renewal patterns to identify any anomalies or potential issues.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Token Compromise with Long Exposure (High Severity):** If a long-lived Vault token is compromised, it remains valid for an extended period, giving attackers ample time to exploit it and access secrets.
    *   **Stolen Token Replay (Medium Severity):**  Even if a token is compromised and quickly detected, a long-lived token can be replayed by an attacker for a longer duration before it expires.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Token Compromise with Long Exposure (High):** High impact reduction. Short-lived tokens significantly reduce the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit compromised tokens.
    *   **Stolen Token Replay (Medium):** Medium to High impact reduction. Shorter token validity limits the time window for successful token replay attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Default token TTLs are configured, but token renewal is not consistently implemented in all applications. Some applications still rely on manually managed, longer-lived tokens.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Consistent implementation of token renewal logic in all applications. Elimination of manually managed, long-lived tokens.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Dynamic Secrets Whenever Possible](./mitigation_strategies/use_dynamic_secrets_whenever_possible.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Services Supporting Dynamic Secrets:** Determine which services used by your applications (e.g., databases, cloud providers) support Vault's dynamic secrets feature.
    2.  **Configure Dynamic Secret Engines in Vault:** Enable and configure dynamic secret engines in Vault for the identified services.
        *   Configure connection details for the target service (e.g., database connection string).
        *   Define roles and policies for generating dynamic credentials.
    3.  **Update Applications to Use Dynamic Secrets:** Modify applications to request dynamic secrets from Vault instead of using static, long-lived credentials.
        *   Applications should request credentials on-demand when needed.
        *   Applications should handle credential rotation and renewal automatically (often handled by Vault client libraries).
    4.  **Minimize Use of Static Secrets:**  Reduce the reliance on static, long-lived secrets as much as possible by migrating to dynamic secrets where feasible.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Static Credential Compromise (High Severity):** Static, long-lived credentials (e.g., database passwords stored in configuration files) are a prime target for attackers. If compromised, they can provide persistent access to sensitive systems.
    *   **Credential Sprawl and Management Overhead (Medium Severity):** Managing static credentials across multiple applications and environments is complex and error-prone, increasing the risk of misconfiguration and security vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Static Credential Compromise (High):** High impact reduction. Dynamic secrets eliminate the risk of long-lived static credential compromise as credentials are short-lived and generated on-demand.
    *   **Credential Sprawl and Management Overhead (Medium):** Medium to High impact reduction. Dynamic secrets simplify credential management by automating credential generation and rotation, reducing manual overhead and potential errors.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Dynamic secrets are used for some database connections in newer applications. Older applications still rely on static credentials.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Expansion of dynamic secret usage to all applicable services and applications. Migration of older applications to use dynamic secrets.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Hardcoding Vault Tokens or Secrets in Application Code or Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_hardcoding_vault_tokens_or_secrets_in_application_code_or_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Eliminate Hardcoded Secrets:**  Thoroughly review application code, configuration files, and environment variables to identify and remove any hardcoded Vault tokens or secrets.
    2.  **Use Secure Authentication Methods:** Implement secure authentication methods for applications to authenticate to Vault, such as:
        *   **Kubernetes Service Account Tokens:** For applications running in Kubernetes.
        *   **AppRole:** For applications running outside Kubernetes or in environments where Service Account Tokens are not suitable.
        *   **Cloud Provider IAM Roles:** For applications running in cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP).
    3.  **Externalize Configuration:** Externalize application configuration, including Vault server address and authentication details, using environment variables or configuration management tools.
    4.  **Securely Inject Configuration:**  Use secure methods to inject configuration into applications at runtime, avoiding storing sensitive configuration in version control or insecure locations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Secret Exposure in Source Code (High Severity):** Hardcoding secrets in source code exposes them to anyone with access to the code repository, including developers, version control systems, and potentially attackers.
    *   **Secret Exposure in Configuration Files (High Severity):** Storing secrets in configuration files (especially if version-controlled) exposes them in a similar way to hardcoding in source code.
    *   **Secret Exposure in Environment Variables (Medium Severity):** While slightly better than hardcoding, environment variables can still be exposed through process listings, system logs, or misconfigured environments.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Secret Exposure in Source Code (High):** High impact reduction. Eliminating hardcoded secrets prevents accidental exposure in version control and code repositories.
    *   **Secret Exposure in Configuration Files (High):** High impact reduction. Externalizing configuration and using secure injection methods prevents exposure in configuration files.
    *   **Secret Exposure in Environment Variables (Medium):** Medium impact reduction. Secure authentication methods and proper environment management minimize the risk of exposure through environment variables.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Hardcoded secrets have been mostly removed from newer applications. Older applications might still contain some hardcoded secrets or insecure configuration practices.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Complete removal of hardcoded secrets from all applications. Consistent adoption of secure authentication methods and configuration management across all projects. Regular code and configuration audits to detect and eliminate any remaining hardcoded secrets.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Rotate Vault Root Token and Encryption Keys](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_rotate_vault_root_token_and_encryption_keys.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Rotate Root Token:**  Establish a process for regularly rotating the Vault root token.
        *   Generate a new root token using `vault operator generate-root`.
        *   Securely distribute the new root token to authorized administrators.
        *   Revoke the old root token.
        *   Document the root token rotation process.
    2.  **Rotate Encryption Keys (Rekey):** Implement a process for regularly rotating Vault's encryption keys (rekeying).
        *   Use `vault operator rekey` to initiate the rekeying process.
        *   Follow the rekeying procedure carefully, ensuring proper key distribution and quorum requirements are met.
        *   Document the rekeying process.
    3.  **Automate Rotation Processes (Where Possible):** Explore automation options for root token and encryption key rotation to reduce manual effort and potential errors.
    4.  **Monitor Rotation Processes:** Monitor the root token and encryption key rotation processes to ensure they are completed successfully and without issues.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Root Token Compromise with Long Exposure (High Severity):** If the Vault root token is compromised, attackers have full administrative control over Vault. Regular rotation limits the window of opportunity for exploitation.
    *   **Encryption Key Compromise with Long Exposure (High Severity):** If Vault's encryption keys are compromised, attackers could potentially decrypt stored secrets. Regular key rotation limits the impact of key compromise.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Root Token Compromise with Long Exposure (High):** High impact reduction. Regular root token rotation significantly reduces the risk associated with root token compromise.
    *   **Encryption Key Compromise with Long Exposure (High):** High impact reduction. Regular key rotation limits the impact of encryption key compromise and reduces the amount of data potentially exposed.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Root token and encryption keys have not been rotated since initial Vault setup.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establishment of root token and encryption key rotation processes. Automation of rotation processes. Regular execution of rotation procedures.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Authentication Methods for Vault Access](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_authentication_methods_for_vault_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Default Root Token Login:** After initial Vault setup, disable the default root token login method to prevent its continued use for regular administration.
    2.  **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable and enforce MFA for Vault administrators and users.
        *   Choose an appropriate MFA method (e.g., TOTP, hardware tokens, push notifications).
        *   Configure Vault authentication methods to require MFA.
    3.  **Integrate with Identity Providers (IdP):** Integrate Vault with existing identity providers (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace) for centralized authentication and user management.
        *   Configure Vault authentication methods to use the IdP for authentication.
        *   Leverage IdP's existing security policies and MFA capabilities.
    4.  **Enforce Password Complexity and Rotation Policies (If Applicable):** If using password-based authentication methods, enforce strong password complexity requirements and regular password rotation policies.
    5.  **Regularly Review Authentication Methods:** Periodically review and update Vault authentication methods to ensure they remain secure and aligned with best practices.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Weak Password Attacks (High Severity):** Relying solely on passwords for authentication makes Vault vulnerable to password guessing, brute-force attacks, and credential stuffing.
    *   **Compromised Credentials (High Severity):** If user credentials are compromised (e.g., through phishing or malware), attackers can gain unauthorized access to Vault.
    *   **Unauthorized Access by Insiders (Medium Severity):** Weak authentication methods can make it easier for malicious insiders to gain unauthorized access to Vault.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Weak Password Attacks (High):** High impact reduction. MFA and IdP integration significantly reduce the effectiveness of password-based attacks.
    *   **Compromised Credentials (High):** High impact reduction. MFA adds an extra layer of security, making it much harder for attackers to use compromised credentials.
    *   **Unauthorized Access by Insiders (Medium):** Medium to High impact reduction. Strong authentication methods make it more difficult for insiders to gain unauthorized access.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Password-based authentication is used for some users. MFA is not enforced. Integration with an IdP is planned but not yet implemented. Root token login is still enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Disabling root token login. Implementation and enforcement of MFA for all Vault users and administrators. Integration with an Identity Provider.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Review and Audit Vault Access Policies and Roles](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_review_and_audit_vault_access_policies_and_roles.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schedule Regular Policy Reviews:** Establish a schedule for periodic reviews of Vault access policies and roles (e.g., quarterly, bi-annually).
    2.  **Review Policy Effectiveness:** During reviews, assess the effectiveness of existing policies in enforcing least privilege and meeting application requirements.
        *   Identify any overly permissive policies or policies that grant unnecessary access.
        *   Verify that policies are still aligned with current application needs.
    3.  **Audit Access Logs for Policy Violations:** Analyze Vault audit logs to identify any policy violations or unauthorized access attempts.
        *   Investigate any suspicious access patterns or policy violations.
        *   Refine policies based on audit log findings.
    4.  **Document Policy Review Process:** Document the policy review process, including review frequency, responsibilities, and review criteria.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Policy Drift and Permissiveness (Medium Severity):** Over time, Vault policies can become overly permissive or misaligned with application needs due to changes in requirements or lack of regular review. This can lead to unintended access and security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Unnoticed Policy Violations (Low Severity):** Without regular policy reviews and audit log analysis, policy violations or unauthorized access attempts might go unnoticed, potentially leading to security incidents.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Policy Drift and Permissiveness (Medium):** Medium impact reduction. Regular policy reviews help maintain policy effectiveness and prevent policies from becoming overly permissive.
    *   **Unnoticed Policy Violations (Low):** Medium impact reduction. Audit log analysis and policy reviews improve visibility into policy enforcement and help detect violations.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Vault policies are created initially but not regularly reviewed or audited.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establishment of a regular policy review schedule and process. Implementation of audit log analysis for policy violations. Documentation of the policy review process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) in Vault](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__or_attribute-based_access_control__abac__in_vault.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Design RBAC/ABAC Model:** Define a clear RBAC or ABAC model for Vault access control based on your organization's roles, responsibilities, or attributes.
        *   **RBAC:** Define roles (e.g., application developer, database administrator, security operator) and assign permissions to roles.
        *   **ABAC:** Define attributes (e.g., application name, environment, user department) and create policies based on attribute combinations.
    2.  **Implement Vault Policies and Roles/Groups:** Translate the RBAC/ABAC model into Vault policies and roles or groups.
        *   Create Vault roles or groups corresponding to defined roles or attribute sets.
        *   Assign granular policies to these roles/groups based on the RBAC/ABAC model.
    3.  **Map Users and Applications to Roles/Groups:**  Assign users and applications to the appropriate Vault roles or groups based on their responsibilities or attributes.
    4.  **Enforce RBAC/ABAC in Authentication Methods:** Configure Vault authentication methods to enforce RBAC/ABAC.
        *   Ensure that authentication methods correctly map users or applications to their assigned roles/groups.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update RBAC/ABAC Model:** Periodically review and update the RBAC/ABAC model to reflect changes in organizational structure, roles, or application requirements.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Complex Policy Management (Medium Severity):** Managing access control with flat, user-based policies can become complex and difficult to maintain as the number of users and applications grows.
    *   **Inconsistent Access Control (Medium Severity):** Without a structured access control model, it's harder to ensure consistent and predictable access control across different parts of the organization.
    *   **Difficulty in Scaling Access Control (Medium Severity):** Flat policies are not easily scalable to accommodate new users, applications, or changing organizational structures.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Complex Policy Management (Medium):** Medium to High impact reduction. RBAC/ABAC simplifies policy management by organizing access control around roles or attributes rather than individual users.
    *   **Inconsistent Access Control (Medium):** Medium impact reduction. RBAC/ABAC provides a structured framework for ensuring consistent access control across the organization.
    *   **Difficulty in Scaling Access Control (Medium):** Medium impact reduction. RBAC/ABAC models are more scalable and adaptable to organizational changes.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic roles are used, but a formal RBAC/ABAC model is not fully defined or implemented. Policy management is still somewhat ad-hoc.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal definition and documentation of an RBAC or ABAC model. Full implementation of RBAC/ABAC in Vault policies and authentication methods. Consistent application of RBAC/ABAC across all Vault access control.
