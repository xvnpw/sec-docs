### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 3. Compromise Application's Vault Client/Integration [HIGH-RISK PATH]

This attack path focuses on compromising the application's integration with HashiCorp Vault, aiming to gain unauthorized access to secrets managed by Vault.  A successful compromise here can have severe consequences, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and loss of trust.

#### 3.1. Leaked Secrets in Application Code/Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

This node highlights the critical risk of unintentionally or intentionally leaking sensitive secrets directly within the application's codebase or configuration files. This is a common and often easily exploitable vulnerability.

##### 3.1.1. Hardcoded Vault Tokens or Credentials in Application [CRITICAL NODE]

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Developers accidentally or intentionally hardcoding Vault tokens or credentials directly into application source code.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** Developers, under pressure or due to lack of awareness, might directly embed Vault tokens (e.g., root tokens, service tokens) or credentials (e.g., username/password for Vault authentication methods) into the application's source code. This could be done for quick testing, debugging, or simply due to misunderstanding secure coding practices.
        *   **Potential Impact:** If the source code repository is compromised (e.g., through a Git leak, insider threat, or compromised developer machine), or if the application code is decompiled or reverse-engineered, the hardcoded credentials become readily available to attackers. This grants immediate and often high-privilege access to Vault and the secrets it manages.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Code Reviews:** Implement mandatory code reviews, specifically looking for hardcoded secrets. Automated static analysis security testing (SAST) tools can also help detect potential hardcoded credentials.
            *   **Developer Training:** Educate developers on secure coding practices, emphasizing the dangers of hardcoding secrets and the importance of using secure secret management techniques.
            *   **Secret Management Best Practices:** Enforce the use of environment variables, configuration management systems, or dedicated secret management libraries to handle Vault authentication and access. **Never store secrets directly in code.**
            *   **Pre-commit Hooks:** Implement pre-commit hooks in version control systems to scan for potential secrets before code is committed.
    *   **Storing Vault credentials in application configuration files that are not properly secured.**
        *   **Detailed Description:**  Instead of hardcoding in source code, developers might store credentials in configuration files (e.g., `.ini`, `.yaml`, `.json`). While seemingly better than hardcoding, if these configuration files are not properly secured (e.g., world-readable permissions, stored in version control without encryption), they become a prime target for attackers.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Similar to hardcoded secrets, compromised configuration files expose Vault credentials, leading to unauthorized Vault access and secret compromise. Configuration files are often easier to access than source code in deployed environments if not properly secured.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Secure Configuration Management:** Store configuration files outside the application's web root and with restrictive file permissions (e.g., readable only by the application user).
            *   **Environment Variables:** Prefer using environment variables for sensitive configuration parameters, as they are generally not stored in files and are managed by the operating system or container orchestration platform.
            *   **Configuration Encryption:** If configuration files must store sensitive data, encrypt them at rest and decrypt them only when the application starts, using secure key management practices.
            *   **Configuration Auditing:** Regularly audit configuration files and deployment processes to ensure secrets are not inadvertently exposed.

##### 3.1.2. Extract Hardcoded Credentials from Application (e.g., reverse engineering, code review) [CRITICAL NODE]

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Performing code review of application source code to find hardcoded credentials.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** Attackers who gain access to the application's source code repository (legitimately or illegitimately) can perform code reviews, either manually or using automated tools, to search for patterns indicative of hardcoded secrets (e.g., "vault_token=", "VAULT_TOKEN=", "password=", "secret=").
        *   **Potential Impact:** Successful code review leading to the discovery of hardcoded credentials directly results in the compromise described in 3.1.1.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**  The mitigation strategies are the same as for 3.1.1.1 (preventing hardcoding in the first place).  Robust access control to the source code repository is also crucial.
    *   **Reverse engineering compiled application binaries to extract embedded credentials.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** Even if source code is not directly accessible, attackers can reverse engineer compiled application binaries (e.g., `.jar`, `.exe`, `.pyc`) to extract embedded strings and data.  Tools like decompilers and disassemblers can be used to analyze the binary code and potentially recover hardcoded secrets.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Successful reverse engineering can reveal hardcoded credentials, even if obfuscated, leading to unauthorized Vault access.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Avoid Hardcoding (Primary Mitigation):** The most effective mitigation is to avoid hardcoding secrets altogether.
            *   **Code Obfuscation (Limited Effectiveness):** While code obfuscation can make reverse engineering more difficult, it is not a foolproof security measure and should not be relied upon as the primary defense against secret extraction.
            *   **Binary Protection (Limited Effectiveness):** Techniques like binary packing or encryption can offer some resistance to reverse engineering, but determined attackers with sufficient resources can often overcome these measures.
    *   **Analyzing application configuration files to locate stored Vault credentials.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** Attackers can target application configuration files, especially if they are publicly accessible (e.g., due to misconfigured web servers, exposed directories) or if the attacker gains access to the application server. They can then analyze these files for potential secrets.
        *   **Potential Impact:**  Compromised configuration files can directly expose Vault credentials, leading to unauthorized access.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Secure Configuration Storage (Primary Mitigation):**  As described in 3.1.1.2, secure configuration storage is paramount.
            *   **Access Control:** Implement strict access control to application servers and configuration file directories.
            *   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically audit application deployments and configurations to identify and remediate any exposed configuration files.

#### 3.2. Insecure Storage of Vault Tokens by Application [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

This node focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the application's handling and storage of Vault tokens *after* they have been successfully retrieved from Vault. Even if the initial authentication is secure, insecure token storage can negate those efforts.

##### 3.2.1. Application Stores Vault Tokens Insecurely (e.g., plaintext files, easily accessible locations) [CRITICAL NODE]

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Applications storing Vault tokens in plaintext files on the server filesystem.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** Applications might write Vault tokens to plaintext files (e.g., `.token` files, log files, temporary files) for persistence or ease of access. Storing tokens in plaintext is inherently insecure as anyone with read access to the filesystem can retrieve them.
        *   **Potential Impact:**  If an attacker gains filesystem access (e.g., through web application vulnerabilities, server misconfigurations, or compromised accounts), they can easily read these plaintext token files and impersonate the application's Vault client, gaining access to secrets the application is authorized to retrieve.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Avoid Plaintext Storage (Primary Mitigation):** **Never store Vault tokens in plaintext files.**
            *   **In-Memory Storage:** Store tokens in memory only and retrieve them from Vault upon application restart if persistence is not strictly required.
            *   **Secure Storage Mechanisms:** If token persistence is necessary, use secure storage mechanisms like:
                *   **Operating System Credential Stores:** Utilize OS-level credential management systems (e.g., Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service API) which provide encrypted storage and access control.
                *   **Dedicated Secret Management Libraries:** Employ libraries designed for secure secret storage and retrieval, which often handle encryption and access control transparently.
                *   **Encrypted Filesystem:** Store tokens in encrypted filesystems, ensuring proper key management for decryption.
    *   **Storing tokens in easily accessible locations within the application's deployment directory.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** Even if not in plaintext files, storing tokens in predictable or easily accessible locations within the application's deployment directory (e.g., within the web root, in world-readable directories) increases the risk of unauthorized access.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Similar to plaintext storage, easily accessible tokens can be retrieved by attackers who gain access to the application server or exploit web application vulnerabilities that allow directory traversal or file inclusion.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Restrict File Permissions:** Ensure token storage locations have restrictive file permissions, limiting access to only the application user and necessary system processes.
            *   **Store Outside Web Root:** Store tokens outside the application's web root to prevent direct access through web requests.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to the application user and processes that require access to the tokens.
    *   **Using insecure storage mechanisms that are vulnerable to unauthorized access.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** This is a broader category encompassing various insecure storage practices, such as using weak encryption algorithms, storing encryption keys insecurely, or relying on easily bypassed access controls.
        *   **Potential Impact:**  Compromised insecure storage mechanisms can lead to token exposure and unauthorized Vault access.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Use Strong Cryptography:** If encryption is used, employ strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms and libraries.
            *   **Secure Key Management:** Implement robust key management practices, ensuring encryption keys are securely generated, stored, and rotated. **Never hardcode encryption keys or store them alongside encrypted data.**
            *   **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in token storage mechanisms.

##### 3.2.2. Access Insecurely Stored Tokens [CRITICAL NODE]

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Gaining access to the application server filesystem through vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the application or underlying infrastructure (e.g., operating system vulnerabilities, web server misconfigurations, SSH key compromise) to gain access to the application server's filesystem. Once inside, they can search for and access insecurely stored tokens.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Filesystem access allows attackers to retrieve insecurely stored tokens, leading to unauthorized Vault access.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Regular Security Patching:** Keep the application, operating system, and all dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
            *   **Secure Server Configuration:** Harden server configurations, following security best practices for web servers, SSH, and other services.
            *   **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):** Implement IDPS to detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts to the server.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Server Access):** Restrict administrative access to servers to only authorized personnel and use strong authentication methods (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
    *   **Reading insecurely stored token files directly from the filesystem.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** Once filesystem access is gained (as described in 3.2.2.1), attackers can directly read token files if they are stored in plaintext or if the attacker can bypass weak access controls.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Direct file reading leads to token compromise and unauthorized Vault access.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**  The mitigation strategies are primarily focused on preventing insecure storage in the first place (as described in 3.2.1) and securing filesystem access (as described in 3.2.2.1).
    *   **Exploiting application vulnerabilities to access token storage locations.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** Web application vulnerabilities (e.g., Local File Inclusion (LFI), Directory Traversal, SQL Injection leading to filesystem access) can be exploited to access files on the server, including locations where tokens might be insecurely stored.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Application vulnerabilities can provide a pathway for attackers to reach and retrieve insecurely stored tokens.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Implement secure coding practices to prevent common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation, output encoding, parameterized queries).
            *   **Web Application Firewalls (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to detect and block common web application attacks, including those that could lead to file access.
            *   **Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing:** Regularly scan the application for vulnerabilities and conduct penetration testing to identify and remediate security weaknesses.

#### 3.3. Vulnerabilities in Vault Client Libraries/SDKs

This node shifts focus to vulnerabilities within the Vault client libraries or SDKs used by the application to interact with Vault.  Even if the application code is secure, vulnerabilities in the client library can be exploited.

##### 3.3.2. Exploit Client Library Vulnerability to Intercept or Steal Secrets [CRITICAL NODE]

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the Vault client library or SDK used by the application.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** Vault client libraries, like any software, can have vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities (e.g., disclosed in security advisories, CVEs) in the specific version of the Vault client library used by the application. These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to intercept communication, bypass security checks, or directly steal secrets.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Exploiting client library vulnerabilities can lead to direct secret theft, unauthorized access to Vault, and potentially compromise the entire application and Vault infrastructure.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Keep Client Libraries Up-to-Date (Critical):** **Regularly update Vault client libraries and SDKs to the latest stable versions.** Subscribe to security advisories from HashiCorp and the library maintainers to be informed of new vulnerabilities and updates.
            *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to scan application dependencies, including Vault client libraries, for known vulnerabilities.
            *   **Security Audits of Dependencies:** Periodically audit the security of all application dependencies, including Vault client libraries.
    *   **Developing custom exploits that target client-side vulnerabilities to intercept or steal secrets during communication with Vault.**
        *   **Detailed Description:**  Sophisticated attackers might discover zero-day vulnerabilities in Vault client libraries or SDKs and develop custom exploits to target them. These exploits could be designed to intercept secrets during the communication between the application and Vault, or to manipulate the client library's behavior to gain unauthorized access.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Zero-day exploits are particularly dangerous as there are no known patches or mitigations initially. Successful exploitation can lead to significant secret compromise.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Proactive Security Measures:** Implement strong security development lifecycle (SDLC) practices, including threat modeling, secure code reviews, and penetration testing, to reduce the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities in the application and its dependencies.
            *   **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):** Consider using RASP solutions that can detect and prevent exploitation attempts at runtime, even for zero-day vulnerabilities.
            *   **Security Monitoring and Logging:** Implement comprehensive security monitoring and logging to detect suspicious activity and potential exploitation attempts.
            *   **Incident Response Plan:** Have a well-defined incident response plan to quickly react to and mitigate security incidents, including potential zero-day exploits.

#### 3.4. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Vault Communication [HIGH-RISK PATH]

This node focuses on Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks targeting the communication channel between the application and the Vault API. If this communication is not properly secured, attackers can intercept and manipulate data, including Vault tokens and secrets.

##### 3.4.2. Steal Vault Tokens or Secrets in Transit [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Performing a Man-in-the-Middle attack to intercept network traffic between the application and Vault API.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** Attackers can position themselves in the network path between the application and Vault server to intercept network traffic. This can be achieved through various techniques, such as ARP poisoning, DNS spoofing, or compromising network devices. Once in a MITM position, attackers can eavesdrop on communication and potentially modify it.
        *   **Potential Impact:** In a MITM attack, attackers can intercept Vault tokens being sent by the application for authentication or secrets being retrieved from Vault. This allows them to steal credentials and sensitive data.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Enforce TLS/SSL for Vault Communication (Critical):** **Always enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all communication between the application and Vault API.** This is the most crucial mitigation. Ensure that the application is configured to communicate with Vault over `https://` and that TLS verification is enabled.
            *   **Mutual TLS (mTLS):** Consider implementing mutual TLS (mTLS) for Vault communication. mTLS provides stronger authentication by requiring both the client (application) and server (Vault) to authenticate each other using certificates.
            *   **Network Segmentation:** Segment the network to isolate the application and Vault server within a secure network zone, limiting the attacker's ability to position themselves for a MITM attack.
            *   **Network Monitoring:** Implement network monitoring and intrusion detection systems to detect suspicious network activity that might indicate a MITM attack.
    *   **Exploiting TLS misconfigurations or lack of TLS enforcement to decrypt communication and steal Vault tokens or secrets in transit.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** Even if TLS/SSL is used, misconfigurations can weaken or negate its security benefits. Examples include:
            *   **Using weak or outdated TLS protocols or cipher suites.**
            *   **Disabling TLS certificate verification.**
            *   **Using self-signed certificates without proper trust management.**
            *   **Downgrade attacks that force the use of weaker encryption.**
            *   **Lack of TLS enforcement, allowing communication over unencrypted HTTP.**
        *   **Potential Impact:** TLS misconfigurations can allow attackers to decrypt intercepted traffic, effectively bypassing the encryption intended to protect Vault tokens and secrets in transit.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Strong TLS Configuration (Critical):** **Configure TLS with strong, modern protocols and cipher suites.** Disable weak or outdated protocols (e.g., SSLv3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1) and cipher suites.
            *   **Enable TLS Certificate Verification (Critical):** **Always enable TLS certificate verification in the application's Vault client configuration.** This ensures that the application is communicating with the legitimate Vault server and not a malicious imposter.
            *   **Proper Certificate Management:** Use certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) or implement a robust internal PKI for managing certificates. Avoid self-signed certificates in production unless properly managed and trusted within the organization.
            *   **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):** Implement HSTS on the Vault server to enforce HTTPS connections and prevent downgrade attacks.
            *   **Regular TLS Configuration Audits:** Regularly audit TLS configurations on both the application and Vault server to identify and remediate any misconfigurations.

#### 3.5. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Application to Vault [HIGH-RISK PATH]

This node focuses on Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities in the application that can be exploited to make requests to the Vault API from the application's server-side context. This can bypass network firewalls and access controls, potentially leading to unauthorized secret retrieval.

##### 3.5.2. Use SSRF to Access Vault API from Application's Context [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Identifying and exploiting Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities in the application.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** SSRF vulnerabilities occur when an application allows a user to control or influence the destination of server-side requests. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to make the application send requests to internal resources, including the Vault API endpoint, which might be protected by firewalls and not directly accessible from the outside.
        *   **Potential Impact:** SSRF vulnerabilities can allow attackers to bypass network security controls and access internal resources, including the Vault API. This can lead to unauthorized secret retrieval and potentially further compromise of the application and Vault infrastructure.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Critical):** **Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied input that could influence server-side requests.** This is the primary defense against SSRF.
            *   **URL Whitelisting:** Implement URL whitelisting to restrict the destinations of server-side requests to only known and trusted resources. **Never rely solely on blacklisting, as it is easily bypassed.**
            *   **Network Segmentation and Firewalls:** Segment the network to isolate the application from internal resources like Vault. Configure firewalls to restrict outbound traffic from the application server to only necessary destinations.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Network Access):** Grant the application server only the necessary network access to perform its intended functions. Restrict access to internal resources like Vault to only authorized applications.
            *   **Disable Unnecessary URL Schemes:** Disable or restrict the use of unnecessary URL schemes (e.g., `file://`, `ftp://`, `gopher://`) in server-side request handling to limit the attack surface for SSRF.
    *   **Crafting SSRF requests that target the Vault API endpoint, leveraging the application's network context and potentially its Vault authentication credentials.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** Once an SSRF vulnerability is identified, attackers can craft malicious requests that target the Vault API endpoint (e.g., `http://vault.internal:8200/v1/secret/data/my-secret`). Because the request originates from the application server, it might bypass network firewalls and access controls that would block external requests to Vault. Furthermore, if the application reuses its Vault authentication context for these SSRF requests, the attacker can leverage the application's authorized access to Vault.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Successful SSRF attacks targeting Vault can lead to unauthorized retrieval of secrets that the application is authorized to access.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**  The mitigation strategies are the same as for 3.5.2.1 (preventing SSRF vulnerabilities in the first place).  Additionally:
            *   **Separate Authentication Contexts:** If possible, consider using separate authentication contexts for the application's legitimate Vault access and any user-controlled server-side requests. This can limit the impact of SSRF by preventing the attacker from leveraging the application's credentials.
    *   **Using SSRF to read secrets from Vault that the application is authorized to access.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** The ultimate goal of SSRF attacks in this context is to read secrets from Vault. If the application has permissions to read certain secrets in Vault, a successful SSRF attack can allow an attacker to leverage these permissions to retrieve those secrets.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Data breach through unauthorized secret retrieval from Vault.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Vault Access):** **Grant the application only the minimum necessary Vault permissions required for its functionality.** Avoid granting overly broad permissions that could be abused in an SSRF attack.
            *   **Vault Access Control Policies:** Implement fine-grained access control policies in Vault to restrict which secrets the application can access.
            *   **Regular Vault Access Audits:** Regularly audit Vault access policies and application permissions to ensure they are still appropriate and follow the principle of least privilege.

#### 3.6. Log Injection/Exposure of Secrets [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

This node focuses on the risk of unintentionally or intentionally logging sensitive secrets within application logs. Logs are often stored and accessed with less stringent security controls than secrets themselves, making them a potential target for attackers.

##### 3.6.2. Access Application Logs to Retrieve Exposed Secrets [CRITICAL NODE]

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Developers accidentally logging secrets or Vault tokens in application logs, especially during debugging or error handling.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** Developers, especially during debugging or error handling, might inadvertently log sensitive information like Vault tokens, secrets retrieved from Vault, or even raw authentication credentials. This is a common mistake and can have serious security implications.
        *   **Potential Impact:** If application logs are accessible to unauthorized individuals (e.g., through misconfigured log management systems, exposed log directories, or compromised accounts), attackers can easily search and retrieve exposed secrets from the logs.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Secure Logging Practices (Critical):** **Implement secure logging practices and educate developers on what should and should not be logged.** **Never log secrets, tokens, passwords, or other sensitive data.**
            *   **Log Sanitization and Redaction:** Implement log sanitization and redaction techniques to automatically remove or mask sensitive information from logs before they are written.
            *   **Code Reviews (Logging Focus):** During code reviews, specifically scrutinize logging statements to ensure no sensitive data is being logged.
            *   **Static Analysis Tools (Logging Focus):** Utilize static analysis tools that can detect potential logging of sensitive data.
    *   **Gaining unauthorized access to application logs through vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the application, log management systems, or infrastructure to gain unauthorized access to application logs. This could involve web application vulnerabilities, server misconfigurations, or compromised accounts used to access log management systems.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized log access allows attackers to search for and retrieve exposed secrets from the logs.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Secure Log Management Systems:** Secure log management systems and infrastructure, implementing strong authentication, access control, and encryption for log data in transit and at rest.
            *   **Access Control for Logs:** Implement strict access control to application logs, limiting access to only authorized personnel and systems.
            *   **Regular Security Audits of Logging Infrastructure:** Regularly audit the security of logging infrastructure and access controls to identify and remediate any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
    *   **Searching application logs for exposed secrets or tokens.**
        *   **Detailed Description:** Once unauthorized access to logs is gained (as described in 3.6.2.2), attackers can use simple text searching or more sophisticated log analysis tools to search for patterns indicative of exposed secrets or tokens (e.g., "vault_token=", "VAULT_TOKEN=", "secret=", "password=").
        *   **Potential Impact:** Successful log searching can quickly reveal exposed secrets, leading to unauthorized Vault access and data breaches.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:** The primary mitigation is to prevent secrets from being logged in the first place (as described in 3.6.2.1) and to secure access to logs (as described in 3.6.2.2).
