# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for hashicorp/vault

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Vault Policies](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_vault_policies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Application Needs:**  For each application or service interacting with Vault, meticulously document the specific secrets and Vault paths it requires access to.
    2.  **Create Granular Policies:**  Develop Vault policies *within Vault* that precisely match the identified needs. Avoid wildcard permissions (`*`) and instead specify exact paths and capabilities (e.g., `read`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `list`).  This is configured using Vault's policy language and API.
    3.  **Assign Policies to Roles/Groups:**  Create Vault roles or groups *within Vault*. Assign the narrowly scoped policies to these roles/groups. This is managed through Vault's role and group management features.
    4.  **Authenticate Applications with Roles/Groups:** Configure applications to authenticate with Vault and associate them with the appropriate roles or groups *within Vault*. This is achieved through Vault's authentication methods (AppRole, Kubernetes, etc.).
    5.  **Regularly Review and Refine Policies:**  Periodically audit Vault policies *within Vault* to ensure they remain aligned with application needs and security best practices. Remove any unnecessary permissions and adapt policies as applications evolve. This involves using Vault's policy listing and inspection features.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Secret Access (Severity: High):  Malicious actors or compromised applications gaining access to sensitive secrets they shouldn't have *due to overly permissive Vault policies*.
    *   Lateral Movement (Severity: Medium):  Compromised application with overly broad permissions being used to access other sensitive resources *within Vault*.
    *   Accidental Data Exposure (Severity: Medium):  Misconfigured application or user with excessive permissions unintentionally exposing sensitive data *due to policy misconfigurations in Vault*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Secret Access: High Risk Reduction
    *   Lateral Movement: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Accidental Data Exposure: Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Vault Policy Configuration: Yes, policies are defined in `vault/policies/` repository using HCL and applied to Vault.
    *   Application Role Assignment: Partially implemented. Web application uses dedicated AppRole, but background jobs use a more generic role.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Background Jobs: Need to create specific AppRoles and policies *in Vault* for each type of background job to restrict access further.
    *   Policy Review Automation:  Lack of automated tools to regularly review and flag overly permissive policies *within Vault*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Configure Audit Logging](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_configure_audit_logging.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Audit Logging Backends:**  Activate at least one audit logging backend *in Vault*. Recommended backends include `file`, `socket`, or cloud-based storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage). This is configured through Vault's configuration files or API.
    2.  **Configure Log Level:** Set the audit log level *in Vault* to `request` or `response+request` to capture sufficient detail for security monitoring and incident investigation. This is a Vault configuration setting.
    3.  **Secure Audit Log Storage:**  Ensure audit logs are stored in a secure and tamper-proof location, separate from Vault servers. *While secure storage is important, the Vault-direct aspect here is configuring Vault to send logs to a suitable backend.*
    4.  **Implement Log Monitoring and Alerting:**  Integrate Vault audit logs with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system or log aggregation platform. Configure alerts for suspicious events, such as failed authentication attempts, unauthorized secret access, or policy changes *based on Vault audit logs*.
    5.  **Regularly Review Audit Logs:**  Establish a process for regularly reviewing Vault audit logs to proactively identify and investigate potential security incidents or misconfigurations *within Vault*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Security Breach Detection (Severity: High):  Delayed detection of security breaches or unauthorized activities *within Vault*.
    *   Insider Threats (Severity: Medium):  Unnoticed malicious actions by internal users with Vault access *that are logged by Vault audit*.
    *   Compliance Violations (Severity: Medium):  Failure to meet regulatory requirements for audit logging and security monitoring *of Vault activity*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Security Breach Detection: High Risk Reduction
    *   Insider Threats: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Compliance Violations: Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   File Audit Backend: Yes, audit logs are written to `/var/log/vault/audit.log` on Vault servers *as configured in Vault*.
    *   Log Rotation: Yes, `logrotate` is configured for audit logs *on the server, but Vault is configured to generate the logs*.
    *   SIEM Integration: No, audit logs are not currently integrated with a SIEM system.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   SIEM Integration:  Need to implement integration with the company's SIEM solution for centralized monitoring and alerting *of Vault audit logs*.
    *   Alerting Rules:  Define and configure specific alerting rules within the SIEM for Vault audit events.
    *   Secure Log Storage:  Current file-based storage on Vault servers is not ideal for long-term secure storage and needs to be moved to a dedicated secure storage solution *as a backend for Vault audit logging*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Review Vault Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_review_vault_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Document Vault Configuration:** Maintain comprehensive documentation of the current Vault configuration, including enabled auth methods, secret engines, policies, roles, groups, audit backends, and other relevant settings.
    2.  **Periodic Configuration Audits:** Schedule regular audits of the Vault configuration (e.g., quarterly or semi-annually).
    3.  **Configuration Review Checklist:** Develop a checklist of security best practices and configuration recommendations for Vault. Use this checklist during audits to identify deviations or potential misconfigurations.
    4.  **Automated Configuration Checks (IaC):**  Ideally, manage Vault configuration using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools. Implement automated checks within the IaC pipeline to validate configuration against security policies and best practices.
    5.  **Address Identified Issues:**  Promptly address any misconfigurations or security weaknesses identified during configuration audits. Track remediation efforts and re-audit to ensure issues are resolved.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium):  Vault being vulnerable due to insecure or suboptimal configuration settings.
    *   Policy Drift (Severity: Medium):  Vault configuration drifting away from security best practices over time, leading to increased risk.
    *   Operational Errors (Severity: Low):  Accidental misconfigurations introduced during manual changes to Vault.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Policy Drift: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Operational Errors: Low Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Short-Lived Tokens](./mitigation_strategies/use_short-lived_tokens.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Default Token TTLs:**  Set appropriate default Time-To-Live (TTL) values for Vault tokens *within Vault's configuration*. Shorter TTLs (e.g., minutes or hours) are generally more secure than long-lived tokens. This is a core Vault setting.
    2.  **Application-Specific Token TTLs:**  Where possible, configure even shorter TTLs for application-specific tokens *using Vault's token creation parameters or role configurations*.
    3.  **Implement Token Renewal:**  For applications requiring longer-term access, implement token renewal mechanisms using Vault's token renewal API. This is a feature provided by Vault.
    4.  **Avoid Storing Tokens Long-Term:**  Applications should avoid storing Vault tokens persistently. Tokens should be held in memory only and discarded when no longer needed. *While application behavior, this is directly related to the security benefit of short-lived Vault tokens.*
    5.  **Token Revocation Mechanisms:**  Understand and utilize Vault's token revocation mechanisms *provided by Vault* to invalidate tokens immediately in case of compromise or application termination.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Token Compromise (Severity: High):  Stolen or leaked long-lived tokens being used by attackers for unauthorized access to Vault.
    *   Reduced Blast Radius (Severity: Medium):  Shorter token lifespan limiting the duration of unauthorized access if a token is compromised.
    *   Credential Stuffing/Replay Attacks (Severity: Medium):  Stolen tokens becoming less useful over time due to expiration.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Token Compromise: High Risk Reduction
    *   Reduced Blast Radius: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Credential Stuffing/Replay Attacks: Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Default Token TTL: Yes, default token TTL is set to 2 hours in Vault configuration.
    *   Token Renewal in Web Application: Yes, the web application implements token renewal using the Vault client library.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Shorter TTLs for Background Jobs: Background jobs still use the default 2-hour TTL, which could be reduced further *by configuring specific roles or token creation parameters in Vault*.
    *   Token Revocation Automation:  No automated mechanisms are in place to revoke tokens upon application termination or security events *using Vault's revocation API*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Key Storage for Vault's Encryption Keys](./mitigation_strategies/secure_key_storage_for_vault's_encryption_keys.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify KMS/HSM Solution:** Choose a robust Key Management System (KMS) or Hardware Security Module (HSM) that is compatible with Vault and meets your organization's security requirements.
    2.  **Integrate KMS/HSM with Vault:** Configure Vault to use the selected KMS/HSM for storing and managing its encryption keys (master keys and unseal keys). Vault supports various KMS/HSM integrations.
    3.  **Configure KMS/HSM Access Control:**  Implement strict access controls within the KMS/HSM to restrict access to Vault's encryption keys to only authorized Vault servers and administrators.
    4.  **Monitor KMS/HSM Activity:**  Monitor the KMS/HSM for any unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activity related to Vault's encryption keys.
    5.  **Regularly Review KMS/HSM Integration:**  Periodically review the integration between Vault and the KMS/HSM to ensure it remains secure and properly configured.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Master Key Compromise (Severity: Critical):  Attackers gaining access to Vault's master keys, allowing them to decrypt all secrets stored in Vault.
    *   Data Breach (Severity: Critical):  Compromise of master keys leading to complete exposure of all secrets managed by Vault.
    *   Loss of Control over Secrets (Severity: Critical):  If master keys are compromised, the organization loses control over the confidentiality of its secrets.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Master Key Compromise: Critical Risk Reduction
    *   Data Breach: Critical Risk Reduction
    *   Loss of Control over Secrets: Critical Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   KMS/HSM Integration: No, Vault currently uses local storage for unseal keys (auto-unseal is enabled with cloud provider KMS, but not a dedicated HSM).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dedicated HSM Integration:  Need to implement integration with a dedicated HSM for storing Vault's master keys to enhance security.
    *   KMS/HSM Access Control Configuration:  Once HSM integration is implemented, configure granular access controls within the HSM.

    4.  **Document Key Rotation Process:**  Document the key rotation process in detail, including steps, roles and responsibilities, and rollback procedures.
    5.  **Monitor Key Rotation Success:**  Monitor the key rotation process to ensure it completes successfully and that Vault remains operational after rotation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Long-Term Key Compromise (Severity: High):  If encryption keys are compromised but not rotated, attackers have a prolonged window of opportunity to exploit them.
    *   Reduced Impact of Key Leakage (Severity: Medium):  Regular key rotation limits the amount of data compromised if a key is leaked, as older data will be encrypted with different keys.
    *   Compliance Requirements (Severity: Medium):  Meeting compliance requirements that mandate regular key rotation for sensitive data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Long-Term Key Compromise: High Risk Reduction
    *   Reduced Impact of Key Leakage: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Compliance Requirements: Medium Risk Reduction
