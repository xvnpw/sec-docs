# Attack Surface Analysis for hashicorp/vault

## Attack Surface: [Vault Server Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/vault_server_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of known security vulnerabilities in the Vault server software itself.
*   **Vault Contribution:** Vault server software, like any software, can have vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
*   **Example:** A known RCE vulnerability in a specific version of Vault allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Vault server.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Vault server, including access to all secrets, audit logs, and potential control over the infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly patch Vault server to the latest stable version.
    *   Implement vulnerability scanning of the Vault server infrastructure.
    *   Follow Vault security hardening guidelines and best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Vault API Exposure](./attack_surfaces/vault_api_exposure.md)

**Description:** Direct exposure of the Vault API to untrusted networks without proper access controls.
*   **Vault Contribution:** Vault exposes an API for management and secret retrieval, which if not properly secured, becomes an attack vector.
*   **Example:** Vault API listener is exposed to the public internet without authentication. An attacker can enumerate API endpoints and attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or brute-force authentication.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Vault secrets, potential data breaches, and possible control over Vault configurations.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Isolate Vault server within a private network and restrict access to only authorized networks.
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all Vault API communication.
    *   Implement strong authentication methods for API access (tokens, TLS certificates, cloud provider IAM).
    *   Consider using an API Gateway or Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect the Vault API.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Method Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/authentication_method_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** Misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in Vault's authentication methods, leading to unauthorized access.
*   **Vault Contribution:** Vault offers various authentication methods. Misconfiguring these methods can weaken security.
*   **Example:** LDAP authentication is configured with weak binding credentials or without TLS, allowing an attacker to intercept credentials or bypass authentication.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Vault, potentially leading to secret leakage and system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Choose strong and secure authentication methods (TLS certificates, cloud provider IAM, OIDC/OAuth 2.0).
    *   Carefully configure authentication methods following security best practices and documentation.
    *   Regularly review and audit authentication method configurations.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to authentication capabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Policy Misconfigurations](./attack_surfaces/policy_misconfigurations.md)

**Description:** Overly permissive or incorrectly configured Vault policies granting excessive access to secrets.
*   **Vault Contribution:** Vault's policy engine controls access to secrets. Misconfigured policies can lead to unintended access.
*   **Example:** A policy grants read access to all secrets in the `secret/` path to an application that only needs access to a specific secret. If the application is compromised, the attacker gains access to more secrets than necessary.
*   **Impact:** Increased blast radius of a compromise, potentially exposing more secrets than intended if an application or user is compromised.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Design policies based on the principle of least privilege, granting only the minimum necessary access.
    *   Regularly review and audit Vault policies.
    *   Thoroughly test policies before deployment.
    *   Implement policy versioning and change management.

## Attack Surface: [Secret Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/secret_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in specific Vault secret engines.
*   **Vault Contribution:** Vault's secret engines generate and manage secrets. Vulnerabilities in these engines can expose secrets.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in a specific version of the database secret engine allows an attacker to bypass access controls and retrieve database credentials.
*   **Impact:** Leakage of secrets managed by the vulnerable secret engine, potentially leading to compromise of downstream systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep secret engines updated to the latest versions.
    *   Securely configure secret engines following best practices.
    *   Conduct engine-specific security reviews.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities (if using custom plugins)](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities__if_using_custom_plugins_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in custom Vault plugins or use of malicious plugins.
*   **Vault Contribution:** Vault's plugin architecture allows for extensibility, but custom plugins can introduce new attack surfaces if not properly secured.
*   **Example:** A custom authentication plugin has a vulnerability that allows authentication bypass. An attacker can exploit this plugin to gain unauthorized access to Vault.
*   **Impact:** Potential compromise of Vault server or access to secrets, depending on the plugin's functionality and vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow secure coding practices for custom plugin development.
    *   Conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing of custom plugins.
    *   Implement a process for validating and verifying plugin security.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege for plugin permissions.
    *   Avoid using unnecessary custom plugins.
