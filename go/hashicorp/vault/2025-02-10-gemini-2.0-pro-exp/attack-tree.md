## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Vault Server -> OS Vuln -> [***OS***]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_vault_server_-_os_vuln_-__os_.md)

*   **Path Description:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the operating system running the Vault server to gain full control.
*   **[OS Vuln]: Operating System Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system (e.g., unpatched kernel, vulnerable SSH).
    *   **Likelihood:** High (Common attack vector)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Full server compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Automated tools available)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (Script kiddies to experienced attackers)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (IDS/IPS, log analysis can detect)
    *   **Actionable Insights:**
        *   Regularly patch the OS.
        *   Harden the OS (disable unnecessary services, firewall).
        *   Use a minimal OS image.
        *   Monitor system logs (IDS/IPS).
*   **[***OS***] (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** Full control of the operating system means full control of the Vault server and all its data.
    *   **Impact:** Very High

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vault Misconfiguration -> Weak Auth -> [***Creds***]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vault_misconfiguration_-_weak_auth_-__creds_.md)

*   **Path Description:** The attacker leverages weak authentication mechanisms to obtain valid credentials for Vault.
*   **[Weak Auth]: Weak Authentication Mechanisms:**
    *   **Description:** Using weak passwords, default credentials, or lacking MFA.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration)
    *   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized access to Vault)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low to Low (Brute-force, password guessing)
    *   **Skill Level:** Very Low to Low (Basic hacking techniques)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium (Failed login attempts, unusual activity)
    *   **Actionable Insights:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        *   Use appropriate auth methods.
        *   Regularly review and rotate credentials.
*   **[***Creds***] (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** Valid credentials grant direct access to Vault, potentially with high privileges.
    *   **Impact:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Vault Misconfiguration -> Unsealed -> [***Keys***]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_vault_misconfiguration_-_unsealed_-__keys_.md)

*   **Path Description:** The attacker gains access to the unseal keys due to insecure storage or handling.
*   **[Unsealed]: Vault Unsealed Insecurely:**
    *   **Description:** Leaving Vault unsealed insecurely (plain text keys, insecure auto-unseal).
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires significant insider access or severe misconfiguration)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Full access to all secrets)
    *   **Effort:** Low (If unseal keys are readily available)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low (If unseal keys are poorly protected)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High (Requires monitoring of unseal attempts)
    *   **Actionable Insights:**
        *   Use a secure unseal mechanism (Shamir's Secret Sharing).
        *   Consider auto-unseal with a trusted KMS or HSM.
        *   Protect unseal keys rigorously.
        *   Monitor unseal attempts.
*   **[***Keys***] (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** The unseal keys are the master keys to decrypt Vault's data. Their compromise is catastrophic.
    *   **Impact:** Very High

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Abuse Legitimate Vault Access -> Leaked Creds -> [***Creds***]](./attack_tree_paths/4__abuse_legitimate_vault_access_-_leaked_creds_-__creds_.md)

*    **Path Description:** The attacker obtains valid Vault credentials that have been leaked through various means.
*   **[Leaked Creds]: Leaked Credentials:**
    *   **Description:** Credentials exposed in code, data breaches, or other leaks.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Accidental exposure, data breaches)
    *   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized access to Vault)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (If credentials are found)
    *   **Skill Level:** Very Low (No specific Vault knowledge needed)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High (Requires monitoring for credential leaks and unusual activity)
    *   **Actionable Insights:**
        *   Never store credentials in code.
        *   Use a secrets management tool.
        *   Regularly rotate credentials.
        *   Monitor for credential leaks.
*   **[***Creds***] (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** Valid credentials grant direct access to Vault.
    *   **Impact:** High
