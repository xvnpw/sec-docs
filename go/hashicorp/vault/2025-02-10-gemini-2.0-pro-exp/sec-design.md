Okay, let's create a design document for HashiCorp Vault, keeping in mind its purpose and the need for a threat modeling-ready document.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

HashiCorp Vault is a secrets management tool.  Its primary business purpose is to provide a secure and reliable way for organizations to store, manage, and access sensitive information (secrets) like API keys, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys.  It addresses the critical business need to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, both internal and external.  Given its role in securing critical infrastructure, Vault itself must be highly available and resilient.

Business Priorities:

*   Security: Protecting sensitive data is paramount.
*   Reliability:  Vault must be highly available and fault-tolerant. Downtime means applications can't access secrets, potentially causing widespread outages.
*   Scalability:  Vault needs to scale to handle the demands of large and growing organizations.
*   Compliance:  Helping organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) related to data protection.
*   Auditability:  Providing a clear audit trail of all secret access and management activities.
*   Usability:  Offering a user-friendly interface and API for developers and operators.
*   Integrations: Seamlessly integrating with other systems and tools in the DevOps ecosystem.

Business Risks:

*   Unauthorized Access to Secrets:  The most significant risk is a breach that exposes sensitive data. This could lead to financial loss, reputational damage, legal penalties, and operational disruption.
*   Data Loss:  Loss of secrets due to hardware failure, software bugs, or human error could render applications and systems unusable.
*   Insider Threats:  Malicious or negligent insiders with access to Vault could compromise secrets.
*   Denial of Service:  An attack that renders Vault unavailable could cripple dependent systems.
*   Misconfiguration:  Incorrectly configured Vault deployments could expose vulnerabilities.
*   Compliance Violations:  Failure to properly manage secrets could lead to non-compliance with relevant regulations.
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Vulnerabilities in Vault's dependencies or build process could be exploited.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on the GitHub repository and HashiCorp documentation):

*   security control: Access Control Lists (ACLs): Vault uses a policy-based access control system to restrict access to secrets based on identity and role. Implemented within Vault's policy engine.
*   security control: Authentication Methods: Supports multiple authentication methods (e.g., username/password, tokens, AppRole, cloud IAM, Kubernetes Service Accounts). Implemented as pluggable authentication backends.
*   security control: Encryption in Transit:  All communication with Vault is encrypted using TLS. Described in Vault's documentation and configuration options.
*   security control: Encryption at Rest:  Vault encrypts data before storing it in its storage backend. Implemented using a layered encryption approach with a master key and data encryption keys.
*   security control: Auditing:  Vault provides detailed audit logs of all requests and responses. Implemented as pluggable audit devices.
*   security control: Secret Engines:  Vault supports various secret engines (e.g., Key/Value, Transit, PKI, Database) to manage different types of secrets. Implemented as pluggable secret engines.
*   security control: Dynamic Secrets:  Vault can generate dynamic secrets (e.g., database credentials) on demand, reducing the risk of long-lived credentials. Implemented within specific secret engines.
*   security control: Leasing and Renewal:  Secrets can be leased for a specific period, and clients must renew the lease to maintain access. Implemented within Vault's core leasing mechanism.
*   security control: Revocation:  Secrets and tokens can be revoked, immediately invalidating access. Implemented within Vault's core revocation mechanism.
*   security control: Response Wrapping: Sensitive data returned by Vault can be wrapped in a single-use token, protecting it from exposure in logs or intermediate systems. Implemented within Vault's cubbyhole response wrapping.
*   security control: Multi-factor Authentication (MFA): Supported through various authentication methods and plugins.
*   security control: Control Groups: Allow for requiring multiple approvals for sensitive operations.
*   security control: Namespaces: Enterprise feature for isolating tenants.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Complexity of Configuration:  Vault is a complex system, and misconfiguration is a potential risk. Mitigation relies on thorough documentation, training, and careful operational procedures.
*   accepted risk: Dependency on Storage Backend:  Vault's security and availability depend on the chosen storage backend (e.g., Consul, etcd, Raft).  Mitigation involves selecting a highly available and secure storage backend and implementing appropriate backup and recovery procedures.
*   accepted risk: Single Point of Failure (Unsealed Vault):  A newly initialized or unsealed Vault instance represents a single point of failure until it's properly configured for high availability. Mitigation involves following best practices for high availability setup.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits of Vault deployments, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.
*   Principle of Least Privilege:  Strictly enforce the principle of least privilege, granting users and applications only the minimum necessary access to secrets.
*   Network Segmentation:  Isolate Vault servers on a dedicated network segment with strict firewall rules.
*   Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):  Deploy IDPS to monitor network traffic and detect malicious activity.
*   Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):  Integrate Vault audit logs with a SIEM system for centralized security monitoring and alerting.
*   Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):  Consider using HSMs to protect Vault's master key and enhance the security of cryptographic operations.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for multiple authentication methods, including strong authentication options like multi-factor authentication.
    *   Integration with existing identity providers (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, cloud IAM).
    *   Secure storage and management of authentication credentials.
    *   Session management with appropriate timeouts and invalidation mechanisms.

*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control based on roles and policies.
    *   Support for the principle of least privilege.
    *   Ability to define and enforce access control policies for all secrets and operations.
    *   Regular review and auditing of access control policies.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all input to the Vault API and CLI to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Sanitize data before using it in internal operations or storing it in the backend.
    *   Enforce data type and format restrictions.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols (e.g., AES-256, TLS 1.3).
    *   Secure key management practices, including key rotation and protection of master keys.
    *   Use of HSMs for enhanced security.
    *   Protection against known cryptographic attacks (e.g., padding oracle attacks, timing attacks).
