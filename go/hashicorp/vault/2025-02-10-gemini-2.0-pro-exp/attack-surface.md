# Attack Surface Analysis for hashicorp/vault

## Attack Surface: [Storage Backend Compromise (Vault-Direct Aspect)](./attack_surfaces/storage_backend_compromise__vault-direct_aspect_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to Vault's storage backend, leading to direct manipulation of Vault's encrypted data.
*   **How Vault Contributes:** Vault *relies* on the storage backend for persistence, but the *direct* Vault-related risk is the potential for an attacker to bypass Vault's access controls by directly interacting with the encrypted data.  This is distinct from simply compromising the backend's *infrastructure*.
*   **Example:** An attacker, having gained access to the storage backend, attempts to decrypt Vault's data using known or brute-forced encryption keys, or modifies the stored data to inject malicious entries.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of all secrets, encryption keys, and audit logs stored in Vault. Attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete all Vault data, *even if they cannot unseal Vault normally*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies (Vault-Direct Focus):**
    *   **Developers/Users:**
        *   Ensure Vault is configured to use a storage backend that supports encryption *and* that Vault can leverage that encryption for its own data protection (e.g., using a KMS). This adds a layer of defense even if the backend is accessed directly.
        *   Regularly rotate Vault's master key. This limits the impact of a potential key compromise.
        *   Implement strict access controls *within Vault* to limit which users/applications can access which secrets, even if the storage backend is compromised. This is defense-in-depth.

## Attack Surface: [Unsealing Key/Shards Compromise](./attack_surfaces/unsealing_keyshards_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized acquisition of the unsealing keys or a sufficient number of Shamir's Secret Sharing shards.
*   **How Vault Contributes:** This is *entirely* a Vault-specific risk. Vault's security model is fundamentally based on the secrecy of these keys/shards.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a configuration file or environment variable where an unseal key is mistakenly stored.
*   **Impact:** Attacker can unseal Vault and gain full access to all stored secrets.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users:**
        *   Use Shamir's Secret Sharing with a high threshold (e.g., 3-of-5).
        *   Distribute the shards to *different*, trusted individuals or systems.  *Never* store all shards together.
        *   If using auto-unseal (via a KMS), *carefully* evaluate the security implications and trust model of the KMS provider.  Ensure the KMS itself is highly secure.
        *   Implement strict physical and logical access controls around the storage and handling of unseal keys/shards.
        *   Regularly rotate unseal keys/shards.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication for any manual unsealing process.

## Attack Surface: [Vault API Exposure and Vulnerabilities (Direct Exploitation)](./attack_surfaces/vault_api_exposure_and_vulnerabilities__direct_exploitation_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities *within Vault's API code* or unauthorized access due to misconfigured API access controls.
*   **How Vault Contributes:** This is a *direct* risk related to the Vault software itself and its exposed API.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a zero-day vulnerability in Vault's API to bypass authentication and gain administrative access.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to complete system compromise (control of Vault).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users:**
        *   Keep Vault updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.  Subscribe to HashiCorp security advisories and act *immediately* on critical updates.
        *   Implement strict network ACLs to allow access to the Vault API *only* from authorized client IPs/networks.
        *   Enable and regularly review Vault's audit logs, looking for any signs of unauthorized access attempts or exploitation.
        *   Regularly perform penetration testing specifically targeting the Vault API.

## Attack Surface: [Client Token Leakage/Compromise (Leading to Vault Access)](./attack_surfaces/client_token_leakagecompromise__leading_to_vault_access_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to a valid Vault client token, allowing an attacker to *directly* interact with Vault.
*   **How Vault Contributes:** Vault *issues* these tokens, and their compromise directly impacts Vault's security.
*   **Example:** A compromised CI/CD pipeline leaks a Vault token, which an attacker uses to retrieve secrets from Vault.
*   **Impact:** Attacker can impersonate the client and access any secrets the token is authorized to access *within Vault*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the token's permissions)
*   **Mitigation Strategies (Vault-Direct Focus):**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Use short-lived tokens (minimize TTL) *within Vault*. This is a core Vault configuration.
        *   Use token wrapping (Cubbyhole response wrapping) for secure token delivery. This is a Vault feature.
        *   Use AppRole or other authentication methods that minimize the exposure of long-lived credentials *to Vault*.
        *   Revoke tokens immediately if compromise is suspected *using Vault's revocation mechanisms*.
        *   Use Vault Agent for automatic token renewal and management, reducing the risk of manual handling errors.
    * **Users:**
        *   Understand that any compromised token grants direct access to Vault, and treat tokens accordingly.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration of Vault Policies (Granting Excessive Access)](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_of_vault_policies__granting_excessive_access_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured Vault policies that grant excessive permissions *within Vault*.
*   **How Vault Contributes:** This is *entirely* a Vault-specific risk. Vault's authorization is controlled *solely* by its policies.
*   **Example:** A policy intended for a read-only service is accidentally configured to allow write access to a sensitive secrets path.
*   **Impact:** An attacker who compromises a client with an overly permissive policy can access or modify more secrets *within Vault* than intended.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege. Grant only the *minimum* necessary permissions to each client and user *within Vault's policy system*.
        *   Regularly review and audit Vault policies.
        *   Use infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to manage Vault policies and ensure consistency and version control.
        *   Implement policy-as-code to enforce security best practices and prevent common misconfigurations.
        *   Use Vault's policy templating features to avoid duplication and reduce errors.
        *   Thoroughly test policies *within a Vault testing environment* before deploying them to production.
