### High and Critical Vault-Specific Threats

This document outlines high and critical threats directly involving HashiCorp Vault components.

*   **Threat:** Weak Authentication Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker might exploit default or weak authentication methods (e.g., default root token) to gain unauthorized access to Vault. They could then read, modify, or delete secrets, policies, and audit logs.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Vault instance, leading to unauthorized access to all secrets, potential data breaches, and disruption of services relying on Vault.
    *   **Component Affected:** Auth Methods (e.g., Userpass, Token, AppRole)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never use the default root token in production. Generate new root tokens and securely distribute the unseal keys.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for userpass authentication.
        *   Utilize more secure authentication methods like AppRole, Kubernetes, or cloud provider IAM.
        *   Regularly rotate authentication credentials and tokens.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication where supported by the chosen auth method.

*   **Threat:** Authorization Policy Flaws
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit overly permissive or incorrectly configured Vault policies to gain access to secrets they shouldn't have. This could involve reading sensitive data or escalating privileges within Vault.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive secrets, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation within the application, and compromise of other systems.
    *   **Component Affected:** Policy Engine (ACLs, RBAC)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege when defining Vault policies.
