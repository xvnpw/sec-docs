## Vulnerability List for HCL Project

### 1. Vulnerability Name: Potential Code Injection via User-Defined Functions

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious HCL configuration file.
    2. This configuration file defines a user-defined function using the `function` block from the `userfunc` extension.
    3. Within the `result` expression of the function, the attacker injects code, potentially leveraging application-provided functions or other HCL features.
    4. When the application parses and evaluates this configuration file, the malicious user-defined function is registered.
    5. If the application subsequently calls this user-defined function, the injected code within the `result` expression is executed within the application's context.

- Impact:
    - **Critical**: Code injection can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or further attacks on internal infrastructure.

- Vulnerability Rank: critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None evident from the provided files. The `userfunc` extension focuses on functionality rather than security.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input validation and sanitization**: The `result` expression within user-defined functions should be strictly validated and sanitized to prevent injection of malicious code.
    - **Sandboxing or restricted execution environment**: User-defined functions should be executed in a sandboxed or restricted environment with limited privileges to minimize the impact of potential code injection vulnerabilities.
    - **Principle of least privilege**: Avoid providing overly powerful or unsafe functions to the HCL evaluation context that could be misused by attackers through user-defined functions.

- Preconditions:
    - The application must enable and use the `userfunc` extension.
    - The application must parse and evaluate HCL configuration files provided or influenced by external users.
    - The application must call user-defined functions defined in the configuration.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: /code/ext/userfunc/decode.go**: The `decodeUserFunctions` function parses `function` blocks and registers them in the `funcs` map.
    2. **File: /code/ext/userfunc/decode.go**: The `impl` function within `decodeUserFunctions` directly evaluates the `resultExpr` using `resultExpr.Value(ctx)`.
    3. **File: /code/ext/userfunc/decode.go**: The `ctx` used for evaluation is created using `getBaseCtx()` and populated with function parameters, but there is no explicit sanitization or validation of the `resultExpr` itself.
    4. **Visualization**:

    ```
    User-provided config file --> HCL Parser --> AST (Body) --> DecodeUserFunctions
                                                                    |
                                                                    V
    function "malicious" {                                     funcs map[string]function.Function
      params = [...]                                                |
      result = <INJECTED CODE>                                     |
    }                                                              |
                                                                    V
    Application calls "malicious" function --> impl function (decode.go) --> resultExpr.Value(ctx) --> INJECTED CODE EXECUTION
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious HCL configuration file (e.g., `malicious.hcl`) with a user-defined function that attempts to execute a system command:

    ```hcl
    function "malicious_command" {
      params = []
      result = exec("/bin/sh", "-c", "whoami > /tmp/hcl_pwned") // Assuming 'exec' function is available in the context for demonstration
    }

    vulnerable_block {
      action = malicious_command()
    }
    ```

    2.  Set up a test application that:
        - Uses `hclsimple.DecodeFile` or a lower-level API to parse and decode the `malicious.hcl` file.
        - Includes the `userfunc` extension and registers user-defined functions from the configuration.
        - Executes code that triggers the `vulnerable_block` which in turn calls the `malicious_command` function.

    3. Run the test application with the `malicious.hcl` file.

    4. Observe if the file `/tmp/hcl_pwned` is created and contains the output of the `whoami` command. If it is, the code injection vulnerability is confirmed.

    5. Check application logs or system behavior for any other signs of code execution or unexpected actions triggered by the malicious configuration.
