### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Dynamic Block Type Expansion with Uncontrolled Collection Length
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious HCL configuration.
    2. The configuration includes a `dynamic` block definition.
    3. The `for_each` attribute of the `dynamic` block is set to an expression that, when evaluated, results in an excessively large collection (e.g., a list or map with millions of elements).
    4. The attacker submits this configuration to the application for parsing and processing.
    5. When the application attempts to expand the `dynamic` block, it iterates over the very large collection.
    6. For each element in the collection, a new block is generated, consuming significant resources (memory and CPU).
    7. This excessive resource consumption leads to performance degradation, application instability, or potential memory exhaustion.
- Impact: High. Excessive resource consumption (memory, CPU) leading to performance degradation or potential application instability. In cloud environments, it could lead to increased costs due to resource scaling.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently implemented mitigations: None. No explicit size limits or resource controls for dynamic block expansion are implemented in the provided code.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement limits on the maximum size (number of elements) of the `for_each` collection allowed in `dynamic` blocks.
    - Introduce resource quotas or timeouts to restrict the resources consumed during dynamic block expansion, preventing unbounded consumption.
    - Implement validation of the `for_each` expression result to ensure it is within acceptable size limits before proceeding with expansion.
- Preconditions:
    - The application using HCL must have the `dynamic` blocks extension enabled.
    - The application must process HCL configurations where the `for_each` attribute in `dynamic` blocks can be influenced or directly controlled by external users (attackers).
- Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/ext/dynblock/expand_body.go`
    2. Function: `expandBlocks`
    3. The `expandBlocks` function processes `dynamic` blocks by iterating over the collection obtained from the `for_each` attribute:
    ```go
    for it := forEachVal.ElementIterator(); it.Next(); {
        key, value := it.Element()
        // ... block generation logic ...
    }
    ```
    4. There are no explicit checks within this loop or in the surrounding code to limit the number of iterations or the size of the `forEachVal` collection.
    5. If a malicious user can provide a configuration with a `for_each` expression that evaluates to a very large collection, the `expandBlocks` function will attempt to iterate over all its elements, generating a large number of blocks and consuming excessive resources.
    6. This unbounded iteration can lead to memory exhaustion or significant performance degradation, as the application attempts to create and manage a huge number of dynamically generated blocks.

- Security test case:
    1. Prepare a malicious HCL input configuration (e.g., `evil_config.hcl`). This configuration should define a `dynamic` block with a `for_each` expression that generates a very large list. For example:
    ```hcl
    variable "large_count" {
      type    = number
      default = 200000
    }

    locals {
      large_list = range(var.large_count)
    }

    resource "test_resource" "test" {
      dynamic "large_block_gen" {
        for_each = local.large_list
        content {
          attribute = "test_value"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    2. Configure the target application to parse and process `evil_config.hcl`, ensuring that the `dynamic` block extension is enabled in the HCL parsing/processing engine.
    3. As an external attacker, initiate the application's configuration loading process using the malicious configuration.
    4. Monitor the resource consumption of the application process during configuration loading, specifically memory and CPU usage.
    5. Observe if the application exhibits a significant increase in memory consumption, CPU usage spikes, or becomes unresponsive.
    6. If the application's performance degrades significantly or if it exhausts available memory and potentially crashes, the vulnerability is confirmed. The extent of the degradation or resource exhaustion should be considered high, as it impacts application availability and stability.
