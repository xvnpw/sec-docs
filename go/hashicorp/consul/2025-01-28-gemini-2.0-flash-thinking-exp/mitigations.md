## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Consul Access Control Lists (ACLs)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_consul_access_control_lists__acls_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Consul Access Control Lists (ACLs)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Enable the ACL system within Consul server configuration by setting `acl.enabled = true`.
    *   Step 2: Bootstrap the ACL system during initial Consul server setup to create a root ACL token with `global-management` privileges.
    *   Step 3: Define Consul ACL policies that specify permissions for different resources like services, KV store paths, nodes, and prepared queries. Policies should adhere to the principle of least privilege.
    *   Step 4: Create Consul ACL roles and associate them with defined policies. Roles represent sets of permissions for different users or application components.
    *   Step 5: Generate Consul ACL tokens and assign appropriate roles to them. Tokens are used by applications and users to authenticate with Consul and access resources based on their assigned roles.
    *   Step 6: Securely distribute and manage Consul ACL tokens. Avoid embedding tokens directly in code; use environment variables or secure secret stores.
    *   Step 7: Regularly audit and review Consul ACL policies and token usage to ensure they remain effective and aligned with security needs.

    *   Step 3: Create user accounts within Consul (if using built-in auth) or manage user accounts in the integrated identity provider.
    *   Step 4: Enforce strong password policies for Consul user accounts if using built-in authentication.
    *   Step 5: Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access to the Consul UI and API for enhanced security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Service Registration Information in Consul](./mitigation_strategies/secure_service_registration_information_in_consul.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Secure Service Registration Information in Consul

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Review service registration definitions for all services registering with Consul. Identify any potentially sensitive information being included in service metadata, tags, or check definitions.
    *   Step 2: Remove sensitive data from service registration definitions. Avoid including API keys, passwords, internal URLs that should not be broadly exposed, or other confidential information.
    *   Step 3: If sensitive data is required for service communication, utilize secure alternatives to service registration for exchanging this data. Consider using Consul Connect's intentions for secure service-to-service communication or HashiCorp Vault for dynamic secret retrieval.
    *   Step 4: Leverage Consul Connect for service-to-service authorization and authentication instead of relying on potentially sensitive information within service registration for access control.
    *   Step 5: Regularly review service registration configurations to ensure no sensitive data is inadvertently exposed through Consul's service catalog.

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Service Segmentation and Network Policies *around Consul*

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Segment your network to isolate Consul servers and agents into dedicated network segments (VLANs, subnets). This limits the blast radius if Consul infrastructure is compromised.
    *   Step 2: Implement network firewalls or security groups to strictly control network access to Consul ports (e.g., 8500, 8501, 8300, 8301, 8302). Restrict access only to authorized sources, such as application servers, monitoring systems, and administrative workstations.
    *   Step 3: Apply network policies within your infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes Network Policies, cloud provider security groups) to further control network traffic *to and from Consul agents*. This can limit the services that can communicate with Consul agents.
    *   Step 4: Deny all unnecessary inbound and outbound network traffic to and from Consul servers and agents at the network firewall level.

    *   Exposure of Sensitive Information Stored in Consul Agent Configuration Files: High reduction - Prevents direct exposure of secrets and sensitive data in agent config files.
    *   Unauthorized Modification of Consul Agent Configuration: Medium reduction - File permissions and configuration management tools limit unauthorized changes to agent configurations.
    *   Configuration Drift and Inconsistency *across Consul agents*: Low reduction - Configuration management ensures consistency, indirectly improving the overall security posture of the Consul deployment.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - File permissions are set to restrict access to Consul agent configuration files. Environment variables are used for some sensitive configurations.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent use of environment variables or Vault for *all* sensitive configurations within Consul agent configurations is not fully enforced.
    *   Configuration management tools are not fully utilized for managing Consul agent configurations across all environments.
    *   Automated checks to detect sensitive data inadvertently included in Consul agent configuration files are not implemented.
    *   Regular audits of Consul agent configuration files specifically for security misconfigurations are not routinely performed.
