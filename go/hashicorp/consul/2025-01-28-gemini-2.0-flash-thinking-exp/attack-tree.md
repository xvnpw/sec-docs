## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Consul Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_consul_configuration_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations in Consul, primarily related to Access Control Lists (ACLs). Weak or default ACLs are a common configuration mistake that can have severe security implications.
*   **Critical Node: Weak or Default ACLs**
    *   **Description:**  If Consul ACLs are not properly configured, using default settings or overly permissive rules, unauthorized users can gain access to Consul's management interfaces and data.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers can attempt to access the Consul UI or API without proper authentication or with easily guessable default credentials.
    *   **Impact:**  Leads to unauthorized access to Consul, potentially allowing data theft, service manipulation, and ultimately application compromise.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement strong, role-based ACLs, following the principle of least privilege. Regularly review and audit ACL configurations.

*   **Critical Node: Gain Unauthorized Access to Consul UI/API**
    *   **Description:** Successful exploitation of weak ACLs results in unauthorized access to Consul's user interface and Application Programming Interface (API).
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers use web browsers or API clients to interact with Consul UI/API, bypassing intended access controls.
    *   **Impact:**  Provides attackers with a platform to interact with Consul, enabling further malicious actions like data exfiltration and service manipulation.
    *   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong ACLs, implement multi-factor authentication for Consul access, and restrict network access to Consul UI/API to trusted networks.

*   **Critical Node: Exfiltrate Application Secrets/Credentials**
    *   **Description:**  With unauthorized access to Consul, attackers can read sensitive data stored in Consul's Key-Value (KV) store, including application secrets and credentials.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers use the Consul UI or API to browse and retrieve data from the KV store.
    *   **Impact:** Stolen secrets can be used to directly compromise the application, gain access to backend systems, or escalate privileges.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Encrypt sensitive data in the KV store, even with ACLs in place. Implement robust secret management practices and consider using dedicated secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault.

*   **Critical Node: Redirect Service Traffic to Malicious Endpoint**
    *   **Description:**  Attackers with unauthorized access can modify service definitions in Consul, redirecting application traffic intended for legitimate services to attacker-controlled malicious endpoints.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers use the Consul API to update service definitions, changing service addresses or ports.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows attackers to intercept application data, manipulate application functionality, or launch further attacks from the malicious endpoint.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Enforce strict ACLs on service registration and modification. Implement monitoring for unauthorized service definition changes. Consider using service mesh features for secure service-to-service communication.

*   **Critical Node: Register Malicious Services**
    *   **Description:**  Attackers can register their own malicious services within Consul's service discovery registry. These services can be used to impersonate legitimate services or disrupt application functionality.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers use the Consul API to register new services, potentially with names similar to legitimate services to trick applications.
    *   **Impact:**  Applications might connect to malicious services instead of legitimate ones, leading to data theft, functionality manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Enforce strict ACLs on service registration. Implement service validation and monitoring to detect and prevent registration of unauthorized or suspicious services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Communication (No TLS/Weak TLS)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_communication__no_tlsweak_tls_.md)

*   **Description:** This path exploits the lack of or weak Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for communication within the Consul cluster and between applications and Consul. This allows for Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
*   **Critical Node: Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Consul Communication**
    *   **Description:**  If Consul communication is not encrypted or uses weak encryption, attackers positioned on the network can intercept and potentially modify Consul traffic.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers use network sniffing tools to capture Consul communication packets.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromises the confidentiality and integrity of Consul data, including service discovery information, configuration data, and potentially secrets.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Enforce TLS for all Consul communication (agent-server, server-server, client-server, gossip). Use strong TLS configurations and regularly rotate certificates.

*   **Critical Node: Intercept Configuration Data**
    *   **Description:**  Through a MitM attack on unencrypted Consul communication, attackers can intercept configuration data being exchanged, which may include application secrets and credentials.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers passively monitor network traffic and extract sensitive data from unencrypted Consul messages.
    *   **Impact:**  Stolen secrets can be used to directly compromise the application, similar to the "Exfiltrate Application Secrets/Credentials" path via weak ACLs.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Enforce TLS for all Consul communication. Implement secure secret transmission practices even within encrypted channels.

*   **Critical Node: Steal Application Secrets/Credentials**
    *   **Description:**  Successful interception of configuration data containing secrets leads to the theft of application secrets and credentials.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers analyze intercepted network traffic to identify and extract sensitive credentials.
    *   **Impact:**  Direct application compromise, access to backend systems, privilege escalation, and data breaches.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Enforce TLS, secure secret management, and minimize the transmission of secrets over the network whenever possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Consul Ports/Services](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_consul_portsservices.md)

*   **Description:** This path highlights the risk of exposing Consul ports, especially the UI/API ports, to untrusted networks like the public internet. This drastically increases the attack surface and likelihood of exploitation.
*   **Critical Node: Direct Access to Consul UI/API from Untrusted Network**
    *   **Description:**  When Consul UI/API ports (typically 8500 and 8501) are accessible from untrusted networks, attackers can directly attempt to access and exploit Consul.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers scan for open ports and directly connect to the exposed Consul UI/API from the internet or other untrusted networks.
    *   **Impact:**  Significantly increases the likelihood of exploiting weak ACLs or other vulnerabilities, leading to all the downstream impacts described in the "Exploit Consul Configuration Weaknesses" path.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Restrict network access to Consul ports to trusted networks only. Use firewalls and network segmentation to isolate Consul infrastructure. Never expose Consul UI/API directly to the public internet. Use VPNs or bastion hosts for secure remote access if needed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering/Insider Threat](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineeringinsider_threat.md)

*   **Description:** This path considers the risk of application compromise through social engineering or insider threats that lead to the compromise of Consul administrator credentials.
*   **Critical Node: Compromise Consul Administrator Credentials**
    *   **Description:** If an attacker can obtain the credentials of a Consul administrator, they gain full control over the Consul cluster and all managed services and configurations.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers may use social engineering tactics (phishing, pretexting), insider collaboration, or credential theft techniques to obtain administrator usernames and passwords or API tokens.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete control over Consul, allowing attackers to perform any malicious action, including data theft, service manipulation, denial of service, and full application compromise.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Implement strong password policies, multi-factor authentication for administrator accounts, robust access control and audit logging, background checks for privileged users, and insider threat detection programs.
