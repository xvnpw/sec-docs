# Attack Surface Analysis for hashicorp/consul

## Attack Surface: [1. Unauthenticated HTTP API Access](./attack_surfaces/1__unauthenticated_http_api_access.md)

*   **Description:**  The Consul HTTP API, used for management and querying, is exposed without proper authentication, allowing unauthorized access.
*   **Consul Contribution:** By default, Consul's HTTP API can be accessed without authentication. If not explicitly secured, it becomes a readily available entry point.
*   **Example:** An attacker scans open ports and finds Consul's HTTP API (port 8500) exposed to the internet. They can use `curl` to query service discovery information, read KV store data, or even attempt to register malicious services.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration (service details, KV store data), unauthorized service registration/deregistration, potential cluster disruption, and information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable ACLs (Access Control Lists) to enforce authentication and authorization for all API requests.
    *   Use HTTPS/TLS for API communication to encrypt data in transit.
    *   Restrict network access to the HTTP API port using firewalls and network segmentation.

## Attack Surface: [2. Unencrypted Communication Channels](./attack_surfaces/2__unencrypted_communication_channels.md)

*   **Description:**  Communication between Consul components (agents, servers, API clients) occurs over unencrypted channels, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Consul Contribution:**  By default, Consul communication (HTTP API, agent-server, server-server gossip) is not encrypted.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network as Consul agents intercepts unencrypted agent-server communication to observe service registration details and health check information. Or, an attacker performs a man-in-the-middle attack on the HTTP API to capture ACL tokens or sensitive data being transmitted.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, credential theft (ACL tokens), potential manipulation of data in transit, and loss of confidentiality.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS for the HTTP API (HTTPS).
    *   Enable TLS for Agent-Server communication.
    *   Enable TLS for Server-Server communication (Gossip, Raft).

## Attack Surface: [3. Weak or Default ACL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/3__weak_or_default_acl_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  Consul ACLs are not properly configured or left at their default permissive settings, allowing unauthorized actions.
*   **Consul Contribution:** Consul's default ACL policy is permissive. If administrators don't explicitly configure and enforce ACLs, access control is weak or non-existent.
*   **Example:** An internal user with no legitimate need to manage infrastructure gains access to the Consul HTTP API (even if authenticated) and is able to modify KV store data, deregister critical services, or create overly permissive ACL tokens due to weak default policies.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, service disruption, privilege escalation, and potential compromise of the Consul cluster.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement Least Privilege ACLs, granting only necessary permissions.
    *   Regularly review and audit ACL configurations.
    *   Enforce a default deny policy and explicitly grant permissions.

## Attack Surface: [4. Insecure KV Store Usage](./attack_surfaces/4__insecure_kv_store_usage.md)

*   **Description:**  Sensitive data is stored unencrypted in the Consul KV store, or access to the KV store is not adequately controlled.
*   **Consul Contribution:** Consul's KV store is a convenient place to store configuration data, but it doesn't inherently provide encryption at rest in the open-source version and relies on ACLs for access control.
*   **Example:** Developers store database credentials or API keys directly in the Consul KV store without encryption. If Consul is compromised or ACLs are misconfigured, this sensitive data is exposed.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, secrets, and confidential information, leading to potential breaches of other systems and data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing secrets directly in the KV store; use dedicated secret management solutions.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data at the application level before storing it in Consul if KV store usage is unavoidable. Consider Consul Enterprise for encryption at rest.
    *   Enforce strict ACLs on KV store paths to restrict access.

## Attack Surface: [5. Exposed Consul Server Ports](./attack_surfaces/5__exposed_consul_server_ports.md)

*   **Description:**  Consul *server* ports are exposed to untrusted networks, increasing the attack surface and potential for direct, critical attacks.
*   **Consul Contribution:** Consul servers require specific ports for cluster communication and API access. Exposing these ports unnecessarily creates a direct attack vector.
*   **Example:** Consul server ports (8300, 8301, 8302, 8500, 8600, 9300) are exposed to the public internet. An attacker can attempt to directly connect to these ports to exploit potential vulnerabilities in Consul services, perform denial-of-service attacks, or attempt unauthorized cluster control.
*   **Impact:** Cluster disruption, data exfiltration, denial of service, and potential full compromise of the Consul cluster.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict network access with firewalls to *only* allow necessary traffic to Consul server ports from trusted networks.
    *   Deploy Consul servers within secure, isolated network zones.
    *   Use VPNs or bastion hosts for secure remote access to Consul management interfaces.

## Attack Surface: [6. Agent Compromise Leading to Consul Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/6__agent_compromise_leading_to_consul_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:**  A compromised Consul agent is leveraged to manipulate service registrations, health checks, and disrupt Consul's service discovery functionality.
*   **Consul Contribution:** Consul agents have the authority to register services and manage health checks within Consul. Agent compromise allows attackers to abuse this functionality.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises an application running alongside a Consul agent and gains control of the agent. They use the agent to deregister legitimate services, register malicious services, or manipulate health checks, disrupting application traffic flow and service discovery.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, redirection of traffic to malicious services, false service health reporting, and potential cascading failures.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure agent hosts by hardening the OS and applying security best practices.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to agent processes.
    *   Monitor agent activity for suspicious behavior.
    *   Regularly update agents to patch vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [7. Server Node Compromise](./attack_surfaces/7__server_node_compromise.md)

*   **Description:**  Compromise of a Consul server node grants attackers access to the entire Consul data store and control over the cluster, representing a critical breach.
*   **Consul Contribution:** Consul servers are the core of the cluster and hold all critical data. Server compromise directly leads to control over the entire Consul system.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability to gain root access to a Consul server node. They can then access the entire KV store, manipulate ACLs, disrupt the Raft consensus, and potentially take over the entire Consul cluster.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Consul cluster, data loss, service disruption, and potential cascading failures across applications relying on Consul.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Extensively harden server nodes (OS hardening, firewalls, intrusion detection).
    *   Minimize server exposure and restrict network access.
    *   Implement regular security updates and patching for servers and OS.
    *   Enforce strong access controls for server access.
    *   Maintain regular backups and a disaster recovery plan.
