### High and Critical Consul Threats

This document outlines high and critical threats directly involving HashiCorp Consul components.

#### Threats Related to Consul Agent Compromise

*   **Threat:** Consul Agent Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Consul agent running on a host. Once inside, they can interact with the local Consul agent API to manipulate Consul's state.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can retrieve sensitive data from the KV store accessible by the agent, manipulate service discovery, impersonate services, modify health checks, and potentially access the Consul API with the agent's permissions. This can lead to data breaches, service disruptions, and misrouting of traffic.
    *   **Affected Component:** Consul Agent
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong host-level security measures.
        *   Regularly patch the operating system and Consul agent.
        *   Use strong authentication for accessing the agent (where applicable).
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege for the agent's user.
        *   Monitor agent logs for suspicious activity.
        *   Secure communication between the application and the local Consul agent.

#### Threats Related to Consul Server Compromise

*   **Threat:** Consul Server Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Consul server node. Servers hold the authoritative state of the Consul cluster.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker gains full control over the Consul cluster. They can read and modify all data in the KV store, disrupt service discovery and health checks, manipulate ACLs, potentially steal Consul tokens, and cause widespread outages.
    *   **Affected Component:** Consul Server
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the operating system of Consul servers.
        *   Regularly patch the operating system and Consul server software.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing Consul servers.
        *   Restrict network access to Consul servers.
        *   Use TLS encryption for all communication within the Consul cluster.
        *   Implement robust monitoring and alerting for server health and activity.

#### Threats Related to Consul ACLs

*   **Threat:** Misconfigured Consul ACLs
    *   **Description:** ACLs are not configured correctly, leading to either overly permissive access (allowing unauthorized entities to access resources) or overly restrictive access (preventing legitimate services from functioning).
    *   **Impact:** Overly permissive ACLs can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data in the KV store, manipulation of service discovery, and other privileged operations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Consul ACL System
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adopt a principle of least privilege when configuring ACLs.
        *   Thoroughly test ACL configurations before deploying them.
        *   Use version control for managing ACL configurations.
        *   Regularly audit ACL configurations.
        *   Implement automated tools for managing and validating ACLs.
*   **Threat:** Consul Token Compromise
    *   **Description:** Consul tokens, used for authentication and authorization, are stolen or leaked.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker with a valid token can perform actions within Consul with the privileges associated with that token, potentially including reading sensitive data, modifying configurations, or disrupting services. High-privilege tokens pose a significant risk.
    *   **Affected Component:** Consul ACL System, Consul API
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store Consul tokens securely (e.g., using a secrets management system).
        *   Use short-lived tokens where possible.
        *   Implement token rotation policies.
        *   Encrypt tokens in transit and at rest.
        *   Monitor token usage for suspicious activity.
        *   Revoke compromised tokens immediately.

#### Threats Related to Consul KV Store

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Sensitive KV Data
    *   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the Consul KV store due to weak or misconfigured ACLs or compromised Consul agents/servers.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data such as database credentials, API keys, encryption keys, and configuration settings, leading to further compromise and data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Consul KV Store, Consul ACL System
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong ACLs to restrict access to sensitive KV paths.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest within the KV store (Consul Enterprise feature).
        *   Regularly audit access to sensitive KV paths.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to KV data.
*   **Threat:** KV Store Data Tampering
    *   **Description:** Attackers with sufficient privileges (due to compromised agents/servers or weak ACLs) modify data in the KV store.
    *   **Impact:** Application misconfiguration, introduction of malicious settings, and potential data corruption, leading to application failures and security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Consul KV Store, Consul ACL System
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong ACLs to restrict write access to critical KV paths.
        *   Implement versioning or auditing of KV store changes (Consul Enterprise feature).
        *   Regularly back up the Consul KV store.
        *   Monitor KV store modifications for unexpected changes.

#### Threats Related to Consul Service Discovery

*   **Threat:** Service Spoofing
    *   **Description:** A malicious actor registers a service with the same name as a legitimate service, potentially through a compromised agent or by exploiting weak ACLs.
    *   **Impact:** Other services may connect to the malicious service instead of the legitimate one, potentially leading to data interception, unauthorized actions, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Consul Service Catalog, Consul Agent
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
