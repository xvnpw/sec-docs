## Project Design Document: HashiCorp Consul

**1. Introduction**

This document provides a detailed design overview of HashiCorp Consul, a service networking solution to connect and secure applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure. This document will serve as the foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities.

**2. Goals**

*   Provide a comprehensive understanding of Consul's architecture and functionality.
*   Identify key components and their interactions.
*   Outline data flows within the system.
*   Highlight security-relevant aspects of the design.
*   Serve as a basis for identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities.

**3. System Overview**

Consul is a distributed, highly available, and data center-aware solution used for service discovery, configuration, and segmentation. It enables applications to easily find and securely connect with each other, regardless of where they are running. Key features include:

*   **Service Discovery:**  Applications can register their services with Consul, and other applications can query Consul to find the location of these services.
*   **Health Checking:** Consul can perform health checks on registered services to ensure they are functioning correctly.
*   **Key/Value Store:** A hierarchical key/value store for dynamic configuration, feature flagging, and coordination.
*   **Secure Service Communication:**  Consul Connect enables secure service-to-service communication using mutual TLS (mTLS).
*   **Multi-Datacenter Awareness:** Consul supports deployments across multiple data centers, providing a unified view of services.

**4. System Architecture**

Consul's architecture consists of several key components:

*   **Consul Server:**
    *   Responsible for maintaining the cluster state, including service catalog, health check information, and the key/value store.
    *   Forms a Raft consensus group for high availability and data consistency.
    *   Handles client requests and replicates data to follower servers.
    *   Typically deployed in odd numbers (e.g., 3 or 5) for fault tolerance.
*   **Consul Agent:**
    *   Runs on every node in the infrastructure.
    *   Communicates with Consul servers to register services, perform health checks, and query for service locations.
    *   Can operate in client or server mode.
    *   Client agents forward requests to server agents.
*   **Consul Client:**
    *   An agent running in client mode.
    *   Lightweight and primarily responsible for forwarding requests to Consul servers.
    *   Does not participate in the Raft consensus protocol.
*   **Consul Connect:**
    *   Provides secure service-to-service communication using mTLS.
    *   Relies on Envoy proxy (or a compatible proxy) to manage connections and enforce policies.
    *   Certificates are managed and distributed by Consul's built-in Certificate Authority (CA).

**5. Data Flow**

Here are some key data flow scenarios within Consul:

*   **Service Registration:**
    *   An application (via a Consul client agent) sends a registration request to a Consul server.
    *   The Consul server validates the request and adds the service information to the service catalog.
    *   This information is replicated to other Consul servers via the Raft protocol.
*   **Service Discovery:**
    *   An application (via a Consul client agent) sends a query to a Consul server for the location of a specific service.
    *   The Consul server retrieves the information from the service catalog.
    *   The server returns the addresses of healthy instances of the requested service.
*   **Health Check:**
    *   Consul agents periodically perform health checks on locally registered services.
    *   The agent reports the health status to a Consul server.
    *   The server updates the service catalog with the latest health information.
*   **Key/Value Store Operation:**
    *   A client agent sends a request (read or write) to a Consul server for a specific key.
    *   For write operations, the server proposes the change through the Raft protocol.
    *   Once a quorum is reached, the change is committed and replicated.
    *   For read operations, the server retrieves the value from its local store.
*   **Consul Connect Connection Establishment:**
    *   Service A attempts to connect to Service B.
    *   The Envoy proxy for Service A requests a TLS certificate from the local Consul agent.
    *   The Consul agent requests a signed certificate from the Consul server's CA.
    *   The Consul server issues a certificate.
    *   The Envoy proxy for Service B also obtains a certificate in a similar manner.
    *   The Envoy proxies establish a mutually authenticated TLS connection.

**6. Deployment Architecture**

Consul can be deployed in various configurations, including:

*   **Single Datacenter:**
    *   A cluster of Consul servers within a single data center.
    *   Consul agents run on all nodes.
    *   Suitable for smaller environments or when multi-datacenter support is not required.
*   **Multi-Datacenter:**
    *   Multiple Consul clusters, one per data center.
    *   Servers in different data centers communicate via server-to-server WAN gossip.
    *   Provides fault tolerance and allows services in different data centers to discover each other.
*   **Hybrid Cloud:**
    *   Consul clusters spanning on-premises and cloud environments.
    *   Requires careful network configuration for inter-cluster communication.

**7. Security Considerations**

Security is a critical aspect of Consul's design. Key security features and considerations include:

*   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**
    *   Control access to Consul data and APIs.
    *   Policies can be defined to restrict which agents and services can read or write specific data.
    *   Token-based authentication is used to enforce ACLs.
*   **Secure Agent Communication (gRPC with TLS):**
    *   Communication between Consul agents and servers is secured using gRPC with TLS encryption.
    *   Mutual TLS can be enabled for enhanced security.
*   **Secure Server Communication (Raft with TLS):**
    *   Communication between Consul servers within a cluster is secured using TLS encryption.
*   **Consul Connect (Mutual TLS):**
    *   Provides strong authentication and encryption for service-to-service communication.
    *   Leverages Consul's built-in Certificate Authority.
*   **Encryption at Rest (Enterprise Feature):**
    *   Consul Enterprise offers the ability to encrypt sensitive data stored on disk.
*   **Audit Logging:**
    *   Consul can be configured to log API requests and other significant events for auditing purposes.
*   **Security Hardening:**
    *   Following best practices for securing the underlying operating system and network infrastructure is crucial.
    *   Regularly patching Consul and its dependencies is essential.
*   **Certificate Management:**
    *   Proper management and rotation of TLS certificates are vital for maintaining security.

**8. Threat Model Focus Areas**

This design document highlights several areas that will be crucial for threat modeling:

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**  How are agents and services authenticated? How are access control policies enforced?
*   **Data Confidentiality and Integrity:** How is sensitive data protected in transit and at rest?
*   **Availability:** What are the potential points of failure that could impact Consul's availability?
*   **Network Security:** How is network traffic to and from Consul secured?
*   **Certificate Management:** What are the risks associated with certificate compromise or misconfiguration?
*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** What are the potential risks associated with vulnerabilities in Consul's dependencies (e.g., Envoy)?
*   **API Security:** How are Consul's APIs protected against unauthorized access and abuse?

**9. Future Considerations**

*   Integration with other HashiCorp tools (e.g., Vault, Nomad).
*   Evolution of Consul Connect features and capabilities.
*   Scalability and performance optimizations for large-scale deployments.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of HashiCorp Consul's design, laying the groundwork for a thorough threat modeling exercise. The identified components, data flows, and security considerations will be instrumental in identifying potential vulnerabilities and developing appropriate mitigation strategies.
