# Attack Surface Analysis for hashicorp/consul

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Consul Agent API](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_consul_agent_api.md)

*   **Description:** The HTTP or gRPC API of a Consul agent is exposed without proper authentication and authorization.
*   **How Consul Contributes:** Consul agents provide APIs for service registration, health checks, KV store access, and more. Without security, these become attack vectors.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers an open port on a server running a Consul agent and uses the API to deregister a critical service, causing an outage.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, data manipulation, information disclosure, potential for lateral movement within the infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable Consul ACLs and implement a principle of least privilege for agent API access.
    *   Use secure tokens and ensure proper token management.
    *   Restrict network access to the agent API using firewalls or network segmentation.
    *   Disable the agent API if it's not required for the application's functionality.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Consul Server API](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_consul_server_api.md)

*   **Description:** The HTTP or gRPC API of a Consul server is exposed without proper authentication and authorization.
*   **How Consul Contributes:** Consul servers manage the cluster state, ACLs, and other critical configurations. Unsecured access allows for cluster-wide manipulation.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to an unsecured Consul server API and modifies ACL rules to grant themselves administrative privileges.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Consul cluster, potential for widespread service disruption, data loss, and security breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable Consul ACLs and enforce strict access control policies for server APIs.
    *   Use strong, rotated tokens for server API authentication.
    *   Restrict network access to Consul server APIs to authorized administrators only.
    *   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure communication between clients and servers.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Consul Gossip Protocol](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_consul_gossip_protocol.md)

*   **Description:** The UDP and TCP ports used for Consul's gossip protocol are exposed to untrusted networks.
*   **How Consul Contributes:** The gossip protocol is used for node discovery and health state propagation. Exposure allows for potential manipulation of cluster membership.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network segment as Consul servers injects malicious gossip messages, causing nodes to become unstable or leave the cluster.
*   **Impact:** Cluster instability, potential for denial-of-service, and in some scenarios, the ability to influence service discovery.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict network access to Consul gossip ports to only trusted Consul nodes within the cluster.
    *   Enable gossip encryption to prevent eavesdropping and tampering with gossip messages.
    *   Consider using network segmentation to isolate the Consul cluster.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Data in Consul Key-Value Store](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_data_in_consul_key-value_store.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is stored in the Consul KV store without proper encryption or with weak access controls.
*   **How Consul Contributes:** Consul provides a distributed KV store for configuration and other data. If not secured, it becomes a target for information theft.
*   **Example:** Database credentials or API keys are stored in plain text in the Consul KV store, and an attacker with read access to the KV store can retrieve them.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potentially leading to further compromise of other systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing highly sensitive data directly in the Consul KV store if possible.
    *   Enable encryption for the Consul KV store (data at rest encryption).
    *   Implement granular ACLs on KV store paths to restrict access based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   Consider using a dedicated secrets management solution integrated with Consul Connect for more sensitive credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitable Service Discovery Mechanisms](./attack_surfaces/exploitable_service_discovery_mechanisms.md)

*   **Description:**  The application relies on Consul's service discovery, and vulnerabilities exist in how service registrations are handled or how DNS queries are resolved.
*   **How Consul Contributes:** Consul's service catalog and DNS interface are crucial for service discovery. Flaws here can lead to misdirection or denial of service.
*   **Example:** An attacker with access to the agent API registers a malicious service with the same name as a legitimate service, causing the application to connect to the attacker's endpoint.
*   **Impact:** Redirection of traffic to malicious services, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict ACLs on service registration to prevent unauthorized registration of services.
    *   Utilize Consul Connect with intentions to enforce secure service-to-service communication based on identity.
    *   Ensure the application validates the identity of services it connects to, even when using service discovery.
    *   Secure the network infrastructure to prevent DNS spoofing attacks if relying on Consul's DNS interface.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Consul Connect Service Identities](./attack_surfaces/compromised_consul_connect_service_identities.md)

*   **Description:**  The private keys or certificates used for service identities in Consul Connect are compromised.
*   **How Consul Contributes:** Consul Connect relies on cryptographic identities for secure service communication. If these are compromised, trust is broken.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the private key of a service's certificate and uses it to impersonate that service, intercepting communication with other services.
*   **Impact:** Ability to impersonate services, intercept and manipulate traffic, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or performing unauthorized actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely store and manage private keys and certificates used for Consul Connect identities.
    *   Implement key rotation policies and regularly rotate service certificates.
    *   Utilize hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure enclaves for key management.
    *   Monitor for suspicious certificate usage or unauthorized connections.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Consul Client Libraries](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_consul_client_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses outdated or vulnerable versions of Consul client libraries.
*   **How Consul Contributes:** Client libraries provide the interface for applications to interact with Consul. Vulnerabilities here can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability in an older version of the Consul client library allows an attacker to craft a malicious API request that could crash the agent or server.
*   **Impact:** Application instability, potential for remote code execution on systems running the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Consul client libraries up-to-date with the latest stable versions.
    *   Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in Consul client libraries.
    *   Implement dependency scanning tools to identify and manage vulnerable dependencies.
