## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Consul](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_consul.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is the ultimate goal and represents the successful exploitation of one or more vulnerabilities within the Consul deployment to compromise the application.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the application, including access to sensitive data, control over functionality, and potential for further lateral movement.

**Mitigation:** Implement a defense-in-depth strategy addressing all potential attack vectors outlined in the tree.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Service Discovery Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_service_discovery_weaknesses.md)

**Attack Vector:** Targeting the core functionality of Consul's service discovery mechanism.

**Impact:** Can lead to the application connecting to malicious services, data leaks, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Mitigation:** Implement strong ACLs, validate service data, and potentially use secure communication channels for service-to-service interaction.

## Attack Tree Path: [Register Malicious Service](./attack_tree_paths/register_malicious_service.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages the ability to register new services with the Consul catalog. If ACLs are not properly configured or enforced, the attacker can register a service with a name or endpoint that is trusted by the target application.

**Impact:** The application, relying on Consul for service discovery, may inadvertently connect to the malicious service, potentially sending sensitive data or executing malicious code.

**Mitigation:** Implement strict validation of service names and metadata retrieved from Consul. Utilize service tags for filtering and verification. Enforce strong ACLs to restrict service registration to authorized entities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Hijack Existing Service Registration](./attack_tree_paths/hijack_existing_service_registration.md)

**Attack Vector:** Specifically targeting the modification of existing service registrations in the Consul catalog.

**Impact:** Allows attackers to redirect traffic intended for legitimate services to malicious endpoints.

**Mitigation:** Enforce strict ACLs on service registration and implement monitoring for unauthorized changes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insufficient ACLs (Service Registration)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insufficient_acls__service_registration_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Due to overly permissive or default ACL configurations, an attacker gains write access to the service registration endpoints in Consul.

**Impact:** This allows the attacker to modify existing service registrations, potentially redirecting traffic intended for legitimate services to attacker-controlled endpoints.

**Mitigation:** Implement fine-grained ACLs that restrict service registration updates to specific services or identities. Regularly review and audit ACL configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Management Weaknesses (KV Store)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_management_weaknesses__kv_store_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Targeting the Consul KV store, which holds critical application configuration.

**Impact:** Can lead to the modification of application behavior, exposure of sensitive data, and service disruption.

**Mitigation:** Implement strong ACLs, validate configuration data, and potentially encrypt sensitive values within the KV store.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Write Access to KV Store](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_write_access_to_kv_store.md)

**Attack Vector:** A prerequisite for many configuration-based attacks, achieved by exploiting weak ACLs or vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Enables the injection of malicious configurations.

**Mitigation:** Focus on strong ACL enforcement and regular auditing of permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insufficient ACLs (KV Store Write Access)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insufficient_acls__kv_store_write_access_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Similar to service registration, weak ACLs on the Consul KV store allow an attacker to gain write access to configuration keys.

**Impact:** The attacker can modify critical application configurations, such as database credentials, API endpoints, or feature flags, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or unauthorized access.

**Mitigation:** Implement strict ACLs on the KV store, limiting write access to only authorized applications or services. Employ the principle of least privilege.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_configuration.md)

**Attack Vector:** Having gained write access to the KV store (often via exploiting insufficient ACLs), the attacker modifies configuration values.

**Impact:** This can directly alter the application's behavior, potentially redirecting it to malicious resources, exposing sensitive data, or enabling malicious functionalities.

**Mitigation:** Implement robust validation and sanitization of configuration values retrieved from Consul. Use secure storage mechanisms for highly sensitive credentials. Consider using Consul's prepared queries for controlled data access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Consul API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_consul_api_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in the Consul API endpoints.

**Impact:** Can allow attackers to perform various unauthorized actions depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Mitigation:** Keep Consul updated, disable unnecessary API endpoints, and enforce authentication and authorization for API access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Consul Agent Security](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_consul_agent_security.md)

**Attack Vector:** Targeting the security of individual Consul agents.

**Impact:** Can lead to the theft of agent tokens and the ability to perform actions with the agent's privileges.

**Mitigation:** Secure agent hosts, protect agent tokens, and implement regular token rotation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal Consul Agent Tokens](./attack_tree_paths/steal_consul_agent_tokens.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises a host running a Consul agent and gains access to the agent's local token. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting host vulnerabilities, accessing insecurely stored tokens, or social engineering.

**Impact:** With a stolen agent token, the attacker can impersonate the legitimate agent, gaining the permissions associated with that agent, which might include the ability to register services, modify configurations, or query sensitive data.

**Mitigation:** Securely store and manage Consul agent tokens. Use secrets management solutions. Implement proper file system permissions on token files. Regularly rotate agent tokens.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Communication Channel Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_communication_channel_weaknesses.md)

**Attack Vector:** Targeting the communication channels between Consul components.

**Impact:** Can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception, and manipulation of Consul data.

**Mitigation:** Enforce TLS encryption for all Consul communication and use strong TLS configurations.
