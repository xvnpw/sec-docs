# Threat Model Analysis for hashicorp/consul

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Consul HTTP API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_consul_http_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Consul HTTP API, potentially by exploiting weak or default credentials, or by bypassing network security controls. This allows them to view sensitive service information, modify configurations, or even disrupt services.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive service metadata, potential for service outages due to configuration changes, ability to register malicious services or deregister legitimate ones.
*   **Affected Consul Component:** Consul HTTP API
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable and enforce ACLs (Access Control Lists) in Consul.
    *   Use strong, unique tokens for accessing the Consul API.
    *   Secure the network where Consul is running to prevent unauthorized access.
    *   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for API communication.
    *   Regularly rotate API access tokens.

## Threat: [Token Compromise and Impersonation](./threats/token_compromise_and_impersonation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains a valid Consul token (e.g., through phishing, insecure storage, or network interception). They can then use this token to impersonate legitimate services or users, performing actions they are authorized for, but shouldn't be doing in this context.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized modification of services, potential data breaches by accessing services they shouldn't, disruption of service communication.
*   **Affected Consul Component:** Consul Agent, Consul HTTP API, ACL System
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store Consul tokens securely (e.g., using a secrets management system like HashiCorp Vault).
    *   Rotate Consul tokens regularly.
    *   Use short-lived tokens where appropriate.
    *   Encrypt token storage and transmission.
    *   Implement mechanisms to detect and revoke compromised tokens.

## Threat: [Key/Value Store Manipulation](./threats/keyvalue_store_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges gains access to the Consul key/value store and modifies critical application configurations, feature flags, or other sensitive data. This can lead to unexpected application behavior, security vulnerabilities, or data breaches.
*   **Impact:** Application malfunction, enabling of malicious features, exposure of sensitive information if stored unencrypted in the KV store.
*   **Affected Consul Component:** Consul Key/Value Store, Consul HTTP API
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use ACLs to restrict access to specific key prefixes in the key/value store.
    *   Implement audit logging for key/value store modifications.
    *   Consider using Consul's prepared queries to abstract access to the key/value store.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data before storing it in the key/value store.

## Threat: [Service Impersonation via Unsecured Registration](./threats/service_impersonation_via_unsecured_registration.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious actor deploys a rogue service that registers itself with Consul under the identity of a legitimate service. This can trick other services into communicating with the malicious service, potentially leading to data interception or manipulation.
*   **Impact:**  Data breaches, man-in-the-middle attacks, denial of service if the malicious service is unavailable or faulty.
*   **Affected Consul Component:** Consul Agent, Service Catalog
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce service identity verification using Consul's Connect feature with mutual TLS (mTLS).
    *   Utilize Consul's intention system to control service-to-service communication.
    *   Implement robust health checks to detect and remove misbehaving services.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) on Consul Servers](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__on_consul_servers.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the Consul servers with requests, overwhelming their resources and causing them to become unavailable. This disrupts service discovery, configuration management, and other critical Consul functions.
*   **Impact:**  Application outages, inability for services to communicate, loss of dynamic configuration updates.
*   **Affected Consul Component:** Consul Server
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on Consul API endpoints.
    *   Secure the network infrastructure to prevent network-level DoS attacks.
    *   Monitor Consul server resource usage and performance.
    *   Deploy Consul in a highly available configuration with multiple server nodes.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Consul Communication Channels](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_consul_communication_channels.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between Consul components (e.g., between agents and servers, or between clients and the API) if encryption is not properly configured. This allows them to eavesdrop on sensitive information or potentially modify data in transit.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data (tokens, service information), potential for data manipulation and system compromise.
*   **Affected Consul Component:** Consul Agent, Consul Server, Consul HTTP API
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS encryption for all Consul communication using the `encrypt` and `verify_incoming`/`verify_outgoing` configurations.
    *   Use TLS certificates signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
    *   Enforce HTTPS for accessing the Consul UI and API.

## Threat: [Consul Agent Compromise](./threats/consul_agent_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a Consul agent running on an application node. This could be achieved through vulnerabilities in the agent itself, the underlying operating system, or other software running on the same node. A compromised agent can be used to exfiltrate data, manipulate service registrations, or launch attacks on other services.
*   **Impact:**  Data breaches, service disruption, lateral movement within the infrastructure.
*   **Affected Consul Component:** Consul Agent
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Harden the operating systems where Consul agents are running.
    *   Keep Consul agents and the underlying OS updated with the latest security patches.
    *   Limit the privileges of the Consul agent process.
    *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems on the nodes running Consul agents.
