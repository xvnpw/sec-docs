# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for hashicorp/consul

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Consul ACLs](./mitigation_strategies/implement_consul_acls.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Consul Access Control Lists (ACLs)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable ACLs in Consul:** Set `acl.enabled = true` in the Consul server configuration file. Restart Consul servers for this change to take effect.
    2.  **Bootstrap ACL System:** Execute `consul acl bootstrap` on a Consul server. This command initializes the ACL system and generates the initial management token. Securely store this bootstrap token.
    3.  **Define Consul ACL Policies:** Create ACL policies using HCL or JSON. These policies specify granular permissions for Consul resources like services, KV store paths, nodes, and more. Example policy definition:
        ```hcl
        service "webapp" {
          policy = "write"
        }
        kv_prefix "config/webapp/" {
          policy = "read"
        }
        ```
    4.  **Create and Manage Consul ACL Tokens:** Generate ACL tokens and associate them with defined policies. Distribute these tokens to applications and users based on their required level of access to Consul. Example token creation using the CLI:
        ```bash
        consul acl token create -policy-name=webapp-policy -description="Token for Web Application"
        ```
    5.  **Enforce ACL Token Usage:** Configure Consul clients and applications to utilize ACL tokens when interacting with the Consul API. This can be done by setting `acl.tokens.default` or `acl.tokens.agent` in agent configuration files, or by passing tokens via HTTP headers in API requests.
    6.  **Regularly Audit and Review Consul ACLs:** Periodically review and audit defined ACL policies and token assignments to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege and remain aligned with current security requirements.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Consul Resources (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized entities from accessing and manipulating sensitive data within Consul, such as service configurations, KV store values, and node information.

    *   **Unnoticed Consul Failures or Degradation:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Delayed Response to Incidents:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Performance Bottlenecks and Capacity Issues:** Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic monitoring of Consul server and agent metrics is in place using a centralized monitoring system.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive monitoring dashboards specifically tailored for Consul are needed. Alerting rules for critical Consul health and performance indicators need to be enhanced and refined. Regular review and analysis of Consul monitoring data should be formalized.
