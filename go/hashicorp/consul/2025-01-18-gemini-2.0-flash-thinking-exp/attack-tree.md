## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Consul Resources](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_consul_resources.md)

*   Attack Vectors: Exploiting API vulnerabilities, compromising Consul agents, exploiting weak ACLs.
*   Impact:  Provides the attacker with the ability to read and modify Consul data and configurations, leading to further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Consul API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_consul_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Attack Vectors: Targeting unauthenticated API endpoints (if misconfigured).
*   Impact: Direct access to sensitive data and the ability to modify Consul configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthenticated API Access (If Misconfigured)](./attack_tree_paths/unauthenticated_api_access__if_misconfigured_.md)

*   Attack Vectors: Targeting unauthenticated API endpoints (if misconfigured).
*   Impact: Direct access to sensitive data and the ability to modify Consul configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise a Consul Agent](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_a_consul_agent.md)

*   Attack Vectors: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the agent process or co-located applications, obtaining the gossip key.
*   Impact: Allows the attacker to directly interact with the Consul cluster, potentially injecting gossip messages, accessing local resources, and pivoting to other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain Agent's Gossip Key](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_agent's_gossip_key.md)

*   Attack Vectors: Stealing the key from the agent's filesystem or memory.
*   Impact: Allows the attacker to eavesdrop on gossip traffic and potentially inject malicious messages, disrupting cluster consensus.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak or Default Consul ACLs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_or_default_consul_acls.md)

*   Attack Vectors: Guessing or brute-forcing tokens, leveraging misconfigured rules, exploiting token leakage.
*   Impact: Grants unauthorized access to Consul resources, allowing the attacker to manipulate data and disrupt services based on the acquired privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigured ACL Rules](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigured_acl_rules.md)

*   Attack Vectors: Identifying and leveraging overly permissive ACL rules.
*   Impact: Gaining unauthorized access to specific Consul resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Token Leakage](./attack_tree_paths/token_leakage.md)

*   Attack Vectors: Finding tokens stored insecurely in configuration files, environment variables, or logs.
*   Impact: Obtaining valid credentials to access Consul resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Consul Data](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_consul_data.md)

*   Attack Vectors: Exploiting weak ACLs to modify the service catalog or key-value store.
*   Impact: Directly affects the application's behavior and data integrity. Modifying the service catalog can misdirect traffic, while altering the key-value store can change configurations or inject malicious data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Service Catalog](./attack_tree_paths/modify_service_catalog.md)

*   Attack Vectors: Exploiting weak ACLs for service registration.
*   Impact: Misdirecting application traffic to attacker-controlled endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [Register Malicious Service Instances](./attack_tree_paths/register_malicious_service_instances.md)

*   Attack Vectors: Exploiting weak ACLs for service registration.
*   Impact: Misdirecting application traffic to attacker-controlled endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deregister Legitimate Service Instances](./attack_tree_paths/deregister_legitimate_service_instances.md)

*   Attack Vectors: Exploiting weak ACLs for service deregistration.
*   Impact: Causing denial of service by removing valid service endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Key-Value Store Data](./attack_tree_paths/modify_key-value_store_data.md)

*   Attack Vectors: Exploiting weak ACLs for the key-value store.
*   Impact: Changing application behavior, potentially introducing vulnerabilities or causing malfunctions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Alter Application Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/alter_application_configuration.md)

*   Attack Vectors: Exploiting weak ACLs for the key-value store.
*   Impact: Changing application behavior, potentially introducing vulnerabilities or causing malfunctions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data.md)

*   Attack Vectors: Exploiting weak ACLs for the key-value store.
*   Impact: Injecting data that can trigger vulnerabilities in the application's processing logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Consul Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_consul_functionality.md)

*   Attack Vectors: Launching DoS attacks by overwhelming servers or exploiting resource exhaustion vulnerabilities.
*   Impact: Makes Consul unavailable, disrupting service discovery, configuration management, and other critical functions, leading to application outages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__attacks.md)

*   Attack Vectors: Sending a large volume of API requests or gossip messages.
*   Impact: Causing denial of service by making Consul unavailable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwhelm Consul Servers with Requests](./attack_tree_paths/overwhelm_consul_servers_with_requests.md)

*   Attack Vectors: Sending a large volume of API requests or gossip messages.
*   Impact: Causing denial of service by making Consul unavailable.
