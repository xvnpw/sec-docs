# Threat Model Analysis for hashicorp/consul

## Threat: [Malicious Service Registration](./threats/malicious_service_registration.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Service Registration

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a node running a Consul agent and registers a malicious service with the same name as a legitimate service. Clients querying Consul for the legitimate service will be directed to the attacker's service.
*   **Impact:** Clients may connect to the malicious service, leading to data theft, data manipulation, or denial of service. Sensitive information intended for the legitimate service could be intercepted.
*   **Affected Consul Component:** Consul Agent, Service Catalog
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control which agents can register services.
    *   Secure the infrastructure where Consul agents are running to prevent compromise.
    *   Implement service identity verification at the application level to ensure clients are connecting to the expected service.
    *   Regularly audit registered services for unexpected or suspicious entries.

## Threat: [Key-Value Store Tampering](./threats/key-value_store_tampering.md)

**Threat:** Key-Value Store Tampering

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the Consul Key-Value store and modifies configuration data, feature flags, or other sensitive information. This could be achieved by compromising a Consul agent or server with sufficient privileges or exploiting ACL misconfigurations.
*   **Impact:** Application behavior can be altered unexpectedly, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities, data corruption, or service disruption. Sensitive information could be modified or deleted.
*   **Affected Consul Component:** Consul Key-Value Store, ACL System
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict ACLs to control access to specific keys and prefixes in the Key-Value store.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting Key-Value store access.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data stored in the Key-Value store at rest and in transit.
    *   Regularly audit Key-Value store access and modifications.

## Threat: [Secret Extraction from Key-Value Store](./threats/secret_extraction_from_key-value_store.md)

**Threat:** Secret Extraction from Key-Value Store

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized read access to the Consul Key-Value store and extracts sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, or other secrets. This could be due to compromised agents or servers, or overly permissive ACLs.
*   **Impact:** Compromised secrets can lead to unauthorized access to other systems and resources, data breaches, and further attacks.
*   **Affected Consul Component:** Consul Key-Value Store, ACL System
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict ACLs to control read access to sensitive keys in the Key-Value store.
    *   Consider using Consul's built-in secrets management features or integrating with dedicated secrets management solutions like HashiCorp Vault.
    *   Encrypt secrets stored in the Key-Value store at rest and in transit.
    *   Regularly rotate secrets.

## Threat: [Consul Agent Impersonation](./threats/consul_agent_impersonation.md)

**Threat:** Consul Agent Impersonation

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains the necessary credentials (e.g., certificates, tokens) to impersonate a legitimate Consul agent. This allows them to perform actions as that agent, such as registering services or updating health checks.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can manipulate service discovery and health checking, potentially leading to clients connecting to malicious services or disrupting service availability.
*   **Affected Consul Component:** Consul Agent, Agent Authentication
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the storage and distribution of Consul agent credentials.
    *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for Consul agents.
    *   Regularly rotate agent credentials.
    *   Monitor agent activity for suspicious behavior.

## Threat: [Consul Server Compromise](./threats/consul_server_compromise.md)

**Threat:** Consul Server Compromise

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a Consul server node. This could grant them significant control over the Consul cluster, depending on the level of access gained.
*   **Impact:** Cluster-wide disruption, data loss or corruption in the Key-Value store, manipulation of ACLs, and potential compromise of the entire infrastructure relying on Consul. If the compromised server is a leader, the impact is even greater.
*   **Affected Consul Component:** Consul Server, Raft Consensus Protocol, ACL System
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Harden Consul server nodes and the underlying infrastructure.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to Consul servers.
    *   Regularly patch and update Consul server software.
    *   Monitor Consul server logs and metrics for suspicious activity.
    *   Implement network segmentation to isolate Consul servers.

## Threat: [ACL Bypass or Manipulation via Server Compromise](./threats/acl_bypass_or_manipulation_via_server_compromise.md)

**Threat:** ACL Bypass or Manipulation via Server Compromise

*   **Description:** An attacker who has compromised a Consul server could potentially bypass or manipulate the Access Control Lists (ACLs), granting themselves or other entities unauthorized access to services and data.
*   **Impact:** Breach of confidentiality and integrity, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive resources and the ability to disrupt services.
*   **Affected Consul Component:** Consul Server, ACL System
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Consul server nodes with strong security measures.
    *   Regularly audit ACL configurations for correctness and adherence to the principle of least privilege.
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for changes to ACL configurations.

## Threat: [Lack of Encryption in Transit](./threats/lack_of_encryption_in_transit.md)

**Threat:** Lack of Encryption in Transit

*   **Description:** Communication between Consul agents and servers, or between Consul servers themselves (gossip protocol), is not properly encrypted using TLS. This allows attackers to eavesdrop on network traffic.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information such as service names, health check data, Key-Value store data, and potentially authentication tokens.
*   **Affected Consul Component:** Consul Agent, Consul Server, Gossip Protocol, RPC Communication
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS encryption for all Consul communication (agent-server and server-server).
    *   Ensure proper certificate management and rotation.
    *   Enable gossip encryption.

## Threat: [Exposed Consul UI or API](./threats/exposed_consul_ui_or_api.md)

**Threat:** Exposed Consul UI or API

*   **Description:** The Consul UI or API is exposed to the internet or an untrusted network without proper authentication and authorization.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information about the Consul cluster, registered services, health check statuses, and the Key-Value store. They might also be able to manipulate the cluster if write access is not properly secured.
*   **Affected Consul Component:** Consul UI, Consul API, HTTP Interface
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict access to the Consul UI and API to trusted networks only.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the UI and API.
    *   Disable the UI and API if they are not required.
