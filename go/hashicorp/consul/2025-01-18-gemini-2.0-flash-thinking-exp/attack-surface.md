# Attack Surface Analysis for hashicorp/consul

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Consul Agent API](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_consul_agent_api.md)

*   **Description:** The Consul Agent exposes an HTTP/HTTPS API for local interaction. If not properly secured, this API can be accessed by unauthorized entities.
    *   **How Consul Contributes:** Consul requires agents to communicate with servers and register services, making the Agent API a necessary component.
    *   **Example:** A malicious process running on the same host as a Consul Agent could use the API to deregister critical services, causing an outage.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, information disclosure (service metadata, health check status), potential for arbitrary command execution if health checks use scripts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and enforce Consul ACLs to restrict access to the Agent API.
        *   Use HTTPS for the Agent API and ensure proper certificate management.
        *   Configure the Agent API to listen only on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1) if external access is not required.
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms if external access is necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Consul Server API](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_consul_server_api.md)

*   **Description:** The Consul Server exposes an HTTP/HTTPS API for cluster-wide management and data access. Lack of proper security can lead to significant compromise.
    *   **How Consul Contributes:** The Server API is essential for managing the Consul cluster, including ACLs, service definitions, and the Key/Value store.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gaining access to the Server API could modify ACL rules to grant themselves full control over the Consul cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Full cluster compromise, data breaches (Key/Value store), service disruption, ability to manipulate the entire service mesh.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and strictly enforce Consul ACLs with the principle of least privilege.
        *   Use HTTPS for the Server API and ensure proper certificate management.
        *   Restrict network access to the Server API to only authorized clients and networks.
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for all Server API interactions.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Consul Connect Certificate Management](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_consul_connect_certificate_management.md)

*   **Description:** Consul Connect relies on certificates for secure service-to-service communication. Weak or compromised certificates can be exploited.
    *   **How Consul Contributes:** Consul Connect's service mesh functionality inherently introduces certificate management as a critical security component.
    *   **Example:** If the root Certificate Authority (CA) used by Consul Connect is compromised, an attacker could generate valid certificates for any service and impersonate them.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks between services, unauthorized access to sensitive data exchanged between services, potential for service impersonation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely manage the root CA used by Consul Connect.
        *   Implement proper certificate rotation policies.
        *   Enforce strong key lengths and signing algorithms for certificates.
        *   Regularly audit certificate issuance and revocation processes.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Missing Consul ACL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_missing_consul_acl_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Consul's Access Control Lists (ACLs) are crucial for securing access to its features and data. Weak or missing ACLs leave Consul vulnerable.
    *   **How Consul Contributes:** Consul provides the ACL system as a security mechanism, but its effectiveness depends on proper configuration.
    *   **Example:** Without ACLs enabled, any client could register or deregister services, modify the Key/Value store, or access sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to all Consul functionalities, data breaches, service disruption, full cluster compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable Consul ACLs in "bootstrapped" mode.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege when defining ACL rules.
        *   Regularly review and audit ACL configurations.
        *   Use tokens with appropriate permissions for different applications and users.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Consul Key/Value Store](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_consul_keyvalue_store.md)

*   **Description:** The Consul Key/Value store can be used to store configuration data, secrets, and other sensitive information. If not properly secured, this data can be exposed.
    *   **How Consul Contributes:** Consul provides the Key/Value store as a core feature, making it a potential target for attackers seeking sensitive data.
    *   **Example:** Developers might inadvertently store database credentials or API keys directly in the Key/Value store without encryption.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to critical systems and resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive data directly in the Key/Value store if possible.
        *   If sensitive data must be stored, encrypt it at rest and in transit.
        *   Use Consul ACLs to restrict access to sensitive Key/Value paths.
        *   Consider using dedicated secrets management solutions integrated with Consul (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
