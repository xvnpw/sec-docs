# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mozilla/sops

## Mitigation Strategy: [Employ Granular `sops` Policies](./mitigation_strategies/employ_granular__sops__policies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Design `sops` policies that adhere to the principle of least privilege.
    2.  Define policies that grant access only to the specific secrets and environments that users or services require, using `path_regex` or similar features.
    3.  Avoid using wildcard characters or overly broad rules in `sops` policies that grant excessive access.
    4.  Organize secrets into logical groups or namespaces and create policies that control access at this granular level.
    5.  Regularly review and refine `sops` policies to ensure they remain aligned with current access requirements and security best practices.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Secrets (Medium Severity): Overly permissive policies can grant unintended access to sensitive secrets.
    *   Lateral Movement (Low Severity):  Restricting access to only necessary secrets can limit the impact of a compromised account or service by preventing lateral movement to other sensitive data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Secrets: Medium Reduction - Granular policies significantly reduce the risk of unintended access by enforcing stricter access control within `sops`.
    *   Lateral Movement: Low Reduction - Contributes to a defense-in-depth strategy by limiting potential damage from compromised accounts through `sops` policy enforcement.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `sops` policies are in place, but some policies are still too broad and need further refinement for granularity.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Review and refactor existing `sops` policies to achieve finer-grained access control. Implement automated policy validation to ensure policies adhere to least privilege principles within `sops` configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Review and Audit `sops` Policies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_review_and_audit__sops__policies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a schedule for regular reviews of `sops` policies (e.g., quarterly, bi-annually).
    2.  During policy reviews, verify that `sops` policies are still aligned with current access requirements and security best practices.
    3.  Audit logs related to `sops` policy changes and access attempts to identify any anomalies or unauthorized modifications within `sops` policy management.
    4.  Involve security personnel in the `sops` policy review process to ensure security considerations are adequately addressed in `sops` configurations.
    5.  Document the `sops` policy review process and maintain records of policy reviews and any changes made to `sops` policies.
    6.  Use policy-as-code principles and version control for `sops` policies to track changes and facilitate audits of `sops` policy history.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Policy Drift and Stale Policies (Low Severity): `sops` policies can become outdated or misconfigured over time, leading to unintended access or security gaps within `sops` managed secrets.
    *   Unauthorized Policy Modifications (Low Severity):  Malicious or accidental changes to `sops` policies could weaken security of secrets managed by `sops`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Policy Drift and Stale Policies: Low Reduction - Regular reviews help maintain `sops` policy relevance and prevent security gaps from emerging over time in `sops` secret management.
    *   Unauthorized Policy Modifications: Low Reduction - Auditing and reviews can detect unauthorized changes to `sops` policies, allowing for timely remediation within `sops` configuration.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.  `sops` policies are version controlled, but regular scheduled reviews are not consistently performed. Audit logging is basic for `sops` policy changes.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establish a formal schedule for `sops` policy reviews. Implement more comprehensive audit logging specifically for `sops` policy changes and access attempts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Version Control `sops` Policies](./mitigation_strategies/version_control__sops__policies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Treat `sops` policies as code and store them in a version control system (e.g., Git).
    2.  Use branches and pull requests for managing changes to `sops` policies.
    3.  Implement code review processes for all `sops` policy changes to ensure they are properly vetted and secure.
    4.  Track the history of `sops` policy changes in version control for auditing and rollback purposes.
    5.  Use tags or releases to version `sops` policies for different environments or application versions.
    6.  Automate the deployment of `sops` policies from version control to the relevant systems that use `sops`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Accidental Policy Changes (Low Severity): Version control provides a history and rollback mechanism for accidental or incorrect `sops` policy modifications.
    *   Lack of Audit Trail for Policy Changes (Low Severity): Version control provides a clear audit trail of who changed what and when in `sops` policies.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Accidental Policy Changes: Low Reduction -  Provides a safety net for accidental errors in `sops` policy management and allows for quick recovery.
    *   Lack of Audit Trail for Policy Changes: Low Reduction - Improves accountability and auditability of `sops` policy management.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented. `sops` policies are stored in Git and use pull requests for changes.

*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Version control for `sops` policies is already in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep `sops` Tool Up-to-Date](./mitigation_strategies/keep__sops__tool_up-to-date.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a process for monitoring `sops` releases and security advisories.
    2.  Subscribe to `sops` release notifications or use automated tools to track new `sops` versions.
    3.  Regularly update the `sops` tool to the latest stable version across all environments where it is used (developer workstations, CI/CD agents, servers).
    4.  Test new `sops` versions in a non-production environment before deploying them to production.
    5.  Document the `sops` update process and schedule.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known `sops` Vulnerabilities (High Severity): Outdated `sops` versions may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit when interacting with `sops`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known `sops` Vulnerabilities: High Reduction -  Ensures that known vulnerabilities in `sops` are patched, reducing the attack surface of the `sops` tool itself.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `sops` updates are performed manually and less frequently than ideal. Monitoring for new releases is not automated.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated monitoring for `sops` releases and security advisories.  Establish a more frequent and automated `sops` update process across all environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify `sops` Tool Integrity](./mitigation_strategies/verify__sops__tool_integrity.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When downloading or installing `sops`, always obtain it from the official source (e.g., GitHub releases page, official package repositories).
    2.  Verify the integrity of the downloaded `sops` binary using checksums or signatures provided by the official source.
    3.  Automate the integrity verification process as part of the `sops` installation or update process.
    4.  Use package managers or trusted distribution channels to minimize the risk of downloading compromised versions of `sops`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Supply Chain Attacks - Compromised `sops` Tool (High Severity): If a compromised version of `sops` is used, it could contain backdoors or malware that could compromise secrets or systems through malicious `sops` operations.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Supply Chain Attacks - Compromised `sops` Tool: High Reduction -  Significantly reduces the risk of using a tampered `sops` tool by verifying its integrity, ensuring the tool itself is not a vulnerability.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.  Manual verification of checksums is sometimes performed, but not consistently or automated for `sops` installations.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated integrity verification as part of the `sops` installation and update process.
