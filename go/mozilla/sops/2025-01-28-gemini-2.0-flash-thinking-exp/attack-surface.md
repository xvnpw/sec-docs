# Attack Surface Analysis for mozilla/sops

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured SOPS Encryption Rules](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_sops_encryption_rules.md)

Description: Incorrect or overly permissive rules in `.sops.yaml` can lead to unintended exposure of sensitive data or grant excessive decryption permissions.
SOPS Contribution: SOPS relies on `.sops.yaml` for defining encryption rules. Misconfiguration directly dictates how secrets are protected and accessed by SOPS.
Example: A `.sops.yaml` file accidentally allows decryption by a broad IAM role or user group that should not have access to certain secrets, leading to unauthorized access to production database credentials.
Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential data breaches, privilege escalation, compromise of confidential information.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Carefully define rules in `.sops.yaml` to grant decryption access only to the absolutely necessary roles or users.
*   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review `.sops.yaml` configurations to ensure rules remain appropriate and secure as roles and responsibilities evolve.
*   **Testing in Non-Production:** Thoroughly test rule configurations in a non-production environment to validate intended access control before deploying to production.
*   **Code Review for `.sops.yaml`:** Mandate code reviews for all changes to `.sops.yaml` files to catch potential misconfigurations early in the development lifecycle.
*   **Static Analysis Tools:** Implement and utilize static analysis tools that can automatically scan `.sops.yaml` files for potential security issues and misconfigurations based on defined security policies.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised KMS Credentials](./attack_surfaces/compromised_kms_credentials.md)

Description: If credentials used by SOPS to access the KMS provider (AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault, etc.) are compromised, attackers can decrypt all secrets managed by SOPS using that KMS.
SOPS Contribution: SOPS directly integrates with KMS providers using provided credentials. The security of these credentials is fundamental to SOPS's ability to protect secrets.
Example: AWS IAM role credentials used by SOPS, stored as environment variables on a server, are exposed due to a server-side vulnerability. An attacker gains access to these credentials and uses them to decrypt all secrets encrypted with the associated KMS key, including API keys and database passwords.
Impact: Complete compromise of all secrets managed by SOPS, large-scale data breaches, significant security incident with potentially widespread impact across systems relying on these secrets.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Secure Credential Management:** Employ robust and secure methods for managing KMS credentials. Avoid storing them directly in code or easily accessible configuration files. Utilize secure secret management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) to manage and inject KMS credentials at runtime.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege (KMS Permissions):** Grant SOPS and the application runtime environment only the absolute minimum KMS permissions required for decryption (typically `kms:Decrypt` and potentially `kms:DescribeKey`). Restrict permissions from actions like key creation, deletion, or modification.
*   **Credential Rotation and Short-Lived Credentials:** Implement regular rotation of KMS credentials to limit the window of opportunity if credentials are compromised. Explore using short-lived credentials where possible.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting on KMS Access:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting on KMS access logs. Detect and alert on suspicious activity, such as unusual access patterns, failed decryption attempts from unexpected sources, or unauthorized KMS API calls.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure and Secure Deployment:** Deploy applications in immutable infrastructure to minimize the attack surface and reduce the risk of credential compromise on running instances. Use secure deployment pipelines to inject credentials securely without exposing them in build artifacts or logs.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in SOPS Binary or Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_sops_binary_or_dependencies.md)

Description: Security vulnerabilities discovered in the SOPS binary itself or its underlying dependencies could be exploited by attackers to bypass encryption, decrypt secrets without authorization, or cause denial-of-service.
SOPS Contribution: SOPS is a software application with its own codebase and dependencies. Like any software, it is susceptible to vulnerabilities that can be introduced in its code or in the libraries it relies upon.
Example: A critical vulnerability is discovered in a YAML parsing library used by SOPS, allowing for arbitrary code execution when processing a maliciously crafted `.sops.yaml` file or encrypted data. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain control of the system running SOPS or to directly decrypt secrets.
Impact: Potential bypass of SOPS encryption, unauthorized decryption of secrets, denial of service affecting secret decryption processes, arbitrary code execution on systems running SOPS, leading to full system compromise.
Risk Severity: High to Critical (depending on the nature and exploitability of the vulnerability)
Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Maintain Up-to-Date SOPS Version:**  Establish a process for regularly updating SOPS to the latest stable version. This ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched promptly. Subscribe to security advisories and release notes for SOPS to stay informed about updates.
*   **Dependency Scanning and Management:** Implement dependency scanning tools to continuously monitor SOPS's dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Use dependency management tools to ensure dependencies are kept up-to-date and patched.
*   **Vulnerability Monitoring and Alerting:** Subscribe to security vulnerability databases and advisories relevant to SOPS and its dependencies. Set up alerts to be notified immediately of newly discovered vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure Software Supply Chain Practices:** Obtain SOPS binaries from trusted and official sources (official GitHub releases, verified package repositories). Verify checksums of downloaded binaries to ensure integrity and prevent tampering.
*   **Consider Static and Dynamic Analysis:** For highly security-sensitive environments, consider performing or commissioning static and dynamic security analysis of the SOPS codebase to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities beyond those publicly known.
