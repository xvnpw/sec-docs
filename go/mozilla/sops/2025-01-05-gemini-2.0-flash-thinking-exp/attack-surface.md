# Attack Surface Analysis for mozilla/sops

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Master Keys](./attack_surfaces/compromised_master_keys.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Compromised Master Keys
    *   **Description:** The master keys used by SOPS (e.g., AWS KMS keys, GCP KMS keys, PGP private keys) are compromised, allowing attackers to decrypt all secrets encrypted with those keys.
    *   **How SOPS Contributes to the Attack Surface:** SOPS relies on these master keys for its core encryption functionality. The security of the secrets is directly tied to the security of these keys.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the AWS account where the KMS key used by SOPS is stored, allowing them to decrypt all application secrets. Alternatively, a developer's laptop containing the PGP private key is stolen.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of all secrets managed by SOPS, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and significant operational disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize strong access control mechanisms for key providers (IAM roles, GCP IAM).
        *   Enable multi-factor authentication for accessing key provider accounts.
        *   Implement robust key rotation policies.
        *   For PGP keys, store private keys securely using strong passphrases and consider hardware security modules.
        *   Monitor key usage and access logs for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured `.sops.yaml`](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured___sops_yaml_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Misconfigured `.sops.yaml`
    *   **Description:** The `.sops.yaml` configuration file is incorrectly configured, leading to secrets not being encrypted, being encrypted with weak settings, or being accessible to unintended entities.
    *   **How SOPS Contributes to the Attack Surface:** SOPS relies on this configuration file to determine which keys to use for encryption and who has decryption access. Misconfiguration directly weakens the security provided by SOPS.
    *   **Example:** A developer accidentally configures `.sops.yaml` to not encrypt a sensitive environment variable or grants decryption access to a broad group of users or roles that shouldn't have it.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive secrets, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement infrastructure-as-code for `.sops.yaml` to ensure consistency and review.
        *   Use a linting tool to validate the `.sops.yaml` configuration.
        *   Enforce code reviews for changes to `.sops.yaml`.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting decryption access.
        *   Regularly audit the `.sops.yaml` configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in SOPS Binary](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_sops_binary.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in SOPS Binary
    *   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities are discovered in the SOPS binary itself, which could be exploited to bypass encryption, leak secrets, or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **How SOPS Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The application's security relies on the integrity and security of the SOPS binary used for encryption and decryption.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability is found in SOPS that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running SOPS, potentially exposing decrypted secrets in memory.
    *   **Impact:** Potential compromise of secrets, denial of service, or even complete system compromise depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the SOPS binary updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to SOPS.
        *   Consider using checksum verification for the SOPS binary to ensure its integrity.
        *   Run SOPS in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.
