## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Gain access to KMS key via compromised role/user

This analysis focuses on the attack tree path "Gain access to KMS key via compromised role/user" within the context of an application utilizing `sops` for secret management. We will break down the attack, its implications, and potential mitigation strategies.

**Understanding the Context:**

`sops` (Secrets OPerationS) is a popular tool for encrypting secrets within configuration files. It supports various encryption providers, including AWS KMS (Key Management Service). When using KMS, `sops` encrypts secrets using a KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK). Access to this CMK is controlled by IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

**Attack Path:** Gain access to KMS key via compromised role/user

**Description:** An attacker successfully compromises an AWS IAM role or user that has permissions to interact with the KMS key used by `sops`. This compromised identity can then be used to decrypt secrets managed by `sops`.

**Stages of the Attack:**

1. **Initial Compromise:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to an AWS IAM role or user. This can happen through various means:
    * **Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force:** Guessing or obtaining valid usernames and passwords.
    * **Phishing:** Tricking users into revealing their credentials.
    * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:**  Compromising systems where credentials are stored or used.
    * **Insider Threat:** Malicious actions by an authorized individual.
    * **Leaked Credentials:**  Credentials inadvertently exposed in code repositories, logs, or other public locations.
    * **Compromised Developer Workstation:** Gaining access to developer machines where AWS credentials might be configured.

2. **Leveraging Compromised Identity:** Once the attacker has control of the IAM role or user, they can assume its permissions within the AWS environment.

3. **Accessing the KMS Key:** The compromised role/user, if misconfigured, might have permissions to perform actions on the KMS key used by `sops`. Crucially, the attacker needs the `kms:Decrypt` permission to decrypt the secrets. Other potentially dangerous permissions include:
    * `kms:Encrypt`: Allows encrypting new secrets, potentially replacing legitimate ones.
    * `kms:GenerateDataKey`: Allows generating new data keys for encryption.
    * `kms:DescribeKey`: Provides information about the key, which can be useful for further attacks.
    * `kms:GetKeyPolicy`: Allows viewing the key's access policy.
    * `kms:PutKeyPolicy`: Allows modifying the key's access policy, granting themselves persistent access.
    * `kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion`:  Allows deleting the key, rendering all encrypted secrets unusable.

4. **Decrypting Secrets:** With access to the KMS key and the `kms:Decrypt` permission, the attacker can use the AWS SDK or CLI to decrypt the secrets managed by `sops`. They would typically need access to the encrypted `sops` files (e.g., in a Git repository, configuration management system, or deployed application).

5. **Exploiting Decrypted Secrets:**  The attacker now has access to sensitive information, which could include:
    * Database credentials
    * API keys
    * Private keys
    * Application secrets
    * Other sensitive configuration data

**Analysis of Attributes:**

* **Likelihood: Medium (Common misconfiguration):**  IAM misconfigurations are unfortunately common. Overly permissive roles, lack of the principle of least privilege, and poor credential management contribute to this. The ease with which an attacker can leverage a compromised identity once obtained makes this path reasonably likely.
* **Impact: Critical (Full key access):**  Gaining access to the KMS key used by `sops` has a critical impact. It allows decryption of all secrets protected by that key, potentially compromising the entire application and its associated data. This can lead to data breaches, service disruption, and significant financial and reputational damage.
* **Effort: Low to Medium (Depending on initial access):** The effort depends heavily on the initial compromise.
    * **Low Effort:** If credentials are leaked or easily guessed, the initial access is trivial.
    * **Medium Effort:**  If the attacker needs to exploit a vulnerability or conduct a more sophisticated phishing attack, the effort increases. Once the initial compromise is achieved, leveraging the compromised identity within AWS is relatively straightforward using standard AWS tools.
* **Skill Level: Low to Medium (Understanding IAM/Policies):**  The initial compromise might require varying skill levels. However, exploiting a compromised identity to access KMS keys requires a basic understanding of AWS IAM roles, policies, and the permissions required to interact with KMS. While advanced knowledge isn't strictly necessary, a good grasp of IAM principles is beneficial.
* **Detection Difficulty: Medium (Can be logged, but requires monitoring):** AWS CloudTrail logs API calls, including those related to IAM and KMS. Therefore, actions like assuming roles, decrypting data, and modifying KMS policies are logged. However, detecting malicious activity requires proactive monitoring and analysis of these logs. Without proper alerting and correlation, these actions can easily go unnoticed amidst legitimate activity.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To defend against this attack path, a multi-layered approach is crucial:

**1. Secure IAM Configuration:**

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to IAM roles and users. Avoid overly broad permissions like `kms:*`.
* **Granular KMS Policies:**  Restrict access to the `sops` KMS key to only the roles and users that absolutely need it for encryption or decryption. Specify the resources (e.g., specific ARNs of roles or users) in the KMS key policy.
* **Regularly Review IAM Policies:**  Conduct periodic audits of IAM policies to identify and rectify any overly permissive configurations.
* **Use IAM Roles for EC2 Instances/Lambda Functions:** Avoid embedding long-term credentials directly in code or instance configurations.
* **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all IAM users, especially those with administrative privileges.
* **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong, unique passwords and encourage regular password changes.

**2. Secure Credential Management:**

* **Avoid Storing Credentials in Code:** Never hardcode AWS credentials in application code or configuration files.
* **Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store:** For applications that need to access secrets programmatically, use dedicated secret management services.
* **Rotate Credentials Regularly:** Implement a process for regularly rotating IAM user access keys and other credentials.
* **Secure Developer Workstations:** Implement security measures on developer machines to prevent credential theft (e.g., endpoint security, software updates).

**3. Logging and Monitoring:**

* **Enable AWS CloudTrail:** Ensure CloudTrail is enabled and configured to log all API activity in your AWS account.
* **Monitor CloudTrail Logs:** Implement automated monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity, such as:
    * Unauthorized attempts to assume roles.
    * KMS `Decrypt` calls from unexpected identities or locations.
    * Modifications to KMS key policies.
    * Creation or deletion of IAM users or roles.
* **Utilize Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:** Integrate CloudTrail logs with a SIEM system for centralized analysis and correlation of security events.
* **Set up Alarms for KMS Key Usage:** Configure alarms based on CloudTrail events to notify security teams of unusual KMS key activity.

**4. Network Security:**

* **Restrict Network Access:** Implement network security measures (e.g., Security Groups, Network ACLs) to limit access to resources that interact with KMS.
* **Use VPC Endpoints for KMS:**  Route traffic to KMS through VPC endpoints to keep it within the AWS network.

**5. `sops` Specific Best Practices:**

* **Regularly Rotate KMS Keys:** While more complex, periodically rotating the KMS key used by `sops` can limit the impact of a compromise.
* **Consider Alternative Encryption Providers:** While KMS is robust, explore other encryption providers supported by `sops` if they better suit your security needs.

**Impact on the Development Team:**

The development team plays a crucial role in preventing and mitigating this attack path. They need to:

* **Understand IAM Best Practices:** Developers should be educated on secure IAM configurations and the principle of least privilege.
* **Follow Secure Coding Practices:** Avoid storing credentials in code and utilize secure secret management solutions.
* **Integrate Security into the Development Lifecycle:** Security considerations should be incorporated from the design phase onwards.
* **Participate in Security Reviews:**  Actively participate in code reviews and security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Respond to Security Incidents:** Be prepared to respond quickly and effectively to security incidents.

**Conclusion:**

Gaining access to the KMS key via a compromised role/user is a significant threat to applications using `sops` with KMS. The potential impact is critical, allowing attackers to decrypt all protected secrets. While the effort and skill level can vary, the likelihood is medium due to common IAM misconfigurations. A robust security strategy involving secure IAM configuration, strong credential management, comprehensive logging and monitoring, and developer awareness is essential to mitigate this risk effectively. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this type of attack.
