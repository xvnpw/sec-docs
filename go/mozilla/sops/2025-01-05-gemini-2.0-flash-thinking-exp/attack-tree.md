## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via SOPS Exploitation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_sops_exploitation__critical_.md)

**Compromise Application via SOPS Exploitation [CRITICAL]:**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access to the application's sensitive data or functionality through exploiting SOPS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Decryption Key [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_decryption_key__critical_.md)

**Compromise Decryption Key [CRITICAL]:**
    * Achieving this allows the attacker to decrypt any secrets managed by SOPS, leading to a complete compromise of sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit KMS Vulnerability/Misconfiguration (AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault, etc.) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_kms_vulnerabilitymisconfiguration__aws_kms__gcp_kms__azure_key_vault__etc____critical_.md)

**Exploit KMS Vulnerability/Misconfiguration (AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault, etc.) [CRITICAL]:**
    * This involves targeting the Key Management Service used by SOPS. Successful exploitation grants access to the encryption/decryption keys.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit IAM/Policy Misconfiguration [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_iampolicy_misconfiguration__critical_.md)

**Exploit IAM/Policy Misconfiguration [CRITICAL]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain access to KMS key via compromised role/user](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_kms_key_via_compromised_roleuser.md)

**Gain access to KMS key via compromised role/user:**
                * Likelihood: Medium (Common misconfiguration)
                * Impact: Critical (Full key access)
                * Effort: Low to Medium (Depending on initial access)
                * Skill Level: Low to Medium (Understanding IAM/Policies)
                * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Can be logged, but requires monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit HashiCorp Vault Vulnerability/Misconfiguration [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_hashicorp_vault_vulnerabilitymisconfiguration__critical_.md)

**Exploit HashiCorp Vault Vulnerability/Misconfiguration [CRITICAL]:**
    * This involves targeting HashiCorp Vault if it's used to store SOPS encryption keys.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vault Policy Misconfiguration [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vault_policy_misconfiguration__critical_.md)

**Exploit Vault Policy Misconfiguration [CRITICAL]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain unauthorized access to the secrets engine](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_the_secrets_engine.md)

**Gain unauthorized access to the secrets engine:**
                * Likelihood: Medium (Common misconfiguration)
                * Impact: Critical (Access to secrets)
                * Effort: Low to Medium (Understanding Vault policies)
                * Skill Level: Low to Medium (Vault policy knowledge)
                * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Requires monitoring policy changes)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit PGP Key Management Weakness [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pgp_key_management_weakness__critical_.md)

**Exploit PGP Key Management Weakness [CRITICAL]:**
    * This involves targeting the PGP key management practices if SOPS is configured to use PGP.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Private Key Storage [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_private_key_storage__critical_.md)

**Compromise Private Key Storage [CRITICAL]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Access insecurely stored private key file [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/access_insecurely_stored_private_key_file__critical_.md)

**Access insecurely stored private key file [CRITICAL]:**
                * Likelihood: Medium (If not properly secured)
                * Impact: Critical (Full decryption capability)
                * Effort: Low (If permissions are weak)
                * Skill Level: Low (Basic file system access)
                * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Depends on file access auditing)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Local Key File Vulnerability [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_local_key_file_vulnerability__critical_.md)

**Exploit Local Key File Vulnerability [CRITICAL]:**
    * This involves targeting locally stored key files used by SOPS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Insecurely Stored Key File [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/access_insecurely_stored_key_file__critical_.md)

**Access Insecurely Stored Key File [CRITICAL]:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Read key file due to incorrect permissions](./attack_tree_paths/read_key_file_due_to_incorrect_permissions.md)

**Read key file due to incorrect permissions:**
                * Likelihood: Medium (Common misconfiguration)
                * Impact: Critical (Full decryption capability)
                * Effort: Low (Basic file system access)
                * Skill Level: Low (Basic file system knowledge)
                * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Depends on file access auditing)
