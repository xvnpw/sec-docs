# Threat Model Analysis for mozilla/sops

## Threat: [Weak Encryption Algorithm Usage](./threats/weak_encryption_algorithm_usage.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit weaknesses in the configured encryption algorithm (e.g., older versions of AES-CBC without proper padding) to perform cryptanalysis and decrypt secrets. This might involve capturing encrypted secrets and applying known attack techniques against the weak algorithm.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, including credentials, API keys, and other confidential information managed by SOPS. This can lead to unauthorized access to systems, data breaches, and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** `Encryption/Decryption Module`, specifically the configuration settings for the encryption algorithm.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Configure SOPS to use strong, modern, and well-vetted encryption algorithms like AES-GCM.
- Regularly review and update the configured encryption algorithms based on current security best practices.
- Avoid using deprecated or known-to-be-weak algorithms.

## Threat: [Compromised Key Management System (KMS)](./threats/compromised_key_management_system__kms_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the Key Management System (e.g., AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, HashiCorp Vault) used by SOPS to store and manage encryption keys. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the KMS itself, compromising KMS credentials, or through insider threats. Once compromised, the attacker can retrieve the master keys.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of all secrets encrypted by SOPS using the compromised KMS. The attacker can decrypt all protected data, potentially leading to widespread data breaches, system compromise, and significant financial and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** `Key Provider Integration` (e.g., AWS KMS integration, GCP KMS integration, etc.).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement strong access controls (IAM roles, policies) for the KMS, enforcing the principle of least privilege.
- Enable multi-factor authentication for KMS access.
- Regularly rotate KMS keys.
- Monitor KMS access logs for suspicious activity.
- Secure the infrastructure hosting the KMS.

## Threat: [Loss of Encryption Keys](./threats/loss_of_encryption_keys.md)

**Description:** Encryption keys used by SOPS could be accidentally deleted, become corrupted, or be lost due to operational errors or disasters affecting the KMS.

**Impact:** Permanent loss of access to all secrets encrypted with the lost keys. This can lead to application unavailability, data loss, and the need to re-encrypt all secrets with new keys, which can be a complex and time-consuming process.

**Affected Component:** `Key Provider Integration`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement robust backup and recovery procedures for encryption keys within the KMS.
- Utilize KMS features for key replication and disaster recovery.
- Securely store backup keys offline in a protected location.
- Regularly test the key recovery process.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Decryption Keys via SOPS Policies](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_decryption_keys_via_sops_policies.md)

**Description:** SOPS policies might be misconfigured, granting decryption access to users, roles, or services that should not have it. An attacker could leverage compromised credentials of an overly privileged entity to decrypt secrets.

**Impact:** Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data managed by SOPS. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to systems, and other security incidents.

**Affected Component:** `Policy Engine` and `Configuration Loading`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement the principle of least privilege when defining SOPS policies.
- Grant decryption access only to the specific users, roles, or services that absolutely require it.
- Regularly review and audit SOPS policies.
- Use specific user or role identifiers instead of wildcard access where possible.

## Threat: [Accidental Committing of Decrypted Secrets](./threats/accidental_committing_of_decrypted_secrets.md)

**Description:** Developers might mistakenly commit files containing decrypted secrets to version control systems or other insecure locations.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data to anyone with access to the version control history or the insecure location. This can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access.

**Affected Component:** N/A (This is primarily a user error directly related to how SOPS is used in a development workflow).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement pre-commit hooks or other automated checks to prevent the committing of files containing decrypted secrets.
- Educate developers on secure secrets management practices and the risks of committing decrypted secrets.
- Utilize `.gitignore` or similar mechanisms to exclude sensitive files.
- Regularly scan repositories for accidentally committed secrets.
