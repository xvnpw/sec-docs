## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.4 GCP/AWS/Azure IAM Role Compromise

This section breaks down each attack vector under the "IAM Role Compromise" node, providing a detailed analysis and mitigation recommendations.

### 4.1 Compromised Credentials

*   **Description:**  An attacker obtains valid access keys, session tokens, or other credentials associated with an IAM role that has KMS access.

*   **Detailed Attack Scenarios:**
    *   **Phishing:**  An attacker sends a targeted email to a developer or administrator, tricking them into revealing their cloud credentials.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:**  An attacker uses credentials leaked from other breaches to try and gain access to cloud accounts.
    *   **Malware:**  An attacker infects a developer's workstation with malware that steals stored credentials or intercepts them during login.
    *   **Accidental Exposure:**  Credentials are accidentally committed to a public code repository (e.g., GitHub) or exposed in logs.
    *   **Third-Party Breach:**  A third-party service with access to the cloud environment is compromised, and the attacker leverages this access.

*   **Vulnerability Analysis:**
    *   **Weak Passwords:**  Users with weak or easily guessable passwords are more vulnerable to credential stuffing and brute-force attacks.
    *   **Lack of MFA:**  Absence of multi-factor authentication makes it easier for attackers to use stolen credentials.
    *   **Poor Credential Hygiene:**  Reusing passwords across multiple accounts, storing credentials in insecure locations (e.g., plain text files), and not rotating credentials regularly.
    *   **Inadequate Monitoring:**  Lack of monitoring for suspicious login attempts or credential misuse.

*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Confidentiality:**  High.  The attacker gains access to the KMS key, allowing them to decrypt all secrets managed by SOPS.
    *   **Integrity:**  High.  The attacker could potentially modify encrypted secrets or inject malicious data.
    *   **Availability:**  Medium.  The attacker could potentially disrupt services by deleting or corrupting secrets, but the primary impact is on confidentiality and integrity.

*   **Mitigation Recommendations:**

    *   **Preventative:**
        *   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for all cloud accounts.
        *   **Mandatory MFA:**  Require multi-factor authentication for all users and roles, especially those with KMS access.
        *   **Credential Rotation:**  Implement automated credential rotation for service accounts and IAM roles.  Use short-lived credentials whenever possible.
        *   **Secure Credential Storage:**  Use a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and manage credentials securely.  Never store credentials in code or configuration files.
        *   **Security Awareness Training:**  Educate users about phishing, social engineering, and credential security best practices.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to IAM roles.

    *   **Detective:**
        *   **CloudTrail/Cloud Logging:**  Enable detailed logging of all API calls and user activity.
        *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual login patterns, access attempts, or API calls.
        *   **Threat Intelligence:**  Utilize threat intelligence feeds to identify and block known malicious IP addresses and domains.

    *   **Responsive:**
        *   **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop and regularly test an incident response plan that includes procedures for handling compromised credentials.
        *   **Credential Revocation:**  Immediately revoke compromised credentials and rotate keys.
        *   **Forensic Analysis:**  Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the scope of the compromise and identify any affected data.

### 4.2 Misconfigured IAM Policies

*   **Description:**  The IAM role has overly permissive policies, granting it more access than necessary.  This could include access to KMS keys it shouldn't have, or overly broad permissions within KMS (e.g., `kms:*` instead of `kms:Decrypt`).

*   **Detailed Attack Scenarios:**
    *   **Default Policies:**  Using default, overly permissive policies without tailoring them to specific needs.
    *   **Copy-Paste Errors:**  Copying policies from other roles or online examples without understanding their implications.
    *   **Lack of Review:**  Not regularly reviewing and auditing IAM policies for excessive permissions.
    *   **"Just-in-Case" Permissions:**  Granting permissions that *might* be needed in the future, rather than adhering to the principle of least privilege.

*   **Vulnerability Analysis:**
    *   **Overly Broad Actions:**  Using wildcards (`*`) in policy actions, granting access to all resources or actions within a service.
    *   **Missing Resource Constraints:**  Not specifying specific resources (e.g., specific KMS key ARNs) that the role can access.
    *   **Lack of Condition Constraints:**  Not using IAM conditions to further restrict access based on factors like source IP address, time of day, or MFA status.
    *   **No Policy Validation:**  Not using tools to validate IAM policies for potential security issues.

*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Confidentiality:**  High.  Overly permissive policies can grant an attacker access to KMS keys and decrypt secrets.
    *   **Integrity:**  High.  The attacker could modify or delete KMS keys or encrypted secrets.
    *   **Availability:**  Medium.  Similar to compromised credentials, the primary impact is on confidentiality and integrity.

*   **Mitigation Recommendations:**

    *   **Preventative:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to each IAM role.  Use specific actions and resource constraints.
        *   **Regular Policy Reviews:**  Conduct regular audits of IAM policies to identify and remediate overly permissive configurations.
        *   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**  Use IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) to manage IAM policies in a consistent and auditable way.
        *   **Policy Validation Tools:**  Use tools like AWS IAM Access Analyzer, GCP Policy Troubleshooter, or Azure Policy to identify potential security issues in IAM policies.
        *   **Custom Policies:** Avoid using managed policies, create custom policies.

    *   **Detective:**
        *   **CloudTrail/Cloud Logging:**  Monitor for policy changes and unusual access patterns.
        *   **IAM Access Analyzer:**  Use IAM Access Analyzer (or equivalent tools in GCP and Azure) to continuously monitor for unintended public or cross-account access.

    *   **Responsive:**
        *   **Policy Rollback:**  Quickly revert to a known-good policy configuration if a misconfiguration is detected.
        *   **Incident Response Plan:**  Include procedures for handling IAM policy misconfigurations in the incident response plan.

### 4.3 Instance Metadata Exploitation

*   **Description:**  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in an application running on a cloud instance (e.g., EC2 instance, Compute Engine VM, Azure VM) to steal temporary credentials associated with the instance's IAM role.  This often involves exploiting Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities.

*   **Detailed Attack Scenarios:**
    *   **SSRF Vulnerability:**  An attacker crafts a malicious request to a vulnerable application that causes it to make a request to the instance metadata service (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`).
    *   **Unvalidated User Input:**  The application fails to properly validate or sanitize user input, allowing the attacker to inject malicious URLs or parameters.
    *   **Misconfigured Proxies:**  Misconfigured proxies or web servers can inadvertently expose the instance metadata service.

*   **Vulnerability Analysis:**
    *   **SSRF Vulnerabilities:**  The presence of SSRF vulnerabilities in applications running on cloud instances.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:**  Insufficient input validation and sanitization in applications.
    *   **Outdated Software:**  Running outdated or unpatched software with known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Weak Application Security:**  General lack of secure coding practices and security testing.

*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Confidentiality:**  High.  The attacker can obtain temporary credentials for the instance's IAM role, potentially granting access to KMS keys and secrets.
    *   **Integrity:**  High.  The attacker could modify or delete secrets.
    *   **Availability:**  Medium.

*   **Mitigation Recommendations:**

    *   **Preventative:**
        *   **SSRF Prevention:**  Implement robust SSRF defenses, including:
            *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user input, especially URLs and parameters.
            *   **Allowlisting:**  Use an allowlist of permitted URLs or IP addresses that the application can access.
            *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate applications and services to limit the impact of SSRF vulnerabilities.
            *   **IMDSv2 (AWS):**  Use Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2) on AWS, which requires session-oriented requests and mitigates some SSRF attacks.  Similar features exist in GCP and Azure.
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding guidelines and conduct regular security testing (SAST, DAST, penetration testing).
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regularly scan applications and infrastructure for vulnerabilities.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Deploy a WAF to protect against common web attacks, including SSRF.

    *   **Detective:**
        *   **Application Logs:**  Monitor application logs for suspicious requests or errors related to SSRF.
        *   **Network Monitoring:**  Monitor network traffic for unusual connections to the instance metadata service.

    *   **Responsive:**
        *   **Patching:**  Immediately patch any identified SSRF vulnerabilities.
        *   **Incident Response:**  Include procedures for handling instance metadata exploitation in the incident response plan.

### 4.4 Cross-Account Access Misconfiguration

*   **Description:**  The IAM role has trust relationships with other accounts, and misconfigurations in these trust relationships allow attackers to assume the role from a compromised account.

*   **Detailed Attack Scenarios:**
    *   **Overly Permissive Trust Policies:**  The trust policy allows any user or role from another account to assume the role, without proper restrictions.
    *   **Compromised Account in Trusted Account:**  An attacker compromises an account in a trusted account and then uses that access to assume the role in the target account.
    *   **Misconfigured External IDs:**  If external IDs are used to restrict access, they are not properly configured or enforced.

*   **Vulnerability Analysis:**
    *   **Broad `Principal` Statements:**  Using wildcards or overly broad principals in the trust policy's `Principal` element.
    *   **Missing `Condition` Constraints:**  Not using conditions to restrict access based on factors like source account, external ID, or MFA status.
    *   **Lack of Monitoring:**  Not monitoring for cross-account access attempts.

*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Confidentiality:**  High.  The attacker can gain access to KMS keys and decrypt secrets.
    *   **Integrity:**  High.
    *   **Availability:**  Medium.

*   **Mitigation Recommendations:**

    *   **Preventative:**
        *   **Restrictive Trust Policies:**  Use specific principals (e.g., specific IAM users or roles) in the trust policy's `Principal` element.  Avoid wildcards.
        *   **External IDs:**  Use external IDs to ensure that only authorized entities can assume the role, even if they have the correct credentials.
        *   **IAM Conditions:**  Use IAM conditions to further restrict access based on factors like source account, MFA status, and other attributes.
        *   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly review and audit trust relationships to ensure they are configured correctly.

    *   **Detective:**
        *   **CloudTrail/Cloud Logging:**  Monitor for cross-account access attempts and role assumptions.
        *   **IAM Access Analyzer:**  Use IAM Access Analyzer (or equivalent tools) to identify unintended cross-account access.

    *   **Responsive:**
        *   **Revoke Trust:**  Immediately revoke trust relationships if a compromise is detected.
        *   **Incident Response:**  Include procedures for handling cross-account access compromises in the incident response plan.

## 5. Prioritization
