## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Encryption/Decryption Keys](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_encryptiondecryption_keys.md)

*   **1.1 KMS Key Compromise [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** Gaining unauthorized access to the master key used within a cloud provider's Key Management Service (AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault).
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Cloud Provider Vulnerability:** Exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the KMS itself (extremely rare).
        *   **Insider Threat:** A malicious or compromised employee with access to the KMS.
        *   **Compromised Cloud Credentials:** Obtaining access keys or other credentials that grant access to the KMS. This could be through phishing, malware, or credential stuffing attacks.
        *   **Misconfigured KMS Permissions:** Overly permissive KMS policies that allow unauthorized users or services to access the key.
        *   **Social Engineering:** Tricking a privileged user into revealing key information or granting access.

*   **1.2 PGP Key Compromise [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** Obtaining the private PGP key and its associated passphrase used for SOPS encryption/decryption.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Phishing:** Tricking the key holder into revealing their private key and passphrase.
        *   **Malware:** Keyloggers or other malware that steal the key and passphrase from the user's system.
        *   **Physical Theft:** Stealing the device (laptop, USB drive, etc.) where the key is stored.
        *   **Compromised Key Server:** If the key is stored on a compromised key server, the attacker could gain access.
        *   **Weak Passphrase:** Brute-forcing or guessing a weak passphrase used to protect the private key.
        *   **Social Engineering:** Tricking user to share key or passphrase.

*   **1.3 Age Key Compromise [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** Obtaining the private Age key used for SOPS encryption/decryption.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Phishing:** Tricking the key holder into revealing their private key.
        *   **Malware:** Keyloggers or other malware that steal the key from the user's system.
        *   **Physical Theft:** Stealing the device where the key is stored.
        *   **Compromised Storage:** If the key is stored insecurely (e.g., in a public repository), the attacker could gain access.
        *   **Social Engineering:** Tricking user to share key.

*   **1.4 GCP/AWS/Azure IAM Role Compromise [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** Gaining control of an IAM role that has permissions to access the KMS key used by SOPS.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Compromised Credentials:** Obtaining access keys or other credentials associated with the IAM role.
        *   **Misconfigured IAM Policies:** Overly permissive IAM policies that grant the role excessive permissions.
        *   **Instance Metadata Exploitation:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in applications running on cloud instances to steal temporary credentials associated with the instance's IAM role.
        *   **Cross-Account Access Misconfiguration:** If the IAM role has trust relationships with other accounts, misconfigurations could allow attackers to assume the role from a compromised account.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit SOPS Implementation Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_sops_implementation_flaws.md)

*   **2.2 Integration Flaws:**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities introduced by how the application interacts with SOPS, *not* flaws within SOPS itself.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Improper Error Handling:** Revealing decrypted secrets or key information in error messages.
        *   **Insecure API Endpoints:** Exposing decrypted secrets through API endpoints without proper authentication or authorization.
        *   **Logging Decrypted Secrets:** Accidentally logging decrypted secrets (see 3.3.2).
        *   **Insecure Storage of Decrypted Secrets:** Storing decrypted secrets in insecure locations (e.g., temporary files, environment variables).
        *   **Code Injection:** If the application is vulnerable to code injection, an attacker could inject code that interacts with SOPS to decrypt secrets.

*   **2.3 Misconfiguration:**
    *   **Description:** Incorrect SOPS configuration that weakens security.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Weak Encryption Algorithms:** Using outdated or weak encryption algorithms.
        *   **Insecure `.sops.yaml` Storage:** Storing the `.sops.yaml` file (which contains key information) in an insecure location (e.g., a public repository).
        *   **Incorrect KMS Permissions:** Misconfiguring KMS permissions, either granting too much access or not enough (preventing legitimate decryption).
        *   **Ignoring SOPS Warnings:** Ignoring warnings or errors generated by SOPS during encryption or decryption.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Circumvent SOPS (Indirect Attacks)](./attack_tree_paths/3__circumvent_sops__indirect_attacks_.md)

*   **3.2 Compromise CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   **Description:** Gaining control of the CI/CD pipeline to intercept secrets during deployment.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Compromised CI/CD Credentials:** Obtaining credentials for the CI/CD system (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI).
        *   **Malicious Code Injection:** Injecting malicious code into the build process to steal secrets.
        *   **Vulnerable Dependencies:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or tools used in the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   **Misconfigured Pipeline Settings:** Exploiting misconfigurations in the pipeline's settings (e.g., exposing environment variables).
        *   **Compromised Build Server:** Gaining access to the server where the CI/CD pipeline runs.

*   **3.3.2 Leaked Logs [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** Obtaining decrypted secrets that have been accidentally logged by the application.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Improper Logging Configuration:** Configuring the application to log sensitive data, including decrypted secrets.
        *   **Lack of Log Redaction:** Failing to redact or mask sensitive information in logs.
        *   **Compromised Log Server:** Gaining access to the server where logs are stored.
        *   **Log Injection:** If the application is vulnerable to log injection, an attacker could inject malicious data that is then logged, potentially revealing secrets.
