## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Access Control and Key Rotation for Master Keys (SOPS-Relevant Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_access_control_and_key_rotation_for_master_keys__sops-relevant_aspects_.md)

*   **1. Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Access Control and Key Rotation for Master Keys (SOPS-Relevant Aspects)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **SOPS Key Rotation (`sops --rotate`):**  After rotating the master key in the underlying KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault, etc.) or generating a new PGP key, use the `sops --rotate` command to re-encrypt all files managed by SOPS with the new key.  This is the *crucial* SOPS-specific step.  The command updates the SOPS metadata in the encrypted files to use the new key.
        2.  **Automated Rotation Script (incorporating SOPS):**  The automated key rotation script (mentioned in the previous, broader response) *must* include the `sops --rotate` command as a core part of the process.  The script should:
            *   Authenticate to the KMS (or handle PGP key access).
            *   Trigger key rotation in the KMS (or generate a new PGP key).
            *   Update the `.sops.yaml` file (if necessary) to reference the new key ID or fingerprint.
            *   Execute `sops --rotate` to re-encrypt all files.
            *   Verify successful re-encryption.
            *   Revoke the old key (in the KMS) or securely delete the old PGP private key.
        3. **Separate Keys Per Environment/Service (SOPS Usage):** When *creating* new SOPS-encrypted files, ensure you are using the correct master key for the intended environment/service. This is done by specifying the appropriate KMS key ARN or PGP key fingerprint when running `sops` (or as configured in `.sops.yaml`).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Compromise of Master Key:** (Severity: **Critical**) - `sops --rotate` ensures that even if an old key is compromised, it cannot be used to decrypt files after rotation.
        *   **Unauthorized Decryption:** (Severity: **High**) - Using separate keys per environment/service, enforced through how `sops` is invoked, limits the blast radius of a key compromise.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Compromise of Master Key:** Risk significantly reduced.  `sops --rotate` is the *direct* mitigation for this threat within the SOPS workflow.
        *   **Unauthorized Decryption:** Risk reduced.  Correct key usage during SOPS encryption operations limits access.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `sops --rotate` is used manually after key rotation in AWS KMS.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The key rotation process, including the `sops --rotate` command, is not fully automated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [`.sops.yaml` Configuration and Usage](./mitigation_strategies/__sops_yaml__configuration_and_usage.md)

*   **2. Mitigation Strategy:** `.sops.yaml` Configuration and Usage

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Precise `creation_rules`:**  The `.sops.yaml` file *directly* controls which keys can be used to encrypt and decrypt which files.  Use specific `path_regex` patterns to map files to the appropriate KMS keys or PGP key fingerprints.  Avoid overly broad wildcards. This is a *core* SOPS configuration element.
        2.  **Key Selection During Encryption:** When creating a *new* encrypted file, SOPS uses the `.sops.yaml` file to determine which key(s) to use.  If `.sops.yaml` is misconfigured, the wrong key could be used.  Therefore, careful configuration and review of `.sops.yaml` are *directly* related to SOPS's security.
        3. **Using `--ignore-mac` (Situational):** In very specific, *advanced* scenarios where you need to temporarily bypass the Message Authentication Code (MAC) check (e.g., for debugging or recovery), you can use the `--ignore-mac` flag with `sops`.  **However**, this should be used with *extreme caution* and *only* when absolutely necessary, as it disables a crucial security check.  It should *never* be used in production. This is a SOPS-specific command-line option.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Decryption (via `.sops.yaml`):** (Severity: **High**) - A misconfigured `.sops.yaml` could allow decryption with an unintended key.
        *   **Data Integrity Violation (if `--ignore-mac` is misused):** (Severity: **Critical**) - Bypassing the MAC check allows for undetected tampering with the encrypted data.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Decryption:** Risk significantly reduced.  Precise `creation_rules` in `.sops.yaml` are the *direct* control mechanism.
        *   **Data Integrity Violation:** Risk is *increased* if `--ignore-mac` is used inappropriately.  This flag should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and with full understanding of the risks.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Reasonably specific `creation_rules` are used in `.sops.yaml`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `--ignore-mac` is not explicitly prohibited in developer guidelines (though its use is not common).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Using SOPS to Decrypt Only Necessary Secrets](./mitigation_strategies/using_sops_to_decrypt_only_necessary_secrets.md)

*   **3. Mitigation Strategy:** Using SOPS to Decrypt Only Necessary Secrets

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Selective Decryption with `--extract`:** Instead of decrypting an entire file, use the `--extract` (or `-e`) option with `sops -d` to decrypt only specific keys within the file.  Example: `sops -d --extract '["key1", "key3"]' secrets.yaml`.  This minimizes the exposure of secrets in memory. This is a *core* SOPS feature.
        2.  **Avoid Creating Temporary Decrypted Files:** Whenever possible, avoid creating temporary, fully decrypted files on disk.  Use `--extract` to work with individual secrets directly in memory.  If temporary files *must* be created, ensure they are handled securely (as described in the broader list), but the *best* practice is to avoid them entirely by using SOPS's selective decryption capabilities.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Remnants in Memory:** (Severity: **Medium**) - By decrypting only necessary secrets, the amount of sensitive data in memory is minimized.
        *   **Data Remnants on Disk:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Avoiding temporary decrypted files eliminates the risk of recovering secrets from the file system.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Remnants in Memory:** Risk reduced. `--extract` is the *direct* SOPS feature that enables this mitigation.
        *   **Data Remnants on Disk:** Risk significantly reduced (or eliminated if temporary files are avoided entirely).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Applications are generally designed to use `--extract` to decrypt only necessary secrets.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Not applicable, as the strategy is generally followed.
