## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using SOPS - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data managed by the application, specifically targeting data protected by SOPS.

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   Compromise Application Secrets via SOPS
    *   Exploit SOPS Vulnerabilities ***
        *   [!] Identify and leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in SOPS
    *   Compromise Encryption Keys ***
        *   [!] Compromise Key Provider ***
            *   [!] Gain Unauthorized Access to Key Provider Credentials ***
                *   Phishing or Social Engineering
                *   Credential Stuffing or Brute-Force
                *   [!] Exploiting Misconfigurations in Key Provider Access Control
                *   Insider Threat
        *   Compromise Key Storage (for non-KMS providers like Age) ***
            *   [!] Gain Access to Private Key File ***
                *   Exploit File System Permissions
                *   Exploit Backup Vulnerabilities
                *   Social Engineering or Phishing
                *   Insider Threat
    *   Exploit Application's Integration with SOPS ***
        *   [!] Exposure of Decrypted Secrets in Memory or Logs ***
            *   Application not securely handling decrypted secrets in memory
            *   Decrypted secrets being logged inadvertently
        *   Insecure Storage of Decrypted Secrets ***
            *   Application storing decrypted secrets in insecure locations

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **High-Risk Path: Exploit SOPS Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Critical Node: Identify and leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in SOPS**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers actively monitor public vulnerability databases (like CVE) and SOPS release notes for disclosed security flaws. They then develop or find existing exploits to leverage these vulnerabilities in the target application's SOPS deployment. This could involve bypassing encryption, gaining access to decrypted data, or manipulating SOPS operations.

*   **High-Risk Path: Compromise Encryption Keys**
    *   **Critical Node: Compromise Key Provider**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker's goal is to gain control over the service responsible for managing the encryption keys used by SOPS (e.g., AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, GCP KMS). This can be achieved through various means targeting the key provider itself.
            *   **Critical Node: Gain Unauthorized Access to Key Provider Credentials**
                *   **Attack Vector: Phishing or Social Engineering:** Attackers trick legitimate users with access to the key provider into revealing their credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys).
                *   **Attack Vector: Credential Stuffing or Brute-Force:** Attackers use lists of compromised credentials or automated tools to try and guess valid credentials for the key provider.
                *   **Critical Node: Exploiting Misconfigurations in Key Provider Access Control:** Attackers identify and exploit weaknesses in the access control policies of the key provider (e.g., overly permissive IAM roles, misconfigured network access) to gain unauthorized access.
                *   **Attack Vector: Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with legitimate access to the key provider abuses their privileges to extract or compromise encryption keys.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Compromise Key Storage (for non-KMS providers like Age)**
        *   **Critical Node: Gain Access to Private Key File**
            *   **Attack Vector: Exploit File System Permissions:** Attackers exploit weak file system permissions on the server or storage location where the Age private key file is stored to gain read access.
            *   **Attack Vector: Exploit Backup Vulnerabilities:** Attackers target insecurely stored or accessed backups that contain the private key file.
            *   **Attack Vector: Social Engineering or Phishing:** Attackers trick individuals with access to the private key file into revealing its location or contents.
            *   **Attack Vector: Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with access to the private key file copies or exfiltrates it.

*   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Application's Integration with SOPS**
    *   **Critical Node: Exposure of Decrypted Secrets in Memory or Logs**
        *   **Attack Vector: Application not securely handling decrypted secrets in memory:**  The application might store decrypted secrets in memory for longer than necessary or in a way that allows other processes or attackers with memory access to read them.
        *   **Attack Vector: Decrypted secrets being logged inadvertently:**  The application's logging configuration might unintentionally include decrypted secrets in log files, making them accessible to anyone with access to the logs.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Insecure Storage of Decrypted Secrets**
        *   **Attack Vector: Application storing decrypted secrets in insecure locations:** The application might store decrypted secrets in temporary files, databases, or other storage locations without proper encryption or access controls, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access.
