# Threat Model Analysis for mozilla/sops

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in SOPS Binary](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_sops_binary.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities are discovered in the `sops` binary itself. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing specially crafted encrypted files or manipulating SOPS command-line arguments. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the system running SOPS, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure. Successful exploitation can lead to secret exfiltration, compromise of systems using SOPS for decryption, and broader security breaches.
*   **Affected SOPS Component:** SOPS Binary (core logic, parsing, cryptography modules).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on vulnerability type)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Latest SOPS Version:**  Always use the latest stable version of SOPS to benefit from the latest security patches and bug fixes. Regularly check for updates and apply them promptly.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Incorporate vulnerability scanning into your development and deployment pipelines to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in the SOPS binary and its dependencies.
    *   **Secure Download and Verification:** Download SOPS binaries only from official and trusted sources like the GitHub releases page or official package repositories. Verify the integrity of downloaded binaries using checksums or signatures provided by the SOPS developers.
    *   **Restrict SOPS Execution Environment:** Limit the privileges of the user or process running SOPS to the minimum necessary. Avoid running SOPS with root or administrator privileges if possible.
    *   **Input Validation (Limited):** While direct input validation of encrypted files might be complex, ensure that the environment where SOPS is executed is secure and that inputs are from trusted sources.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on SOPS](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_sops.md)

*   **Description:** The SOPS software supply chain is compromised. An attacker could inject malicious code into the SOPS binary or its dependencies during the build, release, or distribution process. Users who download and use the compromised SOPS binary would unknowingly be using a backdoored or malicious tool.
*   **Impact:** Installation of a compromised SOPS binary can have severe consequences, including secret exfiltration, backdoors in the application deployment pipeline, and widespread compromise of systems relying on SOPS for secret management. This could affect numerous applications and environments.
*   **Affected SOPS Component:** SOPS Distribution Channels, SOPS Binary, potentially dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Official SOPS Sources:** Download SOPS binaries exclusively from official and highly trusted sources, such as the official GitHub releases page or well-established package repositories maintained by the SOPS project or reputable organizations.
    *   **Verify Signatures and Checksums:**  Always verify the digital signatures and checksums of downloaded SOPS binaries against the official signatures and checksums provided by the SOPS developers. This ensures the integrity and authenticity of the binary.
    *   **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** If available, utilize SBOMs for SOPS to gain visibility into its dependencies and assess potential supply chain risks associated with those dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan SOPS and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools. This helps identify and mitigate risks arising from compromised or vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Secure Build Pipeline (If Building from Source):** If you choose to build SOPS from source, establish a secure and trusted build pipeline. Implement measures to prevent tampering with the source code or build process.
    *   **Network Security for Downloads:** Ensure that downloads of SOPS binaries and dependencies are performed over secure channels (HTTPS) to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks during download.

## Threat: [Misconfigured `.sops.yaml`](./threats/misconfigured___sops_yaml_.md)

*   **Description:** The `.sops.yaml` configuration file is incorrectly configured, leading to unintended or weakened security. This can manifest as: secrets not being encrypted at all, secrets being encrypted with weak or inappropriate algorithms, or overly permissive access rules that allow unauthorized decryption.
*   **Impact:** Secrets may be stored in plaintext or encrypted with insufficient security, leading to potential information disclosure and unauthorized access. Ineffective access control can allow unintended users or processes to decrypt secrets, compromising confidentiality.
*   **Affected SOPS Component:** `.sops.yaml` configuration file, SOPS encryption/decryption logic, access control mechanisms within SOPS.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Review and Testing of `.sops.yaml`:**  Implement a rigorous review process for all changes to `.sops.yaml` files. Test configurations thoroughly in non-production environments to ensure they function as intended and meet security requirements before deploying to production.
    *   **Version Control and Audit Trails for `.sops.yaml`:** Store `.sops.yaml` files in version control systems and maintain detailed audit trails of all changes. This enables tracking modifications, identifying potential misconfigurations, and facilitating rollback to previous secure configurations if needed.
    *   **Automated Configuration Validation:** Develop and implement automated validation checks for `.sops.yaml` files. These checks should verify that the configuration adheres to security best practices, uses strong encryption algorithms, and enforces the principle of least privilege in access rules.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in `.sops.yaml` Access Rules:**  Apply the principle of least privilege when defining access rules in `.sops.yaml`. Grant decryption permissions only to the specific users, roles, or services that absolutely require access to the secrets. Avoid overly broad or permissive access rules.
    *   **Use Strong and Recommended Encryption Algorithms:**  Ensure that `.sops.yaml` is configured to utilize strong and industry-recommended encryption algorithms and key lengths. Avoid using weak or outdated algorithms that could be vulnerable to attacks. Consult security best practices and SOPS documentation for recommended encryption settings.
