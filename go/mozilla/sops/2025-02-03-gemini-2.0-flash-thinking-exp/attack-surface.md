# Attack Surface Analysis for mozilla/sops

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of Encryption Keys Used by `sops` (KMS, Vault, PGP, Age)](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_encryption_keys_used_by__sops___kms__vault__pgp__age_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the encryption keys that `sops` is configured to use for protecting secrets. This directly undermines the security provided by `sops`.
*   **How `sops` Contributes:** `sops`'s security is fundamentally dependent on the secrecy and integrity of the encryption keys it utilizes. If these keys are compromised, `sops`'s encryption becomes ineffective.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises the AWS IAM role used by the application's deployment pipeline, allowing them to access AWS KMS keys configured for `sops`. They can then decrypt any secrets encrypted by `sops` using those keys.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of all secrets managed by `sops` that are encrypted with the compromised keys. This can lead to a critical data breach, unauthorized system access, and complete loss of confidentiality.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users:**
        *   **Implement Strongest Possible Access Control:**  Enforce the principle of least privilege for access to KMS, Vault, PGP private keys, and Age private keys.  Restrict access to only absolutely necessary identities (users, services).
        *   **Mandatory Key Rotation:** Implement and enforce regular key rotation policies for all encryption keys used with `sops`. This limits the window of opportunity if a key is compromised.
        *   **Secure Key Material Storage:** For PGP and Age keys, ensure private keys are stored with robust security measures, such as hardware security modules (HSMs) or encrypted storage with strong access controls. Avoid storing them in easily accessible locations or within code repositories.
        *   **Comprehensive Auditing and Monitoring:**  Enable and actively monitor audit logs for all key access and management operations within KMS, Vault, PGP keyrings, and Age key management systems. Alert on any suspicious activity.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Enforcement:**  Mandate MFA for all accounts and roles that have access to key management systems and key storage locations.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Compromise of `sops` Binary or Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_compromise_of__sops__binary_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers compromise the distribution channels or dependencies of the `sops` binary itself, injecting malicious code into the tool. This can allow attackers to intercept secrets during `sops` operations.
*   **How `sops` Contributes:** Applications directly rely on the `sops` binary to perform secure encryption and decryption. A compromised binary directly undermines this security by potentially exfiltrating secrets or introducing vulnerabilities during processing.
*   **Example:** A malicious actor gains access to the `sops` GitHub repository or its release pipeline and injects a backdoor into a seemingly legitimate release of the `sops` binary. Developers unknowingly download and use this backdoored version, which then exfiltrates decrypted secrets to the attacker's server.
*   **Impact:**  Potential for immediate secret exfiltration during encryption or decryption processes performed by the compromised `sops` binary. System compromise is also possible if the malicious code introduces broader vulnerabilities. This results in a severe loss of confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users:**
        *   **Strict Binary Integrity Verification:**  Always verify the cryptographic integrity (using SHA256 checksums) of the `sops` binary against official checksums provided by the `sops` project before downloading and using it in any environment.
        *   **Utilize Package Managers from Trusted Sources Only:** Install `sops` exclusively through well-established and trusted package managers or distribution channels. Ensure these sources have strong security practices and are regularly updated.
        *   **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning (Source Builds):** If building `sops` from source code, implement regular and automated vulnerability scanning of all dependencies to identify and remediate any known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Thorough Code Review for Source Builds:**  If building `sops` from source, conduct rigorous code reviews, especially focusing on changes from official releases, to detect any potential malicious code injections or tampering.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration Leading to Weak Encryption by `sops`](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_leading_to_weak_encryption_by__sops_.md)

*   **Description:**  `sops` is configured in a way that results in the use of weak or outdated encryption algorithms or insufficient key lengths, making the encrypted secrets vulnerable to cryptanalysis or brute-force attacks.
*   **How `sops` Contributes:** `sops` offers configuration options for encryption settings. Incorrect or insecure configuration directly weakens the cryptographic protection it provides.
*   **Example:** A developer, attempting to optimize for perceived performance, configures `sops` to use an outdated and weak cipher like RC4 or sets a significantly reduced key length for AES. An attacker with sufficient resources could potentially break this weak encryption and recover the secrets.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of secrets due to inadequate encryption strength. This can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access, although the exploitation might require more effort than with unencrypted secrets or in cases of key compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (if significantly weak ciphers are used)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users:**
        *   **Adhere to Strong Default Encryption Settings:**  Rely on `sops`'s default encryption settings, which are designed to be secure and use modern, robust algorithms. Avoid unnecessary customization of cipher settings.
        *   **Avoid Custom Cipher Configuration Unless Absolutely Necessary and Expertly Reviewed:** Only modify default cipher configurations if there is a compelling and well-justified security or compliance reason. Any custom configurations should be designed and rigorously reviewed by cryptography experts.
        *   **Regular Configuration Audits and Security Reviews:**  Periodically audit `sops` configurations to ensure that strong encryption settings are consistently applied and that no insecure configurations have been inadvertently introduced. Include `sops` configuration in regular security reviews.
