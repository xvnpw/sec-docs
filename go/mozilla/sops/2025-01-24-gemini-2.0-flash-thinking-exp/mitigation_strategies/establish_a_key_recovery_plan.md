### 3. Threats Mitigated and Impact

**Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Permanent Key Loss (High Severity - Business Continuity):** This strategy directly mitigates the risk of permanent key loss due to accidental deletion, irreversible KMS outage, or other unforeseen events. By having a recovery plan, we can restore access to `sops` keys and the encrypted secrets, preventing business disruption and data loss.
*   **Prolonged Downtime During Key Issues (Medium Severity - Availability):**  Without a recovery plan, troubleshooting and resolving key-related issues can be a lengthy and complex process, leading to prolonged application downtime. A well-defined recovery plan significantly reduces the time required to restore key access, minimizing downtime and improving application availability.

**Impact:**

*   **Medium Risk Reduction:**  The "Establish a Key Recovery Plan" strategy provides a **medium** level of risk reduction. While it doesn't prevent key loss events from *happening*, it significantly reduces the *impact* of such events by enabling timely and effective recovery. The risk reduction is considered medium because the initial key loss event is still possible, but the consequences are mitigated.
*   **Ensures Business Continuity:**  By enabling key recovery, this strategy is crucial for ensuring business continuity. Applications relying on `sops` for secret management can be restored to operational status quickly in case of key-related incidents.
*   **Faster Recovery Time (Improved Availability):**  A tested and documented recovery plan drastically reduces the Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) for key-related incidents, leading to improved application availability and reduced downtime costs.

### 4. Current Implementation and Missing Implementation

**Currently Implemented:**

*   **Partial KMS Key Backups:**  The organization has basic KMS key backups enabled. This is a good starting point, but it's insufficient without a comprehensive plan for *how* to use these backups for recovery in various scenarios.

**Missing Implementation:**

*   **Comprehensive, Documented Key Recovery Plan:**  A formal, documented key recovery plan specifically for `sops` keys is missing. This includes:
    *   Detailed procedures for KMS and PGP key recovery (until PGP phase-out).
    *   Clearly defined recovery scenarios.
    *   Designated recovery administrators and their contact information.
    *   Backup locations and access instructions.
*   **Testing of Recovery Plan:**  The current KMS key backups are likely not regularly tested in the context of `sops` key recovery.
*   **Designation and Training of Recovery Administrators:**  Specific personnel have not been formally designated and trained as `sops` key recovery administrators.
