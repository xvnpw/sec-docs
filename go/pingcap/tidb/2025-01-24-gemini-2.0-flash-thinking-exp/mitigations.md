# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for pingcap/tidb

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable TLS for Inter-Component Communication](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tls_for_inter-component_communication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable TLS for Inter-Component Communication
*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Generate TLS certificates and keys for each TiDB component (TiDB server, PD server, TiKV server, TiFlash server). Use tools like `openssl` or `cfssl`.
    *   Step 2: Configure each TiDB component to use TLS by modifying their configuration files (`tidb.toml`, `pd.toml`, `tikv.toml`, `tiflash.toml`). Specify certificate, key, and CA paths in TLS sections.
    *   Step 3: Enable TLS for both client and server connections in component configurations (e.g., `security.ssl-client-cert`, `security.ssl-cert`).
    *   Step 4: Restart TiDB cluster components in a rolling update to apply TLS configurations.
    *   Step 5: Verify TLS by monitoring network traffic or checking TiDB component logs for TLS handshake messages.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Eavesdropping on inter-component communication (Severity: High). Interception of sensitive data like SQL queries and replication traffic.
    *   Man-in-the-middle attacks within the cluster network (Severity: High). Manipulation of communication leading to data corruption or unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Eavesdropping: High risk reduction. TLS encrypts communication, making interception ineffective.
    *   Man-in-the-middle: High risk reduction. TLS provides authentication and integrity, preventing undetected manipulation.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not currently implemented in the project.
*   **Missing Implementation:** TLS is not configured for internal communication between TiDB, PD, TiKV, and TiFlash components.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in TiDB](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__in_tidb.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in TiDB
*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Define roles within TiDB based on required access levels (e.g., `read_only_user`, `data_writer`, `administrator`). Define privileges for each role (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `ADMIN`).
    *   Step 2: Create TiDB users for applications and individuals, avoiding `root` for applications.
    *   Step 3: Grant roles to TiDB users using `GRANT role TO user` SQL command, based on their needs.
    *   Step 4: Revoke unnecessary privileges from the `public` role to minimize default access.
    *   Step 5: Regularly audit user roles and privileges using `SHOW GRANTS FOR user` to ensure least privilege.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized data access (Severity: High). Access or modification of data by users with excessive privileges.
    *   Privilege escalation (Severity: Medium). Attackers gaining broader access by compromising over-privileged accounts.
    *   Data breaches via compromised application accounts (Severity: High). Reduced damage if application accounts have limited privileges.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized data access: High risk reduction. RBAC restricts access to necessary data and operations.
    *   Privilege escalation: Medium risk reduction. Limits the scope of escalation by restricting initial privileges.
    *   Data breaches: Medium risk reduction. Confines impact of compromised accounts by limiting capabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic user authentication exists, but granular RBAC is not fully configured. Application users might have excessive privileges.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Define fine-grained roles and assign them to users and applications. Review and enforce least privilege for current user permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Encryption at Rest for TiKV](./mitigation_strategies/enable_encryption_at_rest_for_tikv.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable Encryption at Rest for TiKV
*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Choose a TiKV-supported encryption method (file-based, KMS). Select based on security needs and key management infrastructure.
    *   Step 2: Configure TiKV encryption in `tikv.toml`. Specify encryption method and parameters like key location or KMS endpoint.
    *   Step 3: Securely generate and store keys for file-based encryption, or setup KMS access control.
    *   Step 4: Restart TiKV servers in a rolling update to apply encryption at rest.
    *   Step 5: For existing data, migrate data to encrypted form. New deployments encrypt data automatically.
    *   Step 6: Regularly rotate encryption keys as per security best practices. Configure key rotation based on the chosen method.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data breaches from physical storage compromise (Severity: High). Protection against unauthorized access if storage media is stolen.
    *   Unauthorized access to data files at rest (Severity: Medium). Data unreadable without keys even if file system is accessed.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breaches from physical storage compromise: High risk reduction. Crucial defense against physical media loss or theft.
    *   Unauthorized access to data files at rest: Medium risk reduction. Raises the bar for unauthorized access, though not foolproof against key compromise.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not currently implemented. TiKV data is stored unencrypted at rest.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Configure and enable encryption at rest for TiKV. Decide on encryption method and key management. Plan and execute retroactive encryption of existing data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Parameterized Queries to Prevent SQL Injection](./mitigation_strategies/implement_parameterized_queries_to_prevent_sql_injection.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Parameterized Queries to Prevent SQL Injection
*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Review application code for dynamic SQL construction by concatenating user input.
    *   Step 2: Replace dynamic SQL with parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by TiDB-compatible drivers.
    *   Step 3: Pass user input as parameters, not directly in SQL strings. Drivers handle escaping and quoting.
    *   Step 4: Test application to verify SQL injection prevention and functionality. Use security testing tools.
    *   Step 5: Educate developers on secure coding, emphasizing parameterized queries and dynamic SQL risks with TiDB.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection attacks (Severity: High). Malicious SQL code injection leading to data breaches, modification, or DoS.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection attacks: High risk reduction. Parameterized queries effectively prevent user input from being interpreted as SQL code.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some code uses parameterized queries, but dynamic SQL exists, especially in older or less updated parts.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive code review to eliminate dynamic SQL. Use static analysis tools. Developer training on secure coding practices for TiDB.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable TiDB Audit Logging and Monitoring](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tidb_audit_logging_and_monitoring.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable TiDB Audit Logging and Monitoring
*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Configure TiDB audit logging in `tidb.toml`. Enable logging and set log format and destination (file, syslog).
    *   Step 2: Define audited events. Capture connection attempts, queries, DDL operations, privilege changes relevant to security.
    *   Step 3: Set up monitoring for TiDB health and security events. Integrate with monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana) and SIEM if available.
    *   Step 4: Configure alerts for suspicious activity from logs or monitoring (failed logins, unusual queries, performance anomalies).
    *   Step 5: Regularly review audit logs and monitoring for incident detection and response. Establish incident response procedures.
    *   Step 6: Secure access to audit logs and monitoring dashboards to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Delayed detection of security incidents (Severity: Medium). Breaches unnoticed for long periods without logging and monitoring.
    *   Lack of forensic evidence (Severity: Medium). Missing audit logs hinder incident investigation and impact analysis.
    *   Insider threats (Severity: Medium). Audit logging helps detect and deter malicious insider activity.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Delayed detection: Medium risk reduction. Faster incident detection and quicker response.
    *   Lack of forensic evidence: Medium risk reduction. Audit logs provide data for post-incident analysis.
    *   Insider threats: Medium risk reduction. Increases accountability and deters malicious insider actions.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic performance monitoring exists, but audit logging and security-specific monitoring/alerting are lacking.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Enable and configure TiDB audit logging. Consider SIEM integration. Set up security-focused monitoring dashboards and alerts for proactive incident detection.
