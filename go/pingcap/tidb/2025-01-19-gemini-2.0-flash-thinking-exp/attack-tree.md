## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path: Exploit TiDB SQL Interface**
    * **Critical Node: SQL Injection**
        * **Critical Node: Direct SQL Injection:**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_tidb_sql_interface_____critical_node_sql_injection_________critical_node_dire_a1c0f09d.md)

An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries directly within application inputs. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or parameterize these inputs, the malicious SQL is executed against the TiDB database. This can lead to:
            * Data breaches: Accessing sensitive data not intended for the attacker.
            * Data modification: Altering or deleting data, potentially disrupting application functionality or causing financial loss.
            * Denial of service: Executing resource-intensive queries to overload the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path: Exploit TiDB SQL Interface**
    * **Critical Node: SQL Injection**
        * **Blind SQL Injection:**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_tidb_sql_interface_____critical_node_sql_injection_________blind_sql_injectio_6580a8b3.md)

Similar to direct SQL injection, but the attacker cannot see the direct output of the injected SQL. Instead, they infer information about the database structure and data by observing the application's response time or behavior based on true/false conditions in their injected SQL. This is a slower but still effective way to extract data or manipulate the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Critical Node: Exploit TiDB Internal Components**
    * **Critical Node: Exploit TiKV (Storage Layer) Vulnerabilities**
        * **Critical Node: Data Corruption Exploits:**](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_tidb_internal_components_____critical_node_exploit_tikv__storage_layer__vulner_8957928f.md)

Attackers target vulnerabilities within TiKV, the distributed key-value storage engine used by TiDB. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow them to directly corrupt the data stored within TiKV, leading to:
            * Application malfunction: The application relies on the integrity of the data; corruption can cause errors and unexpected behavior.
            * Data integrity issues: Loss of trust in the accuracy and consistency of the data.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Critical Node: Exploit TiDB Internal Components**
    * **Critical Node: Exploit TiDB Server Vulnerabilities**
        * **Critical Node: Buffer Overflows/Memory Corruption:**](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_tidb_internal_components_____critical_node_exploit_tidb_server_vulnerabilities_20b86cdd.md)

Attackers exploit flaws in the TiDB server's code that allow writing data beyond the allocated memory buffers. This can lead to:
            * Server crashes: Causing denial of service.
            * Arbitrary code execution: The attacker can potentially execute their own code on the TiDB server, leading to complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Critical Node: Exploit TiDB Internal Components**
    * **Critical Node: Exploit Placement Driver (PD) Vulnerabilities**
        * **Critical Node: Disrupt Cluster Management:**](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_tidb_internal_components_____critical_node_exploit_placement_driver__pd__vulne_5c98dd97.md)

Attackers target vulnerabilities in the Placement Driver (PD), which manages the TiDB cluster topology and data placement. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can disrupt the cluster's ability to function correctly, leading to:
            * Data unavailability: Parts of the data become inaccessible.
            * Data inconsistencies: Data is not synchronized correctly across the cluster.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Critical Node: Exploit TiDB Internal Components**
    * **Critical Node: Exploit Placement Driver (PD) Vulnerabilities**
        * **Critical Node: Gain Control of Cluster Metadata:**](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_tidb_internal_components_____critical_node_exploit_placement_driver__pd__vulne_5a9611a0.md)

A more severe compromise of PD allows attackers to manipulate the cluster's metadata. This can lead to:
            * Redirecting queries: Sending queries to incorrect nodes, leading to data access issues or incorrect results.
            * Complete cluster compromise: Gaining control over the entire TiDB cluster.

## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path: Manipulate Data within TiDB to Compromise Application**
    * **Critical Node: Data Corruption for Application Logic Exploitation:**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_data_within_tidb_to_compromise_application_____critical_node_data_corrupti_b2920e57.md)

Attackers intentionally corrupt specific data within TiDB, understanding how the application uses this data. This can trigger vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior in the application's logic, leading to:
        * Application malfunction: The application behaves in unintended ways due to the corrupted data.
        * Security breaches: The corrupted data might bypass security checks or lead to privilege escalation within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Critical Node: Exploit TiDB Management Interfaces (if exposed)**
    * **Critical Node: TiDB Dashboard Vulnerabilities**
        * **Critical Node: Command Injection:**](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_tidb_management_interfaces__if_exposed______critical_node_tidb_dashboard_vulne_c5d5be59.md)

If the TiDB Dashboard is exposed and contains vulnerabilities, attackers might be able to inject malicious commands that are executed on the server hosting the dashboard or even the TiDB server itself. This can lead to:
            * System compromise: Gaining complete control over the server.
            * Data breaches: Accessing sensitive data on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Critical Node: Exploit TiDB Backup/Restore Mechanisms**
    * **Critical Node: Manipulate Backups:**](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_tidb_backuprestore_mechanisms_____critical_node_manipulate_backups.md)

Attackers target the backup process. If backups are not properly secured, attackers can tamper with backup files to inject malicious data or code. When these compromised backups are restored, it can lead to:
        * Application compromise: The restored application contains malicious code or data.
        * TiDB cluster compromise: The restored TiDB cluster is compromised.
        * Long-term persistence: The compromise can persist even after system recovery efforts.
