# Threat Model Analysis for pingcap/tidb

## Threat: [PD Leader Election Manipulation](./threats/pd_leader_election_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to influence or disrupt the PD leader election process. This might involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the Raft consensus algorithm implementation or by overwhelming PD servers with network traffic. A successful attack could lead to the attacker becoming the PD leader or causing instability in the leadership election.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of cluster control, inability to schedule operations, potential data unavailability or inconsistencies if the cluster cannot agree on a leader.
    *   **Affected Component:** PD (Placement Driver), specifically the leader election module and Raft implementation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure PD servers are deployed in a secure and isolated network environment.
        *   Implement network segmentation and access controls to restrict communication with PD servers.
        *   Regularly update TiDB to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities in the Raft implementation.
        *   Monitor PD leader election processes and resource utilization for anomalies.
        *   Implement redundancy for PD servers (typically 3 or 5 nodes) to tolerate failures.

## Threat: [TiKV Data Corruption via Malicious Node](./threats/tikv_data_corruption_via_malicious_node.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who has compromised a TiKV server could attempt to corrupt data stored on that node. This could involve directly modifying data files, manipulating the Raft log, or introducing inconsistencies during data replication.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, data inconsistencies, application errors due to corrupted data.
    *   **Affected Component:** TiKV (Key-Value Store), specifically the storage engine and Raft implementation on the compromised node.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong host-based security measures on TiKV servers, including regular patching and intrusion detection systems.
        *   Use data-at-rest encryption to protect data even if a TiKV node is compromised.
        *   Implement network segmentation and access controls to limit access to TiKV servers.
        *   Regularly monitor TiKV node health and data integrity using TiDB's monitoring tools.
        *   Utilize TiDB's replication mechanisms (Raft) to ensure data redundancy and fault tolerance.

## Threat: [TiDB Server Privilege Escalation](./threats/tidb_server_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in the TiDB server's privilege management or SQL parsing logic to gain higher privileges than intended. This could allow them to access or modify data they are not authorized for, or perform administrative actions.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, potential data breaches, and compromise of the TiDB cluster.
    *   **Affected Component:** TiDB Server, specifically the privilege management module and SQL execution engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update TiDB to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting user permissions in TiDB.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization in the application layer to prevent SQL injection attacks that could be leveraged for privilege escalation.
        *   Monitor TiDB audit logs for suspicious activity and privilege changes.

## Threat: [Unencrypted Communication Between TiDB Components](./threats/unencrypted_communication_between_tidb_components.md)

*   **Description:** If communication between TiDB components (TiDB, PD, TiKV, TiFlash) is not encrypted, an attacker on the network could eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted, such as SQL queries, data values, or internal control messages.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** All TiDB components (TiDB, PD, TiKV, TiFlash) and the network communication layer between them.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS encryption for all inter-component communication within the TiDB cluster.
        *   Configure mutual TLS authentication to verify the identity of communicating components.
        *   Ensure that certificates used for TLS are properly managed and rotated.

## Threat: [TiDB SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/tidb_sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** While the application is primarily responsible for preventing SQL injection, vulnerabilities within TiDB's SQL parsing or execution engine could potentially be exploited by a crafted SQL query, even if the application attempts to sanitize input. This could allow an attacker to bypass intended access controls or execute arbitrary SQL commands.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, potential data breaches, and compromise of the TiDB cluster.
    *   **Affected Component:** TiDB Server, specifically the SQL parsing and execution engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update TiDB to the latest stable version to patch known SQL injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow secure coding practices in the application layer to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements consistently in the application.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization on the application side as a defense-in-depth measure.

## Threat: [PD Server Compromise Leading to Cluster Shutdown](./threats/pd_server_compromise_leading_to_cluster_shutdown.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who gains control of a majority of PD servers could issue commands to shut down the entire TiDB cluster, causing a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Complete application outage, data unavailability.
    *   **Affected Component:** PD (Placement Driver), specifically the cluster management and control plane.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing PD servers.
        *   Secure the network environment where PD servers are deployed.
        *   Monitor PD server activity for suspicious commands.
        *   Implement redundancy for PD servers to tolerate the loss of some nodes.
