# BUSINESS POSTURE

TiDB is a complex, distributed database system. Based on the GitHub repository, here's a breakdown of the likely business posture:

Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a highly scalable and resilient SQL database solution.
*   Offer MySQL compatibility to ease migration and adoption.
*   Ensure high availability and data consistency.
*   Support large-scale, mission-critical applications.
*   Maintain an active open-source community and ecosystem.
*   Provide both self-hosted and potentially managed (cloud) deployment options.
*   Compete with other established and emerging database solutions.

Business Risks:

*   Data loss or corruption: As a database, the most critical risk is the loss, corruption, or unauthorized access of the data it stores.
*   System downtime: Outages can significantly impact businesses relying on TiDB for critical operations.
*   Performance bottlenecks: Scalability is a key selling point, so performance issues under heavy load would be a major risk.
*   Security breaches: Unauthorized access, data breaches, or injection attacks could have severe consequences.
*   Complexity of operation: The distributed nature of TiDB introduces operational complexity, increasing the risk of misconfiguration or operational errors.
*   Competition: The database market is highly competitive. Failure to keep up with features, performance, or pricing of competitors is a risk.
*   Community and ecosystem health: Reliance on open-source contributions means a decline in community engagement could slow down development and support.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on the repository and common practices):

*   security control: Authentication: TiDB supports user authentication, likely with password-based and potentially other methods (e.g., external authentication providers). Implemented within the TiDB server's authentication modules.
*   security control: Authorization: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is likely implemented to manage user permissions and privileges. Implemented within the TiDB server's authorization modules.
*   security control: Encryption in transit: TLS/SSL is likely supported (and strongly recommended) for encrypting communication between clients and the database, and between internal components. Implemented using standard TLS libraries.
*   security control: Encryption at rest: While not explicitly clear from the repository root, encryption at rest is a *critical* feature for any production database and is likely supported, potentially through integration with underlying storage systems or dedicated encryption mechanisms.
*   security control: Input validation: As a SQL database, TiDB *must* implement robust input validation and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. This is a fundamental part of the SQL parsing and execution engine.
*   security control: Auditing: TiDB likely provides audit logging capabilities to track user activity and database operations. Implemented within the TiDB server and potentially integrated with external logging systems.
*   security control: Network security: Deployment typically involves network-level security controls (firewalls, security groups) to restrict access to the database cluster. Implemented at the infrastructure level (e.g., cloud provider's security groups, firewalls).
*   security control: Regular security updates: The TiDB project likely follows a release process that includes security patches and updates. Implemented through the project's release management process.
*   security control: Dependency management: The project uses Go modules, which helps manage dependencies and track vulnerabilities. Implemented through Go's module system.
*   security control: Code reviews: The open-source nature of the project encourages community code reviews, which can help identify security vulnerabilities. Implemented through the GitHub pull request process.
*   security control: Static analysis: The project likely uses static analysis tools (e.g., linters, security scanners) to identify potential code quality and security issues. Implemented as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Operational complexity: The distributed nature of TiDB introduces significant operational complexity, which increases the risk of misconfiguration and human error. This is partially mitigated by documentation, tooling, and managed service offerings.
*   accepted risk: Potential for zero-day vulnerabilities: Like any complex software, TiDB is susceptible to undiscovered vulnerabilities. This is mitigated by ongoing security research, community contributions, and a rapid response to reported issues.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on external dependencies: TiDB relies on external libraries and components, which may have their own vulnerabilities. This is mitigated by dependency management and regular updates.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   high priority: Formal security audits: Regular, independent security audits by external experts are crucial for identifying vulnerabilities that may be missed by internal reviews.
*   high priority: Penetration testing: Regular penetration testing simulates real-world attacks to assess the security of the system.
*   high priority: Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS): Deploying IDPS can help detect and respond to malicious activity within the cluster.
*   high priority: Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Implementing DLP measures can help prevent sensitive data from leaving the system unauthorized.
*   high priority: Web Application Firewall (WAF): If TiDB is exposed through a web interface or API, a WAF can provide an additional layer of protection against web-based attacks.
*   high priority: Secrets management: Securely store and manage sensitive credentials (e.g., passwords, API keys) using a dedicated secrets management solution.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support strong password policies.
    *   Offer multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Integrate with external identity providers (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory).
    *   Provide mechanisms for secure password reset and recovery.
*   Authorization:
    *   Implement fine-grained RBAC.
    *   Support the principle of least privilege.
    *   Allow for granular control over access to specific databases, tables, and operations.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Strictly validate all user inputs.
    *   Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
    *   Implement robust error handling to avoid information leakage.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms.
    *   Securely manage encryption keys.
    *   Support both encryption in transit and at rest.
    *   Regularly review and update cryptographic implementations.

## BUILD

The TiDB build process leverages Go's build system and likely incorporates several security measures.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] --> GitRepository["Git Repository (GitHub)"]
    GitRepository --> CI_Server["CI Server (GitHub Actions)"]
    CI_Server --> Build["Build (Go Build)"]
    Build --> SAST["Static Analysis (SAST)"]
    SAST --> SCA["Software Composition Analysis (SCA)"]
    SCA --> Tests["Unit & Integration Tests"]
    Tests --> Artifacts["Build Artifacts (Binaries, Docker Images)"]
    Artifacts --> ArtifactRegistry["Artifact Registry (Docker Hub, etc.)"]
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code to the GitHub repository.
2.  A CI/CD system (likely GitHub Actions, based on the presence of `.github/workflows`) is triggered.
3.  The CI server checks out the code.
4.  The Go build system compiles the code.
5.  Static analysis tools (SAST) scan the code for potential vulnerabilities. Examples include GoSec, staticcheck.
6.  Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools analyze dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Examples include `go list -m all` combined with vulnerability databases.
7.  Unit and integration tests are executed.
8.  If all checks and tests pass, build artifacts (binaries, Docker images) are created.
9.  The artifacts are pushed to an artifact registry (e.g., Docker Hub, a private registry).

Security Controls:

*   security control: Code reviews: Required pull requests before merging code to the main branch.
*   security control: Static analysis (SAST): Automated code scanning for vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Identifying vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   security control: Automated testing: Unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   security control: Signed commits: Enforcing signed commits to verify the authenticity of code changes. (Potentially used, not explicitly stated in the repo root).
*   security control: Build provenance: Generating build provenance information to track the origin and build process of artifacts. (Potentially used, best practice).
*   security control: Container image signing: Signing Docker images to ensure their integrity and authenticity. (Potentially used, best practice).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Online Transaction Processing (OLTP): TiDB is designed for OLTP workloads, so ensuring the availability, performance, and integrity of transactional operations is paramount.
*   Data Analytics (HTAP): TiDB also supports Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP), making real-time analytics a critical business process.
*   Data Storage and Retrieval: The fundamental function of a database is to store and retrieve data reliably.

Data Sensitivity:

The data stored in TiDB can vary greatly in sensitivity depending on the specific use case. It could range from:

*   Non-sensitive data: Test data, publicly available information.
*   Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Names, addresses, contact details.
*   Protected Health Information (PHI): Medical records, health insurance information.
*   Financial data: Credit card numbers, bank account details, transaction history.
*   Intellectual property: Source code, trade secrets, confidential documents.
*   Authentication credentials: Usernames, passwords, API keys.

The sensitivity of the data dictates the level of security controls required. For example, storing PHI or financial data requires significantly higher security measures than storing non-sensitive data.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) must TiDB deployments adhere to? This will significantly impact the required security controls.
*   What is the expected threat model? Are there specific types of attackers or attacks that are of particular concern?
