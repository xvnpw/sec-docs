# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for pingcap/tidb

## Mitigation Strategy: [Transaction Isolation Level Awareness and Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/transaction_isolation_level_awareness_and_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand Isolation Levels:** Thoroughly understand the different transaction isolation levels supported by TiDB (Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable) and their implications for data consistency and performance.  Refer to the official TiDB documentation.
    2.  **Analyze Application Requirements:** Analyze the specific data consistency requirements of your application.  Identify transactions that require strong consistency (e.g., financial transactions) and those that can tolerate weaker consistency (e.g., read-only reporting queries).
    3.  **Choose Appropriate Levels:**  Select the *lowest* isolation level that meets the requirements of each transaction.  Avoid using Serializable globally unless absolutely necessary, as it can significantly impact performance.
    4.  **Configure TiDB:** Configure the default transaction isolation level in the TiDB configuration file (`tidb.toml`).  Override the default level for specific transactions using the `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL` SQL statement within the application code.
    5.  **Document Choices:**  Clearly document the chosen isolation levels and the rationale behind them.  This documentation should be part of the application's design and code documentation.
    6.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the application with the chosen isolation levels, including concurrent access scenarios, to ensure that data consistency is maintained.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Inconsistency due to Incorrect Isolation Level:** (Severity: High) - Prevents data corruption or incorrect results caused by using an inappropriate isolation level.
    *   **Lost Updates:** (Severity: High) - Reduces the risk of lost updates in concurrent transactions.
    *   **Phantom Reads:** (Severity: Medium) - Mitigates the risk of reading inconsistent data.
    *   **Non-Repeatable Reads:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents reading different values for the same data within a transaction.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Inconsistency:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 80%) by choosing the correct isolation level.
    *   **Lost Updates:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 70%).
    *   **Phantom Reads:** Risk reduced moderately (e.g., 60%).
    *   **Non-Repeatable Reads:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 75%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The default isolation level (Repeatable Read) is used globally.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No analysis of application-specific requirements for different transactions.
    *   No explicit configuration of isolation levels for specific transactions.
    *   No documentation of isolation level choices.
    *   Testing does not specifically focus on isolation level behavior.

## Mitigation Strategy: [TiDB-Specific SQL Injection Prevention (Using Parameterized Queries and Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/tidb-specific_sql_injection_prevention__using_parameterized_queries_and_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enforce Parameterized Queries:**  *Mandate* the use of parameterized queries (prepared statements) for *all* database interactions from the application code.  This is the primary defense against SQL injection.
    2.  **Code Review and Static Analysis:**  Implement code reviews and use static analysis tools to automatically detect any instances of string concatenation or dynamic SQL generation that could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    3.  **TiDB Configuration:**  Review and configure TiDB's SQL-related settings in `tidb.toml` to enhance security.  For example:
        *   `prepared-plan-cache`: Enable the prepared plan cache to improve performance and security of parameterized queries.
        *   `treat-old-grant-as-revoke`: Ensure that old grant statements are treated as revoke statements.
    4.  **Least Privilege (Database Users):**  Ensure that database users created within TiDB have only the *minimum* necessary privileges.  Avoid granting excessive permissions (e.g., `SUPER`, `GRANT OPTION`) that could be abused through SQL injection.  Use TiDB's `CREATE USER`, `GRANT`, and `REVOKE` statements to manage user privileges.
    5. **TiDB-Specific Testing:** Conduct penetration testing that specifically targets TiDB's SQL dialect and features, looking for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities that might be unique to TiDB.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code into the application.
    *   **Data Breach:** (Severity: High) - Prevents unauthorized data access through SQL injection.
    *   **Data Modification/Deletion:** (Severity: High) - Prevents unauthorized data manipulation.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from gaining higher privileges within the database.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduced very significantly (e.g., 95%) with strict enforcement of parameterized queries.
    *   **Data Breach:** Risk reduced very significantly (e.g., 90%).
    *   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Risk reduced very significantly (e.g., 90%).
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 80%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Parameterized queries are used in some parts of the application, but not consistently.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No strict enforcement of parameterized queries.
    *   No static analysis to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   TiDB configuration is not optimized for SQL security.
    *   Database user privileges are not consistently managed based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   No TiDB-specific penetration testing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitoring TiDB-Specific Metrics and Alerts](./mitigation_strategies/monitoring_tidb-specific_metrics_and_alerts.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Key Metrics:** Identify TiDB-specific metrics that are critical for monitoring the health, performance, and security of the cluster.  This includes metrics related to:
        *   **PD:** Leader election latency, region count, store count, heartbeat latency.
        *   **TiKV:** Region size, write/read latency, storage capacity, compaction statistics, raft log statistics.
        *   **TiDB Server:** Query latency, QPS, connection count, transaction commit/rollback rates, slow query log.
        *   **TiFlash (if used):** Query latency, data replication lag, resource utilization.
    2.  **Configure TiDB Monitoring:** Use TiDB's built-in monitoring capabilities (e.g., Prometheus integration, Grafana dashboards) to collect and visualize the identified metrics.
    3.  **Define Alerting Rules:**  Create specific alerting rules based on thresholds for the key metrics.  For example:
        *   Alert if PD leader election latency exceeds a certain threshold.
        *   Alert if TiKV write latency is consistently high.
        *   Alert if the number of slow queries exceeds a certain limit.
        *   Alert if TiFlash replication lag is increasing.
    4.  **Alerting Channels:** Configure appropriate alerting channels (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty) to notify administrators when alerts are triggered.
    5.  **Regular Review:** Regularly review the monitoring dashboards and alerts to identify any potential issues and tune the alerting rules as needed.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Performance Degradation:** (Severity: Medium) - Early detection of performance issues.
    *   **Cluster Instability:** (Severity: High) - Detects issues that could lead to cluster downtime.
    *   **Data Loss/Corruption (Indirectly):** (Severity: High) - Early warning of potential problems that could lead to data loss.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: Medium) - Detects excessive resource consumption.
    *   **Security Anomalies (Indirectly):** (Severity: Medium) - Unusual patterns in metrics might indicate a security issue.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduced moderately (e.g., 60%).
    *   **Cluster Instability:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 70%).
    *   **Data Loss/Corruption:** Risk reduced indirectly (e.g., 40%).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced moderately (e.g., 50%).
    *   **Security Anomalies:** Risk reduced indirectly (e.g., 30%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic monitoring of overall system resource utilization.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No comprehensive monitoring of TiDB-specific metrics.
    *   No specific alerting rules for TiDB components.
    *   No integration with dedicated alerting channels.

## Mitigation Strategy: [TiDB Configuration Hardening](./mitigation_strategies/tidb_configuration_hardening.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Review Configuration Files:** Thoroughly review the configuration files for all TiDB components (tidb-server, tikv-server, pd-server).
    2. **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable any features or functionalities that are not required by the application. This reduces the attack surface.
    3. **Secure Configuration Options:** Configure security-related options appropriately. Examples include:
        *   `tidb-server`:
            *   `security.ssl-ca`, `security.ssl-cert`, `security.ssl-key`: Configure TLS encryption for client connections.
            *   `security.cluster-ssl-ca`, `security.cluster-ssl-cert`, `security.cluster-ssl-key`: Configure TLS for inter-component communication.
            *   `skip-grant-table`: Ensure this is set to `false` (the default) to enforce authentication.
        *   `tikv-server`:
            *   `security.ca-path`, `security.cert-path`, `security.key-path`: Configure TLS for inter-component communication.
        *   `pd-server`:
            *   `security.ca-path`, `security.cert-path`, `security.key-path`: Configure TLS for inter-component communication.
    4. **Regular Updates:** Keep TiDB components updated to the latest stable versions to benefit from security patches and improvements. Use TiDB's update mechanisms.
    5. **Configuration Management:** Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to manage TiDB configurations in a consistent and reproducible manner. This helps prevent configuration drift and ensures that security settings are applied consistently across all nodes.
    6. **Configuration Validation:** Implement automated checks to validate TiDB configurations against a set of predefined rules and best practices. This can be done using custom scripts or configuration management tools.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Unauthorized Access:** (Severity: High) - Prevents unauthorized access due to misconfigured security settings.
    * **Data Breach:** (Severity: High) - Reduces the risk of data breaches due to insecure configurations.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from gaining higher privileges.
    * **Configuration Drift:** (Severity: Medium) - Ensures consistent and secure configurations across the cluster.

* **Impact:**
    * **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 80%).
    * **Data Breach:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 75%).
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 70%).
    * **Configuration Drift:** Risk reduced significantly (e.g., 85%).

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Basic configuration settings are in place, but not comprehensively reviewed or hardened.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * No systematic review of configuration files for security best practices.
    * Not all security-related configuration options are explicitly set.
    * No configuration management tools are used.
    * No automated configuration validation.
