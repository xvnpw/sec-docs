# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for pingcap/tidb

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement TLS Encryption for Inter-Component Communication](./mitigation_strategies/implement_tls_encryption_for_inter-component_communication.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Generate TLS certificates and keys for each TiDB component (TiDB Server, PD Server, TiKV Server). Use tools like `openssl` or certificate management systems. Ensure certificates are properly signed and valid.
    *   Step 2: Configure PD Servers to use TLS for client and peer communication by modifying the PD configuration file (`pd.toml`) to enable TLS and specify certificate paths.
    *   Step 3: Configure TiKV Servers to use TLS for client and peer communication by modifying the TiKV configuration file (`tikv.toml`) to enable TLS and specify certificate paths.
    *   Step 4: Configure TiDB Servers to use TLS for client and server communication with PD and TiKV by modifying the TiDB configuration file (`tidb.toml`) to enable TLS and specify certificate paths.
    *   Step 5: Configure client applications connecting to TiDB to use TLS by specifying connection parameters in the client library or connection string.
    *   Step 6: Test TLS configuration by monitoring network traffic and verifying encrypted connections between all components and clients.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Eavesdropping on inter-component communication (Severity: High) - Interception of sensitive data like SQL queries and internal cluster information.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks within the cluster (Severity: High) - Interception and potential modification of communication between TiDB components.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Eavesdropping: High reduction - TLS encryption renders intercepted data unreadable.
    *   MITM attacks: High reduction - TLS prevents impersonation and malicious traffic injection.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Not currently implemented in the TiDB cluster.
*   **Missing Implementation:** TLS encryption is missing across all TiDB components (PD, TiKV, TiDB Servers) and client connections.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Authentication and Authorization within the Cluster](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_authentication_and_authorization_within_the_cluster.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Enable TiDB's built-in user authentication system in the TiDB configuration (`tidb.toml`).
    *   Step 2: Change default passwords for all TiDB administrative accounts (e.g., `root`). Use strong, unique passwords.
    *   Step 3: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using TiDB's privilege system. Define roles with specific privileges.
    *   Step 4: Grant users and applications only necessary roles and privileges using `GRANT` and `REVOKE` SQL statements.
    *   Step 5: Consider integrating with external authentication systems like LDAP or PAM if required, configuring TiDB to authenticate against them.
    *   Step 6: Regularly audit user accounts and privileges to ensure appropriateness.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized access to TiDB data and cluster management (Severity: High) - Access by unauthorized users due to weak credentials or permissive access controls.
    *   Privilege escalation within TiDB (Severity: Medium) - Attackers gaining higher privileges within the TiDB cluster.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access: High reduction - Strong authentication and authorization limit unauthorized access.
    *   Privilege escalation: Moderate reduction - RBAC and least privilege limit potential damage.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Basic user authentication is enabled, but default `root` password might be in use and RBAC is not fully implemented in TiDB.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Strong password policy enforcement for TiDB users, full RBAC implementation within TiDB, potential external authentication integration, and regular privilege audits within TiDB.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Access to TiDB Monitoring Tools](./mitigation_strategies/secure_access_to_tidb_monitoring_tools.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Implement authentication and authorization for TiDB Dashboard access. Configure user accounts and roles within TiDB or integrate with external authentication if supported.
    *   Step 2: Restrict access to TiDB Dashboard to authorized personnel only through network controls (firewall rules) and application-level authentication.
    *   Step 3: Ensure HTTPS is enabled for TiDB Dashboard communication to encrypt traffic between users and the dashboard.
    *   Step 4: If using Prometheus/Grafana for TiDB monitoring, secure access to these tools as well, implementing authentication and authorization and HTTPS.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive TiDB cluster information through monitoring tools (Severity: Medium) - Unauthorized access to dashboards revealing cluster status, performance metrics, and potentially sensitive configurations.
    *   Manipulation of monitoring data (Severity: Low to Medium) - Insecure monitoring tools could be targets for manipulation, leading to misleading information and potentially masking real issues.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive information: Moderate reduction - Authentication and authorization limit unauthorized access to monitoring data.
    *   Manipulation of monitoring data: Low to Moderate reduction - Secure access reduces the risk of unauthorized modification.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Access to TiDB Dashboard and potentially Prometheus/Grafana is not secured with authentication and authorization.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement authentication and authorization for TiDB Dashboard and related monitoring tools, enforce HTTPS, and restrict network access.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_parameterized_queries__prepared_statements_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify all dynamic SQL query construction in the application code interacting with TiDB.
    *   Step 2: Replace dynamic SQL with parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by the database driver used to connect to TiDB.
    *   Step 3: Pass user input as parameters to prepared statements, not directly concatenated into SQL query strings.
    *   Step 4: Test application functionalities interacting with TiDB to verify parameterized queries are correctly implemented.
    *   Step 5: Conduct code reviews to ensure consistent use of parameterized queries for TiDB interactions.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection vulnerabilities in TiDB queries (Severity: High) - Injection of malicious SQL code through user input to manipulate TiDB queries.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High reduction - Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user data when interacting with TiDB.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Parameterized queries are used in some parts of the application interacting with TiDB, but dynamic SQL might still exist in places.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Systematic review and refactoring of all TiDB database interaction code to ensure consistent use of parameterized queries.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Database Users](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_database_users.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Define specific roles and privileges required for each application or user interacting with TiDB.
    *   Step 2: Grant TiDB users only the necessary privileges for their tasks using `GRANT` SQL statements. Avoid granting broad privileges like `SUPER` or `ALL PRIVILEGES` unless absolutely necessary.
    *   Step 3: Regularly review and audit TiDB user privileges to ensure they remain appropriate and aligned with the principle of least privilege. Revoke unnecessary privileges using `REVOKE` SQL statements.
    *   Step 4: For applications, create dedicated TiDB users with limited privileges instead of using shared or administrative accounts.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized data access and modification within TiDB (Severity: Medium to High) - Users or applications with excessive privileges could unintentionally or maliciously access or modify data beyond their intended scope.
    *   Lateral movement within TiDB (Severity: Medium) - If an attacker compromises an account with excessive privileges, they can potentially access or control more of the TiDB system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized data access/modification: Moderate to High reduction - Least privilege limits the impact of compromised accounts or application vulnerabilities.
    *   Lateral movement: Moderate reduction - Reduces the potential for attackers to expand their access within TiDB.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Some level of privilege management might be in place, but not consistently enforced across all TiDB users and applications.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Full implementation of least privilege across all TiDB users and applications, regular privilege audits, and dedicated limited-privilege users for applications.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Encryption at Rest for TiKV (if supported and required)](./mitigation_strategies/encryption_at_rest_for_tikv__if_supported_and_required_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Evaluate if encryption at rest is required based on data sensitivity and compliance requirements. Check TiDB documentation for current encryption at rest capabilities and configuration options for TiKV.
    *   Step 2: If supported and required, configure encryption at rest for TiKV. This typically involves configuring encryption keys and enabling encryption in the TiKV configuration (`tikv.toml`).
    *   Step 3: Securely manage encryption keys. Use key management systems or secure storage mechanisms to protect encryption keys.
    *   Step 4: Test encryption at rest configuration to ensure it is working correctly and does not impact performance significantly.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data breach from physical media theft or unauthorized access to storage (Severity: High) - If storage media containing TiKV data is physically stolen or accessed without authorization, data at rest encryption protects data confidentiality.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breach from physical media theft: High reduction - Encryption at rest renders data unreadable without the decryption key in case of physical compromise.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Encryption at rest for TiKV is not currently implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Evaluate requirement for encryption at rest, configure encryption at rest for TiKV if needed, and implement secure key management.

    *   Information disclosure due to insecure configurations (Severity: Medium) - Misconfigurations potentially revealing sensitive information about the TiDB cluster.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of misconfigurations: Moderate to High reduction - Secure configuration reduces the attack surface and mitigates potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Information disclosure: Moderate reduction - Hardening configurations prevents unintentional exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Secure configuration hardening of TiDB components has not been systematically performed. Default configurations are likely in use.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Review and harden the configuration of all TiDB components based on security best practices, disable unnecessary features, and establish a process for ongoing configuration review.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor TiDB Logs for Security Anomalies](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_tidb_logs_for_security_anomalies.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Ensure comprehensive logging is enabled for all TiDB components (PD, TiKV, TiDB Servers). Configure logging levels to capture relevant security events.
    *   Step 2: Centralize TiDB logs using a log management system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) for efficient analysis and correlation.
    *   Step 3: Define security anomaly detection rules and alerts based on TiDB log events. This could include rules for failed login attempts, suspicious SQL queries, privilege escalations, or configuration changes.
    *   Step 4: Regularly review TiDB logs and security alerts to identify and respond to potential security incidents.
    *   Step 5: Automate log analysis and alerting to enable timely detection of security threats.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
