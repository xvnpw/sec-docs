## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (TiDB Specific) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities__tidb_specific___high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **1.1. Leverage TiDB-Specific SQL Dialect Features [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **1.1.1. Exploit TiDB Extensions (e.g., specific functions, syntax differences from MySQL) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Identifying and exploiting SQL injection points in application code that interact with TiDB.
            *   Crafting malicious SQL payloads that utilize TiDB-specific syntax, functions, or behaviors that are not correctly handled by application-side input validation or WAFs designed for standard MySQL.
            *   Exploiting differences in error handling or data type coercion between TiDB and MySQL to bypass security measures.
            *   Using TiDB-specific features to perform advanced SQL injection techniques like out-of-band data exfiltration or command execution (if applicable and exploitable).

*   **1.2. Second-Order SQL Injection via TiDB Features [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **1.2.1. Store Malicious Data in TiDB and Trigger Execution Later [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Injecting malicious SQL code into database fields through application inputs that are not properly sanitized during data insertion.
            *   Waiting for the application to retrieve and process this malicious data in a later operation without proper output encoding or context-aware sanitization.
            *   Triggering the execution of the injected SQL code when the application uses the stored data in a dynamic SQL query, stored procedure, or other database operation.

*   **1.3. Blind SQL Injection to Extract Data or Modify State [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities where the application does not directly display database errors or output, but the attacker can infer information based on application behavior (e.g., response times, HTTP status codes).
        *   Using techniques like time-based blind SQL injection (e.g., using `BENCHMARK()` or similar TiDB-compatible functions to introduce delays) to extract data bit by bit.
        *   Using boolean-based blind SQL injection to infer information based on true/false responses from the application to crafted SQL queries.
        *   Potentially modifying application state or data by crafting blind SQL injection queries that perform `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operations based on inferred conditions.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses in TiDB [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_authentication_and_authorization_weaknesses_in_tidb__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **2.1. Bypass TiDB Authentication [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **2.1.1. Exploit Default TiDB Credentials (if any are left unchanged) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH if defaults are not changed]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Attempting to connect to TiDB using well-known default usernames and passwords (e.g., `root` with no password, or common default passwords).
            *   Scanning for exposed TiDB ports (typically 4000 for TiDB server, 10080 for PD server, 20160 for TiKV server) and attempting to authenticate.
            *   If default credentials are not changed after deployment, gaining immediate administrative access to the TiDB cluster.

    *   **2.1.2. Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force Attacks against TiDB [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Using lists of compromised usernames and passwords (obtained from data breaches elsewhere) to attempt login to TiDB.
            *   Performing brute-force attacks to guess TiDB user passwords, especially if weak passwords are used or if rate limiting is not in place.
            *   Exploiting any lack of account lockout policies to repeatedly attempt logins.

*   **2.2. Exploit TiDB Authorization Flaws [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **2.2.2. Bypass Application-Level Authorization via Direct TiDB Access [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   If application-level authorization is solely relied upon and database user permissions are overly permissive, attackers might bypass application logic.
            *   Gaining direct access to TiDB (e.g., through a compromised server or network access) and performing unauthorized operations if the database user used by the application has excessive privileges.
            *   Exploiting misconfigurations where the application database user has broader permissions than necessary, allowing attackers to access or modify data outside the intended application scope.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Data Exfiltration and Manipulation via TiDB Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__data_exfiltration_and_manipulation_via_tidb_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

*   **4.2. Data Exfiltration via Backup/Restore Processes (if insecurely configured) [CRITICAL NODE if backups are not secured]:**
    *   **4.2.1. Unauthorized Access to TiDB Backups [CRITICAL NODE if backups are not secured] [HIGH-RISK PATH if backups are easily accessible]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   If TiDB backups are stored in publicly accessible locations (e.g., unsecured cloud storage buckets, network shares).
            *   If access control to backup storage is weak or non-existent.
            *   If backups are not encrypted, allowing attackers to directly access and extract sensitive data from backup files.
            *   Compromising systems or accounts that have access to backup storage to download and exfiltrate backups.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploiting TiDB Management Interfaces and Tools (if exposed and vulnerable) [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploiting_tidb_management_interfaces_and_tools__if_exposed_and_vulnerable___critical_node_.md)

*   **5.1. Compromise TiDB Dashboard (if exposed without proper authentication) [CRITICAL NODE if Dashboard is exposed and unsecured] [HIGH-RISK PATH if Dashboard is easily accessible]:**
    *   **5.1.1. Default Credentials on TiDB Dashboard [CRITICAL NODE if defaults are not changed] [HIGH-RISK PATH if defaults are not changed and Dashboard is exposed]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Accessing the TiDB Dashboard web interface if it is exposed to the internet or untrusted networks.
            *   Attempting to log in using default credentials for the Dashboard (if not changed).
            *   Gaining administrative control over the TiDB cluster through the Dashboard if default credentials are used.

*   **5.2. Exploit TiDB Operator or other Management Tools (if used and vulnerable) [CRITICAL NODE if Operator is exposed and unsecured]:**
    *   **5.2.2. Misconfiguration of Operator leading to TiDB Compromise [CRITICAL NODE if Operator is misconfigured]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Exploiting misconfigurations in the TiDB Operator deployment, such as overly permissive RBAC settings, insecure API access, or exposed management interfaces.
            *   Using misconfigured Operator settings to gain unauthorized access to the TiDB cluster or the underlying infrastructure.
            *   Manipulating the Operator to disrupt TiDB cluster operations or inject malicious configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Supply Chain Attacks Targeting TiDB Dependencies (Less Direct, but possible) [CRITICAL NODE in broader context]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__supply_chain_attacks_targeting_tidb_dependencies__less_direct__but_possible___critical_node_in_br_9621169a.md)

*   **6.1. Compromised TiDB Dependencies (e.g., vulnerable libraries) [CRITICAL NODE in broader context]:**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   If TiDB or its dependencies rely on vulnerable third-party libraries or components.
        *   If attackers compromise the supply chain of these dependencies and inject malicious code.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in compromised dependencies to gain control over TiDB or the application using it.
        *   This is a less direct attack vector but can have widespread and significant impact if successful.
