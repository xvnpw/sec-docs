# Attack Surface Analysis for pingcap/tidb

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected TiDB Server MySQL Protocol Port](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_tidb_server_mysql_protocol_port.md)

**Description:** Unprotected TiDB Server MySQL Protocol Port
    * **How TiDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** TiDB exposes a MySQL-compatible protocol port for client connections. If this port is directly accessible from untrusted networks without proper authentication or network controls, it becomes a primary attack vector.
    * **Example:** An attacker on the internet attempts to connect to the TiDB server's MySQL port (default 4000) without needing to go through an application layer or VPN. They then try to brute-force credentials or exploit potential vulnerabilities in the MySQL protocol implementation within TiDB.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Network Segmentation: Isolate the TiDB server within a private network, accessible only through trusted networks or VPNs.
        * Firewall Rules: Implement strict firewall rules to allow connections only from authorized IP addresses or networks.
        * Strong Authentication: Enforce strong password policies and consider using multi-factor authentication for database users.
        * Disable Default Accounts: Remove or rename default administrative accounts and ensure they have strong, unique passwords.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Authentication and Authorization](./attack_surfaces/weak_authentication_and_authorization.md)

**Description:** Weak Authentication and Authorization
    * **How TiDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** TiDB relies on user accounts and roles for access control. Weak password policies, default credentials, or overly permissive role assignments increase the risk of unauthorized access to TiDB.
    * **Example:** A developer sets a simple, easily guessable password for a TiDB user account. An attacker guesses the password and gains access to sensitive data stored within TiDB.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to critical functionalities within TiDB.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enforce Strong Password Policies: Require complex passwords with a mix of character types and enforce regular password changes for TiDB users.
        * Principle of Least Privilege: Grant TiDB users only the necessary permissions required for their tasks.
        * Regularly Review User Permissions: Periodically audit TiDB user roles and permissions to ensure they are still appropriate.
        * Disable Default Accounts: Change default passwords or disable default administrative accounts within TiDB.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Inter-Component Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_inter-component_communication.md)

**Description:** Insecure Inter-Component Communication
    * **How TiDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** TiDB is a distributed system with communication between TiDB servers, TiKV nodes, and PD. If this internal communication is not encrypted or authenticated, it's vulnerable to eavesdropping or manipulation within the network affecting TiDB's operation.
    * **Example:** An attacker on the internal network intercepts communication between a TiDB server and a TiKV node, potentially gaining access to data being transferred or manipulating control messages affecting TiDB's data storage.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches within TiDB, data corruption within TiDB, cluster instability, man-in-the-middle attacks affecting TiDB's internal operations.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enable TLS/SSL for Internal Communication: Configure TiDB to use TLS/SSL encryption for all communication between its components (TiDB, TiKV, PD).
        * Mutual Authentication: Implement mutual authentication between TiDB components to ensure they are communicating with legitimate peers.
        * Secure Network Infrastructure: Ensure the internal network itself is secure and protected from unauthorized access.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in TiDB Dashboard (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_tidb_dashboard__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in TiDB Dashboard (if enabled)
    * **How TiDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The TiDB Dashboard provides a web-based management interface for TiDB. Vulnerabilities in the dashboard application itself (e.g., authentication bypass, cross-site scripting) can grant attackers significant control over the TiDB cluster.
    * **Example:** An attacker exploits a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the TiDB Dashboard to execute malicious JavaScript in the browser of an administrator, potentially stealing credentials or performing actions on their behalf within the TiDB management interface.
    * **Impact:** Full control over the TiDB cluster, data breaches within TiDB, data manipulation within TiDB, denial of service of the TiDB service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep TiDB Dashboard Up-to-Date: Regularly update TiDB to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities in the dashboard.
        * Restrict Access to TiDB Dashboard: Limit access to the dashboard to authorized administrators from trusted networks.
        * Implement Strong Authentication for TiDB Dashboard: Use strong passwords and consider multi-factor authentication for dashboard logins.
        * Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Conduct security assessments of the TiDB Dashboard to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (Specific to TiDB's Implementation)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerabilities__specific_to_tidb's_implementation_.md)

**Description:** SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (Specific to TiDB's Implementation)
    * **How TiDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** While aiming for MySQL compatibility, subtle differences in TiDB's SQL parsing or execution engine could introduce unique SQL injection vectors if input sanitization is not rigorous when interacting with TiDB.
    * **Example:** An application developer, assuming standard MySQL behavior, fails to properly sanitize user input when constructing a SQL query for TiDB. A TiDB-specific parsing quirk allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code that bypasses the intended logic within TiDB.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches within TiDB, data manipulation within TiDB, potential for arbitrary code execution on the database server (though less likely in TiDB's architecture).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements): This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection when querying TiDB by separating SQL code from user-supplied data.
        * Input Sanitization and Validation: Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input before using it in SQL queries targeting TiDB.
        * Principle of Least Privilege for Database Users: Grant database users connecting to TiDB only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks, limiting the impact of a successful SQL injection attack.
        * Regular Security Code Reviews: Review code that constructs SQL queries for TiDB to identify potential injection vulnerabilities.
