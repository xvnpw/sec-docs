## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via TiDB Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_tidb_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the root goal of the attacker and represents the successful compromise of the application through exploiting TiDB vulnerabilities.
*   Likelihood: Varies depending on specific attack path.
*   Impact: Critical (Full compromise of application data and functionality).
*   Effort: Varies depending on specific attack path.
*   Skill Level: Varies depending on specific attack path.
*   Detection Difficulty: Varies depending on specific attack path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit TiDB SQL Interface [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_tidb_sql_interface__critical_node___high_risk_.md)

*   This node represents the attack vector of leveraging the SQL interface of TiDB to compromise the application. It is considered critical as it's a direct interaction point and high-risk due to the prevalence and potential impact of SQL injection.
*   Likelihood: High
*   Impact: High (Data Breach, Data Manipulation, Unauthorized Access).
*   Effort: Low to Medium.
*   Skill Level: Low to Medium.
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious SQL [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_sql__high_risk_.md)

*   This attack step involves successfully inserting malicious SQL code into queries executed against the TiDB database. It is high-risk due to its direct potential for data compromise.
*   Likelihood: High (if SQL injection vulnerabilities exist).
*   Impact: High (Data Breach, Data Manipulation).
*   Effort: Low to Medium.
*   Skill Level: Low to Medium.
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Application Code [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_sql_injection_vulnerabilities_in_application_code__high_risk_.md)

*   This step focuses on exploiting weaknesses in the application's code where user input is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries. It's a high-risk path due to the common occurrence of these vulnerabilities.
*   Likelihood: High.
*   Impact: High (Data Breach, Data Manipulation).
*   Effort: Low.
*   Skill Level: Low.
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unsanitized User Input [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unsanitized_user_input__high_risk_.md)

*   This is the most fundamental step in the SQL injection attack path, where an attacker provides malicious input that is not properly processed, leading to the execution of unintended SQL commands. It's high-risk due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
*   Likelihood: High.
*   Impact: High (Data Breach, Data Manipulation).
*   Effort: Low.
*   Skill Level: Low.
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise TiDB Cluster Components [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_tidb_cluster_components__critical_node_.md)

*   This node represents attacks targeting the underlying infrastructure of the TiDB cluster. It is critical because successful compromise of these components can have widespread and severe consequences for the entire system.
*   Likelihood: Varies depending on the specific component and vulnerability.
*   Impact: High to Critical (Data Loss, Service Disruption, Cluster Control).
*   Effort: Medium to High.
*   Skill Level: Medium to Advanced.
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target PD (Placement Driver) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/target_pd__placement_driver___critical_node___high_risk_.md)

*   The Placement Driver (PD) is the central control plane of the TiDB cluster. Targeting it is considered critical and high-risk because compromising it can grant an attacker significant control over the entire cluster.
*   Likelihood: Low to Medium.
*   Impact: Critical (Cluster Control, Data Loss, Service Disruption).
*   Effort: Medium to High.
*   Skill Level: Advanced.
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit PD API Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pd_api_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   This attack step involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the PD's API, which is used for managing the cluster. It's a high-risk path because successful exploitation can lead to gaining control over critical cluster functions.
*   Likelihood: Low.
*   Impact: Critical (Cluster Control, Data Loss, Service Disruption).
*   Effort: Medium to High.
*   Skill Level: Advanced.
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Control Over Cluster Management Functions [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_control_over_cluster_management_functions__high_risk_.md)

*   This is the consequence of successfully exploiting PD API vulnerabilities. It's a high-risk step because it grants the attacker the ability to manipulate the TiDB cluster, potentially leading to data loss, service disruption, or complete takeover.
*   Likelihood: Low (dependent on successful exploitation of API vulnerabilities).
*   Impact: Critical (Cluster Control, Data Loss, Service Disruption).
*   Effort: Medium to High.
*   Skill Level: Advanced.
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium.
