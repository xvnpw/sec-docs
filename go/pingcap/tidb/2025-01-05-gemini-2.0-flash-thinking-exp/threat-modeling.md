# Threat Model Analysis for pingcap/tidb

## Threat: [TiDB Client Impersonation](./threats/tidb_client_impersonation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to valid client credentials (e.g., through phishing, malware, or data breach) or exploits a vulnerability in client authentication *within TiDB* to impersonate a legitimate application connecting to TiDB. The attacker might then read, modify, or delete data they are not authorized to access, or execute administrative commands.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential for denial of service by locking resources or executing disruptive commands.
*   **Affected Component:** TiDB Server (Authentication Module)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong client authentication mechanisms *supported by TiDB* (e.g., TLS client certificates, strong passwords with secure storage and transmission, potentially using TiDB's built-in authentication plugins).
    *   Regularly rotate client credentials.
    *   Monitor client connection attempts and unusual activity *within TiDB logs*.
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for client accounts *within TiDB's permission system*.

## Threat: [PD Leader Spoofing/Manipulation](./threats/pd_leader_spoofingmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a non-leader PD (Placement Driver) node or exploits a vulnerability in the PD leader election process *within TiDB* to either spoof the leader or influence the election to install a malicious leader. This could allow the attacker to manipulate cluster metadata, leading to data misplacement, scheduling disruptions, or even data loss.
*   **Impact:** Cluster instability, data corruption, data loss, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** PD (Leader Election Process, Metadata Management)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the network communication between PD nodes *using TiDB's security configurations* (e.g., mutual TLS).
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for inter-PD communication *as configured in TiDB*.
    *   Monitor PD leader elections and the health of PD nodes *using TiDB monitoring tools*.
    *   Isolate the PD cluster on a secure network.

## Threat: [TiKV Peer Spoofing/Man-in-the-Middle](./threats/tikv_peer_spoofingman-in-the-middle.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between TiKV (Key-Value) nodes or spoofs a TiKV peer. This could allow the attacker to inject malicious data, disrupt data replication, or gain access to data being transferred between nodes.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, data inconsistency, denial of service, potential data breach.
*   **Affected Component:** TiKV (Inter-Node Communication)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce secure communication between TiKV nodes *using TiDB's security configurations* (e.g., mutual TLS).
    *   Isolate the TiKV cluster on a secure network.
    *   Implement network segmentation and access controls to limit potential attack surfaces.

## Threat: [Data Corruption via Maliciously Crafted Queries](./threats/data_corruption_via_maliciously_crafted_queries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, with sufficient privileges or by exploiting a vulnerability *within TiDB's query processing engine*, crafts SQL queries that bypass integrity checks or exploit internal TiDB mechanisms to corrupt data within TiKV.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, application malfunction, potential financial loss or reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** TiDB Server (Query Parser, Query Executor), TiKV (Data Storage)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep TiDB updated with the latest security patches.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization at the application layer.
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for database users *within TiDB*.
    *   Regularly back up data and implement data integrity checks.

## Threat: [Metadata Tampering via PD Compromise](./threats/metadata_tampering_via_pd_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a PD node and directly manipulates cluster metadata stored within it. This could lead to incorrect data placement, scheduling issues, or even data loss.
*   **Impact:** Data loss, cluster instability, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** PD (Metadata Storage)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure access to PD nodes with strong authentication and authorization *as configured in TiDB*.
    *   Implement file system permissions to protect PD data directories.
    *   Monitor PD logs for suspicious activity.
    *   Regularly back up PD metadata.

## Threat: [Exploiting TiDB User Management Vulnerabilities (Privilege Escalation)](./threats/exploiting_tidb_user_management_vulnerabilities__privilege_escalation_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in TiDB's user management system to gain higher privileges than initially assigned, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data and administrative functions, potential for data manipulation or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** TiDB Server (User Management, Authorization)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep TiDB updated with the latest security patches.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting database access *within TiDB*.
    *   Regularly review user permissions and roles *within TiDB*.
