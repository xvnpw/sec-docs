# Threat Model Analysis for coredns/coredns

## Threat: [Open Resolver Abuse](./threats/open_resolver_abuse.md)

* **Threat:** Open Resolver Abuse
    * **Description:**
        * **Attacker Action:** An attacker identifies a CoreDNS instance configured as an open resolver.
        * **How:** The attacker sends DNS queries for arbitrary domains to the vulnerable CoreDNS server, which recursively resolves them.
    * **Impact:**
        * The CoreDNS server can be used for DNS amplification attacks (DDoS).
        * The server's resources can be exhausted, causing denial of service for legitimate users.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * `forward` plugin (or similar upstream resolver plugin)
        * CoreDNS configuration
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Configure the `forward` plugin to only allow queries from authorized networks or IP addresses.
        * Implement network-level ACLs to restrict access to the CoreDNS port.
        * Consider using Response Rate Limiting (RRL).

## Threat: [DNS Cache Poisoning](./threats/dns_cache_poisoning.md)

* **Threat:** DNS Cache Poisoning
    * **Description:**
        * **Attacker Action:** An attacker injects false DNS records into the CoreDNS cache.
        * **How:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the DNS protocol or manipulating responses from upstream resolvers (if DNSSEC is not implemented or improperly configured).
    * **Impact:**
        * Users are redirected to malicious websites or services.
        * This can lead to phishing, malware distribution, or other exploitation.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * CoreDNS caching mechanism
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement and enforce DNSSEC validation.
        * Use randomized source ports for DNS queries.
        * Regularly update CoreDNS to patch caching-related vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

* **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion
    * **Description:**
        * **Attacker Action:** An attacker floods the CoreDNS server with a large volume of DNS queries.
        * **How:** Generating a high number of requests, potentially targeting resource-intensive queries or exploiting vulnerabilities in query processing.
    * **Impact:**
        * The CoreDNS server becomes overloaded and unable to respond to legitimate queries, causing service disruption.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * CoreDNS core functionality (query processing)
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement rate limiting.
        * Deploy CoreDNS behind load balancers or use Anycast.
        * Ensure sufficient resources are allocated to the CoreDNS server.

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering](./threats/configuration_tampering.md)

* **Threat:** Configuration Tampering
    * **Description:**
        * **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the CoreDNS configuration (Corefile).
        * **How:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the server's OS, insecure access controls, or compromised credentials.
    * **Impact:**
        * The attacker can modify DNS records, redirect traffic, disable security features, or introduce malicious configurations, leading to various security breaches.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * Corefile
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Securely store and manage the Corefile with appropriate access controls.
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the server.
        * Use version control for the Corefile.
        * Regularly audit configuration changes.

## Threat: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./threats/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Threat:** Plugin Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:**
        * **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits a security vulnerability within a specific CoreDNS plugin.
        * **How:** Sending specially crafted DNS queries or requests that trigger the vulnerability in the plugin's code.
    * **Impact:**
        * Can lead to remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, or other forms of compromise, depending on the vulnerability.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * Specific CoreDNS plugin(s)
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep all CoreDNS plugins updated to the latest versions.
        * Only use trusted and well-maintained plugins.
        * Carefully review the security implications of each plugin before enabling it.
        * Consider disabling unnecessary plugins.
