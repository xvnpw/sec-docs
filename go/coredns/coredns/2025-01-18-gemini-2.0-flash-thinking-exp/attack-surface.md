# Attack Surface Analysis for coredns/coredns

## Attack Surface: [Malformed DNS Queries](./attack_surfaces/malformed_dns_queries.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Malformed DNS Queries
    *   **Description:**  Crafted DNS queries with unexpected formats, lengths, or values designed to exploit parsing vulnerabilities or cause errors *within CoreDNS*.
    *   **How CoreDNS Contributes:** As a DNS server, CoreDNS's core functionality involves parsing and processing incoming DNS queries. Vulnerabilities in *its* parsing logic can be triggered by malformed queries.
    *   **Example:** Sending a query with an excessively long hostname or a malformed record type field that triggers a buffer overflow in CoreDNS's parsing code.
    *   **Impact:**  Denial of service (crashes), resource exhaustion, or potentially remote code execution if a severe parsing vulnerability exists *in CoreDNS*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep CoreDNS updated to the latest version to patch known parsing vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement rate limiting to mitigate query floods that might exploit parsing inefficiencies *in CoreDNS*.

## Attack Surface: [Open Resolver Configuration](./attack_surfaces/open_resolver_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Open Resolver Configuration
    *   **Description:** Configuring CoreDNS to recursively resolve queries for any client on the internet, making *it* an open resolver.
    *   **How CoreDNS Contributes:** CoreDNS's configuration file (Corefile) dictates *its* behavior. Incorrectly configured forwarders or the absence of proper access controls *within CoreDNS* can lead to it acting as an open resolver.
    *   **Example:** A Corefile with a simple `forward . /etc/resolv.conf` without any `acl` plugin *within CoreDNS* to restrict access.
    *   **Impact:**  Being used in DNS amplification attacks, consuming excessive bandwidth *on the CoreDNS server*, and potentially being blacklisted.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Explicitly define allowed client networks using the `acl` plugin in the Corefile.
        *   Avoid using wildcard forwarders (`.`) without strict access controls *within CoreDNS*.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Plugin Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Security flaws present in individual CoreDNS plugins (official or third-party).
    *   **How CoreDNS Contributes:** CoreDNS's modular architecture relies on plugins for extended functionality. Vulnerabilities in *these plugins* directly impact the security of the CoreDNS instance.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a database backend plugin allowing SQL injection through crafted DNS records, or a flaw in a metrics plugin exposing sensitive information *via the plugin*.
    *   **Impact:**  Information disclosure, unauthorized access to backend systems, denial of service, or potentially remote code execution depending on the plugin's functionality and the severity of the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin and vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep all CoreDNS plugins updated to their latest versions.
        *   Carefully evaluate the security of third-party plugins before using them.
        *   Only enable necessary plugins to minimize the attack surface.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization within custom plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Secure Management Interface (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_secure_management_interface__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Lack of Secure Management Interface (If Enabled)
    *   **Description:**  Using insecure methods for managing or monitoring CoreDNS.
    *   **How CoreDNS Contributes:** If management or monitoring plugins are enabled *within CoreDNS*, they might expose interfaces that, if not properly secured, can be exploited.
    *   **Example:**  An HTTP-based management interface *provided by a CoreDNS plugin* without TLS encryption or proper authentication, allowing attackers to intercept credentials or manipulate the configuration.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to CoreDNS configuration, potentially leading to complete compromise of the DNS service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure protocols like HTTPS for management interfaces.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   Restrict access to management interfaces to trusted networks.
