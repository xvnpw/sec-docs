## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Weak Permissions on Corefile

**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Weak Permissions on Corefile**

* **Attack Vector:** The Corefile has overly permissive access rights, allowing unauthorized modification.
* **Impact:** Easy modification of DNS configuration without needing to exploit other vulnerabilities.

**Detailed Analysis:**

**1. Deconstructing the Attack Path:**

* **Attack Vector Breakdown:**  The core issue is that the file system permissions on the `Corefile` (typically located at `/etc/coredns/Corefile` or a similar path depending on the deployment) are set in a way that allows users or processes without the necessary privileges to read, write, or execute it. This deviates from the principle of least privilege.
* **Impact Breakdown:**  The ability to modify the `Corefile` directly grants an attacker significant control over CoreDNS's behavior. This bypasses the intended security mechanisms and allows for immediate and impactful changes to the DNS resolution process.

**2. Detailed Threat Modeling:**

* **Attacker Goals:** An attacker exploiting this vulnerability might aim to:
    * **Redirect Traffic:** Modify DNS records to point legitimate domain names to attacker-controlled servers for phishing, malware distribution, or data exfiltration.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Configure CoreDNS to fail to resolve certain domains or to become unresponsive, disrupting service availability.
    * **Information Gathering:**  Modify logging configurations to capture sensitive DNS queries.
    * **Subvert Security Controls:**  Disable or modify security-related plugins within CoreDNS.
    * **Maintain Persistence:**  Modify the `Corefile` to ensure malicious configurations persist across restarts.
* **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to write to the `Corefile`. This could be achieved through:
    * **Compromised User Account:**  Gaining access to a user account on the system running CoreDNS that has write permissions to the `Corefile`.
    * **Vulnerability in Another Application:** Exploiting a vulnerability in another application running on the same system that allows writing to arbitrary files.
    * **Container Escape:** If CoreDNS is running in a container, escaping the container and gaining access to the host filesystem.
    * **Supply Chain Attack:**  Compromising the build process or deployment pipeline to inject a `Corefile` with weak permissions.

**3. Impact Assessment:**

* **Confidentiality:**  Compromised DNS resolution can lead to the exposure of sensitive information if users are redirected to malicious sites that attempt to steal credentials or other data. Modification of logging can also expose query data.
* **Integrity:**  The integrity of DNS resolution is directly compromised. Users may be directed to incorrect or malicious resources, undermining trust in the application and its services.
* **Availability:**  Attackers can cause denial of service by misconfiguring DNS resolution, making the application or its dependencies unreachable.

**4. Prerequisites Identification:**

* **Overly Permissive File Permissions:** The most critical prerequisite is that the `Corefile` has permissions that allow unauthorized users or processes to modify it. This typically means permissions like `777` or group/owner write permissions granted to overly broad groups/users.
* **Access to the Filesystem:** The attacker needs some level of access to the filesystem where the `Corefile` is located. This could be direct shell access, access through a compromised application, or via container escape.
* **Knowledge of Corefile Syntax:** While not strictly necessary for simple modifications, understanding the `Corefile` syntax allows for more sophisticated and targeted attacks.

**5. Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:**

1. **Gain Access:** The attacker gains access to the system running CoreDNS through a compromised account, a vulnerability in another application, or container escape.
2. **Identify Corefile Location:** The attacker locates the `Corefile`, typically in `/etc/coredns/Corefile` or a similar path.
3. **Verify Permissions:** The attacker checks the file permissions of the `Corefile` using commands like `ls -l`.
4. **Modify Corefile:**  If the permissions are weak, the attacker uses a text editor (e.g., `vi`, `nano`) or command-line tools (e.g., `sed`, `echo`) to modify the `Corefile`. Examples of malicious modifications include:
    * **Redirecting a domain:** Adding or modifying a `forward` or `rewrite` rule to point a legitimate domain to an attacker's IP address.
    * **Introducing a sinkhole:** Configuring a zone to resolve all queries to a non-routable IP address.
    * **Disabling plugins:** Commenting out or removing crucial security plugins.
5. **Restart CoreDNS (if necessary):** Depending on the changes made, the attacker might need to restart the CoreDNS service for the changes to take effect. This could involve commands like `systemctl restart coredns` or sending a `SIGHUP` signal to the CoreDNS process.
6. **Verify Impact:** The attacker verifies that their modifications are working as intended by performing DNS queries.

**Example Malicious Corefile Modification:**

```
. {
    forward . 192.168.1.10  # Original forwarder
    forward example.com 10.0.0.5 # Redirecting example.com to attacker's server
    cache 30
    loop
    reload
    health
}
```

**6. Detection Strategies:**

* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Implement FIM tools (like `AIDE`, `Tripwire`) to monitor changes to the `Corefile`. Any unauthorized modification will trigger an alert.
* **Regular Permission Audits:** Periodically check the permissions of the `Corefile` to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege. Automated scripts can be used for this.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Monitor CoreDNS logs for unusual behavior, such as frequent reloads or errors related to the `Corefile`.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate CoreDNS logs and FIM alerts into a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and correlation.
* **Container Security Scanners:** If running in containers, use container security scanners to identify misconfigurations, including weak file permissions.
* **Behavioral Analysis:** Monitor DNS resolution patterns for unexpected redirections or failures that might indicate a compromised `Corefile`.

**7. Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Restrict File Permissions:**  Set the `Corefile` permissions to the most restrictive possible while still allowing CoreDNS to function correctly. Typically, this means setting the owner to the user running the CoreDNS process and restricting write access to only that user (e.g., `644` or `600`).
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that only the user account running the CoreDNS process has the necessary permissions to access and modify the `Corefile`. Avoid granting broad write permissions to groups or other users.
* **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Consider deploying CoreDNS in an immutable infrastructure where the `Corefile` is part of the read-only image. Any changes would require rebuilding and redeploying the image.
* **Configuration Management:** Use configuration management tools (like Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to manage the `Corefile` and ensure consistent and secure configurations.
* **Secure Deployment Practices:**  Follow secure deployment practices for CoreDNS, including running it with a dedicated, non-privileged user account and limiting network access.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the CoreDNS deployment, including file permissions and configurations.
* **Security Hardening:** Implement other security hardening measures for the system running CoreDNS, such as disabling unnecessary services and keeping the operating system and software up-to-date.

**8. Risk Assessment:**

* **Likelihood:**  The likelihood of this attack path being exploited depends on the current file permissions of the `Corefile` and the overall security posture of the system. If permissions are overly permissive, the likelihood is high, especially if the system is exposed to potential attackers.
* **Severity:** The severity of this attack path is high due to the direct and significant impact on DNS resolution, which can disrupt critical services and lead to various security breaches.

**Conclusion and Recommendations:**

The "Exploit Weak Permissions on Corefile" attack path represents a significant security risk due to its ease of exploitation and the potential for widespread impact. It is crucial for the development team to prioritize mitigating this vulnerability by implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, particularly focusing on restricting file permissions and adhering to the principle of least privilege.
