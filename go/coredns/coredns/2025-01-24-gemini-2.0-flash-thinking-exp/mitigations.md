# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for coredns/coredns

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict CoreDNS Access with ACLs and Internal Binding](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_coredns_access_with_acls_and_internal_binding.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Internal IP Binding:** Configure CoreDNS to listen only on internal network interfaces. This is achieved by modifying the Corefile and specifying the `bind` address to an internal IP address (e.g., `bind 10.0.0.10:53` or `bind :53` for all internal interfaces). This prevents CoreDNS from being accessible on public-facing interfaces, even if network firewalls are misconfigured.
    2.  **Access Control Lists (ACLs) in CoreDNS:**  Utilize the `acl` plugin within the CoreDNS configuration file (Corefile). Define rules within the `acl` block to explicitly permit DNS queries only from trusted source IP addresses or networks. For example, allow queries only from your internal network ranges. This provides a software-level access control within CoreDNS itself, independent of network firewalls, adding a layer of defense.  Example ACL rule: `acl { allow net 10.0.0.0/8 192.168.0.0/16 }`.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **External Exploitation via Direct CoreDNS Access (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from directly querying and potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in CoreDNS if they bypass network-level controls or if CoreDNS is inadvertently exposed.
        *   **Unauthorized DNS Queries from External Sources (Medium Severity):**  Stops unauthorized external entities from using your CoreDNS server for DNS resolution, preventing potential abuse or information leakage.
        *   **Internal Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):**  In case of internal network compromise, ACLs can limit lateral movement by restricting which internal systems can query CoreDNS, hindering attackers from using DNS for reconnaissance or command and control.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **External Exploitation via Direct CoreDNS Access:** High reduction in risk.
        *   **Unauthorized DNS Queries from External Sources:** Medium reduction in risk.
        *   **Internal Lateral Movement:** Medium reduction in risk.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   CoreDNS is configured to bind to the internal network interface (`bind :53`).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   ACLs within CoreDNS configuration using the `acl` plugin are not currently implemented. We are relying solely on network firewalls for access control. Implementing ACLs in CoreDNS would provide an additional layer of defense directly within the DNS server.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Harden CoreDNS Configuration (Disable Unnecessary Plugins)](./mitigation_strategies/harden_coredns_configuration__disable_unnecessary_plugins_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Plugin Inventory in Corefile:** Examine your CoreDNS Corefile and list all currently enabled plugins.
    2.  **Functionality Necessity Review:** For each enabled plugin, critically assess if it is absolutely essential for your application's DNS resolution needs. Consult with development teams to confirm plugin dependencies.
    3.  **Comment Out Unnecessary Plugins:** In the Corefile, comment out or remove the lines that activate plugins that are deemed non-essential. For example, if you don't use Prometheus monitoring, disable the `prometheus` plugin by commenting out its line. Similarly, disable `pprof`, `trace`, or other plugins not actively required.
    4.  **Minimal Corefile Configuration:**  Strive for a Corefile configuration that includes only the bare minimum set of plugins required for your specific DNS service.
    5.  **Functionality Testing Post-Disablement:** After disabling plugins, rigorously test your application's DNS resolution functionality to ensure no critical services are disrupted.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Plugin-Specific Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity):** Reduces the attack surface by eliminating potential vulnerabilities present in plugins that are not actively used.
        *   **Resource Consumption by Unused Features (Low to Medium Severity):** Disabling plugins can decrease CoreDNS's resource footprint (CPU, memory), potentially improving performance and stability, and indirectly mitigating resource exhaustion DoS.
        *   **Corefile Complexity and Auditability (Low Severity):** Simplifies the CoreDNS configuration, making it easier to understand, manage, and audit for potential security misconfigurations.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Plugin-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Medium to High reduction in risk, depending on the nature and severity of potential plugin vulnerabilities.
        *   **Resource Consumption by Unused Features:** Low to Medium reduction in risk.
        *   **Corefile Complexity and Auditability:** Low reduction in direct risk, but improves overall security posture management.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   We have reviewed the default CoreDNS Corefile and removed the `trace` plugin as it was not actively used in production.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   A recent, comprehensive audit of all enabled plugins against our application's precise requirements is lacking. We should perform a detailed review to identify and disable any other plugins that are not strictly necessary, such as `pprof`, `auto`, `file` (if not used for authoritative zones), or other less commonly used plugins.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Harden CoreDNS Configuration (Rate Limiting using `ratelimit` plugin)](./mitigation_strategies/harden_coredns_configuration__rate_limiting_using__ratelimit__plugin_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable `ratelimit` Plugin:** Ensure the `ratelimit` plugin is included and enabled in your CoreDNS Corefile.
    2.  **Define Rate Limits in Corefile:** Configure the `ratelimit` plugin directly within the Corefile to set appropriate limits for DNS queries. This configuration can be tailored based on:
        *   **Source IP Address:** Limit the number of queries per second originating from a specific IP address or network range. Example: `ratelimit ip 100`.
        *   **Query Type:** Limit specific DNS query types that are known to be abused in attacks (e.g., `ANY` queries). Example: `ratelimit qtype ANY 10`.
        *   **Globally:** Set a server-wide rate limit for all incoming queries. Example: `ratelimit global 500`.
        *   **Combinations:** Combine different rate limiting criteria for more granular control.
    3.  **Threshold Calibration:** Determine suitable rate limit thresholds based on your expected legitimate DNS traffic volume and CoreDNS server capacity. Start with conservative limits and monitor performance and logs.
    4.  **Corefile Configuration Syntax:** Add the `ratelimit` plugin block to your Corefile, carefully following the syntax and options documented for the `ratelimit` plugin.
    5.  **Testing and Monitoring of Rate Limiting:** Thoroughly test the rate limiting configuration in a staging environment to verify its effectiveness and ensure it does not inadvertently block legitimate DNS traffic. Continuously monitor CoreDNS logs and metrics for rate limiting events to detect potential attacks or necessary adjustments to the limits.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Targeting CoreDNS (High Severity):**  Effectively mitigates DoS attacks by limiting the rate of incoming queries, preventing malicious actors from overwhelming the CoreDNS server and making it unavailable.
        *   **DNS Amplification Attacks Originating from CoreDNS (Medium Severity):** Reduces the potential for your CoreDNS server to be exploited in DNS amplification attacks against other targets by limiting the volume of responses it can send out in a short timeframe.
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks via DNS (Low to Medium Severity):** Can slow down or hinder brute-force attempts that might leverage DNS for certain attack vectors, such as attempts to discover dynamic DNS records or exploit DNS-based services.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Targeting CoreDNS:** High reduction in risk.
        *   **DNS Amplification Attacks Originating from CoreDNS:** Medium reduction in risk.
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks via DNS:** Low to Medium reduction in risk.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Rate limiting is partially implemented. We have a global rate limit configured using the `ratelimit` plugin in our Corefile to provide basic DoS protection.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   More granular rate limiting based on source IP address or query type is not yet implemented. We should consider implementing source IP-based rate limiting to enhance protection against targeted DoS attacks from specific sources.  Furthermore, the current global rate limit needs to be fine-tuned based on detailed traffic analysis to ensure it is optimally effective without negatively impacting legitimate DNS traffic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Updates and Patching of CoreDNS](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_updates_and_patching_of_coredns.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **CoreDNS Security Monitoring:** Actively subscribe to the official CoreDNS security mailing list and regularly monitor the CoreDNS project's security advisories published on GitHub or the official CoreDNS website.
    2.  **CoreDNS Vulnerability Assessment:** Periodically check for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities that affect the specific version of CoreDNS and its plugins currently deployed in your environment. Utilize vulnerability scanners or consult vulnerability databases if available to automate this process.
    3.  **Establish CoreDNS Patching Schedule:** Define and adhere to a clear schedule for applying security patches and updates released by the CoreDNS project. Prioritize critical security updates and aim for rapid patching, ideally within days or weeks of their release.
    4.  **CoreDNS Update Procedure with Testing:** Establish a well-defined procedure for updating CoreDNS. This procedure must include thorough testing in a staging or pre-production environment before deploying updates to the production CoreDNS infrastructure. This ensures stability and prevents unintended disruptions.
    5.  **Automated CoreDNS Updates (Consideration with Caution):** Explore the feasibility of automating CoreDNS updates using package managers, container image updates, or other automation tools. If automation is implemented, ensure robust testing and rollback mechanisms are in place to mitigate risks associated with automated updates.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known CoreDNS Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Directly mitigates the risk of attackers exploiting publicly known security vulnerabilities present in the CoreDNS software itself or its plugins.
        *   **Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploitation Window Reduction (Medium Severity):** While not preventing zero-day exploits, timely patching significantly reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities before patches are applied.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known CoreDNS Vulnerabilities:** High reduction in risk.
        *   **Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploitation Window Reduction:** Medium reduction in risk (reduces the time window of potential exposure).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   We are subscribed to the CoreDNS security mailing list and receive notifications regarding security advisories.
        *   We have a documented procedure for updating CoreDNS, which includes testing in a staging environment before production deployment.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Automated vulnerability scanning specifically for CoreDNS and its plugins is not currently implemented. We primarily rely on manual monitoring of security advisories.
        *   The CoreDNS patching schedule is not strictly proactive or enforced. Patching is generally reactive, triggered by security advisories. Implementing a proactive, scheduled patching cycle would be a more robust security practice.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitoring and Logging (Detailed Logging via `log` plugin)](./mitigation_strategies/monitoring_and_logging__detailed_logging_via__log__plugin_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable `log` Plugin in Corefile:** Verify that the `log` plugin is enabled and correctly configured in your CoreDNS Corefile.
    2.  **Set Detailed Log Level:** Configure the `log` plugin to use a sufficiently detailed log level. For security monitoring purposes, setting the log level to `info` or even `debug` can be beneficial to capture a wider range of security-relevant events.
    3.  **Comprehensive Log Format Configuration:** Customize the log format within the `log` plugin configuration to include all relevant information necessary for security analysis. This should include, at minimum: timestamp, source IP address of the DNS query, query type, queried domain name, DNS response code, and any error messages generated by CoreDNS.
    4.  **Secure and Reliable Log Destination:** Configure CoreDNS to send its logs to a secure and reliable logging system. Options include:
        *   **Local Files (with Security Measures):** Write logs to local files on the CoreDNS server, ensuring proper file rotation, access controls (restrict read access to authorized personnel), and secure storage.
        *   **Syslog:** Utilize the syslog protocol to forward logs to a centralized syslog server.
        *   **Centralized Logging Platform (SIEM Integration):** Integrate CoreDNS logging with a centralized logging platform or Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Splunk, etc.). This enables centralized security monitoring, anomaly detection, and alerting.
    5.  **Log Retention Policy:** Define a clear log retention policy that balances security requirements with storage capacity limitations. Retain logs for a sufficient duration to facilitate thorough incident investigation, security auditing, and compliance requirements.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Delayed Security Incident Detection (High Severity):** Detailed logging significantly improves the ability to promptly detect security incidents, active attacks, and configuration errors affecting CoreDNS.
        *   **Insufficient Forensic Information for Incident Response (Medium Severity):** Provides the necessary data for comprehensive post-incident analysis, enabling a deeper understanding of attack vectors, attacker techniques, and facilitating improvements to the overall security posture.
        *   **Operational Issue Diagnosis (Low to Medium Severity):** Logs are invaluable for diagnosing operational problems, identifying performance bottlenecks within CoreDNS, and troubleshooting configuration errors that may impact service availability or security.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Delayed Security Incident Detection:** High reduction in risk.
        *   **Insufficient Forensic Information for Incident Response:** Medium reduction in risk.
        *   **Operational Issue Diagnosis:** Low to Medium reduction in risk.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   The `log` plugin is enabled in our Corefile.
        *   Logs are currently written to local files and rotated daily.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The current log level is set to a minimal level, which may not capture all security-relevant events. We should increase the log level to `info` or `debug` to enhance security logging.
        *   Integration of CoreDNS logs with a centralized logging system or SIEM is not yet implemented. Centralized logging would significantly improve security monitoring capabilities, enable proactive threat detection, and streamline incident response workflows.
