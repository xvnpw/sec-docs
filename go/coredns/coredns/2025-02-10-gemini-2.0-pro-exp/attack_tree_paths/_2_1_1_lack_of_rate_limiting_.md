# Deep Analysis: CoreDNS Cache Poisoning via Lack of Rate Limiting

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack vector described as "2.1.1 Lack of Rate Limiting" within the context of a CoreDNS-based DNS resolver.  We aim to understand:

*   The precise mechanisms by which a lack of rate limiting facilitates cache poisoning.
*   The specific configurations and conditions in CoreDNS that make this attack feasible.
*   The potential impact of a successful attack on the application and its users.
*   Effective mitigation strategies and best practices to prevent this vulnerability.
*   How to detect this type of attack.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   **CoreDNS:**  The analysis centers on the CoreDNS DNS server software (https://github.com/coredns/coredns).  While the general principles of DNS cache poisoning apply broadly, we will examine CoreDNS-specific features, plugins, and configurations.
*   **Cache Poisoning:** The primary attack type under consideration is DNS cache poisoning, specifically exploiting the `cache` plugin.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  The core vulnerability is the absence or inadequacy of rate limiting mechanisms within CoreDNS.
*   **Non-Existent Subdomains:** The attack vector involves querying for a large number of non-existent subdomains.
*   **Impact on Application:** We will consider the impact on an application relying on the compromised CoreDNS resolver.

This analysis *excludes*:

*   Other DNS server software (e.g., BIND, Unbound).
*   Other types of DNS attacks (e.g., DDoS, reflection attacks) *except* as they relate to facilitating cache poisoning.
*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system or network infrastructure, *except* as they directly impact CoreDNS's ability to rate limit.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Technical Background:**  Establish a clear understanding of DNS cache poisoning, the role of the CoreDNS `cache` plugin, and the concept of rate limiting.
2.  **Attack Scenario Walkthrough:**  Detail a step-by-step scenario of how an attacker could exploit the lack of rate limiting to poison the CoreDNS cache.
3.  **CoreDNS Configuration Analysis:**  Examine relevant CoreDNS configuration options (Corefile) and plugin interactions that influence rate limiting and cache behavior.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Analyze the potential consequences of a successful attack, including traffic redirection, data interception, and service disruption.
5.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Recommend specific CoreDNS configurations, plugins, and operational practices to mitigate the vulnerability.
6.  **Detection Methods:**  Describe techniques for identifying this type of attack through log analysis, traffic monitoring, and other security measures.
7.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  If we had access to the CoreDNS source code, we would outline areas to examine for potential vulnerabilities related to rate limiting and cache management.  Since we don't, we'll focus on configuration and plugin interactions.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1.1 Lack of Rate Limiting

### 2.1 Technical Background

*   **DNS Cache Poisoning:**  This attack involves injecting forged DNS records into a DNS resolver's cache.  When a client queries the resolver for a legitimate domain, the resolver returns the attacker's malicious record instead of the correct one.  This can redirect the client to a malicious server controlled by the attacker.
*   **CoreDNS `cache` Plugin:**  The `cache` plugin in CoreDNS is responsible for caching DNS responses to improve performance.  It stores successful responses (positive cache) and, optionally, negative responses (NXDOMAIN, SERVFAIL, etc. - negative cache).  The cache has a Time-To-Live (TTL) associated with each entry, after which the entry is considered stale and removed.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a client (or IP address) can make within a specific time window.  In the context of DNS, it limits the number of queries a resolver will process from a single source.  This is a crucial defense against various attacks, including cache poisoning.
* **Non-Existent Subdomains and Cache Exhaustion:** By querying many non-existent subdomains, an attacker can fill the cache with negative responses (NXDOMAIN).  This "cache exhaustion" reduces the space available for legitimate entries and increases the likelihood that a forged response for a *different* domain will be accepted, especially if the attacker can time their forged response to arrive just as the legitimate entry's TTL expires.

### 2.2 Attack Scenario Walkthrough

1.  **Attacker Setup:** The attacker identifies a CoreDNS server that is publicly accessible and lacks adequate rate limiting.  They also control a malicious DNS server.
2.  **Cache Exhaustion:** The attacker sends a flood of DNS queries to the target CoreDNS server.  These queries are for a large number of non-existent subdomains of a target domain (e.g., `random1.example.com`, `random2.example.com`, `random3.example.com`, ...).  The lack of rate limiting allows these queries to be processed.
3.  **Legitimate Query:** A legitimate client queries the CoreDNS server for the *actual* domain `example.com`.
4.  **Cache Miss (Potentially):**  Because the cache is filled with NXDOMAIN responses for the non-existent subdomains, there's a higher chance that the legitimate `example.com` entry is either not present or has a very short remaining TTL.
5.  **Upstream Query:** CoreDNS, not finding `example.com` in its cache (or finding a stale entry), forwards the query to the authoritative DNS server for `example.com`.
6.  **Attacker Interception:** The attacker, through various techniques (e.g., DNS spoofing, timing attacks), intercepts the legitimate response from the authoritative server.
7.  **Forged Response:** The attacker sends a forged DNS response to the CoreDNS server, claiming to be the authoritative server for `example.com`.  This forged response contains the attacker's malicious IP address.
8.  **Cache Poisoning:** CoreDNS, believing the forged response is legitimate, caches it.  The lack of rate limiting has made this easier by exhausting the cache and increasing the window of opportunity for the forged response to be accepted.
9.  **Redirection:** Subsequent clients querying for `example.com` will receive the attacker's malicious IP address from the poisoned cache, redirecting them to the attacker's server.

### 2.3 CoreDNS Configuration Analysis

The CoreDNS `Corefile` is the central configuration file.  Here's how various plugins and settings relate to this attack:

*   **`cache` Plugin:**
    *   `prefetch`:  This option can *exacerbate* the problem.  If `prefetch` is enabled, CoreDNS will proactively refresh entries nearing their TTL expiration.  An attacker can use this to their advantage by timing their forged response to coincide with a prefetch attempt.
    *   `serve_stale`:  If enabled, CoreDNS will serve stale entries while refreshing them in the background.  This can also increase the attack window.
    *   `denial`: Controls caching of negative responses (NXDOMAIN, etc.).  A large `denial` cache can be filled by the attacker's queries for non-existent subdomains.
    *   `success`: Controls caching of positive responses.
    *   `min_ttl` and `max_ttl`: These settings can override the TTLs provided by authoritative servers.  Careless configuration here can impact cache effectiveness and vulnerability.

*   **`ratelimit` Plugin (Crucial Mitigation):**
    *   This plugin is *essential* for preventing this attack.  It allows you to limit the number of queries per second from a given source (IP address or CIDR block).
    *   `zone`: Specifies the zone to which the rate limit applies.
    *   `rate`: The maximum number of queries per second.
    *   `window`: The time window over which the rate is measured.
    *   `whitelist` and `blacklist`: Allow for exceptions to the rate limiting rules.

*   **`hosts` Plugin:**  If used, it's important to ensure that the `hosts` file itself is not vulnerable to modification.

*   **`forward` Plugin:**  The configuration of upstream resolvers can impact the attack.  Using DNSSEC-validating resolvers upstream can help, but doesn't fully mitigate the cache poisoning risk on the CoreDNS server itself.

* **`log` and `errors` Plugins:** Proper logging is crucial for detection.

**Example Vulnerable Corefile (Illustrative):**

```
. {
    forward . 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
    cache 30 {
        prefetch 10 1m
        denial 9984 30
    }
    log
    errors
}
```

This configuration is vulnerable because it lacks the `ratelimit` plugin.  The `prefetch` setting could make the attack slightly easier.

**Example Mitigated Corefile:**

```
. {
    forward . 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
    cache 30 {
        denial 9984 30
    }
    ratelimit example.com 10 1s  # Limit queries for example.com to 10/second
    log
    errors
}
```

This configuration adds a `ratelimit` for the `example.com` zone, significantly reducing the risk.  A more robust configuration might rate-limit *all* zones or use a global rate limit.

### 2.4 Impact Assessment

A successful cache poisoning attack can have severe consequences:

*   **Traffic Redirection:** Users attempting to access legitimate websites are redirected to malicious sites controlled by the attacker.
*   **Data Interception:** The attacker can intercept sensitive data, such as login credentials, financial information, and personal data.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker's server can serve malware to unsuspecting users.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** The attacker can position themselves between the user and the legitimate service, intercepting and modifying communications.
*   **Service Disruption:** The attacker can disrupt access to legitimate services by poisoning DNS records with incorrect or non-routable IP addresses.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  The organization operating the compromised DNS resolver can suffer significant reputational damage.

### 2.5 Mitigation Strategies

The primary mitigation is to implement rate limiting:

1.  **`ratelimit` Plugin:**  Use the `ratelimit` plugin in your Corefile.  Configure it with appropriate `rate` and `window` values.  Consider rate-limiting all zones or using a global rate limit.  Start with a conservative rate and adjust based on monitoring.
2.  **Reasonable Cache Sizes:**  Configure the `cache` plugin with reasonable sizes for both `success` and `denial` caches.  Avoid excessively large caches that can be easily exhausted.
3.  **Disable `prefetch` (or Use Carefully):**  If `prefetch` is used, ensure that rate limiting is in place to prevent attackers from exploiting it.  Consider disabling `prefetch` if it's not strictly necessary.
4.  **Disable `serve_stale` (or Use Carefully):** Similar to prefetch, be cautious with `serve_stale`.
5.  **DNSSEC:**  While DNSSEC doesn't directly prevent cache poisoning on the *resolver*, it does prevent the attacker from forging responses from authoritative servers that support DNSSEC.  Use a DNSSEC-validating upstream resolver in your `forward` plugin configuration.
6.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Regularly review your CoreDNS configuration and security posture.
7.  **Keep CoreDNS Updated:**  Ensure you are running the latest version of CoreDNS to benefit from security patches and improvements.
8.  **Network Segmentation:**  Consider placing your CoreDNS resolver in a separate network segment to limit the impact of a compromise.
9. **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy network-based or host-based IDS/IPS solutions that can detect and potentially block DNS cache poisoning attempts.

### 2.6 Detection Methods

Detecting cache poisoning can be challenging, but here are some techniques:

1.  **Log Analysis:**  Enable detailed logging in CoreDNS (`log` plugin).  Look for:
    *   High volumes of queries for non-existent subdomains.
    *   Sudden spikes in NXDOMAIN responses.
    *   Queries from unusual or unexpected IP addresses.
    *   Rate limit violations (if the `ratelimit` plugin is used and configured to log).
2.  **Traffic Monitoring:**  Monitor DNS traffic for:
    *   Anomalous query patterns.
    *   High volumes of DNS traffic from specific sources.
    *   Responses with unexpected TTL values.
3.  **Cache Inspection (Advanced):**  It's possible to inspect the CoreDNS cache directly, although this is typically not done in real-time.  Tools or scripts could be developed to periodically dump the cache and analyze it for suspicious entries.  This is a more complex approach.
4.  **DNS Monitoring Services:**  Use external DNS monitoring services that can detect discrepancies between your expected DNS records and what is being returned by your resolvers.
5.  **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate CoreDNS logs with a SIEM system to correlate DNS events with other security events and identify potential attacks.
6. **Honeypots:** Deploy DNS honeypots to attract and detect malicious DNS activity.

### 2.7 Hypothetical Code Review Areas

If we had access to the CoreDNS source code, we would focus on these areas:

*   **`cache` Plugin Implementation:**
    *   Examine the cache eviction logic to ensure it's not susceptible to manipulation.
    *   Review the handling of TTLs and how they are enforced.
    *   Look for potential race conditions or other concurrency issues that could be exploited.
*   **`ratelimit` Plugin Implementation:**
    *   Verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the rate limiting algorithm.
    *   Ensure that rate limits are enforced consistently across different request types and scenarios.
    *   Check for potential bypasses or vulnerabilities in the rate limiting logic.
*   **Input Validation:**  Ensure that all DNS queries and responses are properly validated to prevent injection of malicious data.
*   **Error Handling:**  Review how errors are handled, particularly in the context of cache operations and rate limiting.

## 3. Conclusion

The lack of rate limiting in CoreDNS is a significant vulnerability that can facilitate cache poisoning attacks.  By sending a flood of queries for non-existent subdomains, an attacker can exhaust the cache and increase the chances of successfully injecting forged DNS records.  The primary mitigation is to implement the `ratelimit` plugin and configure it appropriately.  Other mitigations, such as DNSSEC and careful cache configuration, also play important roles.  Detecting cache poisoning requires a combination of log analysis, traffic monitoring, and potentially more advanced techniques like cache inspection.  Regular security audits and keeping CoreDNS updated are crucial for maintaining a secure DNS infrastructure.
