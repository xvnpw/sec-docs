# Deep Analysis of CoreDNS Attack Tree Path: [2.4.1 Missing ACLs]

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the security implications of missing Access Control Lists (ACLs) in a CoreDNS deployment.  We aim to understand the specific vulnerabilities introduced, the potential attack vectors, the likelihood and impact of exploitation, and to propose concrete mitigation strategies.  This analysis will inform development and operational practices to enhance the security posture of the application relying on CoreDNS.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the **absence of ACL configuration** within CoreDNS, as described in attack tree path [2.4.1].  It considers:

*   **CoreDNS Configuration:**  How CoreDNS is configured (or *not* configured) with respect to client access restrictions.  This includes examining the `Corefile` and any relevant environment variables or configuration files.
*   **Network Environment:** The network context in which CoreDNS operates.  Is it exposed to the public internet, an internal network, or a segmented network?  What are the existing network-level security controls (firewalls, etc.)?
*   **Client Types:** The types of clients expected to interact with CoreDNS.  Are they trusted internal services, external users, or potentially malicious actors?
*   **Data Sensitivity:** The sensitivity of the DNS data managed by CoreDNS.  Does it resolve internal-only hostnames, sensitive service discovery information, or publicly available records?
*   **Impact on Application:** How a compromised CoreDNS instance (due to missing ACLs) could impact the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the application it serves.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other CoreDNS vulnerabilities unrelated to ACLs (e.g., vulnerabilities in specific plugins).
*   General network security best practices *outside* the direct context of CoreDNS ACL configuration.
*   Application-level vulnerabilities that are independent of CoreDNS.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Configuration Review:**  Examine example `Corefile` configurations, both with and without ACLs, to understand the syntax and implementation details.  This will involve consulting the official CoreDNS documentation.
2.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify potential attack scenarios that exploit the absence of ACLs.  This will consider various attacker motivations and capabilities.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Assess the specific vulnerabilities that arise from missing ACLs, including the potential for information disclosure, denial of service, and DNS poisoning/spoofing.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the potential impact of successful attacks on the application and its users, considering confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  Propose concrete and actionable steps to mitigate the identified risks, including specific CoreDNS configuration changes and complementary security measures.
6.  **Detection Strategy:** Outline methods for detecting attempts to exploit missing ACLs, including network monitoring and log analysis.

### 4.1. Configuration Review

The core of the issue lies in the `Corefile` configuration.  Without explicit ACLs, CoreDNS defaults to allowing queries from *any* client.  Here's a comparison:

**Vulnerable Configuration (No ACLs):**

```
.:53 {
    forward . 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
    log
    errors
}
```

This configuration forwards all queries to Google's public DNS servers, but it doesn't restrict *who* can send those queries.

**Secure Configuration (With ACLs - Example using `whoami` and `acl` plugins):**

```
.:53 {
    whoami
    acl {
        allow net 192.168.1.0/24  # Allow queries from this subnet
        block net 0.0.0.0/0        # Block everything else (explicit deny)
    }
    forward . 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 {
        policy sequential
    }
    log
    errors
}
```

This configuration uses the `acl` plugin (which needs to be enabled during CoreDNS compilation or installation) to restrict access to clients within the `192.168.1.0/24` subnet.  The `whoami` plugin is useful for debugging and testing ACLs.  The `block net 0.0.0.0/0` line is crucial; it acts as a default deny rule.  Without it, any network *not* explicitly allowed would still be permitted.

**Key Configuration Points:**

*   **`acl` Plugin:**  This is the primary plugin for implementing ACLs in CoreDNS.  It allows defining rules based on IP addresses and CIDR blocks.
*   **`allow` and `block` Directives:**  These directives within the `acl` block specify which networks are permitted or denied access.
*   **Order Matters:**  The order of `allow` and `block` directives is significant.  CoreDNS evaluates them sequentially.  A general best practice is to have specific `allow` rules followed by a broad `block` rule.
*   **Default Behavior:**  Crucially, CoreDNS's default behavior is to *allow* access if no ACLs are configured.  This is a "secure by default" *failure*.

### 4.2. Threat Modeling

Without ACLs, several attack scenarios become possible:

*   **Information Gathering:** An attacker can query the CoreDNS server to discover internal hostnames and IP addresses.  This reconnaissance can reveal details about the internal network structure, services, and potential vulnerabilities.  Even if the CoreDNS server only forwards to public resolvers, the *pattern* of queries can leak information.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can flood the CoreDNS server with a large volume of requests, overwhelming its resources and preventing legitimate clients from resolving DNS queries.  This can disrupt the application's availability.
*   **DNS Spoofing/Poisoning (Indirect):** While missing ACLs don't *directly* enable DNS spoofing, they make it easier for an attacker to *probe* the server and potentially identify vulnerabilities in other plugins or configurations that *could* be exploited for spoofing.  For example, if the attacker can send crafted queries, they might be able to trigger a cache poisoning vulnerability if one exists.
*   **Amplification Attacks:**  An attacker can use the CoreDNS server as an amplifier in a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack against a third party.  They send small queries with spoofed source IP addresses (the victim's IP), and the CoreDNS server sends larger responses to the victim, amplifying the attack traffic.
* **Data Exfiltration (Unlikely but Possible):** In very specific and unusual scenarios, if the CoreDNS server is misconfigured or has vulnerabilities in logging or other plugins, an attacker *might* be able to exfiltrate data through specially crafted DNS queries. This is less likely than the other scenarios.

### 4.3. Vulnerability Analysis

The primary vulnerability is the **lack of authorization checks** for incoming DNS queries.  This leads to:

*   **Unauthorized Access:**  Any client, regardless of its origin or intent, can interact with the CoreDNS server.
*   **Increased Attack Surface:**  The absence of restrictions exposes the server to a wider range of potential attacks.
*   **Violation of Least Privilege:**  The principle of least privilege dictates that systems should only have the minimum necessary access.  Missing ACLs violate this principle by granting excessive access to all clients.

### 4.4. Impact Assessment

The impact of exploiting missing ACLs can range from medium to high, depending on the specific attack and the application's context:

*   **Confidentiality:**  Internal network information can be leaked, potentially aiding further attacks.
*   **Integrity:**  While direct DNS spoofing is less likely, the potential for it (if other vulnerabilities exist) can compromise the integrity of DNS responses, leading to misdirection of traffic.
*   **Availability:**  DoS attacks can disrupt the application's availability, making it inaccessible to legitimate users.  Amplification attacks can impact third parties.

### 4.5. Mitigation Recommendations

The primary mitigation is to **implement ACLs using the `acl` plugin** in CoreDNS.  Here are specific recommendations:

1.  **Enable the `acl` Plugin:** Ensure the `acl` plugin is included in your CoreDNS build or installation.
2.  **Define Specific `allow` Rules:**  Identify the specific IP addresses or CIDR blocks that *should* be allowed to query CoreDNS.  These should be as restrictive as possible, following the principle of least privilege.
3.  **Implement a Default `block` Rule:**  Always include a `block net 0.0.0.0/0` rule (or a similarly broad block rule) *after* your `allow` rules.  This ensures that any client not explicitly allowed is denied access.
4.  **Regularly Review and Update ACLs:**  As your network and application evolve, review and update your ACLs to ensure they remain accurate and effective.
5.  **Network Segmentation:**  Consider placing CoreDNS within a segmented network, limiting its exposure to potentially malicious clients.  Use firewalls to further restrict access.
6.  **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting (using the `ratelimit` plugin or external tools) to mitigate DoS attacks.
7. **Monitor and test:** After implementing ACL, test it from allowed and blocked networks.

### 4.6. Detection Strategy

Detecting attempts to exploit missing ACLs involves:

*   **Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitor DNS traffic to and from the CoreDNS server.  Look for:
    *   Queries from unexpected or unauthorized IP addresses.
    *   High volumes of queries from a single source (potential DoS).
    *   Unusual query patterns (e.g., attempts to resolve internal hostnames from external sources).
*   **Log Analysis:**  Enable CoreDNS logging (using the `log` plugin) and analyze the logs for:
    *   Errors related to ACL processing (if the `acl` plugin is misconfigured).
    *   Records of queries from unauthorized clients (if ACLs are partially implemented or bypassed).
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Configure your IDS/IPS to detect and potentially block malicious DNS traffic, including known attack patterns.
* **Regular security audits:** Perform regular security audits of CoreDNS configuration.

## 5. Conclusion

Missing ACLs in CoreDNS represent a significant security risk, allowing unauthorized access and increasing the attack surface.  Implementing ACLs using the `acl` plugin, along with network segmentation, rate limiting, and robust monitoring, is crucial for mitigating this risk and ensuring the security and availability of applications relying on CoreDNS.  The "secure by default" failure of CoreDNS necessitates proactive configuration to enforce access control.
