# Deep Analysis of CoreDNS Cache Poisoning Attack Path

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Cache Poisoning" attack path (identified as 2.1 in the broader attack tree) against a CoreDNS deployment.  This includes identifying specific vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, potential impacts, and effective mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to harden the application against this class of attack.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the CoreDNS cache poisoning vulnerability.  It encompasses:

*   **CoreDNS Configuration:**  Examining default configurations, common misconfigurations, and specific plugin interactions that could increase susceptibility to cache poisoning.
*   **Network Environment:**  Considering the network context in which CoreDNS operates, including the presence of upstream resolvers, client configurations, and network security controls.
*   **Exploitation Techniques:**  Detailing known and theoretical methods for injecting malicious DNS records into the CoreDNS cache.
*   **Impact Assessment:**  Quantifying the potential damage resulting from successful cache poisoning, including traffic redirection, data exfiltration, and service disruption.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Recommending specific, practical steps to prevent or mitigate cache poisoning attacks, including configuration changes, plugin selection, and external security measures.

This analysis *excludes* other attack vectors against CoreDNS (e.g., denial-of-service attacks targeting the server itself, vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system) unless they directly contribute to the feasibility or impact of cache poisoning.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ a combination of the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Examining the CoreDNS source code (from the provided GitHub repository: https://github.com/coredns/coredns) for potential vulnerabilities related to cache handling, input validation, and response processing.  This includes reviewing relevant plugins.
*   **Documentation Review:**  Analyzing the official CoreDNS documentation, including best practices, security recommendations, and known limitations.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  Investigating publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) and exploit reports related to CoreDNS cache poisoning.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Applying threat modeling principles to identify potential attack scenarios and assess their likelihood and impact.
*   **Experimental Testing (Optional/Future):**  If feasible and within ethical boundaries, conducting controlled experiments in a sandboxed environment to simulate cache poisoning attacks and validate mitigation strategies.  This would require explicit authorization.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Path: Cache Poisoning (2.1)

### 4.1.  Understanding CoreDNS Caching

CoreDNS, like most DNS servers, employs caching to improve performance and reduce load on authoritative DNS servers.  When CoreDNS receives a query, it first checks its cache.  If a valid (non-expired) record exists, it returns the cached response.  If not, it forwards the query to an upstream resolver (or performs recursive resolution itself), caches the response, and then returns it to the client.

The cache is typically an in-memory data structure, although plugins can provide alternative caching mechanisms.  Cache entries have a Time-To-Live (TTL) value, dictated by the authoritative DNS server, which determines how long the record remains valid.

### 4.2.  Exploitation Techniques

Several techniques can be used to poison the CoreDNS cache:

*   **Classic DNS Cache Poisoning (Kaminsky Attack & Variants):**  This involves flooding the CoreDNS server with forged DNS responses for a specific domain.  The attacker attempts to guess the transaction ID (TXID) of a pending DNS query.  If the attacker's forged response with the correct TXID arrives before the legitimate response, the forged record is cached.  Modern DNS implementations, including CoreDNS, employ TXID randomization and source port randomization to mitigate this attack, but it's not entirely eliminated.  The attack is more effective if the attacker can trigger CoreDNS to make a recursive query for the target domain.

*   **Bait-and-Switch Attacks:**  The attacker controls a malicious DNS server.  They configure this server to initially return a legitimate record with a short TTL.  Once CoreDNS caches this record, the attacker changes the record on their server to point to a malicious IP address.  When the short TTL expires, CoreDNS will re-query the attacker's server and cache the malicious record.

*   **Vulnerabilities in Specific Plugins:**  Certain CoreDNS plugins, particularly those handling dynamic updates or interacting with external data sources, might have vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to inject arbitrary records into the cache.  This requires careful code review of each plugin used.  For example, a plugin that reads DNS records from a file or database without proper input validation could be vulnerable.

*   **Exploiting Weak Upstream Resolvers:** If CoreDNS is configured to forward queries to a vulnerable or compromised upstream resolver, that resolver could be poisoned, and CoreDNS would then cache the poisoned responses.  This highlights the importance of securing the entire DNS resolution chain.

* **Birthday attack on TXID:** Although TXID is randomized, it is still only 16-bit number. Attacker can send multiple requests, and with enough requests, there is a high probability that one of the forged responses will match the TXID.

### 4.3.  Impact Assessment

Successful cache poisoning can have severe consequences:

*   **Traffic Redirection:**  Users attempting to access legitimate websites or services can be redirected to malicious sites controlled by the attacker.  This can lead to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or credential theft.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:**  The attacker can intercept and modify traffic between the user and the intended destination, potentially stealing sensitive data or injecting malicious content.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  The attacker can redirect DNS queries for specific domains (e.g., those used for data uploads or API calls) to their own servers, capturing sensitive data.
*   **Service Disruption:**  By poisoning DNS records for critical services, the attacker can disrupt access to those services, causing denial-of-service conditions.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  If users experience security incidents due to cache poisoning, it can severely damage the reputation of the organization running the CoreDNS server.

### 4.4.  Mitigation Strategies

*   **DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions):**  This is the *most robust* defense against cache poisoning.  DNSSEC provides cryptographic signatures for DNS records, allowing resolvers to verify the authenticity and integrity of the data.  CoreDNS supports DNSSEC validation.  Enabling DNSSEC validation in CoreDNS *and* ensuring that the queried domains are DNSSEC-signed is crucial.

*   **0x20-bit Encoding (RFC Draft):** This technique uses case randomization in the query name to add entropy, making it harder for attackers to forge responses. While not a complete solution, it increases the difficulty of cache poisoning attacks. CoreDNS supports this.

*   **Source Port Randomization:**  CoreDNS should use random source ports for outgoing queries.  This makes it significantly harder for attackers to predict the correct source port and TXID combination.  This is generally enabled by default in modern operating systems and CoreDNS.

*   **Limit Recursion:**  If CoreDNS is not intended to be a public recursive resolver, disable recursion or restrict it to trusted clients.  This reduces the attack surface by limiting the domains for which CoreDNS will perform recursive lookups. Use the `forward` plugin carefully, and consider using `policy` to restrict which domains are forwarded.

*   **Secure Upstream Resolvers:**  If CoreDNS forwards queries to upstream resolvers, ensure those resolvers are secure, reputable, and also implement DNSSEC validation.  Consider using well-known public resolvers with strong security practices (e.g., Google Public DNS, Cloudflare DNS) if appropriate.

*   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to mitigate the impact of flooding attacks.  CoreDNS has plugins like `ratelimit` that can help.  This can prevent an attacker from sending a large number of forged responses in a short period.

*   **Cache TTL Management:**  Consider using shorter TTLs for sensitive domains, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers.  However, balance this with the performance impact of more frequent DNS lookups.  The `cache` plugin allows for TTL configuration.

*   **Plugin Security Audits:**  Thoroughly review the security of any plugins used in the CoreDNS configuration, particularly those handling dynamic updates or external data sources.  Look for input validation vulnerabilities and potential injection points.

*   **Regular Updates:**  Keep CoreDNS and all its plugins updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches and improvements.

*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement monitoring to detect unusual DNS query patterns or cache anomalies that might indicate a cache poisoning attack.  This could involve analyzing query logs or using intrusion detection systems.

* **Use `cache` plugin with `denial` option:** This option allows caching of NXDOMAIN and other negative responses, which can help mitigate some cache poisoning attacks.

* **Avoid `hosts` plugin for critical records:** The `hosts` plugin can be easily manipulated if the server is compromised.

## 5. Recommendations

1.  **Enable DNSSEC Validation:** This is the highest priority recommendation. Configure CoreDNS to validate DNSSEC signatures and ensure that the relevant domains are DNSSEC-signed.
2.  **Enable 0x20-bit Encoding:** This provides an additional layer of defense.
3.  **Restrict Recursion:** If CoreDNS is not a public resolver, disable or limit recursion.
4.  **Secure Upstream Resolvers:** Use trusted and secure upstream resolvers that also implement DNSSEC.
5.  **Implement Rate Limiting:** Use the `ratelimit` plugin to mitigate flooding attacks.
6.  **Regularly Audit Plugins:** Conduct security reviews of all used plugins.
7.  **Keep CoreDNS Updated:** Apply security updates promptly.
8.  **Implement Monitoring:** Monitor DNS traffic and cache behavior for anomalies.
9. **Use `cache` plugin with `denial` option.**
10. **Avoid using `hosts` plugin for critical records.**

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of cache poisoning attacks against their CoreDNS deployment and protect their users from the associated threats.
