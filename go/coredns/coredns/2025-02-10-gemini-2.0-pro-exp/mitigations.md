# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for coredns/coredns

## Mitigation Strategy: [DNSSEC Validation with `dnssec` Plugin](./mitigation_strategies/dnssec_validation_with__dnssec__plugin.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable the `dnssec` plugin:** In the Corefile, add the `dnssec` plugin to the relevant server block(s).  This is typically done *before* any forwarding or caching plugins.
    2.  **Configure Trust Anchors:** Obtain the trust anchors (public keys) for the root zone and any other zones you want to validate.  Specify these directly in the Corefile or use a separate file.
    3.  **(Optional) Configure `policy`:** Customize the validation policy if needed (e.g., for specific key rollover scenarios).
    4.  **Test Validation:** Use tools like `dig +dnssec` to verify that DNSSEC validation is working.  Check for the `ad` flag.
    5.  **Monitor Logs:** Regularly monitor CoreDNS logs for DNSSEC validation errors.
    6.  **Key Rollover Process:** Establish a process for handling key rollovers.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cache Poisoning:** (Severity: **Critical**)
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (related to DNS):** (Severity: **Critical**)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cache Poisoning:** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Very Low**.
    *   **MITM (DNS-related):** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Very Low**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Enabled in the Corefile for the `example.com` zone.
    *   Trust anchors configured via `trust-anchors.db`.
    *   Basic testing with `dig` performed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated monitoring of DNSSEC validation errors is missing.
    *   Formal key rollover process is not documented.
    *   No automated testing for DNSSEC in CI/CD.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting with `ratelimit` Plugin](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_with__ratelimit__plugin.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Rate Limit Needs:** Analyze traffic patterns to determine appropriate limits.
    2.  **Add `ratelimit` Plugin:** Add the `ratelimit` plugin to the relevant server block(s) in the Corefile, *before* expensive operations.
    3.  **Configure Limits:** Define rate limits (zone, window size, max requests).  Consider client IP, CIDR, etc.
    4.  **(Optional) Configure Whitelists/Blacklists:** Whitelist trusted clients or blacklist malicious sources.
    5.  **Test Rate Limiting:** Use tools like `dig` to simulate high query volumes.
    6.  **Monitor Logs:** Monitor CoreDNS logs for rate limiting events.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) / DDoS:** (Severity: **High**)
    *   **Data Exfiltration (partial mitigation):** (Severity: **Medium**)
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: **High**)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS/DDoS:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Medium**.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Medium**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `ratelimit` plugin enabled for all zones.
    *   Global rate limit: 100 queries/second/IP.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No zone-specific rate limits.
    *   No whitelisting/blacklisting.
    *   No automated testing of rate limits.
    *   Monitoring of rate limiting events not integrated with alerting.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Recursion and Forwarding (using `forward` and Corefile configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_recursion_and_forwarding__using__forward__and_corefile_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine Recursion Needs:** Decide if CoreDNS should be a recursive resolver.
    2.  **Disable Recursion (if not needed):** *Remove* the `recursion` directive (or ensure it's absent) from the Corefile.
    3.  **Configure `forward` Plugin:** If forwarding, use `forward`. Specify trusted upstream DNS servers.
    4.  **(Optional) Configure Health Checks:** Use `forward`'s health check options.
    5.  **Test Forwarding:** Use `dig` to verify forwarding.
    6. **Restrict access to upstream servers using CoreDNS configuration if possible (e.g., using ACLs within CoreDNS, if supported by a plugin, or by carefully crafting the forwarding rules).** This is a more CoreDNS-centric approach than relying solely on external firewalls.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **DNS Amplification Attacks:** (Severity: **High**)
    *   **Data Exfiltration (partial mitigation):** (Severity: **Medium**)
    *   **Cache Poisoning (indirectly):** (Severity: **Medium**)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DNS Amplification Attacks:** Risk reduced from **High** to **None** (if recursion disabled).
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.
    *   **Cache Poisoning:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Recursion disabled.
    *   `forward` configured with two trusted upstream servers.
    *   Basic health checks enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Network-level restrictions (ideally, implemented *in addition to* any CoreDNS-based restrictions) are not fully implemented.
    *   Advanced health check configuration is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Logging with the `log` Plugin](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_logging_with_the__log__plugin.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable `log` Plugin:** Add the `log` plugin to the relevant server block(s).
    2.  **Configure Log Format:** Choose a format with all relevant information (client IP, query name, type, response code, errors). Consider JSON.
    3.  **Log to a Centralized System:** Configure CoreDNS to send logs to a centralized system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Splunk).
    4.  **Implement Log Analysis:** Analyze logs for suspicious patterns.
    5.  **Set up Alerts:** Configure alerts for critical events.
    6.  **Regularly Review Logs:** Review logs for potential issues.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **All Threats (Detection and Response):** (Severity: Varies)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Threats:** Improves detection and response, reducing the impact of attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `log` plugin enabled.
    *   Logs written to a local file.
    *   Basic log rotation configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Logs not sent to a centralized system.
    *   No log analysis or alerting.
    *   No structured log format.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Plugin Configuration and Usage (Corefile Review)](./mitigation_strategies/careful_plugin_configuration_and_usage__corefile_review_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only enable necessary plugins.
    2.  **Configuration Validation:**
        *   **Automated Testing:** Test configurations for syntax and behavior.
        *   **Code Review:** Review configurations for security issues.
        *   **Configuration Management:** Use a system like Ansible to manage configurations.
    3.  **Regular Audits:** Audit configurations for misconfigurations.
    4.  **Documentation:** Maintain clear documentation of the configuration.
    5. **Specifically review plugins like `hosts`, `rewrite`, `template`, and any custom plugins for potential misuse or information leakage.** These plugins can be powerful but also introduce risks if not configured carefully.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities:** (Severity: Varies, can be **High**)
    *   **Information Leakage:** (Severity: **Medium**)
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** (Severity: Varies)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or insecure plugin configurations.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic code review of the Corefile is performed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No automated testing of the Corefile configuration.
    *   No formal configuration management system is used.
    *   No regular security audits of the configuration.
