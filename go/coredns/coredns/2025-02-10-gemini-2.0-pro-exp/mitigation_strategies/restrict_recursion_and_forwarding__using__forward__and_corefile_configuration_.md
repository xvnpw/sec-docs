Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the "Restrict Recursion and Forwarding" mitigation strategy for CoreDNS.

## Deep Analysis: Restrict Recursion and Forwarding in CoreDNS

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of the "Restrict Recursion and Forwarding" mitigation strategy in securing a CoreDNS deployment against relevant threats.  This includes assessing the completeness of the current implementation, identifying potential gaps, and recommending improvements to maximize the strategy's protective capabilities.  We aim to move beyond a simple checklist and delve into the *why* and *how* of each aspect of the strategy.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the CoreDNS configuration and its interaction with the network environment.  It covers:

*   The `forward` plugin and its configuration options.
*   The presence (or absence) of the `recursion` directive.
*   Health check mechanisms within the `forward` plugin.
*   The interaction between CoreDNS's forwarding rules and potential network-level restrictions (firewalls, ACLs).
*   The specific threats mitigated by this strategy (DNS amplification, data exfiltration, cache poisoning).
*   The CoreDNS version is assumed to be a recent, stable release (e.g., 1.9.x or later).  Older versions might have different plugin behaviors or lack certain features.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Review of CoreDNS Configuration:** Examine the provided Corefile snippets and configuration details related to recursion and forwarding.
2.  **Threat Model Analysis:**  Revisit the identified threats (DNS amplification, data exfiltration, cache poisoning) and analyze how the mitigation strategy addresses each one, considering both the CoreDNS configuration and the network context.
3.  **Implementation Gap Analysis:** Identify discrepancies between the ideal implementation of the strategy and the current state, focusing on missing features or configurations.
4.  **Best Practices Review:** Compare the current implementation against established best practices for securing DNS resolvers and forwarders.
5.  **Recommendation Generation:**  Propose specific, actionable recommendations to address identified gaps and enhance the overall security posture.
6.  **Code and Configuration Examples:** Provide concrete examples of Corefile configurations and commands to illustrate the recommendations.
7. **Testing and Validation:** Describe how to test and validate the effectiveness of the implemented mitigations.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Mitigation Strategy

**2.1. Review of Current Implementation:**

The current implementation states:

*   Recursion disabled.
*   `forward` configured with two trusted upstream servers.
*   Basic health checks enabled.

This is a good starting point, but "basic" is subjective and needs further clarification.  We need to see the actual Corefile snippet to fully assess this.  Let's assume, for now, a Corefile like this:

```
.:53 {
    forward . 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 {
        health_check 5s
    }
    log
    errors
}
```

This configuration disables recursion implicitly (because the `recursion` directive is absent), forwards all queries (`.`) to Google's public DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4), and performs health checks every 5 seconds.

**2.2. Threat Model Analysis:**

*   **DNS Amplification Attacks:**  With recursion disabled, CoreDNS will *not* respond to queries from arbitrary sources with potentially large responses.  This effectively eliminates the risk of CoreDNS being used in a DNS amplification attack.  The `forward` plugin, by design, only forwards queries; it doesn't generate amplified responses.  **Mitigation: Effective.**

*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Restricting forwarding to known, trusted upstream servers significantly reduces the risk of data exfiltration via DNS.  An attacker cannot easily direct queries to a malicious server they control.  However, if an attacker compromises a trusted upstream server, or if the communication channel to the upstream server is compromised (e.g., via a man-in-the-middle attack), exfiltration is still *possible*.  The current implementation provides a good first layer of defense, but it's not foolproof.  **Mitigation: Partially Effective.**

*   **Cache Poisoning:**  While this strategy doesn't directly address cache poisoning within CoreDNS itself (that's more the domain of DNSSEC and the `cache` plugin), by using trusted upstream resolvers, we indirectly reduce the risk.  Reputable public DNS providers like Google implement robust cache poisoning defenses.  However, CoreDNS's own cache (if enabled) could still be vulnerable.  **Mitigation: Indirectly Effective.**

**2.3. Implementation Gap Analysis:**

Based on the description and the assumed Corefile, here are the key gaps:

*   **Missing Network-Level Restrictions:** The description explicitly mentions this as a missing piece.  CoreDNS should *not* be able to communicate with arbitrary servers on port 53 (or any other DNS port).  A firewall should restrict outbound traffic from the CoreDNS server to *only* the specified upstream DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 in this example) on port 53 (UDP and TCP).  This is crucial as a defense-in-depth measure.  If CoreDNS's configuration is somehow compromised, the firewall acts as a backstop.

*   **"Basic" Health Checks:**  The `health_check` directive in the `forward` plugin has several options that are likely not being utilized.  We need to define what "basic" means.  The default behavior only checks if the upstream server is reachable.  We should consider:
    *   **`max_fails`:**  The number of consecutive health check failures before a server is considered unhealthy.  The default is often too low (e.g., 2).
    *   **`fail_timeout`:**  The duration after which a failed server is rechecked.  The default might be too long.
    *   **TLS Verification:** If using DNS-over-TLS (DoT) or DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), we *must* configure TLS verification to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.  This is a critical security measure often overlooked.

*   **Lack of `policy`:** The `forward` plugin supports different policies for selecting upstream servers:
    *    `random` (default): Randomly choose an upstream server.
    *    `round_robin`: Cycle through upstream servers in order.
    *    `sequential`: Try upstreams in order, only moving to the next if the current one is unavailable.
    *    `least_outstanding`: Forwards to the server with the fewest outstanding requests.
    *    `first`: Always try the first specified upstream.
    It is good practice to explicitly define policy.

*   **No ACLs within CoreDNS (if possible):** The original mitigation strategy mentions exploring ACLs within CoreDNS. While CoreDNS itself doesn't have a built-in ACL plugin *for restricting outbound traffic*, some third-party plugins might offer this functionality.  This is worth investigating, but network-level restrictions are generally preferred for this purpose.

*   **No consideration of DNS-over-TLS (DoT) or DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH):**  The current configuration uses plain-text DNS.  This is vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation.  Using DoT or DoH with the upstream servers would significantly improve security.

**2.4. Best Practices Review:**

The current implementation aligns with some best practices (disabling recursion, using trusted forwarders), but falls short in others:

*   **Defense in Depth:**  The lack of network-level restrictions violates this principle.
*   **Least Privilege:**  CoreDNS should only have the network access it absolutely needs.
*   **Secure Transport:**  Plain-text DNS is not considered secure.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** While `log` and `errors` are enabled, more detailed monitoring and alerting might be beneficial.

**2.5. Recommendation Generation:**

1.  **Implement Network-Level Restrictions:**  This is the *highest priority*.  Configure a firewall (e.g., `iptables`, `nftables`, or a cloud provider's firewall) to allow outbound traffic from the CoreDNS server *only* to the specified upstream DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) on port 53 (UDP and TCP).  Block all other outbound DNS traffic.

    *   **Example (iptables - assuming CoreDNS server IP is 192.168.1.10):**

        ```bash
        iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -d 8.8.8.8 -s 192.168.1.10 -j ACCEPT
        iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 53 -d 8.8.8.8 -s 192.168.1.10 -j ACCEPT
        iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -d 8.8.4.4 -s 192.168.1.10 -j ACCEPT
        iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 53 -d 8.8.4.4 -s 192.168.1.10 -j ACCEPT
        iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -s 192.168.1.10 -j DROP
        iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 53 -s 192.168.1.10 -j DROP
        ```

2.  **Enhance Health Checks:**  Configure `max_fails` and `fail_timeout` appropriately.  Consider values like `max_fails 3` and `fail_timeout 10s`.

    *   **Example Corefile:**

        ```
        .:53 {
            forward . 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 {
                health_check 5s
                max_fails 3
                fail_timeout 10s
            }
            log
            errors
        }
        ```

3.  **Implement DNS-over-TLS (DoT):**  This is a *high priority* for confidentiality and integrity.  Use the `tls` option in the `forward` plugin.  You'll need to specify the TLS server name (for Google, it's `dns.google`).

    *   **Example Corefile:**

        ```
        .:53 {
            forward . tls://8.8.8.8 tls://8.8.4.4 {
                health_check 5s
                max_fails 3
                fail_timeout 10s
                tls_servername dns.google
            }
            log
            errors
        }
        ```

4.  **Explicitly define policy:**

    *   **Example Corefile:**

        ```
        .:53 {
            forward . tls://8.8.8.8 tls://8.8.4.4 {
                health_check 5s
                max_fails 3
                fail_timeout 10s
                tls_servername dns.google
                policy round_robin
            }
            log
            errors
        }
        ```

5.  **Investigate Third-Party Plugins (Optional):**  Explore if any reputable third-party CoreDNS plugins offer outbound traffic filtering capabilities.  However, rely primarily on network-level restrictions.

6.  **Consider DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH):** DoH offers similar security benefits to DoT and might be preferable in some environments. The configuration is similar, but uses `https://` instead of `tls://`.

7. **Enable `cache` plugin:** Enable CoreDNS's cache to reduce latency and load on upstream servers. This is not strictly part of the "Restrict Recursion and Forwarding" strategy, but it's a general best practice.

    *   **Example Corefile:**
        ```
        .:53 {
            forward . tls://8.8.8.8 tls://8.8.4.4 {
                health_check 5s
                max_fails 3
                fail_timeout 10s
                tls_servername dns.google
                policy round_robin
            }
            cache 30
            log
            errors
        }
        ```

**2.6. Testing and Validation:**

After implementing these recommendations, thorough testing is crucial:

1.  **Basic Forwarding:** Use `dig` (or `nslookup`) to query various domains and ensure they resolve correctly.

    ```bash
    dig example.com @<CoreDNS_IP>
    dig google.com @<CoreDNS_IP>
    ```

2.  **Health Check Failure:**  Temporarily block access to one of the upstream servers (e.g., using `iptables`) and verify that CoreDNS switches to the other server.  Monitor the CoreDNS logs.

3.  **Network-Level Restrictions:**  Try to use `dig` to query a DNS server *other* than the allowed upstream servers, directly from the CoreDNS server.  This should *fail*.

    ```bash
    dig example.com @1.1.1.1  # This should be blocked by the firewall
    ```

4.  **TLS Verification:**  Use a tool like `kdig` (part of Knot DNS) or `openssl s_client` to verify that the TLS connection to the upstream server is established correctly and that the certificate is valid.

    ```bash
    kdig +tls +tls‑hostname=dns.google @8.8.8.8 example.com
    openssl s_client -connect 8.8.8.8:853 -servername dns.google
    ```

5.  **Negative Testing:** Try to send crafted DNS queries that might be used in attacks (even though recursion is disabled, it's good to test).  These should be rejected or forwarded without causing any issues.

6. **Cache testing:** Verify that `cache` plugin is working as expected.

### 3. Conclusion

The "Restrict Recursion and Forwarding" mitigation strategy is a vital component of securing a CoreDNS deployment.  The initial implementation provides a basic level of protection, but significant improvements are needed, particularly regarding network-level restrictions and the use of DNS-over-TLS.  By implementing the recommendations outlined in this analysis, the organization can significantly reduce the risk of DNS amplification attacks, data exfiltration, and (indirectly) cache poisoning, achieving a much stronger security posture for their DNS infrastructure. The most important improvements are implementing firewall rules and using DoT/DoH.
