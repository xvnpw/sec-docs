# Attack Surface Analysis for coredns/coredns

## Attack Surface: [1. Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/1__plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitable vulnerabilities within CoreDNS plugins (whether built-in or third-party) can lead to compromise of the CoreDNS instance.
    *   **CoreDNS Contribution:** CoreDNS's plugin architecture is the direct source of this risk.  The more plugins, the larger the attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A custom plugin with a buffer overflow allows remote code execution.  A poorly-written database interaction plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete server compromise, arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, DNS manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Critical to High (depending on the plugin and vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Minimize Plugins:**  *Only* enable essential plugins. Disable all others. This is the single most important mitigation.
        *   **Rigorous Code Auditing:**  Thoroughly audit *all* plugin source code (especially third-party/custom) for security vulnerabilities. Use static analysis tools.
        *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):**  Isolate plugins using containers or other sandboxing techniques to limit their impact if compromised.
        *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep CoreDNS and *all* plugins updated to the latest versions to get security patches.
        *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Ensure *all* plugins rigorously validate and sanitize *all* inputs.
        *   **Fuzzing:**  Fuzz test plugins with a wide range of inputs to identify vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [2. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/2__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can overwhelm CoreDNS with requests, making it unavailable.
    *   **CoreDNS Contribution:** CoreDNS, as a DNS server, is inherently vulnerable to DoS.  Its query handling is the direct target.
    *   **Example:**  DNS amplification attacks using CoreDNS, or floods of complex queries designed to exhaust resources.
    *   **Impact:**  DNS resolution failure, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:**  Use the `ratelimit` plugin or external tools to limit queries per source IP.
        *   **Response Rate Limiting (RRL):**  Limit identical responses to mitigate amplification.
        *   **Anycast:**  Deploy CoreDNS with Anycast for load distribution and resilience.
        *   **Resource Limits:**  Set OS resource limits (e.g., `ulimit`) to prevent excessive resource consumption.
        *   **Recursion Control:** If authoritative, disable recursion for untrusted clients.

## Attack Surface: [3. DNS Cache Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/3__dns_cache_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject forged DNS records into the CoreDNS cache.
    *   **CoreDNS Contribution:** CoreDNS's caching mechanism is the direct target of this attack.
    *   **Example:**  Exploiting weaknesses in upstream resolvers or DNSSEC to inject malicious records.
    *   **Impact:**  Clients redirected to malicious sites, leading to phishing or malware.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **DNSSEC Validation:**  *Enforce* DNSSEC validation using the `dnssec` plugin. This is crucial.
        *   **Trusted Upstream Resolvers:**  Use *only* trusted, well-maintained resolvers that also implement DNSSEC.
        *   **Source Port Randomization:**  Ensure CoreDNS uses randomized source ports (default behavior).
        *   **0x20 Encoding:**  Verify both CoreDNS and upstream resolvers support 0x20 encoding.
        *   **Short TTLs:**  Use relatively short TTLs for cached records.

## Attack Surface: [4. Configuration Errors (Specific High-Risk Examples)](./attack_surfaces/4__configuration_errors__specific_high-risk_examples_.md)

*   **Description:**  Misconfigurations in the Corefile create vulnerabilities.  This entry focuses on *high-risk* configuration errors.
    *   **CoreDNS Contribution:**  The Corefile's flexibility and complexity directly contribute to the risk of misconfiguration.
    *   **Example:**  Allowing unauthorized zone transfers (AXFR), exposing internal network information.  Misconfigured forwarding rules sending queries to malicious resolvers.
    *   **Impact:**  Information disclosure, DNS hijacking, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Zone Transfer Control:**  Use the `transfer` plugin to *strictly* limit zone transfers to authorized IPs *and* use TSIG.
        *   **Validated Forwarding:**  Thoroughly review and test forwarding configurations. Use *only* trusted resolvers. Enable DNSSEC validation for forwarded queries.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant CoreDNS only necessary permissions.
        *   **Automated Validation:** Use tools to automatically validate Corefile configurations.

## Attack Surface: [5. Zone File Management (if using `file` plugin)](./attack_surfaces/5__zone_file_management__if_using__file__plugin_.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure zone file permissions allow attackers to modify DNS records.
    *   **CoreDNS Contribution:** The `file` plugin's reliance on file system permissions is the direct source of this risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker with local access modifies a zone file to inject malicious records.
    *   **Impact:** DNS hijacking, data modification.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (conditional on local access).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict File Permissions:** Zone files *must* be readable *only* by the CoreDNS user and *not* writable by others.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Detect unauthorized changes to zone files.
        *   **Version Control:**  Store zone files in a version control system (e.g., Git).

## Attack Surface: [6. Dynamic DNS Updates (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/6__dynamic_dns_updates__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** Unsecured dynamic updates allow attackers to modify DNS records.
    *   **CoreDNS Contribution:** CoreDNS's support for dynamic updates, if not secured, is the direct vulnerability.
    *   **Example:**  Unauthorized dynamic update requests adding or modifying records.
    *   **Impact:**  DNS hijacking, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory TSIG Authentication:**  *Require* TSIG for *all* dynamic update requests.
        *   **Strict Access Control:**  Limit updates to authorized clients based on IP or other criteria.
        *   **Disable if Unnecessary:**  If dynamic updates are not needed, *disable* them.
