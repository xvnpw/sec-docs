Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Cache Poisoning via Malformed Responses" threat for a CoreDNS-based application, following the structure you outlined:

## Deep Analysis: CoreDNS Cache Poisoning

### 1. Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanics of cache poisoning attacks against CoreDNS, identify specific vulnerabilities and configuration weaknesses that could be exploited, and propose concrete, actionable steps beyond the initial mitigation strategies to enhance the security posture of the CoreDNS deployment.  We aim to move from a general understanding of the threat to a detailed, CoreDNS-specific analysis.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following aspects of CoreDNS:

*   **`cache` plugin:**  Detailed examination of its caching behavior, response validation (or lack thereof), and configuration options related to TTLs and cache size.
*   **`forward` plugin:**  Analysis of how upstream resolver selection and interaction can contribute to or mitigate cache poisoning risks.  Emphasis on secure configuration practices.
*   **`dnssec` plugin:**  In-depth review of DNSSEC validation implementation and best practices for its configuration within CoreDNS.
*   **`minimalresponses` plugin:**  Assessment of its effectiveness in reducing the attack surface related to cache poisoning.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:**  Identification of specific CoreDNS log entries and metrics that are crucial for detecting and responding to cache poisoning attempts.
*   **Interaction with other plugins:**  Consideration of how other plugins (e.g., custom plugins, plugins that modify DNS responses) might inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities or interact with the cache in unexpected ways.
* **Go Code Review (Hypothetical):** While we don't have access to modify the CoreDNS source code directly, we will *hypothetically* analyze areas of the Go code (based on the public repository) that are relevant to cache poisoning, to identify potential weaknesses.

This analysis *excludes* general DNS security concepts (e.g., the basics of DNSSEC) except as they directly relate to CoreDNS's implementation.  It also excludes vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system or network infrastructure, focusing solely on CoreDNS itself.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Documentation Review:**  Thorough examination of the official CoreDNS documentation for the relevant plugins (`cache`, `forward`, `dnssec`, `minimalresponses`, and any others identified as relevant).
*   **Configuration Analysis:**  Review of example CoreDNS configurations (Corefiles) and identification of secure and insecure configuration patterns related to cache poisoning.
*   **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  Analysis of the publicly available CoreDNS source code on GitHub, focusing on the logic related to caching, response validation, and DNSSEC.  This will be a *hypothetical* code review, as we are acting as security experts advising the development team, not directly modifying the code.
*   **Testing (Conceptual):**  Conceptual design of test cases that could be used to verify the effectiveness of mitigations and identify potential vulnerabilities.  These tests would ideally be implemented in a controlled environment.
*   **Threat Modeling Refinement:**  Iterative refinement of the initial threat model based on the findings of the deep analysis.

### 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat: Cache Poisoning via Malformed Responses

**4.1.  `cache` Plugin Analysis**

*   **Caching Behavior:** The `cache` plugin stores DNS responses in memory.  The key vulnerability is the potential for accepting and caching *unvalidated* responses.  Without DNSSEC, CoreDNS has no inherent mechanism to verify the authenticity of a response.
*   **TTL Handling:**
    *   **Excessively Long TTLs:**  An attacker could inject a record with a very long TTL, causing the malicious record to persist in the cache for an extended period.  The `cache` plugin allows setting `max_ttl` to limit this.  *Recommendation:*  Set a `max_ttl` to a reasonable value (e.g., 1 day or less, depending on the application's needs).  Values should be justified based on the expected update frequency of the DNS records being served.
    *   **Excessively Short TTLs:**  While less directly related to poisoning, very short TTLs could be used in a denial-of-service attack against upstream resolvers.  The `min_ttl` setting can mitigate this.  *Recommendation:*  Set a `min_ttl` to prevent caching of records with extremely short TTLs (e.g., a few seconds).
    *   **Zero TTL:**  A TTL of 0 means "do not cache."  An attacker might try to inject records with a TTL of 0 to prevent legitimate records from being cached, potentially forcing more queries to a malicious upstream server.  *Recommendation:*  Consider whether records with a TTL of 0 should be cached at all.  If they must be cached, treat them with the `min_ttl`.
*   **Cache Size:**  A large cache can increase the likelihood of a successful poisoning attack, as there are more "slots" for malicious records.  *Recommendation:*  Configure the cache size (`capacity`) to be as small as possible while still meeting performance requirements.  Monitor cache hit rates to ensure the cache is appropriately sized.
*   **Prefetch:** The `prefetch` option can proactively refresh records before they expire.  While generally beneficial, it could potentially amplify a poisoning attack if a malicious record is prefetched.  *Recommendation:*  Use `prefetch` judiciously, and ensure DNSSEC validation is enabled.  Consider a lower `prefetch` value if cache poisoning is a high concern.
*   **`serve_stale`:** This option allows CoreDNS to serve stale records if the upstream resolver is unavailable.  This could be exploited if a malicious record is in the cache.  *Recommendation:*  Carefully consider the risks and benefits of `serve_stale`.  If enabled, ensure a short `max_stale` duration and robust monitoring.

**Hypothetical Go Code Review (cache plugin):**

*   We would examine the code that parses and stores DNS responses in the cache.  Specifically, we would look for any points where validation *should* be happening but isn't.  We would look for code paths that bypass validation checks.
*   We would analyze the TTL handling logic to ensure that `min_ttl` and `max_ttl` are correctly enforced.
*   We would review the prefetch logic to ensure it doesn't inadvertently increase the risk of cache poisoning.

**4.2.  `forward` Plugin Analysis**

*   **Upstream Resolver Selection:**  The *most critical* aspect of the `forward` plugin is the choice of upstream resolvers.  Using untrusted or poorly secured resolvers is a major vulnerability.  *Recommendation:*  Use *only* well-known, reputable DNS resolvers that support DNSSEC and have strong security practices.  Examples include resolvers run by major cloud providers (and configured to use DNSSEC).  Avoid using arbitrary public resolvers.  Document the rationale for choosing each upstream resolver.
*   **`force_tcp`:**  Using TCP can help prevent some spoofing attacks, as it's harder to spoof TCP connections than UDP packets.  *Recommendation:*  Consider enabling `force_tcp` if the upstream resolvers support it.
*   **`tls`:**  Using DNS-over-TLS (DoT) encrypts the communication between CoreDNS and the upstream resolver, preventing eavesdropping and tampering.  *Recommendation:*  Enable `tls` and provide the necessary certificates.  This is *essential* for security.
*   **`expire`:** This setting controls how long CoreDNS will attempt to connect to an upstream resolver before giving up.  *Recommendation:* Set a reasonable `expire` value to prevent CoreDNS from getting stuck trying to connect to an unresponsive or malicious resolver.

**Hypothetical Go Code Review (forward plugin):**

*   We would examine the code that handles connections to upstream resolvers, ensuring that TLS is correctly implemented and that certificate validation is enforced.
*   We would review the logic that selects an upstream resolver, ensuring that it prioritizes secure resolvers and handles failures gracefully.

**4.3.  `dnssec` Plugin Analysis**

*   **DNSSEC Validation:**  This is the *primary defense* against cache poisoning.  The `dnssec` plugin *must* be enabled and configured correctly.  *Recommendation:*  Enable `dnssec` and ensure that it's working correctly.  Use a tool like `delv` or `dig +dnssec` to verify that DNSSEC validation is happening.
*   **Trust Anchors:**  CoreDNS needs to be configured with the correct trust anchors for the zones it's serving.  *Recommendation:*  Obtain the trust anchors from the appropriate sources (e.g., the parent zone) and configure them in CoreDNS.
*   **`policy`:** The default policy is usually sufficient, but review the documentation to understand the different policy options.

**Hypothetical Go Code Review (dnssec plugin):**

*   We would examine the code that performs DNSSEC validation, ensuring that it correctly implements the DNSSEC algorithms and follows the RFCs.
*   We would review the code that handles trust anchors, ensuring that they are loaded and used correctly.
*   We would look for any potential vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to bypass DNSSEC validation.

**4.4. `minimalresponses` Plugin Analysis**

*   **QNAME Minimization:**  This plugin reduces the amount of information sent to upstream resolvers, making it harder for an attacker to poison the cache of those resolvers.  *Recommendation:*  Enable `minimalresponses`.  This is a simple but effective mitigation.

**Hypothetical Go Code Review (minimalresponses plugin):**

*   We would examine the code to ensure that it correctly implements QNAME minimization according to the relevant RFC.

**4.5. Logging and Monitoring**

*   **Log Level:**  Ensure that CoreDNS is logging at a sufficient level to capture relevant events.  *Recommendation:*  Use at least the `info` log level, and consider using `debug` for troubleshooting.
*   **Specific Log Entries:**  Monitor for log entries related to:
    *   DNSSEC validation failures (e.g., "dnssec: validation failure")
    *   Upstream resolver errors (e.g., connection timeouts, refused connections)
    *   Cache operations (e.g., cache hits, misses, evictions) - these may require enabling more verbose logging.
*   **Metrics:**  CoreDNS exposes Prometheus metrics.  Monitor the following:
    *   `coredns_dns_request_count_total`:  Monitor for sudden spikes in requests.
    *   `coredns_dns_response_rcode_count_total`:  Monitor for increases in NXDOMAIN or SERVFAIL responses.
    *   `coredns_dns_cache_hits_total` and `coredns_dns_cache_misses_total`:  Monitor cache hit rates.
    *   `coredns_dns_request_duration_seconds`:  Monitor for increases in request latency.
    *   `coredns_dnssec_validation_failure_count_total`:  This is *critical* for detecting DNSSEC validation failures.

**4.6. Interaction with Other Plugins**

*   Any plugin that modifies DNS responses (e.g., custom plugins, plugins that rewrite queries or responses) could potentially introduce vulnerabilities or interfere with DNSSEC validation.  *Recommendation:*  Carefully review the code and configuration of any such plugins.  Thoroughly test their interaction with the `cache`, `forward`, and `dnssec` plugins.

**4.7.  Testing (Conceptual)**

*   **Positive Tests:**  Verify that DNSSEC validation is working correctly for known signed zones.
*   **Negative Tests:**
    *   Attempt to inject malicious records into the cache using various techniques (e.g., sending responses with manipulated TTLs, sending responses with incorrect signatures).
    *   Configure CoreDNS to use a known-vulnerable upstream resolver and attempt to poison the cache.
    *   Send a large number of queries with slightly different names to try to trigger cache collisions or other unexpected behavior.
    *   Test with various combinations of `cache`, `forward`, `dnssec`, and `minimalresponses` configurations.

### 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

Cache poisoning is a critical threat to CoreDNS deployments.  The primary defense is **DNSSEC validation**, which *must* be enabled and configured correctly.  In addition to DNSSEC, the following recommendations are crucial:

1.  **Secure Upstream Resolvers:** Use *only* trusted, reputable DNS resolvers that support DNSSEC.  Enable DoT (`tls`) for all upstream connections.
2.  **Enable `minimalresponses`:**  This reduces the attack surface.
3.  **Configure TTL Limits:**  Set reasonable `min_ttl` and `max_ttl` values in the `cache` plugin.
4.  **Monitor for Anomalies:**  Implement robust monitoring of CoreDNS logs and metrics to detect potential cache poisoning attempts.
5.  **Regularly Review Configuration:**  Periodically review the CoreDNS configuration (Corefile) to ensure that security best practices are being followed.
6.  **Stay Updated:**  Keep CoreDNS and its plugins up to date to benefit from the latest security patches.
7. **Consider serve_stale carefully:** If enabled, ensure short `max_stale` and robust monitoring.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of cache poisoning attacks against their CoreDNS-based application. The hypothetical code reviews highlight areas where the team should focus their attention during internal security audits. This deep analysis provides a strong foundation for building a more secure and resilient DNS infrastructure.
