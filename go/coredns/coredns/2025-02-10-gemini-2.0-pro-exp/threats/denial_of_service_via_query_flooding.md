Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the "Denial of Service via Query Flooding" threat for a CoreDNS-based application.

## Deep Analysis: Denial of Service via Query Flooding in CoreDNS

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Denial of Service via Query Flooding" threat against CoreDNS, identify specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors, evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies, and provide actionable recommendations for hardening the CoreDNS deployment.  We aim to move beyond a high-level description and delve into the practical implications and implementation details.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on CoreDNS and its associated plugins, particularly `ratelimit`.  We will consider:

*   The mechanics of query flooding attacks targeting CoreDNS.
*   The resource consumption patterns of CoreDNS under attack.
*   The configuration and effectiveness of the `ratelimit` plugin.
*   The interaction between CoreDNS and the operating system's resource limits.
*   The role of monitoring in detecting and responding to attacks.
*   The limitations of CoreDNS-based mitigations and the need for external defenses (briefly, as the threat model focuses on CoreDNS itself).

We will *not* delve deeply into:

*   Network-level DDoS mitigation techniques (e.g., scrubbing services, BGP flowspec) that are external to the CoreDNS server itself.  These are important, but outside the scope of this *CoreDNS-focused* analysis.
*   Specific vulnerabilities in *other* applications that might be *exposed* by a CoreDNS outage.  We focus on the CoreDNS outage itself.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Re-examine the existing threat model entry to ensure a clear understanding of the threat's definition.
2.  **Code Review (Conceptual):**  Analyze the CoreDNS codebase (conceptually, without line-by-line inspection) to understand how queries are processed, how resources are allocated, and how the `ratelimit` plugin functions.  This includes reviewing the official CoreDNS documentation and relevant plugin documentation.
3.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Examine example Corefile configurations and identify best practices and potential misconfigurations related to rate limiting and resource management.
4.  **Scenario Analysis:**  Develop specific attack scenarios to illustrate how query flooding can impact CoreDNS.
5.  **Mitigation Evaluation:**  Assess the effectiveness of each proposed mitigation strategy, considering its limitations and potential bypasses.
6.  **Recommendation Synthesis:**  Provide concrete, actionable recommendations for improving the security posture of the CoreDNS deployment.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1 Attack Mechanics:**

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack via query flooding aims to overwhelm CoreDNS by sending a high volume of DNS queries.  Several techniques can be employed:

*   **Direct Flooding:**  The attacker directly sends a large number of queries from one or more compromised hosts.  This is the most basic form.
*   **Spoofed Source IPs:** The attacker sends queries with forged source IP addresses. This makes it harder to identify and block the attacker, and can complicate rate limiting based on individual IPs.
*   **Query Type Variation:**  The attacker might use a variety of query types (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, etc.) to potentially exploit differences in processing overhead for different record types.  Some query types might be more resource-intensive to resolve.
*   **Recursive Queries (if enabled):** If CoreDNS is configured to perform recursive resolution, the attacker can send queries for domains that require extensive lookups, further amplifying the load.
*   **Queries for Non-Existent Domains (NXDOMAIN):**  A flood of queries for non-existent domains can still consume resources, especially if caching is not effectively configured or if the authoritative nameservers are slow to respond.
* **Targeting specific plugins:** Some plugins, like `kubernetes`, might have specific vulnerabilities or performance bottlenecks that can be exploited by crafted queries.

**2.2 Resource Consumption:**

Under a query flood, CoreDNS's resources are consumed in the following ways:

*   **CPU:**  Parsing incoming queries, performing lookups (local cache, forwarding, or recursion), and generating responses all consume CPU cycles.  Excessive CPU usage leads to slow response times and eventual unresponsiveness.
*   **Memory:**  Each active query consumes some memory to store the query data, intermediate results, and response data.  The `cache` plugin, if enabled, also consumes memory to store cached records.  Memory exhaustion leads to process crashes or swapping (which drastically reduces performance).
*   **Network Bandwidth:**  Receiving and sending DNS packets consumes network bandwidth.  While DNS packets are typically small, a massive volume can saturate the network interface, preventing legitimate traffic from reaching the server.
*   **File Descriptors (Sockets):**  Each incoming connection (especially over UDP) uses a file descriptor.  Exhausting the available file descriptors prevents CoreDNS from accepting new connections.
*   **Goroutines (if applicable):** CoreDNS uses goroutines for concurrency.  A large number of simultaneous queries can lead to a large number of goroutines, potentially exceeding limits or causing scheduling overhead.

**2.3  `ratelimit` Plugin Analysis:**

The `ratelimit` plugin is CoreDNS's primary defense against query flooding.  It works by tracking the number of queries from a given source (IP address, subnet, or query type) within a defined time window.  If the number of queries exceeds a configured threshold, subsequent queries from that source are dropped or delayed.

*   **Configuration:** The `ratelimit` plugin is configured within the Corefile.  Key parameters include:
    *   `rate`: The maximum number of queries allowed per time window.
    *   `window`: The duration of the time window (e.g., 1s, 1m).
    *   `zone`: The zone to which the rate limit applies.
    *   `whitelist`: A list of IP addresses or networks that are exempt from rate limiting.
    *   `burst`: Allow a burst of requests above the rate, up to this number.
    *   `dry_run`: Log rate limit actions without actually dropping packets. Useful for testing.
    *  `responses_per_second`: Rate limit responses, not requests.

*   **Effectiveness:**  The `ratelimit` plugin is effective against many forms of query flooding, particularly direct flooding from a limited number of sources.  However, it has limitations:

    *   **Distributed Attacks:**  If the attacker uses a large botnet with many unique source IPs, the rate limit per IP might be ineffective.  Rate limiting by subnet can help, but requires careful configuration to avoid blocking legitimate users.
    *   **Spoofed Source IPs:**  While `ratelimit` can handle some level of spoofing, a sophisticated attacker with a wide range of spoofed IPs can still bypass it.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion Before Rate Limiting:**  If the flood is intense enough, the server's resources (e.g., file descriptors) might be exhausted *before* the `ratelimit` plugin can effectively drop packets.
    *   **Legitimate User Impact:**  Overly aggressive rate limiting can inadvertently block legitimate users, especially if they share a NAT gateway or are behind a proxy.

*   **Example Corefile Configuration:**

    ```
    . {
        ratelimit {
            zone example.com
            rate 100
            window 1s
            burst 200
        }
        forward . 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
        cache 30
        log
    }
    ```
    This configuration limits queries for `example.com` to 100 per second, with a burst allowance of 200.

**2.4 Operating System Resource Limits:**

Operating system-level resource limits (e.g., `ulimit` on Linux) provide a crucial layer of defense.  They prevent the CoreDNS process from consuming excessive resources, even if the `ratelimit` plugin is bypassed or overwhelmed.

*   **Key Limits:**
    *   `nofile`:  The maximum number of open file descriptors.  This is critical to prevent CoreDNS from being unable to accept new connections.
    *   `nproc`:  The maximum number of processes (or threads) a user can create.  This can limit the number of goroutines CoreDNS can spawn.
    *   `memlock`: The maximum amount of memory that can be locked into RAM.  This is less directly relevant to DoS, but can be important for performance.
    *   `cpu`: Limit CPU time.

*   **Configuration:**  Resource limits are typically configured in `/etc/security/limits.conf` or through systemd unit files.

*   **Example (limits.conf):**

    ```
    coredns    soft    nofile    65535
    coredns    hard    nofile    1048576
    coredns    soft    nproc     1024
    coredns    hard    nproc     2048
    ```

    This sets soft and hard limits for the `coredns` user.

**2.5 Monitoring and Alerting:**

Comprehensive monitoring is essential for detecting and responding to DoS attacks.  CoreDNS exposes metrics that can be collected and analyzed.

*   **Key Metrics:**
    *   `coredns_dns_requests_total`:  The total number of DNS requests received.  A sudden spike indicates a potential attack.
    *   `coredns_dns_responses_total`: The total number of DNS responses sent.
    *   `coredns_dns_request_duration_seconds`:  The time taken to process requests.  Increased latency suggests resource contention.
    *   `coredns_ratelimit_drops_total`: The number of requests dropped by the `ratelimit` plugin.  This directly indicates rate limiting activity.
    *   `coredns_cache_hits_total` and `coredns_cache_misses_total`: Cache hit and miss counts.
    *   System-level metrics (CPU usage, memory usage, network I/O) for the CoreDNS process.

*   **Monitoring Tools:**  Prometheus, Grafana, and other monitoring tools can be used to collect and visualize these metrics.

*   **Alerting:**  Alerts should be configured to trigger when metrics exceed predefined thresholds, indicating a potential attack or resource exhaustion.

### 3. Scenario Analysis

**Scenario 1: Direct Flood from a Single Source**

*   **Attacker:**  A single compromised host sends a continuous stream of A record queries for `example.com` to the CoreDNS server.
*   **Impact:**  The `ratelimit` plugin (if configured) quickly detects the excessive query rate from the attacker's IP address and drops subsequent queries.  CoreDNS remains responsive to legitimate users.
*   **Mitigation:**  `ratelimit` is effective.

**Scenario 2: Distributed Flood with Spoofed IPs**

*   **Attacker:**  A botnet of 1000 compromised hosts sends queries with spoofed source IP addresses.  Each host sends only a few queries per second, but the aggregate volume is high.
*   **Impact:**  The `ratelimit` plugin, configured with a per-IP limit, is ineffective because each individual source IP appears to be within the limit.  CoreDNS becomes overwhelmed, and legitimate users experience timeouts.
*   **Mitigation:**  `ratelimit` with per-IP limits is *not* effective.  Rate limiting by subnet might help, but could also block legitimate users.  External DDoS mitigation is required.

**Scenario 3: Resource Exhaustion (File Descriptors)**

*   **Attacker:**  A single host sends a flood of UDP queries with spoofed source IPs, but the query rate is *just below* the `ratelimit` threshold.
*   **Impact:**  Even though the `ratelimit` plugin is not triggered, the sheer volume of connections exhausts the available file descriptors on the server.  CoreDNS can no longer accept new connections, effectively causing a DoS.
*   **Mitigation:**  `ulimit` (specifically `nofile`) is crucial here.  Setting a high `nofile` limit for the CoreDNS process prevents this type of attack.
