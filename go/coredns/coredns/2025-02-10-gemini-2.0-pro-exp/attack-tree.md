## Attack Tree Path: [[[Attacker's Goal: Disrupt, Degrade, or Manipulate DNS Resolution]]](./attack_tree_paths/__attacker's_goal_disrupt__degrade__or_manipulate_dns_resolution__.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker is to negatively impact the DNS resolution process for applications relying on CoreDNS. This can manifest in various ways, including making services unavailable, redirecting traffic to malicious destinations, or exfiltrating data.
*   **Impact:** High-Very High

## Attack Tree Path: [[1. Compromise CoreDNS Instance]](./attack_tree_paths/_1__compromise_coredns_instance_.md)

*   **Description:** This branch represents attacks aimed at gaining direct control over the CoreDNS server itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[1.1 Remote Code Execution]]](./attack_tree_paths/__1_1_remote_code_execution__.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the CoreDNS server, effectively taking full control.
*   **Impact:** Very High

## Attack Tree Path: [[[1.1.1 CVE-X]]](./attack_tree_paths/__1_1_1_cve-x__.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of a known, unpatched vulnerability in CoreDNS (identified by a CVE number).
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (Depends on patching frequency and vulnerability disclosure)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Full system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Medium-High (Requires finding and exploiting a specific vulnerability)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate-Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Hard (Requires vulnerability scanning and intrusion detection)

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1.3 Plugin Vulnerability (RCE)]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_3_plugin_vulnerability__rce__.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of a vulnerability in a third-party CoreDNS plugin that allows for remote code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (Depends on the quality and security of third-party plugins)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Full system compromise, potentially)
*   **Effort:** Medium-High (Requires finding and exploiting a vulnerability in a plugin)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate-Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Hard (Requires plugin vulnerability scanning and intrusion detection)

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.2 Denial of Service]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_2_denial_of_service_.md)

* **Description:** Attacks that prevent CoreDNS from servicing legitimate requests.
* **Impact:** Medium-High

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.2.1 Resource Exhaustion]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_2_1_resource_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Description:** Flooding CoreDNS with requests to consume resources (memory, file descriptors, etc.), making it unavailable.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium-High (Relatively easy to attempt, effectiveness depends on server resources and configuration)
*   **Impact:** Medium-High (Service disruption)
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie-Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy-Medium (Network monitoring and traffic analysis)

## Attack Tree Path: [[[2. Exploit CoreDNS Configuration/Features]]](./attack_tree_paths/__2__exploit_coredns_configurationfeatures__.md)

*   **Description:** This branch focuses on leveraging CoreDNS's features and configuration (or misconfiguration) for malicious purposes, without necessarily gaining full control of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[2.1 Cache Poisoning]]](./attack_tree_paths/__2_1_cache_poisoning__.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting false DNS records into the CoreDNS cache, causing it to return incorrect results, potentially redirecting traffic.
*   **Impact:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.1.1 Lack of Rate Limiting]](./attack_tree_paths/_2_1_1_lack_of_rate_limiting_.md)

*   **Description:** Sending a large number of queries for non-existent subdomains to exhaust the cache and increase the chance of successful poisoning.  This is facilitated by a lack of rate limiting on the server.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If rate limiting is not configured)
*   **Impact:** High (Incorrect DNS resolution, potential for traffic redirection)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires analyzing DNS traffic and cache contents)

## Attack Tree Path: [[[2.4 Misconfiguration]]](./attack_tree_paths/__2_4_misconfiguration__.md)

*   **Description:** General misconfigurations that weaken the security of the CoreDNS instance.
*   **Impact:** Varies (Depends on the specific misconfiguration)

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.4.1 Missing ACLs]](./attack_tree_paths/_2_4_1_missing_acls_.md)

*   **Description:** Lack of Access Control Lists to restrict which clients can query CoreDNS. This allows any client to potentially interact with the server, increasing the attack surface.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If ACLs are not configured)
*   **Impact:** Medium-High (Allows unauthorized clients to query CoreDNS, increasing attack surface)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Network traffic analysis)

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.4.2 Insecure Defaults]](./attack_tree_paths/_2_4_2_insecure_defaults_.md)

*   **Description:** Using default configurations that are known to be insecure, without reviewing and hardening them.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If default configurations are not reviewed and hardened)
*   **Impact:** Varies (Depends on the specific default setting)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Configuration review)

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.4.4 Forward to Insecure Server]](./attack_tree_paths/_2_4_4_forward_to_insecure_server_.md)

*   **Description:** Forwarding DNS requests to an untrusted or compromised upstream DNS server. This can lead to the CoreDNS instance receiving and caching malicious responses.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (If upstream resolvers are not carefully selected)
*   **Impact:** High (Compromised DNS resolution, potential for traffic redirection)
*   **Effort:** Low (Attacker only needs to compromise the upstream server)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (If attacking the upstream server)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires monitoring DNS traffic and validating responses from upstream resolvers)
