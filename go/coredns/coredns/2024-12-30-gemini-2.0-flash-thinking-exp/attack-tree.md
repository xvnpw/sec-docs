## Threat Model: CoreDNS Exploitation for Application Compromise - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to the application's data, functionality, or resources by leveraging vulnerabilities in the CoreDNS service it relies on.

**High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application via CoreDNS Exploitation
    * OR Exploit DNS Resolution Manipulation
        * ***AND DNS Spoofing/Cache Poisoning [HIGH-RISK PATH]***
            * Exploit Weak Source Port Randomization (CoreDNS or upstream)
                * Inject malicious DNS records into CoreDNS cache
                    * Redirect application traffic to attacker-controlled server
                        * Compromise application through redirected traffic (e.g., credential harvesting, XSS)
    * OR Exploit CoreDNS Service Vulnerabilities
        * ***[CRITICAL NODE] Remote Code Execution (RCE)***
            * ***[HIGH-RISK PATH]*** Exploit a vulnerability in CoreDNS code
                * Execute arbitrary code on the CoreDNS server
                    * Gain control of the CoreDNS server and potentially the application's network
            * ***[HIGH-RISK PATH]*** Exploit a vulnerability in a loaded plugin
                * Execute arbitrary code on the CoreDNS server
                    * Gain control of the CoreDNS server and potentially the application's network
    * OR Exploit CoreDNS Configuration Weaknesses
        * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Compromise DNS registrar or authoritative nameserver
            * Modify DNS records for the application's domain
                * Redirect application traffic to attacker-controlled server
                    * Compromise application through redirected traffic

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors:**

**High-Risk Path: DNS Spoofing/Cache Poisoning**

* **Exploit Weak Source Port Randomization (CoreDNS or upstream):**
    * The attacker analyzes DNS queries originating from the CoreDNS server to understand the source port selection mechanism.
    * If the source port randomization is weak or predictable, the attacker can guess the source port for a pending DNS query.
    * The attacker crafts a forged DNS response with a malicious answer (e.g., pointing the application's domain to an attacker-controlled server).
    * The attacker sends this forged response to the CoreDNS server with the correct transaction ID and the predicted source port.
    * If successful, CoreDNS accepts the forged response and caches the malicious DNS record.
    * When the application subsequently queries for the domain, CoreDNS returns the malicious record.
    * The application connects to the attacker's server, allowing for various attacks like credential harvesting or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Critical Node and High-Risk Path: Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the CoreDNS server**

* **Exploit a vulnerability in CoreDNS code:**
    * The attacker identifies a security vulnerability within the CoreDNS codebase itself (e.g., a buffer overflow, an injection flaw, or a logic error).
    * The attacker crafts a specific DNS query or interacts with the CoreDNS service in a way that triggers this vulnerability.
    * This crafted input allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server where CoreDNS is running.
    * With RCE, the attacker gains control of the CoreDNS server, potentially allowing them to:
        * Modify CoreDNS configuration.
        * Intercept or manipulate DNS traffic.
        * Pivot to other systems on the network, including the application server.
        * Exfiltrate sensitive data.

* **Exploit a vulnerability in a loaded plugin:**
    * CoreDNS uses a plugin architecture for extensibility.
    * The attacker identifies a security vulnerability within a loaded CoreDNS plugin.
    * The attacker crafts a specific DNS query or interacts with the CoreDNS service in a way that targets the vulnerable plugin.
    * This interaction triggers the vulnerability, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the CoreDNS server.
    * The consequences of successful RCE via a plugin are similar to exploiting a vulnerability in the CoreDNS core.

**Critical Node: Compromise DNS registrar or authoritative nameserver**

* **Compromise DNS registrar or authoritative nameserver:**
    * The attacker targets the infrastructure responsible for managing the application's domain name. This could be the domain registrar or the authoritative nameserver hosting the DNS records.
    * Methods of compromise could include:
        * Phishing or social engineering attacks against personnel with access to the DNS management interface.
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the registrar's or nameserver's systems.
        * Obtaining stolen credentials for the DNS management interface.
    * Once compromised, the attacker can modify the DNS records for the application's domain.
    * This allows the attacker to point the application's domain to an attacker-controlled server.
    * When users or the application attempt to access the domain, they are redirected to the attacker's server.
    * The attacker can then host a fake version of the application, harvest credentials, or launch other attacks.
