Here's the updated list of high and critical threats directly involving CoreDNS:

*   **Threat:** Open Recursive Resolver Abuse (DNS Amplification DDoS)
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker identifies a CoreDNS instance configured as an open recursive resolver (accepting queries from any source). They then send DNS queries to this instance with a spoofed source IP address, making it appear as if the target of their attack is sending the queries. The CoreDNS instance responds with potentially large DNS records to the spoofed IP, amplifying the attacker's traffic.
        *   **How:** Exploiting the lack of access controls on recursive queries within CoreDNS's configuration.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:** The target of the spoofed IP address receives a massive influx of unwanted DNS responses, leading to denial of service. The CoreDNS instance itself consumes resources responding to these malicious queries, potentially impacting its ability to serve legitimate requests.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:** CoreDNS Configuration (specifically the `forward` plugin or lack of restrictions on recursive queries).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure CoreDNS to only allow recursive queries from trusted networks or specific IP addresses.
        *   Disable recursion entirely if the CoreDNS instance is only intended to serve authoritative answers for specific zones.
        *   Monitor DNS query traffic for unusual patterns.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Plugins
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits a known security vulnerability in a third-party CoreDNS plugin that is being used.
        *   **How:** Sending specially crafted requests or data that triggers the vulnerability in the plugin's code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It could range from denial of service of the CoreDNS instance, information disclosure, to remote code execution on the server running CoreDNS.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:** Specific third-party CoreDNS plugin with the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit third-party plugins before using them.
        *   Keep all CoreDNS plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories for the plugins being used.
        *   Implement security monitoring to detect unusual activity related to plugin usage.

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via DNS Query Floods
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker floods the CoreDNS instance with a large volume of DNS queries.
        *   **How:** Sending a high number of requests from multiple sources or a botnet directly to the CoreDNS instance.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:** The CoreDNS instance becomes overwhelmed, consuming excessive CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. This leads to denial of service for legitimate clients attempting to resolve domain names.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:** CoreDNS Core (specifically the query processing and handling mechanisms).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on DNS queries within CoreDNS or using a front-end proxy.
        *   Deploy CoreDNS behind a DDoS mitigation service.
        *   Configure appropriate resource limits for the CoreDNS process.
        *   Monitor DNS query rates for anomalies.

*   **Threat:** Manipulation of Zone Files (If using the `file` plugin)
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the zone files that CoreDNS uses when configured with the `file` plugin and modifies them.
        *   **How:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in CoreDNS that allow writing to the zone files or gaining unauthorized access to the server's filesystem.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:** The attacker can modify DNS records, redirecting traffic to malicious servers, intercepting emails, or causing other disruptions.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:** CoreDNS `file` plugin and potentially vulnerabilities in CoreDNS allowing file system access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the filesystem where zone files are stored with appropriate permissions.
        *   Implement access controls to restrict who can modify zone files.
        *   Consider using a more robust backend for zone data management instead of relying solely on the `file` plugin for critical zones.
