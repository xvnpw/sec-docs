*   **Risk Reduction Contribution:** Enables proactive detection of "CoreDNS Service Disruption" and "Delayed CoreDNS Incident Detection" by providing a platform for visualizing trends and anomalies.

**3. Configure CoreDNS Alerts:**

*   **Analysis:**  Alerting is the proactive component of monitoring. Defining alerts for abnormal behavior is critical for timely incident response. The suggested alert triggers (high error rates, query pattern changes, resource exhaustion, security logs) are relevant and actionable.
*   **Strengths:** Focuses on actionable alerts that indicate potential problems or security incidents. Includes both performance and security-related alerts.
*   **Potential Improvements:**
    *   **Alert Threshold Tuning:** Emphasize the importance of carefully tuning alert thresholds to minimize false positives and ensure timely notifications for genuine issues.
    *   **Alert Severity Levels:** Implement different severity levels for alerts to prioritize response efforts based on impact.
    *   **Correlation and Aggregation:** Explore alert correlation and aggregation techniques to reduce alert fatigue and focus on critical incidents.
    *   **Security-Specific Alert Examples:** Provide concrete examples of security-related log messages to alert on (e.g., DNSSEC validation failures, suspicious query patterns).
*   **Risk Reduction Contribution:** Directly mitigates "Delayed CoreDNS Incident Detection" and helps prevent "CoreDNS Service Disruption" by enabling rapid response to emerging issues.

**4. Establish CoreDNS Alert Response Procedures:**

*   **Analysis:**  Alerts are only effective if there are clear procedures for responding to them. Defining investigation steps, escalation paths, and mitigation actions is crucial for efficient incident handling.
