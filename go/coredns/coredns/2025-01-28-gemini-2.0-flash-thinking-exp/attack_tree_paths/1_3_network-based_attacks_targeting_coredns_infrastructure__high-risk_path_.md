#### 1.3.1.1 DNS Query Flooding [HIGH-RISK PATH] (Impact: High)

**Attack Description:**

DNS Query Flooding is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack where an attacker overwhelms a DNS server, in this case CoreDNS, with a massive volume of seemingly legitimate DNS queries. The goal is to exhaust the server's resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth, connection limits) to the point where it becomes unresponsive to legitimate DNS requests from valid clients, effectively denying service.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

*   **Mechanism:** Attackers typically use botnets or distributed compromised systems to generate a large number of DNS queries. These queries can be:
    *   **Random Subdomain Queries:** Queries for non-existent subdomains (e.g., `randomstring.example.com`). This forces CoreDNS to perform recursive lookups (if configured as recursive) or exhaust resources trying to resolve them.
    *   **Queries for Specific Records:**  Flooding with requests for specific DNS records, potentially targeting resource-intensive record types or zones.
    *   **Amplification Attacks (DNS Amplification):**  Exploiting publicly accessible DNS resolvers (including potentially CoreDNS if misconfigured) to amplify the attack traffic. Attackers send small queries with spoofed source IP addresses (victim's IP) to these resolvers. The resolvers respond with larger DNS responses to the spoofed IP, magnifying the attack volume directed at the victim.
*   **Targeting CoreDNS:** CoreDNS, like any DNS server, is designed to handle DNS queries. However, it has finite resources.  A flood of queries, especially if crafted to be resource-intensive, can quickly overwhelm CoreDNS's processing capacity.
*   **Protocols:**  DNS Query Flooding primarily utilizes UDP (User Datagram Protocol) due to its connectionless nature, making it easier to generate high volumes of traffic. TCP can also be used, but UDP is more common for amplification attacks.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **Service Unavailability:** CoreDNS becomes unresponsive to legitimate DNS queries from the application and other clients. This directly impacts the application's ability to resolve domain names, leading to application downtime and functionality loss.
*   **Performance Degradation:** Even if CoreDNS doesn't become completely unresponsive, its performance can severely degrade, leading to slow DNS resolution times and impacting application performance.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  High CPU and memory utilization on the CoreDNS server can impact other services running on the same infrastructure.
*   **Reputational Damage:** Application downtime due to DNS issues can lead to reputational damage and loss of user trust.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at various levels:
    *   **Network Level (Firewall/Load Balancer):** Limit the number of DNS queries from a single source IP address within a specific time window.
    *   **CoreDNS Level (Plugins):** Utilize CoreDNS plugins like `ratelimit` to limit queries based on source IP, query type, or other criteria.
*   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Restrict access to CoreDNS only to authorized networks and clients. Use firewalls to filter traffic based on source IP and port.
*   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement robust monitoring of CoreDNS server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, query rate). Set up alerts to trigger when resource utilization exceeds predefined thresholds, indicating a potential DoS attack.
*   **Over-provisioning Resources:**  Ensure CoreDNS servers have sufficient resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) to handle expected peak loads and some level of attack traffic. However, this is not a complete solution and should be combined with other mitigation strategies.
*   **DNS Request Filtering/Anomaly Detection:** Implement systems that can analyze DNS query patterns and identify anomalous traffic indicative of a DoS attack. This can involve using Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) or specialized DNS security solutions.
*   **Response Rate Limiting (RRL):**  If CoreDNS is authoritative for zones, consider enabling Response Rate Limiting (RRL) to mitigate DNS amplification attacks. RRL limits the rate at which responses are sent for the same query, reducing the amplification factor.
*   **Disable Recursion (If Not Needed):** If CoreDNS is not intended to be a recursive resolver for external clients, disable recursion to prevent it from being used in amplification attacks.
*   **Implement DNSSEC:** While not directly mitigating DoS, DNSSEC helps ensure the integrity of DNS responses, preventing attackers from injecting malicious data during a potential compromise.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in the CoreDNS infrastructure and validate the effectiveness of implemented security measures.

**Risk Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:** **Medium to High**. DNS Query Flooding attacks are relatively common and easy to execute, especially with readily available botnets. Publicly accessible DNS services are prime targets.
*   **Severity:** **High**. Successful DNS Query Flooding can lead to significant application downtime and service disruption, impacting business operations and user experience.

#### 1.3.2.1 MitM between Application and CoreDNS (Impact: High)

**Attack Description:**

A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack between the application and CoreDNS occurs when an attacker intercepts and potentially manipulates network traffic flowing between the application making DNS queries and the CoreDNS server responding to those queries. This attack relies on the communication channel between the application and CoreDNS being unencrypted and vulnerable to eavesdropping and interception.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Network Interception:** The attacker positions themselves on the network path between the application and CoreDNS. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
        *   **ARP Spoofing:**  Poisoning the ARP cache of the application or CoreDNS to redirect traffic through the attacker's machine.
        *   **Rogue Access Point:** Setting up a malicious Wi-Fi access point that the application or CoreDNS connects to.
        *   **Compromised Network Infrastructure:** Gaining access to network switches or routers to intercept traffic.
    *   **Traffic Interception and Manipulation:** Once in the network path, the attacker intercepts DNS queries from the application and DNS responses from CoreDNS. They can then:
        *   **Eavesdrop:**  Read the DNS queries and responses to understand the application's DNS resolution patterns and potentially sensitive information.
        *   **Spoof DNS Responses:**  Modify DNS responses before they reach the application. This allows the attacker to redirect the application to malicious servers by providing false IP addresses for legitimate domain names.
        *   **Block DNS Responses:** Prevent DNS responses from reaching the application, causing DNS resolution failures and application malfunction.

*   **Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of encryption between the application and CoreDNS. Standard DNS queries and responses are typically transmitted in plaintext over UDP or TCP port 53.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **DNS Spoofing/Redirection:** Attackers can redirect application traffic to malicious servers by providing false IP addresses in spoofed DNS responses. This can lead to:
    *   **Phishing Attacks:** Redirecting users to fake login pages or websites to steal credentials.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to servers hosting malware.
    *   **Data Theft:** Redirecting application traffic to attacker-controlled servers to intercept sensitive data.
*   **Denial of Service (Indirect):** By consistently providing incorrect DNS responses, attackers can effectively prevent the application from accessing legitimate services, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality:** Eavesdropping on DNS queries can reveal information about the application's dependencies and communication patterns.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **DNS-over-TLS (DoT) or DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH):**  Implement encrypted DNS communication between the application and CoreDNS using DoT or DoH.
    *   **Application Configuration:** Configure the application to use DoT or DoH to communicate with CoreDNS.
    *   **CoreDNS Configuration:** Configure CoreDNS to support DoT or DoH and enforce encrypted connections. CoreDNS supports both DoT and DoH through plugins.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the CoreDNS infrastructure and the application network segments. Implement network access controls (firewalls, VLANs) to restrict network traffic and limit the attacker's ability to position themselves in the network path.
*   **Secure Network Infrastructure:**  Harden the network infrastructure to prevent ARP spoofing and other network-level attacks. Use secure network protocols and configurations.
*   **Mutual Authentication (mTLS for DoT/DoH):** For enhanced security, consider implementing mutual TLS (mTLS) for DoT or DoH between the application and CoreDNS. This ensures both the client (application) and server (CoreDNS) authenticate each other, preventing unauthorized connections.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy IDS/IPS to detect and potentially prevent MitM attacks by monitoring network traffic for suspicious patterns and anomalies.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure and validate the effectiveness of implemented security measures.

**Risk Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:** **Medium**. The likelihood depends on the network environment and the attacker's capabilities. In less secure networks (e.g., shared networks, networks with weak access controls), the likelihood is higher.
*   **Severity:** **High**. A successful MitM attack can have severe consequences, leading to data breaches, malware infections, and significant application compromise.

#### 1.3.2.2 MitM between CoreDNS and Upstream Resolvers (if CoreDNS is recursive) (Impact: High)

**Attack Description:**

This MitM attack targets the communication path between CoreDNS (when configured as a recursive resolver) and upstream DNS resolvers (e.g., public DNS servers like Google Public DNS, Cloudflare DNS, or ISP resolvers). If this communication is not secured, an attacker positioned on the network path can intercept and manipulate DNS queries and responses exchanged between CoreDNS and upstream resolvers.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Network Interception:** Similar to the MitM attack between the application and CoreDNS, the attacker needs to position themselves on the network path between CoreDNS and the upstream resolvers. This could involve compromising network infrastructure along the path to the internet.
    *   **Traffic Interception and Manipulation:** The attacker intercepts DNS queries sent by CoreDNS to upstream resolvers and DNS responses returned by upstream resolvers to CoreDNS. They can then:
        *   **Eavesdrop:** Monitor DNS traffic to understand CoreDNS's recursive resolution process and potentially glean information about resolved domains.
        *   **Spoof DNS Responses (Cache Poisoning):**  Inject malicious DNS responses into the communication stream before legitimate responses from upstream resolvers reach CoreDNS. CoreDNS might then cache these poisoned responses, serving them to applications making queries, leading to widespread DNS spoofing.
        *   **Block DNS Responses:** Prevent legitimate DNS responses from reaching CoreDNS, causing DNS resolution failures for the application.

*   **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of encryption between CoreDNS and upstream resolvers when using standard DNS over UDP/TCP.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **Cache Poisoning:**  The most significant impact is DNS cache poisoning. By injecting false DNS records into CoreDNS's cache, attackers can redirect all applications relying on this CoreDNS instance to malicious servers for specific domains. This can have a wide-ranging impact, affecting multiple applications and users.
*   **Widespread DNS Spoofing:**  Applications querying the poisoned CoreDNS server will receive incorrect DNS information, leading to redirection to malicious websites, phishing attacks, malware distribution, and data theft, similar to the MitM attack between the application and CoreDNS, but potentially on a larger scale due to cache poisoning.
*   **Denial of Service (Indirect):** By consistently poisoning the cache with incorrect records or blocking responses, attackers can effectively disrupt DNS resolution for applications relying on CoreDNS.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality:** Eavesdropping on DNS traffic can reveal information about the domains being resolved by CoreDNS.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **DNS-over-TLS (DoT) or DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) to Upstream Resolvers:** Configure CoreDNS to use DoT or DoH when communicating with upstream resolvers.
    *   **CoreDNS Configuration:** Configure the `forward` plugin in CoreDNS to use DoT or DoH for upstream resolvers. Specify upstream resolvers that support DoT or DoH.
*   **DNSSEC Validation:** Enable DNSSEC validation in CoreDNS. DNSSEC helps verify the authenticity and integrity of DNS responses received from upstream resolvers. While DNSSEC doesn't prevent MitM attacks, it prevents attackers from successfully poisoning the cache with forged DNS records if the domains are DNSSEC-signed.
*   **Trusted Upstream Resolvers:**  Choose reputable and security-conscious upstream DNS resolvers that support DoT or DoH and have a strong security track record.
*   **Network Security:** Secure the network infrastructure between CoreDNS and the internet to minimize the risk of MitM attacks.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy IDS/IPS to detect and potentially prevent MitM attacks by monitoring network traffic for suspicious patterns and anomalies.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and validate the effectiveness of security measures.

**Risk Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:** **Medium**.  While MitM attacks on the internet backbone are less common than local network attacks, they are still possible, especially in certain network environments or against specific targets.
*   **Severity:** **High**.  Successful MitM attacks leading to cache poisoning can have widespread and severe consequences, affecting multiple applications and users relying on the compromised CoreDNS instance. The potential for large-scale DNS spoofing and redirection makes this a high-risk attack vector.
