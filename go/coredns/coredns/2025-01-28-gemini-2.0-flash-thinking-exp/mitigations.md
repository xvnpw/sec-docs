*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known CoreDNS Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented
    *   We have a general dependency update process, but not a dedicated, scheduled process for CoreDNS updates. We are using CoreDNS version 1.8.0.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need a dedicated schedule for CoreDNS update checks and integration of CoreDNS version tracking into our dependency management. Upgrade to the latest stable CoreDNS version (e.g., 1.11.x).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure CoreDNS Configuration (`Corefile` Hardening)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_coredns_configuration___corefile__hardening_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **In-depth `Corefile` Review:**  Carefully examine the `Corefile` configuration, understanding each CoreDNS plugin and its specific configuration parameters.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary CoreDNS Plugins:** Remove or comment out any CoreDNS plugins in the `Corefile` that are not strictly required for your application's DNS resolution needs. Start with a minimal `Corefile` and add plugins only when necessary.
    3.  **CoreDNS Plugin Least Privilege:** Configure enabled CoreDNS plugins with the minimum necessary permissions and access levels within the `Corefile`. For example, restrict access paths for the `file` plugin in the `Corefile`.
    4.  **Harden CoreDNS Plugin Configurations:** For each enabled CoreDNS plugin in the `Corefile`, review its specific security-related configuration options and apply hardening measures. For example, for the `forward` plugin, ensure forwarding only to trusted resolvers specified in the `Corefile`.
    5.  **Regular `Corefile` Audits:** Periodically review the `Corefile` to ensure it remains hardened, aligned with security best practices for CoreDNS configurations, and meets current application DNS requirements.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **CoreDNS Misconfiguration Exploitation (Medium Severity):** Default or overly permissive `Corefile` configurations can expose unintended CoreDNS functionalities or vulnerabilities.
    *   **CoreDNS Plugin-Specific Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity):** Unnecessary CoreDNS plugins in the `Corefile` increase the attack surface and potential for plugin-specific vulnerabilities within CoreDNS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CoreDNS Misconfiguration Exploitation:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **CoreDNS Plugin-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented
    *   We use a custom `Corefile`, but a recent security-focused review for CoreDNS hardening is missing. Plugin selection in the `Corefile` was based on initial requirements, not a recent security audit.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Conduct a dedicated security audit of the `Corefile`, focusing on disabling unnecessary CoreDNS plugins and hardening configurations of enabled plugins within the `Corefile`. Document the security rationale behind each plugin and configuration setting in the `Corefile`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement CoreDNS Rate Limiting and Resource Quotas](./mitigation_strategies/implement_coredns_rate_limiting_and_resource_quotas.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose CoreDNS Rate Limiting Plugin:** Select a suitable CoreDNS rate limiting plugin for the `Corefile`, such as the built-in `limit` plugin. Evaluate if external solutions are needed for more advanced CoreDNS rate limiting features.
    2.  **Configure CoreDNS Rate Limits in `Corefile`:** Define appropriate rate limits within the `Corefile` based on expected legitimate DNS traffic patterns and CoreDNS resource capacity. Start with conservative limits in the `Corefile` and adjust based on monitoring and testing of CoreDNS performance. Configure limits per client IP, query type, or other relevant criteria within the `Corefile`.
    3.  **Set CoreDNS Resource Quotas (if applicable):** If running CoreDNS in containers, define resource requests and limits (CPU, memory) specifically for the CoreDNS container to prevent resource exhaustion of the CoreDNS service.
    4.  **Monitor CoreDNS Rate Limiting Effectiveness:** Monitor CoreDNS logs and metrics to ensure rate limiting configured in the `Corefile` is functioning as expected and effectively mitigating DoS attempts against CoreDNS without impacting legitimate DNS traffic.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Targeting CoreDNS (High Severity):** Uncontrolled request rates can overwhelm CoreDNS, leading to CoreDNS service unavailability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Targeting CoreDNS:** High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented
    *   We do not currently have any rate limiting configured within CoreDNS or resource quotas specifically for CoreDNS.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement rate limiting using the `limit` plugin in the `Corefile`. Define appropriate rate limits in the `Corefile` based on traffic analysis and CoreDNS performance testing. Configure resource quotas in our container orchestration system specifically for CoreDNS deployments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Properly Configure CoreDNS DNSSEC](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_properly_configure_coredns_dnssec.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine CoreDNS DNSSEC Requirement:** Assess if your application relies on authoritative DNS zones served by CoreDNS and if DNSSEC within CoreDNS is necessary for ensuring data integrity and authenticity of DNS responses from CoreDNS.
    2.  **Enable CoreDNS DNSSEC Plugin in `Corefile`:** Enable the `dnssec` plugin in the `Corefile` to activate DNSSEC functionality within CoreDNS.
    3.  **Configure CoreDNS DNSSEC Signing:** Configure DNSSEC signing parameters within CoreDNS, including key generation, key management, and signing policies. This typically involves integrating CoreDNS with a key management system or using secure key storage for CoreDNS DNSSEC keys.
    4.  **Publish CoreDNS DNSSEC Records:** Ensure the necessary DNSSEC records (e.g., DS, DNSKEY) generated by CoreDNS are published in the parent zone to establish the chain of trust for DNSSEC validation of CoreDNS responses.
    5.  **Validate CoreDNS DNSSEC Configuration:** Use DNSSEC validation tools to verify that DNSSEC is correctly configured within CoreDNS and that DNS responses from CoreDNS are being signed and validated properly.
    6.  **Monitor CoreDNS DNSSEC Health:** Regularly monitor the health of CoreDNS DNSSEC signing and validation processes, checking for errors or failures in CoreDNS DNSSEC operations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **DNS Spoofing/Cache Poisoning of CoreDNS Responses (High Severity):** Attackers can manipulate DNS responses from CoreDNS to redirect traffic or intercept data. CoreDNS DNSSEC prevents this by ensuring DNS data integrity from CoreDNS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DNS Spoofing/Cache Poisoning of CoreDNS Responses:** High Risk Reduction (for authoritative zones served by CoreDNS)

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented
    *   We are not currently using DNSSEC for our authoritative zones served by CoreDNS.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement DNSSEC for our authoritative zones served by CoreDNS. This involves key generation for CoreDNS DNSSEC, configuration of the `dnssec` plugin in the `Corefile`, and publishing DNSSEC records in the parent zone for CoreDNS. Requires careful planning and execution specific to CoreDNS DNSSEC setup.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize and Secure CoreDNS Logs](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_and_secure_coredns_logs.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review CoreDNS Logging Configuration:** Examine the CoreDNS logging configuration in the `Corefile` (e.g., using the `log` plugin). Identify any potentially sensitive information being logged by CoreDNS (e.g., full query parameters, client IPs if not necessary in CoreDNS logs).
    2.  **Minimize Sensitive CoreDNS Logging:** Adjust CoreDNS logging levels and formats in the `Corefile` to avoid logging sensitive data unnecessarily in CoreDNS logs. Consider anonymizing or masking sensitive information if logging is required in CoreDNS logs.
    3.  **Implement CoreDNS Log Rotation and Retention:** Configure log rotation specifically for CoreDNS logs to prevent them from consuming excessive disk space. Implement a log retention policy for CoreDNS logs based on security and compliance requirements.
    4.  **Secure CoreDNS Log Storage and Access:** Store CoreDNS logs in a secure location with restricted access. Use appropriate access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized personnel can access CoreDNS logs. Consider using centralized logging solutions with security features for CoreDNS logs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via CoreDNS Logs (Medium Severity):** CoreDNS logs can inadvertently expose sensitive information if not properly sanitized.
    *   **CoreDNS Log Tampering/Manipulation (Medium Severity):** If CoreDNS logs are not securely stored and accessed, attackers could tamper with CoreDNS logs to cover their tracks or manipulate evidence related to CoreDNS activity.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via CoreDNS Logs:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **CoreDNS Log Tampering/Manipulation:** Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented
