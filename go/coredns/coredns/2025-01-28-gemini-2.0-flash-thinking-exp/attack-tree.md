## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Compromise Application via CoreDNS Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_compromise_application_via_coredns_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the root goal and represents the ultimate critical outcome. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application through CoreDNS.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit CoreDNS Software Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_coredns_software_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting bugs in CoreDNS code. This is a high-risk path because software vulnerabilities can lead to severe consequences like Remote Code Execution (RCE) and complete server compromise.
    *   **Critical Nodes within this path:**
        *   **1.1.1.1.1 Triggered by Malicious DNS Query (Impact: Critical):**  A specially crafted DNS query triggers a memory corruption vulnerability (buffer overflow, heap overflow, use-after-free) in CoreDNS core, leading to potential RCE.
        *   **1.1.1.1.2 Triggered by Crafted DNS Response (Impact: Critical):** If CoreDNS acts as a resolver, a malicious DNS response from an upstream server triggers a memory corruption vulnerability during response processing, leading to potential RCE or cache poisoning.
        *   **1.1.1.2.1 DNS Protocol Parsing Vulnerabilities (Impact: High):** Flaws in how CoreDNS parses DNS protocol elements can be exploited using malformed DNS packets, potentially leading to DoS or even code execution depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
        *   **1.1.2 Exploit Vulnerabilities in CoreDNS Plugins [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Plugins, being extensions to the core functionality, can introduce vulnerabilities. This is a high-risk path because plugins are often less rigorously audited than the core and can handle diverse and complex logic.
            *   **1.1.2.1 Plugin-Specific Vulnerabilities (e.g., File, Forward, etc.) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Vulnerabilities specific to individual plugins.
                *   **1.1.2.1.1 Injection Vulnerabilities (Command Injection, Path Traversal) in Plugin Logic (Impact: High):** Plugins that process external input or file paths are susceptible to injection vulnerabilities. For example, a command injection in a plugin could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the CoreDNS server. Path traversal could allow access to sensitive files.
                *   **1.1.2.1.2 Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Plugins (Impact: Critical):** Similar to core vulnerabilities, memory corruption in plugins can lead to RCE and server compromise.
        *   **1.1.3 Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** CoreDNS and its plugins rely on third-party Go libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited.
            *   **1.1.3.2 Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Go Libraries used by CoreDNS or Plugins [HIGH-RISK PATH] (Impact: High):** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries is a common attack vector.
        *   **1.1.4 Exploit Known CVEs in CoreDNS (if any exist) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] (Impact: Critical):** Publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in CoreDNS are a direct and high-risk attack path. If patches are not applied promptly, attackers can easily exploit these known weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Exploit CoreDNS Misconfiguration [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_exploit_coredns_misconfiguration__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting insecure configurations of CoreDNS. Misconfigurations are a common source of vulnerabilities and can have significant security implications.
    *   **Critical Nodes within this path:**
        *   **1.2.1 Open Recursive Resolver Misconfiguration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **1.2.1.2 DNS Cache Poisoning (if recursive is enabled) (Impact: High):** If CoreDNS is misconfigured as an open recursive resolver and recursion is enabled, it becomes vulnerable to DNS cache poisoning attacks. Attackers can inject malicious DNS records into the cache, leading to redirection of application traffic to attacker-controlled servers.
        *   **1.2.2 Weak Access Control [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **1.2.2.1 Unrestricted Access to CoreDNS Service [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **1.2.2.1.1 Direct Access from Untrusted Networks [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** If CoreDNS service is directly accessible from untrusted networks (e.g., the public internet) without proper access controls, attackers can directly interact with it and attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
        *   **1.2.3 Vulnerable Plugin Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **1.2.3.3 Overly permissive plugin configurations (e.g., allowing unsafe operations) [HIGH-RISK PATH] (Impact: Medium to High):** Some plugins might offer configurations that, if enabled, can introduce security risks. For example, allowing unsafe operations or overly broad access permissions within a plugin.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Network-Based Attacks Targeting CoreDNS Infrastructure [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_network-based_attacks_targeting_coredns_infrastructure__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Targeting the network infrastructure where CoreDNS is deployed. While not directly CoreDNS vulnerabilities, these attacks can disrupt or compromise CoreDNS service.
    *   **Critical Nodes within this path:**
        *   **1.3.1 Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **1.3.1.1 DNS Query Flooding [HIGH-RISK PATH] (Impact: High):** Overwhelming CoreDNS with a flood of DNS queries can exhaust its resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) and cause a denial of service, making the application reliant on CoreDNS unavailable.
        *   **1.3.2 Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:**
            *   **1.3.2.1 MitM between Application and CoreDNS (Impact: High):** If communication between the application and CoreDNS is not secured (e.g., using encryption), an attacker performing a MitM attack on the network path can intercept and manipulate DNS queries and responses, leading to DNS spoofing and redirection of application traffic.
            *   **1.3.2.2 MitM between CoreDNS and Upstream Resolvers (if CoreDNS is recursive) (Impact: High):** If CoreDNS is configured as a recursive resolver and communication with upstream resolvers is not secured (e.g., using DNS-over-TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS), an attacker performing a MitM attack on the network path between CoreDNS and upstream resolvers can manipulate DNS responses, leading to cache poisoning and redirection of application traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4 Social Engineering/Insider Threats](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_social_engineeringinsider_threats.md)

**Attack Vector:**  While not specific to CoreDNS vulnerabilities, social engineering or malicious insiders can compromise the application or the CoreDNS infrastructure by exploiting human factors. This can lead to critical impact, including data breaches, system sabotage, or unauthorized access.
