# Attack Surface Analysis for coredns/coredns

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation and Parsing Vulnerabilities (DNS Query Parsing)](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_and_parsing_vulnerabilities__dns_query_parsing_.md)

**Description:** Flaws in how CoreDNS parses incoming DNS queries can be exploited to cause unexpected behavior or system compromise.

**CoreDNS Contribution:** CoreDNS is designed to process DNS queries, making it directly exposed to this attack surface.  Its parsing logic is the entry point for external data.

**Example:** Sending a specially crafted DNS query with an overly long domain name that triggers a buffer overflow in CoreDNS's query parsing routine, potentially leading to code execution.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE), Information Disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep CoreDNS Up-to-Date: Regularly update CoreDNS to the latest version to patch known parsing vulnerabilities.
* Input Sanitization (within Plugins): If developing custom plugins, rigorously sanitize and validate all input data, especially from DNS queries.
* Fuzzing and Security Testing: Employ fuzzing tools and security testing to identify potential parsing vulnerabilities in CoreDNS and custom plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities (Plugin-Specific Bugs)](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities__plugin-specific_bugs_.md)

**Description:** Security flaws within individual CoreDNS plugins can be exploited to compromise the DNS server or the underlying system.

**CoreDNS Contribution:** CoreDNS's plugin architecture, while flexible, relies on the security of individual plugins. Vulnerabilities in plugins directly impact CoreDNS's security.

**Example:** A vulnerability in a specific plugin (e.g., `file`, `etcd`, custom plugin) allows an attacker to bypass authentication, read sensitive data, or execute arbitrary code by crafting specific DNS queries or exploiting plugin logic.

**Impact:** Data Breach, Privilege Escalation, Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use Reputable and Well-Maintained Plugins: Prioritize using plugins from the official CoreDNS repository or trusted, actively maintained sources.
* Regular Plugin Audits: Periodically review and audit the plugins used in your Corefile for known vulnerabilities and security best practices.
* Plugin Updates: Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Security Scanning of Plugins: If using third-party or custom plugins, perform security scans and code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration and Misconfiguration Risks (Open Resolvers)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_and_misconfiguration_risks__open_resolvers_.md)

**Description:** Misconfiguring CoreDNS as an open resolver allows unauthorized external access, leading to abuse and potential amplification attacks.

**CoreDNS Contribution:** CoreDNS, by default, can be configured to listen on public interfaces. Misconfiguration in the Corefile can easily lead to an open resolver setup.

**Example:** Configuring CoreDNS to listen on `0.0.0.0:53` without proper access controls, allowing anyone on the internet to use it for DNS resolution and potentially for DNS amplification attacks against other targets.

**Impact:** DNS Amplification Attacks (originating from your server), Resource Exhaustion, Reputation Damage, Potential legal liabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Restrict Listening Interfaces: Configure CoreDNS to listen only on internal network interfaces or specific authorized IP addresses using the `bind` directive in the Corefile.
* Access Control Lists (ACLs): Utilize plugins like `acl` to restrict access to CoreDNS based on source IP addresses or networks.
* Monitoring and Alerting: Monitor DNS query patterns for unusual traffic volumes that might indicate abuse of an open resolver.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration and Misconfiguration Risks (Insecure Plugin Configurations)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_and_misconfiguration_risks__insecure_plugin_configurations_.md)

**Description:** Improperly configuring plugins can expose sensitive information, weaken access controls, or introduce other vulnerabilities.

**CoreDNS Contribution:** Plugins extend CoreDNS functionality, and their configuration directly impacts the overall security posture. Misconfigurations in plugins can negate other security measures.

**Example:** Using the `file` plugin to serve DNS records from a file containing sensitive internal network information, and failing to restrict access to this plugin, allowing external users to query and obtain this sensitive data.

**Impact:** Information Disclosure, Data Breach, Unauthorized Access, Privilege Escalation (depending on the plugin and exposed data).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Principle of Least Privilege (Plugin Configuration): Configure plugins with the minimum necessary permissions and access rights.
* Secure Defaults: Avoid relying on default plugin configurations without thorough review and customization.
* Input Validation and Output Sanitization (Plugin Configuration): When configuring plugins, validate input parameters and sanitize output data to prevent injection vulnerabilities or information leaks.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Query Floods)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__attacks__query_floods_.md)

**Description:** Overwhelming CoreDNS with a high volume of DNS queries to exhaust resources and disrupt service availability.

**CoreDNS Contribution:** As a DNS server, CoreDNS is inherently designed to handle DNS queries, making it a direct target for query flood DoS attacks.

**Example:** An attacker sends a massive flood of DNS queries to the CoreDNS server, exceeding its processing capacity and causing it to become unresponsive to legitimate DNS requests.

**Impact:** Service Disruption, Downtime, Impact on applications relying on DNS resolution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting mechanisms (e.g., using plugins or external firewalls) to restrict the number of queries from specific sources or in general.
* Resource Limits (OS Level): Configure operating system level resource limits (CPU, memory, file descriptors) for the CoreDNS process to prevent resource exhaustion from DoS attacks.
* Load Balancing and Redundancy: Deploy CoreDNS in a load-balanced and redundant configuration to distribute traffic and ensure service availability even under DoS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (External Go Modules)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__external_go_modules_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in external Go modules used by CoreDNS or its plugins can be exploited to compromise CoreDNS.

**CoreDNS Contribution:** CoreDNS relies on a number of external Go modules for various functionalities. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies indirectly affect CoreDNS's security.

**Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in a widely used Go module that CoreDNS depends on. An attacker exploits this vulnerability through CoreDNS, potentially leading to code execution or other compromises.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), other impacts depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Dependency Scanning: Regularly scan CoreDNS dependencies (Go modules) for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
* Dependency Updates: Keep CoreDNS dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Vendoring Dependencies: Vendor dependencies to have better control over the versions used and to facilitate easier updates and security patching.
