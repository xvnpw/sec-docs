# Attack Tree Analysis for coredns/coredns

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To compromise the application that uses CoreDNS by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within CoreDNS itself, focusing on the most likely and impactful attack routes.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   Compromise Application via CoreDNS **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   Manipulate DNS Resolution to Redirect Application **[CRITICAL NODE]** **[HIGH_RISK PATH]**
        *   Cache Poisoning
        *   Response Injection
    *   Deny DNS Resolution for the Application **[CRITICAL NODE]** **[HIGH_RISK PATH]**
        *   Resource Exhaustion
        *   Exploit Denial-of-Service Vulnerability in CoreDNS
    *   Exploit CoreDNS Vulnerabilities Directly **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   Code Injection **[HIGH_RISK PATH]**
        *   Plugin Vulnerability Exploitation **[HIGH_RISK PATH]**
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via CoreDNS [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_coredns__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal and represents the successful exploitation of any vulnerability within CoreDNS to compromise the dependent application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate DNS Resolution to Redirect Application [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH_RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_dns_resolution_to_redirect_application__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Cache Poisoning:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in CoreDNS's caching mechanism to insert false DNS records.
        *   Sending spoofed DNS responses to CoreDNS that appear to originate from authoritative name servers.
        *   Exploiting timing vulnerabilities in CoreDNS cache updates to inject records during a vulnerable window.
*   **Response Injection:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Intercepting and modifying legitimate DNS responses before they reach CoreDNS.
        *   Performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the network communication between CoreDNS and upstream DNS resolvers to intercept and alter responses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deny DNS Resolution for the Application [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH_RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/deny_dns_resolution_for_the_application__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Resource Exhaustion:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Overwhelming CoreDNS with a flood of requests, preventing it from responding to legitimate queries from the application.
        *   Sending a large volume of DNS queries (DNS flood) from single or multiple sources.
        *   Exploiting resource limits in CoreDNS configuration by sending queries that consume excessive CPU or memory.
*   **Exploit Denial-of-Service Vulnerability in CoreDNS:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Triggering a bug or vulnerability within CoreDNS that causes it to crash, hang, or become unresponsive.
        *   Sending specially crafted DNS queries designed to exploit known vulnerabilities in CoreDNS.
        *   Exploiting known vulnerabilities in specific versions of CoreDNS or its plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CoreDNS Vulnerabilities Directly [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_coredns_vulnerabilities_directly__critical_node_.md)

*   **Code Injection [HIGH_RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in CoreDNS's parsing or processing logic to execute arbitrary code on the server.
        *   Injecting malicious code through crafted DNS records that are not properly sanitized or validated by CoreDNS.
        *   Leveraging vulnerabilities within specific CoreDNS plugins to inject and execute code.
*   **Plugin Vulnerability Exploitation [HIGH_RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Targeting vulnerabilities within specific CoreDNS plugins used by the application.
        *   Leveraging publicly known vulnerabilities in popular CoreDNS plugins.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom-developed CoreDNS plugins.
