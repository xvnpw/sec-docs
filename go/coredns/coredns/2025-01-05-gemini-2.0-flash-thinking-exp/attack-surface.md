# Attack Surface Analysis for coredns/coredns

## Attack Surface: [Listening on Exposed Ports](./attack_surfaces/listening_on_exposed_ports.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Listening on Exposed Ports
    * **Description:** CoreDNS listens on network ports (typically UDP/53 and TCP/53) to receive and respond to DNS queries. If these ports are exposed to untrusted networks, they become entry points for malicious actors.
    * **How CoreDNS Contributes:** CoreDNS *must* listen on network ports to function as a DNS server. This inherent functionality creates the exposure.
    * **Example:** An attacker from the internet sends a flood of DNS queries to the exposed CoreDNS port, causing a denial of service.
    * **Impact:** Service disruption, inability for applications to resolve domain names, potential resource exhaustion on the server.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Network Segmentation:** Restrict access to CoreDNS ports using firewalls or network policies, allowing only trusted networks or specific IP addresses.
        * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the CoreDNS server or upstream network devices to prevent query floods.
        * **Consider Internal Deployment:** If possible, deploy CoreDNS within a private network, minimizing external exposure.

## Attack Surface: [Corefile Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/corefile_misconfiguration.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Corefile Misconfiguration
    * **Description:** The Corefile dictates CoreDNS's behavior. Incorrect configurations can introduce vulnerabilities or expose sensitive information.
    * **How CoreDNS Contributes:** CoreDNS relies entirely on the Corefile for its operational parameters. Flexibility in configuration also introduces the risk of misconfiguration.
    * **Example:** An administrator configures the `forward` plugin to unconditionally forward all queries to an external, potentially malicious DNS server.
    * **Impact:**  Redirection of DNS queries to attacker-controlled servers, information leakage, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only grant necessary permissions and configure plugins with the minimum required scope.
        * **Regular Review:** Periodically review the Corefile for any misconfigurations or overly permissive settings.
        * **Configuration Management:** Use version control and automated deployment for Corefile changes to track and revert modifications.
        * **Security Audits:** Conduct security audits of the Corefile to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Plugin Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** CoreDNS's functionality is extended through plugins. Vulnerabilities in these plugins can be exploited.
    * **How CoreDNS Contributes:** CoreDNS's architecture encourages the use of plugins, making the overall system's security dependent on the security of individual plugins.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability in a specific plugin allows an attacker to send a crafted DNS query that triggers remote code execution within the CoreDNS process.
    * **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the CoreDNS server, potential access to underlying infrastructure, data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Use Reputable Plugins:**  Favor well-maintained and widely used plugins with a strong security track record.
        * **Regular Updates:** Keep CoreDNS and all its plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan CoreDNS and its plugins for known vulnerabilities using appropriate tools.
        * **Principle of Least Functionality:** Only enable necessary plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Malicious Queries](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_malicious_queries.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Resource Exhaustion through Malicious Queries
    * **Description:** Attackers can send specially crafted or high volumes of DNS queries to exhaust CoreDNS's resources (CPU, memory).
    * **How CoreDNS Contributes:** As a DNS server, CoreDNS is designed to process queries. This inherent functionality makes it a potential target for resource exhaustion attacks.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends a large number of recursive queries for non-existent domains, forcing CoreDNS to expend resources attempting to resolve them.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, performance degradation, potential server crashes.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the CoreDNS server or upstream network devices.
        * **Query Filtering:** Configure CoreDNS to filter out potentially malicious or excessive query types.
        * **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor CoreDNS's resource usage (CPU, memory) and set alerts for abnormal behavior.
