# Threat Model Analysis for coredns/coredns

## Threat: [Insecure Corefile Configuration](./threats/insecure_corefile_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit a poorly configured Corefile in CoreDNS to gain unauthorized control or disrupt DNS services. This might involve manipulating rewrite rules within CoreDNS to redirect application traffic to malicious servers, enabling overly permissive access controls to sensitive CoreDNS plugins, or exposing internal network details through misconfigured DNS zones managed by CoreDNS.

## Threat: [Lack of Resource Limits](./threats/lack_of_resource_limits.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could overwhelm the CoreDNS instance with a large volume of DNS queries, directly targeting CoreDNS's processing capabilities and leading to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory). This denial-of-service (DoS) directly impacts CoreDNS's ability to respond to legitimate requests from applications.

## Threat: [Running CoreDNS with Elevated Privileges](./threats/running_coredns_with_elevated_privileges.md)

*   **Description:** If the CoreDNS process is running with root or other elevated privileges, a successful exploit of a vulnerability within CoreDNS itself could grant the attacker broad access to the underlying system. The vulnerability resides within CoreDNS, and the elevated privileges amplify the impact.

## Threat: [Using Untrusted or Unverified Plugins](./threats/using_untrusted_or_unverified_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** CoreDNS's plugin architecture allows for extensibility. However, using plugins from untrusted sources or plugins with known vulnerabilities introduces malicious code or security flaws directly into the CoreDNS process, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution within the context of CoreDNS.

## Threat: [DNS Cache Poisoning](./threats/dns_cache_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in CoreDNS's caching mechanism to inject false DNS records into its cache. This directly manipulates CoreDNS's responses to queries, redirecting users of applications relying on this CoreDNS instance to malicious websites or services.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attacks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could flood the CoreDNS instance with a large volume of malicious or malformed DNS queries, directly targeting CoreDNS's ability to process requests. This overwhelms CoreDNS's resources and prevents it from responding to legitimate requests.

## Threat: [Protocol-Level Vulnerabilities](./threats/protocol-level_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities may exist within CoreDNS's implementation of the DNS protocol itself. An attacker could craft specific DNS queries or responses that exploit these implementation flaws within CoreDNS, potentially leading to crashes, information leaks from the CoreDNS process, or even remote code execution within CoreDNS.

## Threat: [Implementation Bugs and Vulnerabilities](./threats/implementation_bugs_and_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Like any software, CoreDNS may contain undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities in its codebase. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities directly within the CoreDNS application to cause crashes, information leaks from the CoreDNS process, or potentially achieve remote code execution within the context of CoreDNS.
