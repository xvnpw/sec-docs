## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit FRP Server Software Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] --> [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_frp_server_software_vulnerabilities__critical_node__--__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the FRP server software itself.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (for known CVEs, depends on patching cadence), Low (for zero-days)
*   **Impact:** Critical (Remote Code Execution on FRP Server, full system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Medium (for known CVEs, public exploits may exist), High (for zero-days, requires significant research)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium (for known CVEs, understanding exploits), High (for zero-days, expert vulnerability researcher)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (exploit attempts might be logged), High (zero-days are harder to detect)
*   **Mitigation:** Regularly update FRP Server to the latest version, implement vulnerability scanning, security audits and penetration testing, robust input validation and sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Bypass FRP Server Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL NODE] --> [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__bypass_frp_server_authenticationauthorization__critical_node__--__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Bypassing authentication mechanisms on the FRP server to gain unauthorized access to its control panel and functionality.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (if weak passwords are used or default credentials not changed), Low (for authentication bypass vulnerabilities)
*   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized Access to FRP Server Control Panel/Functionality, potentially control over proxied applications)
*   **Effort:** Low (for brute-force), Medium (for authentication bypass vulnerabilities)
*   **Skill Level:** Low (for brute-force, script kiddie tools), Medium (for bypass vulnerabilities, competent hacker)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (for brute-force, failed login attempts are easily logged), Medium (for bypass vulnerabilities, depends on the nature of the bypass)
*   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong passwords, implement account lockout policies, use multi-factor authentication, security audits and code reviews of authentication logic, regularly update FRP Server.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Insecure Access Control Lists (ACLs) on FRP Server --> [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__insecure_access_control_lists__acls__on_frp_server_--__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Misconfiguring Access Control Lists on the FRP server to allow unauthorized access to proxied internal services.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (configuration errors are common)
*   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized access to internal application)
*   **Effort:** Low (simple configuration review or probing)
*   **Skill Level:** Low (basic understanding of networking and access control)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (access logs might show unauthorized access, depends on logging level and monitoring)
*   **Mitigation:** Implement strict ACLs, follow the principle of least privilege, regularly review and audit ACLs.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exposing Unintended Services via FRP --> [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exposing_unintended_services_via_frp_--__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Misconfiguring proxy rules in FRP to unintentionally expose internal admin panels, sensitive endpoints, or other unintended services to the public internet.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (configuration errors are common, especially in complex setups)
*   **Impact:** Critical (Unauthorized access to sensitive internal resources)
*   **Effort:** Low (configuration review, port scanning, web probing)
*   **Skill Level:** Low (basic networking and web probing skills)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (access logs might show access to unexpected endpoints, depends on monitoring)
*   **Mitigation:** Carefully review and test proxy configurations, regularly audit exposed services, implement strong authentication on all services.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Weak or Default Credentials for FRP Components --> [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__weak_or_default_credentials_for_frp_components_--__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Using default or weak passwords for FRP server admin or client authentication.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (default passwords are often overlooked)
*   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized access to FRP server/client control)
*   **Effort:** Low (checking default credentials is trivial)
*   **Skill Level:** Low (basic knowledge of default credentials)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (login attempts with default credentials might be logged)
*   **Mitigation:** Change default passwords immediately, enforce strong password policies.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on FRP Client-Server Communication [CRITICAL NODE] --> [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/6__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_frp_client-server_communication__critical_node__--__high-risk__eb527725.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Intercepting and potentially modifying communication between the FRP client and server if it is not properly encrypted using TLS/HTTPS.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (assuming misconfiguration - lack of TLS)
*   **Impact:** Critical (Data Breach, Credential Theft, Potential to modify traffic and compromise proxied application)
*   **Effort:** Low (tools like Wireshark, readily available MitM frameworks)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium (network knowledge, using MitM tools)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High (passive interception is very hard to detect, active MitM might be detectable with proper TLS configuration and monitoring)
*   **Mitigation:** **Enforce TLS/HTTPS for FRP client-server communication (critical).** Use strong ciphers, implement integrity checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Phishing Attacks to Obtain FRP Credentials --> [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/7__phishing_attacks_to_obtain_frp_credentials_--__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Using phishing techniques to trick users or administrators into revealing their FRP server or client credentials.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (phishing is a common and effective attack vector)
*   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized access to FRP components)
*   **Effort:** Low (phishing kits are readily available)
*   **Skill Level:** Low (basic social engineering and phishing skills)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (depends on user awareness and phishing detection mechanisms)
*   **Mitigation:** Security awareness training for users, implement phishing detection mechanisms, use multi-factor authentication.
