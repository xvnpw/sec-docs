# Attack Surface Analysis for fatedier/frp

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of the `frps` Listener Port](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_the__frps__listener_port.md)

**Description:** The `frps` server, acting as the central point of connection, listens on a publicly accessible network port.

**How FRP Contributes:** `frp`'s core functionality relies on this exposed port for clients (`frpc`) to connect and establish tunnels. Without it, `frp` cannot function.

**Example:** An attacker scans public IP ranges and identifies an open port associated with `frps`. They attempt to connect and probe for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

**Impact:** Potential for unauthorized access to the `frps` server, denial of service attacks, and exploitation of vulnerabilities in the `frps` software itself.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use strong firewall rules: Restrict access to the `frps` listener port to only necessary IP addresses or networks.
* Implement rate limiting:  Limit the number of connection attempts from a single IP address to mitigate brute-force and DoS attacks.
* Keep `frps` updated: Regularly update `frps` to the latest version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
* Consider port knocking or other port obfuscation techniques: While not a primary security measure, it can add a layer of obscurity.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Missing Authentication on `frps`](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_missing_authentication_on__frps_.md)

**Description:**  The `frps` server might not require strong authentication or might be configured with default or easily guessable authentication tokens.

**How FRP Contributes:** `frp`'s authentication mechanism controls who can connect to the `frps` server and establish tunnels. Weak authentication allows unauthorized clients to connect.

**Example:** An attacker uses default credentials or brute-forces a weak `authentication_token` to connect to the `frps` server and create unauthorized tunnels, potentially exposing internal services.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal network resources, data breaches, and potential compromise of internal systems.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure strong authentication: Use a strong, randomly generated `authentication_token` in the `frps.ini` configuration.
* Consider using more robust authentication methods: Explore if future versions of `frp` offer more advanced authentication options.
* Regularly rotate authentication tokens: Periodically change the `authentication_token`.
* Limit the number of allowed client connections:  Restrict the number of concurrent connections to prevent abuse.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration of `frps`](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_of__frps_.md)

**Description:** Incorrect or insecure settings in the `frps.ini` configuration file.

**How FRP Contributes:** `frp`'s behavior and security are heavily dependent on its configuration. Misconfigurations can directly introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:**  The `bind_addr` in `frps.ini` is set to `0.0.0.0` without proper firewall rules, exposing the `frps` management interface (if enabled) to the public internet. Or, `tls_only` is not enabled, allowing unencrypted connections.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, unauthorized access, and potential for exploitation of vulnerable features.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow the principle of least privilege: Only enable necessary features and bind to specific interfaces if needed.
* Secure the `frps.ini` file:** Ensure the configuration file has appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized modification.
* Disable unnecessary features:** If features like `web_port` are not required, disable them. If enabled, implement strong authentication for them.
* Review the `frps` documentation thoroughly: Understand the security implications of each configuration option.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration of `frpc`](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_of__frpc_.md)

**Description:** Incorrect or insecure settings in the `frpc.ini` configuration file.

**How FRP Contributes:** `frpc`'s configuration determines which internal services are exposed through tunnels. Misconfigurations can unintentionally expose sensitive services.

**Example:**  An attacker compromises a machine running `frpc`. They examine the `frpc.ini` and find a tunnel configured to forward traffic to a sensitive internal database without proper access control.

**Impact:** Unintended exposure of internal services, data breaches, and potential compromise of internal systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Apply the principle of least privilege: Only configure tunnels for necessary services and with the minimum required access.
* Secure the `frpc.ini` file:** Ensure the configuration file has appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized modification.
* Regularly review `frpc` configurations:** Audit the configured tunnels to ensure they are still necessary and securely configured.
* Implement strong access controls on proxied applications:** Even with `frp`, the proxied applications should have their own robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of TLS Encryption](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_tls_encryption.md)

**Description:** Communication between `frpc` and `frps` is not encrypted using TLS.

**How FRP Contributes:** `frp` transmits data over the network. Without encryption, this data is vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation.

**Example:** An attacker on the network path between `frpc` and `frps` intercepts the communication and gains access to sensitive data being transmitted through the tunnel or potentially steals authentication credentials.

**Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of sensitive information, and potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable TLS encryption:** Configure both `frps` and `frpc` to use TLS for secure communication by setting `tls_enable = true` in their respective configuration files.
* Consider using `tls_only = true` on `frps`:** This forces all connections to use TLS, preventing unencrypted connections.
* Ensure proper TLS certificate management:** Use valid and trusted TLS certificates.

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of the `frpc` Host](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_the__frpc__host.md)

**Description:** The machine running the `frpc` client is compromised by an attacker.

**How FRP Contributes:** `frpc` acts as a bridge between the internal network and the external `frps` server. A compromised `frpc` host provides a direct entry point into the internal network.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability on the machine running `frpc` (e.g., an outdated operating system or application). Once compromised, they can access the internal network segment and potentially reconfigure `frpc` or pivot to other internal systems.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the internal network, data breaches, lateral movement to other systems, and potential for significant damage.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Harden the `frpc` host:** Implement strong security measures on the machine running `frpc`, including regular patching, strong passwords, and disabling unnecessary services.
* Implement network segmentation:** Isolate the network segment where `frpc` resides to limit the impact of a potential compromise.
* Monitor the `frpc` host for suspicious activity:** Implement intrusion detection and monitoring systems to detect potential compromises.
* Apply the principle of least privilege to the `frpc` process:** Run `frpc` with the minimum necessary privileges.
