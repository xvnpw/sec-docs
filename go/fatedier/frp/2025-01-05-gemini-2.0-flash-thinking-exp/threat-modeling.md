# Threat Model Analysis for fatedier/frp

## Threat: [FRP Server Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/frp_server_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the FRP server software (`frps`) or its dependencies to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could involve sending specially crafted requests or exploiting known vulnerabilities within `frps`.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the FRP server, potentially leading to data breaches, further attacks on internal networks, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** `frps` (main server binary/process)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the FRP server software updated to the latest stable version.
    *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization on the FRP server.
    *   Run the FRP server with minimal privileges.
    *   Use a security scanner to identify potential vulnerabilities in `frps`.
    *   Consider using a hardened operating system for the FRP server.

## Threat: [FRP Client Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/frp_client_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the FRP client software (`frpc`) or its dependencies to execute arbitrary code on the machine running the client. This could involve a compromised FRP server sending malicious instructions or exploiting local vulnerabilities within `frpc`.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the internal machine running the FRP client, potentially leading to access to sensitive internal resources, data theft, or using the compromised machine as a pivot point for further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** `frpc` (main client binary/process)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the FRP client software updated to the latest stable version.
    *   Run the FRP client with minimal privileges.
    *   Restrict network access of the FRP client to only the necessary FRP server.
    *   Monitor the client machine for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [FRP Server Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)](./threats/frp_server_denial_of_service__dos___distributed_denial_of_service__ddos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the FRP server with a large volume of requests, consuming its resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) and making `frps` unavailable for legitimate clients. This directly targets the FRP server's ability to function.
*   **Impact:**  Inability for authorized clients to connect through the FRP server, disrupting access to internal services exposed via FRP.
*   **Affected Component:** `frps` (network handling, connection management)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on the FRP server.
    *   Use a firewall to filter malicious traffic targeting `frps`.
    *   Consider using a DDoS mitigation service specifically for the FRP server's public endpoint.
    *   Properly configure resource limits for the FRP server process.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Tunneled Services](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_tunneled_services.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses FRP's intended access controls and gains access to internal services that are being proxied through `frps`. This could be due to misconfigured access rules within `frps`, weak authentication mechanisms provided by FRP, or vulnerabilities in the FRP server's authentication logic.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive internal applications and data, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or further internal attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** `frps` (authentication, authorization, proxying logic)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize strong authentication mechanisms provided by FRP (e.g., `token`).
    *   Carefully configure access control lists (ACLs) or proxy settings on the FRP server to restrict access to authorized clients only.
    *   Regularly review and audit FRP server configurations.
    *   Implement additional authentication and authorization within the tunneled internal services as a defense-in-depth measure.

## Threat: [Exposure of FRP Server Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_frp_server_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the FRP server's configuration file (`frps.ini`), which is directly used by `frps` and may contain sensitive information such as authentication tokens, bind addresses, and port mappings. This could be due to insecure file permissions or vulnerabilities in the server's file system access.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive credentials allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate clients, modify server behavior within `frps`, or gain insights into the internal network setup facilitated by FRP.
*   **Affected Component:** `frps` (configuration loading and handling)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the FRP server's file system and restrict access to the configuration file using appropriate permissions.
    *   Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in the configuration file; consider using environment variables or secure secrets management that `frps` can access.
    *   Regularly review the permissions of the FRP server's configuration file.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on FRP Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_frp_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication directly between the FRP client and the FRP server, potentially eavesdropping on sensitive data being transmitted through the FRP tunnel or manipulating the traffic intended for `frps` or `frpc`.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data being proxied through FRP, potential manipulation of data in transit affecting the tunneled application, or hijacking of the FRP connection itself.
*   **Affected Component:** Network communication protocols used by `frpc` and `frps`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure secure communication between the FRP client and server using TLS/SSL encryption, a feature directly supported by FRP.
    *   Verify the server's certificate on the client-side to prevent connecting to rogue FRP servers.

## Threat: [FRP Tunnel Hijacking](./threats/frp_tunnel_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manages to take over an existing FRP tunnel, potentially by exploiting vulnerabilities in session management or authentication within `frps`, or by compromising either the `frpc` or `frps` instance.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the internal service being tunneled, potential data interception or manipulation within the established FRP connection, or disruption of legitimate access through FRP.
*   **Affected Component:** `frps` (session management, tunnel management), `frpc` (connection management)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong session management and authentication mechanisms in FRP.
    *   Regularly update FRP components to patch potential vulnerabilities affecting tunnel security.
    *   Monitor FRP connections for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Using FRP as a Command and Control (C2) Channel](./threats/using_frp_as_a_command_and_control__c2__channel.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who has compromised an internal machine uses `frpc` to establish a covert communication channel back to their infrastructure through a rogue FRP server, bypassing traditional firewall rules and security monitoring that might be in place for other protocols.
*   **Impact:**  Allows attackers to maintain persistent access to the internal network, exfiltrate data through the FRP tunnel, or launch further attacks from within the network using FRP's capabilities.
*   **Affected Component:** `frpc` (establishing outbound connections), `frps` (handling inbound connections, potentially a rogue server)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Monitor network traffic for unusual FRP connections or patterns.
    *   Implement egress filtering to restrict outbound connections from internal machines running `frpc` to only known and trusted FRP servers.
    *   Employ endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to detect malicious activity involving `frpc` on internal machines.
