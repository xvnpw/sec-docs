## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit FRP Server Vulnerabilities leading to RCE](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_frp_server_vulnerabilities_leading_to_rce.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker identifies a known vulnerability in the FRP server software. This often involves scanning the server to determine its version and then researching known vulnerabilities for that specific version.
*   **Critical Node: Compromise FRP Server:** The attacker's goal is to gain any level of access to the FRP server.
*   **Attack Vector:** Once a vulnerability is identified, the attacker crafts or uses an existing exploit to take advantage of the flaw.
*   **Critical Node: RCE on FRP Server:** The attacker successfully executes arbitrary code on the FRP server. This grants them complete control over the server's operating system and resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise FRP Server Configuration via Weak Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_frp_server_configuration_via_weak_credentials.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker attempts to log in to the FRP server's management interface using common default credentials (e.g., admin/admin) or weak, easily guessable passwords.
*   **Critical Node: Access FRP Server Management:**  Successful login grants the attacker access to the FRP server's configuration settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise FRP Server Configuration via Insecure Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_frp_server_configuration_via_insecure_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits a misconfiguration in the FRP server. This could involve:
    *   An unprotected management interface accessible without authentication.
    *   Loose access control rules that allow unauthorized access to the management interface or sensitive configuration files.
*   **Critical Node: Access FRP Server Management:** The attacker gains access to the FRP server's configuration settings without proper authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Exposed Internal Services via FRP (especially with Default Credentials)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_exposed_internal_services_via_frp__especially_with_default_credentials_.md)

*   **Critical Node: Access to Internal Network via FRP:** The attacker leverages the intended functionality of FRP to access the internal network. The FRP server acts as a bridge, allowing connections from the internet to internal services.
*   **Attack Vector:** Once inside the internal network via the FRP tunnel, the attacker targets the specific internal services exposed by FRP.
*   **Attack Vector:** A common attack vector here is attempting to log in to these internal services using default or weak credentials that were not changed after deployment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise FRP Server](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_frp_server.md)

This is a critical node because gaining control of the FRP server allows the attacker to:
    *   Reconfigure FRP to expose more internal services.
    *   Intercept and manipulate traffic passing through FRP.
    *   Use the server as a pivot point to attack other systems on the network.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access FRP Server Management](./attack_tree_paths/access_frp_server_management.md)

This is a critical node because it allows the attacker to:
    *   Change the FRP configuration, including access control rules and exposed services.
    *   Potentially add new users or modify existing ones.
    *   Gain insights into the internal network setup.

## Attack Tree Path: [RCE on FRP Server](./attack_tree_paths/rce_on_frp_server.md)

This is a critical node because it grants the attacker the highest level of control, allowing them to:
    *   Install malware or backdoors.
    *   Steal sensitive data from the server.
    *   Use the server for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access to Internal Network via FRP](./attack_tree_paths/access_to_internal_network_via_frp.md)

This is a critical node because it bypasses the network perimeter and allows the attacker to:
    *   Directly interact with internal services.
    *   Potentially move laterally within the network.
