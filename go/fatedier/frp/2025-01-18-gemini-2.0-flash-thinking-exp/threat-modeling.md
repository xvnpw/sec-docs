# Threat Model Analysis for fatedier/frp

## Threat: [Unauthorized FRP Server Access](./threats/unauthorized_frp_server_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the FRP server's operating system or management interface (if enabled) by exploiting weak credentials or vulnerabilities *in the FRP software itself* or its configuration. Once in, the attacker can manipulate the `frps.ini` configuration, create or modify tunnels.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the FRP server, allowing attackers to expose internal services, redirect traffic to malicious destinations, or use the server as a pivot point for further attacks.
    *   **Affected FRP Component:** `frps` binary, `frps.ini` configuration file.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong and unique passwords or key-based authentication for server access, especially if the FRP management interface is enabled.
        *   Disable or secure the FRP server's management interface if not strictly necessary.
        *   Keep the FRP server software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Regularly audit the `frps.ini` configuration for any unauthorized changes.

## Threat: [FRP Server Misconfiguration Leading to Unintended Exposure](./threats/frp_server_misconfiguration_leading_to_unintended_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured `frps.ini` settings can lead to internal services being unintentionally exposed to the public internet *through the FRP server*. This could involve misconfigured `bind_addr`, `vhost_http_port`, `vhost_https_port`, or incorrect tunnel definitions within the FRP configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Sensitive internal services become accessible to unauthorized individuals through the FRP server, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further exploitation of internal systems.
    *   **Affected FRP Component:** `frps.ini` configuration file, `frps` binary (handling tunnel creation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and understand all configuration options in `frps.ini`.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege when defining tunnels within FRP, only exposing necessary services.
        *   Regularly audit the `frps.ini` configuration for any misconfigurations.
        *   Use tools or scripts to validate the `frps.ini` configuration before deploying changes.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attack on FRP Server](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attack_on_frp_server.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the FRP server with connection requests or malicious traffic, overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable to legitimate clients. This directly targets the FRP server's ability to handle connections.
    *   **Impact:** Legitimate users are unable to access internal services proxied through FRP, causing service disruption.
    *   **Affected FRP Component:** `frps` binary (connection handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on the FRP server to restrict the number of connections from a single source.
        *   Ensure the FRP server has sufficient resources to handle expected traffic loads.
        *   Consider using a reverse proxy or CDN in front of the FRP server for added protection.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on FRP Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_frp_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the FRP client (`frpc`) and the FRP server (`frps`). This is possible if TLS encryption is not enabled or is improperly configured *within FRP*, or if vulnerabilities exist in the TLS implementation *used by FRP*. The attacker can eavesdrop on the communication, potentially capturing sensitive data or modifying traffic.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted through the FRP tunnels, potential for injecting malicious data or commands into the FRP communication.
    *   **Affected FRP Component:** Communication channel between `frpc` and `frps`, TLS implementation within `frpc` and `frps`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce TLS encryption for all FRP communication by configuring `tls_enable = true` in both `frps.ini` and `frpc.ini`.**
        *   Use strong TLS versions and cipher suites supported by FRP.
        *   Ensure that the certificates used for TLS are valid and properly configured within FRP.
        *   Regularly update FRP to benefit from the latest security patches for TLS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploitation of FRP Server Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_frp_server_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the `frps` binary itself. This could involve buffer overflows, remote code execution flaws, or other security weaknesses in the FRP server software.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the FRP server, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code, gain control of the server, and access connected internal networks.
    *   **Affected FRP Component:** `frps` binary.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Stay up-to-date with FRP releases and security patches. Regularly update the `frps` binary to the latest stable version.**
        *   Subscribe to security advisories related to FRP to be informed of any newly discovered vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a stable and well-vetted version of FRP.

## Threat: [Compromised FRP Client Host Leading to Malicious Tunnel Creation](./threats/compromised_frp_client_host_leading_to_malicious_tunnel_creation.md)

*   **Description:** While the *host* compromise is the initial event, the direct FRP involvement is the attacker's ability to manipulate the `frpc` process or its configuration *to create malicious tunnels*.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can create malicious tunnels, redirect existing tunnels to malicious destinations, or exfiltrate data from the internal network through the FRP connection.
    *   **Affected FRP Component:** `frpc` binary, `frpc.ini` configuration file.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the host running the FRP client with appropriate security measures (antivirus, firewall, regular patching).
        *   Restrict access to the FRP client configuration file (`frpc.ini`).
        *   Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions on the client machine.

## Threat: [Credential Theft for FRP Client Enabling Unauthorized Tunnel Creation](./threats/credential_theft_for_frp_client_enabling_unauthorized_tunnel_creation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers obtain the authentication credentials (e.g., `auth_token`) used by the FRP client to connect to the server. This allows them to *directly interact with the FRP server to establish unauthorized tunnels*.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can impersonate the legitimate client and establish unauthorized tunnels, potentially bypassing intended security controls and gaining access to internal resources.
    *   **Affected FRP Component:** `frpc.ini` configuration file (storing credentials), authentication mechanism between `frpc` and `frps`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store FRP client credentials. Avoid storing them in plain text in `frpc.ini` if possible (consider environment variables or more secure storage mechanisms).
        *   Use strong and unique authentication tokens.
        *   Restrict access to the `frpc.ini` file.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for unauthorized FRP client connections.

## Threat: [Lateral Movement Through Compromised FRP Tunnels](./threats/lateral_movement_through_compromised_frp_tunnels.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers compromise a service accessible through an FRP tunnel and use *the established FRP tunnel as a pathway* to access other internal systems.
    *   **Impact:** Broader compromise of the internal network.
    *   **Affected FRP Component:** The FRP tunnel itself, facilitating the connection.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong network segmentation to limit lateral movement, even if an FRP tunnel is compromised.
        *   Harden internal systems and services.
        *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to detect suspicious activity within the network, including traffic originating from FRP tunnels.
