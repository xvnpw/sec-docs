# Attack Surface Analysis for fatedier/frp

## Attack Surface: [Publicly Exposed frps Service](./attack_surfaces/publicly_exposed_frps_service.md)

*   **Description:** The frps server, by design, listens for connections on a public IP address and port, making it a direct target for internet-based attacks.
    *   **How FRP Contributes:** FRP's core functionality requires a publicly accessible server to act as the rendezvous point for clients.
    *   **Example:** An attacker scans the internet for open FRP servers and attempts to exploit a known vulnerability in the frps software.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the FRP server, potentially leading to unauthorized access to internal resources, denial of service, or data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the frps software updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement strong firewall rules to restrict access to the frps port to only necessary IP addresses or networks.
        *   Consider using a non-standard port for the frps service (security through obscurity, but not a primary defense).
        *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor for malicious activity targeting the frps server.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure frps Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_frps_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigurations in the `frps.ini` file can introduce significant security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How FRP Contributes:** FRP's behavior and security are heavily reliant on its configuration file.
    *   **Example:** Using a default or weak `token` value allows any client with that token to connect to the server and potentially access configured proxies.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal resources, ability to manipulate or disrupt proxied services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, randomly generated, and unique `token` values for client authentication.
        *   Carefully define allowed client IPs or subnets if possible.
        *   Restrict proxy definitions to only the necessary internal services and ports. Avoid wildcard configurations if possible.
        *   Regularly review and audit the `frps.ini` configuration.
        *   Implement proper file system permissions to protect the `frps.ini` file from unauthorized access.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised frpc Client](./attack_surfaces/compromised_frpc_client.md)

*   **Description:** If the machine running the frpc client is compromised, the attacker can leverage the existing FRP connection to access the internal network.
    *   **How FRP Contributes:** FRP establishes persistent connections from internal networks to the public server, creating a potential backdoor if the client is compromised.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a developer's machine running frpc and uses the established tunnel to access internal databases or other sensitive systems.
    *   **Impact:** Lateral movement within the internal network, access to sensitive data, potential for further compromise of internal systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong security measures on machines running frpc clients (endpoint security, regular patching, strong passwords).
        *   Principle of least privilege: Only grant the frpc client access to the specific internal resources it needs.
        *   Monitor network traffic originating from frpc clients for suspicious activity.
        *   Consider using client-side authentication mechanisms provided by FRP.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in frps or frpc Software](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_frps_or_frpc_software.md)

*   **Description:** Like any software, FRP may contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
    *   **How FRP Contributes:** FRP's code base itself is a potential attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A remote code execution vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of frps, allowing attackers to gain control of the server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the FRP server or client, depending on where the vulnerability exists.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay informed about security advisories and updates for FRP.
        *   Promptly update frps and frpc to the latest stable versions.
        *   Consider using automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential weaknesses.
