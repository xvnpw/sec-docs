## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known FRP Server Vulnerability (e.g., RCE, Authentication Bypass)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_frp_server_vulnerability__e_g___rce__authentication_bypass_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies a publicly known vulnerability in the specific version of the FRP server being used. They then leverage readily available exploit code or develop their own to gain unauthorized access. This could involve remote code execution, allowing them to run arbitrary commands on the server, or bypassing authentication mechanisms to gain administrative privileges.

**Impact:** Critical, as it can lead to full control of the FRP server and potentially the underlying host, allowing access to the internal network and the proxied application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak or Default Authentication Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/weak_or_default_authentication_credentials.md)

**Attack Vector:** The FRP server is configured with default credentials (e.g., admin/admin) or easily guessable passwords. An attacker attempts to log in using these common credentials or employs brute-force techniques to guess the password.

**Impact:** Critical, as successful authentication grants the attacker full control over the FRP server configuration and the ability to establish malicious tunnels.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Access Control Rules](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_access_control_rules.md)

**Attack Vector:** The FRP server's configuration for `bind_addr` or `allow_users` is overly permissive. This allows unauthorized clients or users to connect to the FRP server or access internal services that should be restricted.

**Impact:** High, as it can grant unauthorized access to the internal application or other sensitive services exposed through the FRP tunnel.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of TLS Encryption or Improper TLS Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_tls_encryption_or_improper_tls_configuration.md)

**Attack Vector:** The communication between the FRP client and server is not encrypted using TLS, or the TLS configuration is weak (e.g., using outdated protocols or weak cipher suites). This allows an attacker positioned on the network path to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, intercepting and potentially modifying traffic, including authentication credentials.

**Impact:** High, as it can lead to the theft of FRP server credentials, allowing the attacker to impersonate legitimate clients or intercept sensitive data being transmitted through the tunnel.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Operating System Vulnerabilities (on FRP Server Host)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_operating_system_vulnerabilities__on_frp_server_host_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The operating system running the FRP server has known vulnerabilities that have not been patched. An attacker exploits these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the server's operating system.

**Impact:** Critical, as it grants the attacker full control over the server hosting the FRP service, allowing them to manipulate the FRP configuration, access internal resources, or use the server as a pivot point for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Server Security Practices (on FRP Server Host)](./attack_tree_paths/weak_server_security_practices__on_frp_server_host_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The server hosting the FRP service suffers from common security weaknesses such as weak passwords for user accounts, open and unnecessary ports, or unpatched software. An attacker exploits these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Critical, similar to exploiting OS vulnerabilities, leading to full control of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Operating System Vulnerabilities (on FRP Client Host)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_operating_system_vulnerabilities__on_frp_client_host_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The operating system running the FRP client has known vulnerabilities that have not been patched. An attacker exploits these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the client's operating system.

**Impact:** High, as it allows the attacker to control the FRP client, potentially manipulating its configuration, intercepting traffic, or using it as a stepping stone to access the internal network.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Client Security Practices (on FRP Client Host)](./attack_tree_paths/weak_client_security_practices__on_frp_client_host_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The system running the FRP client suffers from common security weaknesses such as weak user passwords, susceptibility to malware, or lack of proper security configurations. An attacker exploits these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:** High, similar to exploiting OS vulnerabilities on the client, leading to control over the client and its FRP connection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on FRP Tunnel](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_frp_tunnel.md)

**Attack Vector:** If TLS is disabled or improperly configured, an attacker positioned on the network path between the FRP client and server can intercept and potentially modify the communication. This can be used to steal credentials, inject malicious data, or disrupt the connection.

**Impact:** High, potentially leading to credential theft, data manipulation, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Storing Credentials Insecurely (on FRP Client)](./attack_tree_paths/storing_credentials_insecurely__on_frp_client_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The FRP client's configuration file or other storage mechanisms contain the FRP server's credentials in plaintext or easily decryptable form. An attacker who gains access to the client system can retrieve these credentials.

**Impact:** High, as it allows the attacker to directly authenticate to the FRP server and establish malicious tunnels.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Internal Application via Proxied Port](./attack_tree_paths/access_internal_application_via_proxied_port.md)

**Attack Vector:** After successfully compromising the FRP server or client, the attacker uses the established FRP tunnel to access the internal application on the port that is being forwarded.

**Impact:** Critical, as this achieves the attacker's primary goal of gaining unauthorized access to the internal application and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit FRP Server](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_frp_server.md)

Successfully exploiting the FRP server grants the attacker significant control over the reverse proxy mechanism, allowing them to manipulate tunnels, intercept traffic, and potentially access the internal network.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfiguration of FRP Server](./attack_tree_paths/misconfiguration_of_frp_server.md)

Misconfigurations are often the easiest and most common entry points for attackers. A single misconfiguration can have severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the FRP Server Host](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_frp_server_host.md)

Gaining control of the underlying server provides the attacker with extensive capabilities, including full control over the FRP service and the potential to pivot to other internal systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit FRP Client](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_frp_client.md)

Compromising the FRP client allows attackers to manipulate the connection from the internal network side, potentially bypassing server-side security measures or intercepting sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the FRP Client Host](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_frp_client_host.md)

Similar to the server, gaining control of the client host provides a significant foothold within the internal network.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfiguration of FRP Client](./attack_tree_paths/misconfiguration_of_frp_client.md)

Client-side misconfigurations, particularly insecure credential storage, can directly lead to the compromise of the FRP server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Established FRP Tunnel](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_established_frp_tunnel.md)

This node represents the culmination of a successful attack, where the attacker has established a connection through the FRP tunnel and can now access the internal application.
