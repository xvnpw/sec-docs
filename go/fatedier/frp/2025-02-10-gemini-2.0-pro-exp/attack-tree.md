## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access/Disrupt Services via frp](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_accessdisrupt_services_via_frp.md)

**Description:** This is the overarching goal of the attacker. It represents the ultimate objective of any attack targeting the frp-based application.
*   **Likelihood:** N/A (This is the goal, not an attack step)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete compromise of the application's intended functionality and potentially access to sensitive data)
*   **Effort:** N/A
*   **Skill Level:** N/A
*   **Detection Difficulty:** N/A

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise frpc](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_frpc.md)

**Description:** This involves gaining unauthorized control over the frp client (frpc) configuration and/or execution. This is a critical node because it allows direct access to the services exposed through frp.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the security of the client machine and configuration storage)
*   **Impact:** High (Full access to exposed services)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Depends on access to the system)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Depends on logging and intrusion detection)

*   **Sub-Attack Vector: [Steal Config]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker obtains the `frpc.ini` file (or equivalent configuration), which contains sensitive information like the frps server address, authentication tokens, and details about exposed services.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on how the config is stored)
    *   **Impact:** High (Full access to exposed services)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Depends on access to the system)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Depends on logging and intrusion detection)

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise frps](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_frps.md)

**Description:** This involves gaining unauthorized control over the frp server (frps). While often harder than compromising the client, it's still a critical vulnerability.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on the security of the server)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Control over all traffic and exposed services)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

*   **Sub-Attack Vector: ==Expose Unauthorized Service==**
    *   **Description:** This is the most critical and high-risk attack vector. The administrator unintentionally exposes a service that should not be publicly accessible (e.g., a database, internal API). This is a direct result of misconfiguration.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (Common misconfiguration)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Depends on the exposed service â€“ could range from data breaches to complete system compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (The attacker simply needs to connect to the exposed service)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice (No special skills are required beyond basic networking knowledge)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring exposed services and traffic; proactive configuration reviews are crucial)
