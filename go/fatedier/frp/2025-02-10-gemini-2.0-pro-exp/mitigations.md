## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Authentication (Token-Based)](./mitigation_strategies/strong_authentication__token-based_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement mandatory token-based authentication.
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Generate a Strong Token:** Use a cryptographically secure random number generator or a password manager to create a long (at least 32 characters), complex token.
        2.  **Configure `frps.ini`:** On the server, add: `token = YOUR_GENERATED_TOKEN` in the `[common]` section.
        3.  **Configure `frpc.ini`:** On each client, add the same: `token = YOUR_GENERATED_TOKEN` in the `[common]` section.
        4.  **Restart:** Restart both `frps` and `frpc`.
        5.  **Test:** Verify clients can only connect with the correct token.
        6.  **Secure Storage:** Store the token securely (e.g., password manager, secrets management system).
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Client Access (Critical):** Prevents unauthorized `frpc` connections.
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks (High):** Makes brute-forcing the connection infeasible.
        *   **Replay Attacks (Medium):** Reduces effectiveness (TLS further mitigates).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Access: Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
        *   Brute-Force: Risk reduced from High to Negligible.
        *   Replay: Risk reduced from Medium to Low (with TLS).
    *   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) Yes, in `frps.ini` and all `frpc.ini` files. Token in secrets management.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** (Example) Automated token rotation and secrets management API integration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Client Privileges (Precise `frpc.ini` Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_client_privileges__precise__frpc_ini__configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict `frpc` configurations to expose *only* essential services.
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Needs:** Determine the *minimum* services/ports each client needs to expose.
        2.  **`frpc.ini` Specificity:**
            *   Use specific `local_ip` and `local_port` values. Avoid `0.0.0.0` for `local_ip` if possible.
            *   Define only required `remote_port` mappings.
            *   Avoid wildcards or broad port ranges.
            *   Securely configure any `frp` plugins, enabling only if strictly necessary.
        3.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review `frpc.ini` files for minimality.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Lateral Movement (High):** Limits attacker movement if a client is compromised.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium):** Reduces risk of exposing sensitive data.
        *   **Service Exploitation (Medium):** Reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Lateral Movement: Risk reduced from High to Medium.
        *   Information Disclosure: Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
        *   Service Exploitation: Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) Partially. Specific ports mapped, but some `local_ip` are `0.0.0.0`.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** (Example) Audit `frpc.ini` files, change `local_ip` where possible, document exposed service rationale.

## Mitigation Strategy: [TLS Encryption](./mitigation_strategies/tls_encryption.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce TLS encryption for all `frp` communication.
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Obtain Certificates:** Get a certificate from a trusted CA (e.g., Let's Encrypt) or generate a self-signed one (testing only!).
        2.  **Configure `frps.ini`:**
            *   `tls_enable = true`
            *   `tls_cert_file = /path/to/certificate.crt`
            *   `tls_key_file = /path/to/private.key`
        3.  **Configure `frpc.ini`:**
            *   `tls_enable = true`
            *   **(Recommended):** `tls_trusted_ca_file = /path/to/ca.crt` (verifies server certificate).
        4.  **Restart:** Restart `frps` and `frpc`.
        5.  **Verify:** Use a network analyzer to confirm encryption.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Eavesdropping (Critical):** Encrypts communication.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Critical):** Prevents impersonation and interception (especially with CA verification).
        *   **Data Tampering (High):** Provides integrity checks.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Eavesdropping: Risk reduced from Critical to Negligible.
        *   MitM: Risk reduced from Critical to Low (with CA) or Medium (self-signed).
        *   Tampering: Risk reduced from High to Negligible.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) Yes, Let's Encrypt certificates. `tls_enable = true`, `tls_trusted_ca_file` configured.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** (Example) Automated certificate renewal.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Maximum Connections (`max_pool_count`)](./mitigation_strategies/maximum_connections___max_pool_count__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit concurrent connections using `frp`'s built-in setting.
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Estimate Capacity:** Determine the maximum concurrent connections your `frps` server can handle.
        2.  **Configure `frps.ini`:** Set `max_pool_count` in the `[common]` section (e.g., `max_pool_count = 100`).
        3.  **Monitor:** Monitor server performance and adjust as needed.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium):** Helps prevent connection exhaustion.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium):** Prevents resource depletion.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   DoS: Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
        *   Resource Exhaustion: Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) Yes, `max_pool_count = 50` in `frps.ini`.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** (Example) Document rationale for the value, establish review/adjustment process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep frp Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_frp_updated.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly update `frps` and `frpc` to the latest stable versions using official `frp` releases.
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Monitor for Updates:** Regularly check the official frp GitHub repository.
        2.  **Test Updates:** Before deploying to production, test in a staging environment.
        3.  **Update Procedure:** Download new version, stop service, replace binary, restart, verify.
        4.  **Rollback Plan:** Have a plan to revert to the previous version if needed.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High):** Updates often include security patches.
        *   **Bugs and Instability (Low):** Updates can fix bugs.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Vulnerability Exploitation: Risk reduced from High to Low (depending on update promptness).
        *   Bugs/Instability: Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) Partially. Occasional updates, no formal schedule/testing.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** (Example) Formal update schedule, staging environment, documented procedures.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Logging (frp's built-in logging)](./mitigation_strategies/logging__frp's_built-in_logging_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable and configure frp's built-in logging capabilities.
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Configure Logging (`frps.ini` and `frpc.ini`):**
            *   Set `log_level` to `info` (recommended for production) or `debug` (for troubleshooting).
            *   Specify a `log_file` path.
            *   Consider using `log_max_days` to manage log file size.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Intrusion Detection (Medium):** Logs can show attempted/successful intrusions.
        *   **Debugging (Low):** Logs are essential for troubleshooting.
    *   **Impact:**
        *    Intrusion Detection: Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
        *    Debugging: Significantly improved.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) Partially. Basic logging (`log_level = info`), no log rotation.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** (Example) Configure `log_max_days`.
