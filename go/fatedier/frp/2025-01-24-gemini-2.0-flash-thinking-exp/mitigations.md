## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to frp Server Control Port](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to_frp_server_control_port.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Restrict Access to frp Server Control Port

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify the IP addresses or network ranges that require administrative access to the frp server control port (default 7000). This should typically be limited to your operations or infrastructure team's networks.
    *   Step 2: Configure your firewall (e.g., iptables, firewalld, cloud provider security groups) rules on the frp server.
    *   Step 3: Create rules that explicitly allow inbound traffic to the frp server control port (TCP 7000 by default) only from the identified authorized IP addresses or network ranges.
    *   Step 4: Implement a default deny rule for all other inbound traffic to the control port. This ensures that only explicitly allowed sources can connect.
    *   Step 5: Regularly review and update these firewall rules as your team's network configuration changes.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to frp Server Control Panel - Severity: High.  An attacker gaining access can reconfigure the server, create malicious tunnels, and potentially compromise internal services.
    *   Brute-Force Attacks on Control Port - Severity: Medium.  Exposing the control port to the internet increases the risk of brute-force attacks attempting to guess authentication credentials (if enabled) or exploit potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Information Disclosure via Control Port - Severity: Low to Medium.  Even without authentication bypass, an exposed control port might leak version information or other details that could aid reconnaissance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to frp Server Control Panel: High Risk Reduction.  Significantly reduces the attack surface by limiting who can even attempt to connect to the control port.
    *   Brute-Force Attacks on Control Port: Medium Risk Reduction. Reduces the likelihood of successful brute-force attacks by limiting the attack origin points.
    *   Information Disclosure via Control Port: Low to Medium Risk Reduction. Minimizes potential information leakage from the control port.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented on the cloud provider firewall level, restricting access to the control port to the operations team's VPN IP range.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No missing implementation currently. Firewall rules are in place and regularly reviewed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Strong Authentication for frp Server](./mitigation_strategies/enable_strong_authentication_for_frp_server.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Enable Strong Authentication for frp Server

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: In the `frps.ini` configuration file on the frp server, choose an authentication method.  The recommended method is using a token (`token = your_strong_token`). Alternatively, username/password authentication (`auth_method = token, username, password`, `username = your_username`, `password = your_password`) can be used.
    *   Step 2: Generate a strong, unique token or password. Use a cryptographically secure random string generator for tokens. For passwords, follow strong password guidelines (length, complexity, uniqueness).
    *   Step 3: Configure all frp clients (`frpc.ini`) to use the same authentication token or username/password by setting the `token` or `username` and `password` parameters under the `[common]` section.
    *   Step 4: Securely distribute the token or credentials to authorized frp clients. Avoid embedding them directly in publicly accessible code repositories. Use secure configuration management or secrets management tools.
    *   Step 5: Regularly rotate the authentication token or password (e.g., every 3-6 months) to limit the impact of potential credential compromise. Update both server and client configurations during rotation.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to frp Server Control Panel (if control port is exposed) - Severity: High. Prevents unauthorized users from controlling the frp server even if they can reach the control port.
    *   Malicious Tunnel Creation - Severity: High.  Prevents attackers from creating tunnels through your frp server to access internal resources if they bypass control port restrictions.
    *   Server Configuration Tampering - Severity: High.  Protects the frp server configuration from unauthorized modifications via the control panel.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to frp Server Control Panel: High Risk Reduction.  Authentication is a critical layer of defense against unauthorized control.
    *   Malicious Tunnel Creation: High Risk Reduction.  Authentication prevents unauthorized tunnel creation, a primary attack vector through frp.
    *   Server Configuration Tampering: High Risk Reduction.  Authentication safeguards the server's configuration integrity.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Token-based authentication is implemented on the frp server and all clients. Tokens are managed using a secrets management system.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Password rotation is currently a manual process. Automating token rotation and distribution would further improve security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize frp Server Privileges](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_frp_server_privileges.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Minimize frp Server Privileges

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Create a dedicated system user account specifically for running the frp server process.  Choose a username that clearly indicates its purpose (e.g., `frpserver`).
    *   Step 2: Ensure this user account has minimal privileges. It should not have root or administrator privileges.
    *   Step 3: Change the ownership of the frp server executable and the `frps.ini` configuration file to this dedicated user and group.
    *   Step 4: Set restrictive file permissions on the frp server executable and `frps.ini` file.  For example, owner read/write/execute, group read/execute, others none (e.g., `chmod 750 frps frps.ini`).
    *   Step 5: Configure the system service (e.g., systemd unit file) for the frp server to run as this dedicated user.  Use the `User=` and `Group=` directives in the service file.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Privilege Escalation after Compromise - Severity: High.  If the frp server process is compromised, limiting its privileges restricts the attacker's ability to escalate to root or other high-privilege accounts and perform further malicious actions on the server.
    *   Lateral Movement after Compromise - Severity: Medium to High. Reduced privileges limit the attacker's ability to use the compromised frp server as a pivot point to access other systems or resources.
    *   Data Breach due to Server Compromise - Severity: Medium.  While frp itself doesn't store application data, reduced privileges can limit the attacker's ability to access sensitive data on the server file system or connected network segments.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Privilege Escalation after Compromise: High Risk Reduction.  Significantly limits the impact of a server compromise by preventing easy privilege escalation.
    *   Lateral Movement after Compromise: Medium to High Risk Reduction. Makes lateral movement more difficult and time-consuming for an attacker.
    *   Data Breach due to Server Compromise: Medium Risk Reduction. Reduces the potential scope of data access in case of a server breach.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The frp server is run under a dedicated non-privileged user account (`frpserver`). File permissions are set appropriately.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No missing implementation currently. Privilege minimization is in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Client Authentication and Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_client_authentication_and_authorization.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Utilize Client Authentication and Authorization

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Ensure client authentication is enabled on the frp server (as described in "Enable Strong Authentication for frp Server"). This is the foundation for client authorization.
    *   Step 2: For each frp client configuration (`frpc.ini`), carefully define the tunnels (`[ssh]`, `[web]`, etc.) and the services they expose.
    *   Step 3: Adhere to the principle of least privilege. Only expose the absolutely necessary services and ports through frp tunnels. Avoid wildcard port ranges or exposing entire networks.
    *   Step 4: If possible, implement further authorization within the tunneled applications themselves. For example, if tunneling SSH, use SSH key-based authentication and restrict user access on the target server.
    *   Step 5: Regularly review and audit frp client configurations to ensure they remain necessary and follow the principle of least privilege. Remove or disable outdated or unnecessary client configurations.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Internal Services via frp Tunnels - Severity: High.  Without proper client authorization, any client with valid server credentials could create tunnels to any internal service, bypassing intended access controls.
    *   Lateral Movement via frp Tunnels - Severity: High.  Compromised clients or malicious insiders could create tunnels to gain unauthorized access to internal networks and facilitate lateral movement.
    *   Data Exfiltration via frp Tunnels - Severity: High.  Attackers could create tunnels to exfiltrate sensitive data from internal systems through the frp server.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Internal Services via frp Tunnels: High Risk Reduction.  Client authorization ensures only intended clients can establish specific tunnels.
    *   Lateral Movement via frp Tunnels: High Risk Reduction.  Restricts the ability to create arbitrary tunnels for lateral movement.
    *   Data Exfiltration via frp Tunnels: High Risk Reduction.  Limits the potential for unauthorized data exfiltration through frp.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Client authentication is enforced. Client configurations are reviewed during deployment, but regular audits are not yet automated.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated periodic audits of frp client configurations to ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege and identify any deviations or unnecessary tunnels.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable TLS Encryption for Control Connection](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tls_encryption_for_control_connection.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Enable TLS Encryption for Control Connection

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: In both `frps.ini` (server) and `frpc.ini` (client) configuration files, set the `tls_enable = true` option under the `[common]` section.
    *   Step 2: Ensure that the frp server and clients have access to necessary TLS libraries (typically included in standard operating system distributions).
    *   Step 3: Restart both the frp server and all frp clients for the TLS encryption setting to take effect.
    *   Step 4: Verify that TLS encryption is active by monitoring network traffic between frp clients and the server. Use network analysis tools (e.g., Wireshark) to confirm encrypted communication on the control port.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Eavesdropping on Control Channel - Severity: Medium. Without TLS, the control communication (including authentication credentials and tunnel configurations) is transmitted in plaintext, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping by network attackers.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Control Channel - Severity: Medium to High.  Without TLS, an attacker could intercept and manipulate control communication, potentially hijacking tunnels, injecting malicious configurations, or impersonating clients or the server.
    *   Credential Theft via Network Sniffing - Severity: High (if authentication is compromised). If authentication credentials are transmitted in plaintext, they can be easily captured by network sniffers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Eavesdropping on Control Channel: Medium Risk Reduction.  TLS encryption makes it significantly harder for attackers to passively eavesdrop on control communication.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Control Channel: Medium to High Risk Reduction. TLS provides strong protection against MITM attacks by ensuring the integrity and authenticity of communication.
    *   Credential Theft via Network Sniffing: High Risk Reduction. TLS encryption protects authentication credentials during transmission.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   TLS encryption is enabled for the control connection between frp server and clients.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No missing implementation currently. TLS encryption is active.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable frp Server Logging and Monitoring](./mitigation_strategies/enable_frp_server_logging_and_monitoring.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Enable frp Server Logging and Monitoring

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: In the `frps.ini` configuration file, configure logging options:
        *   `log_file = /var/log/frps.log` (Specify a log file path)
        *   `log_level = INFO` (Set the desired log level - INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG)
        *   `log_max_days = 7` (Configure log rotation to keep logs for a defined number of days)
    *   Step 2: Ensure the frp server process has write permissions to the specified log file directory.
    *   Step 3: Integrate frp server logs into a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, Graylog) for easier analysis and alerting.
    *   Step 4: Set up monitoring for key frp server metrics:
        *   CPU and memory usage
        *   Network traffic (inbound/outbound)
        *   Number of active client connections
        *   Error rates in logs
    *   Step 5: Configure alerts for critical security events detected in logs (e.g., failed authentication attempts, connection errors, unusual traffic patterns) and performance anomalies.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Delayed Detection of Security Incidents - Severity: Medium to High. Without logging and monitoring, security breaches or malicious activity might go unnoticed for extended periods, increasing the potential damage.
    *   Lack of Audit Trail - Severity: Medium.  Without logs, it's difficult to investigate security incidents, identify the root cause, and implement effective remediation measures.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks - Severity: Medium. Monitoring can help detect DoS attacks targeting the frp server by observing unusual traffic patterns or resource exhaustion.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Delayed Detection of Security Incidents: Medium to High Risk Reduction. Logging and monitoring enable faster detection and response to security incidents.
    *   Lack of Audit Trail: Medium Risk Reduction. Logs provide valuable audit trails for security investigations and compliance purposes.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: Medium Risk Reduction. Monitoring helps in identifying and mitigating DoS attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   frp server logging is enabled to a local log file. Basic monitoring of server resource usage is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Integration of frp server logs into the centralized logging system is missing. Alerting on security events and performance anomalies is not yet fully configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep frp Server and Clients Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_frp_server_and_clients_updated.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Keep frp Server and Clients Updated

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Regularly check the `fatedier/frp` GitHub repository for new releases and security advisories. Subscribe to project release notifications or watch the repository.
    *   Step 2: When a new version is released, review the release notes to identify any security fixes or vulnerability patches.
    *   Step 3: Plan and schedule updates for both the frp server and all frp clients. Follow the project's update instructions.
    *   Step 4: Test updates in a non-production environment before deploying them to production to ensure compatibility and stability.
    *   Step 5: Implement a process for regularly updating frp components as part of your ongoing security maintenance. Consider using automated update tools if feasible.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities - Severity: High. Outdated software is vulnerable to publicly known security exploits. Failing to update frp server and clients leaves them exposed to these vulnerabilities.
    *   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Reduced Risk) - Severity: Variable, but potentially High. While updates don't directly prevent zero-day exploits, staying up-to-date ensures you benefit from community and developer efforts to quickly patch newly discovered vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: High Risk Reduction.  Regular updates are crucial for patching known vulnerabilities and preventing their exploitation.
    *   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Reduced Risk): Medium Risk Reduction.  While not a direct mitigation, timely updates contribute to a more secure overall posture and faster patching of future vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   frp server and clients are updated manually when new releases are announced.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated checks for new frp releases and a streamlined process for testing and deploying updates are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Segmentation and Isolation for frp Server](./mitigation_strategies/network_segmentation_and_isolation_for_frp_server.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Network Segmentation and Isolation for frp Server

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Deploy the frp server in a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) or a dedicated network segment that is isolated from your internal, more sensitive networks.
    *   Step 2: Configure firewall rules to strictly control network traffic to and from the frp server's DMZ segment.
        *   Allow only necessary inbound traffic to the frp server (e.g., from the internet for client connections, from authorized admin networks for control port access).
        *   Restrict outbound traffic from the frp server's DMZ to internal networks. Only allow connections to specific, necessary services and ports on internal systems that are intended to be tunneled. Implement strict deny-all-other outbound rules.
    *   Step 3: If possible, further segment the network where the services being tunneled by frp reside. This limits the impact if a tunnel is compromised.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Lateral Movement from Compromised frp Server - Severity: High. If the frp server is compromised, network segmentation limits the attacker's ability to move laterally into internal networks and access sensitive systems.
    *   Data Breach Scope Reduction - Severity: High.  Segmentation reduces the potential blast radius of a security breach originating from the frp server.
    *   Impact of Server Vulnerabilities - Severity: Medium to High.  Even if vulnerabilities in the frp server are exploited, segmentation limits the attacker's access to internal resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Lateral Movement from Compromised frp Server: High Risk Reduction. Network segmentation is a fundamental control to prevent lateral movement.
    *   Data Breach Scope Reduction: High Risk Reduction. Significantly limits the potential damage from a breach.
    *   Impact of Server Vulnerabilities: Medium to High Risk Reduction. Reduces the exploitability and impact of server-side vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The frp server is deployed in a DMZ network segment. Firewall rules are in place to control inbound and outbound traffic.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Further network segmentation for the services being tunneled by frp is not fully implemented.  More granular segmentation could be considered for higher-risk tunneled services.
