# Threat Model Analysis for cilium/cilium

## Threat: [eBPF Program Exploitation](./threats/ebpf_program_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:**  Exploitation of a vulnerability in a Cilium-loaded eBPF program.
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious network traffic or exploits a vulnerability in a legitimate application to trigger a bug in an eBPF program (e.g., a buffer overflow, integer overflow, or logic error). This could be a vulnerability in Cilium's own eBPF code. The attacker aims to gain arbitrary code execution within the kernel context.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete node compromise (root access).
    *   Bypass of all network policies.
    *   Data exfiltration.
    *   Denial of service (DoS) for the entire node.
    *   Lateral movement to other nodes.
*   **Affected Component:**  Cilium Agent (specifically the eBPF programs loaded into the kernel, including `bpf_netdev.c`, `bpf_lxc.c`).  The vulnerability could reside within the datapath processing logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Cilium Updates:**  Apply security updates and patches for Cilium promptly.  Subscribe to security advisories.
    *   **Kernel Hardening:**  Enable kernel security features like SELinux, AppArmor, and seccomp to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
    *   **eBPF Verifier:** Rely on the kernel's eBPF verifier, but understand its limitations.  It cannot catch all logic errors.
    *   **Runtime Security Monitoring:**  Use tools like Falco or Tracee to detect anomalous eBPF program behavior at runtime.
    *   **Fuzzing:** Consider fuzzing Cilium's eBPF programs to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Cilium Agent Denial of Service](./threats/cilium_agent_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Threat:**  Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack against the Cilium agent.
*   **Description:** An attacker sends a flood of network traffic, malformed packets, or API requests designed to overwhelm the Cilium agent.  This could target specific agent functionalities, such as policy enforcement, connection tracking, or the API server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Loss of network connectivity for all pods on the affected node.
    *   Bypass of network policies (if the agent becomes unresponsive).
    *   Disruption of Cilium's control plane functions.
*   **Affected Component:** Cilium Agent (various components, including the policy engine, connection tracking table, API server, and datapath interaction).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Limits:**  Set appropriate CPU and memory limits for the Cilium agent container.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Utilize Cilium's built-in rate limiting features for API requests and other operations.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Cilium agent's control plane traffic from potentially malicious application traffic.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Monitor the Cilium agent's resource usage and performance.  Set up alerts for high CPU/memory usage or connection drops.
    *   **Traffic Shaping:** Consider using traffic shaping to prioritize Cilium agent traffic.

## Threat: [Network Policy Bypass via Misconfiguration](./threats/network_policy_bypass_via_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Threat:**  Bypass of intended network policies due to misconfiguration.
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits an overly permissive or incorrectly configured CiliumNetworkPolicy.  This could involve missing rules, incorrect CIDR ranges, incorrect label selectors, or logical errors in the policy definition. The attacker gains unauthorized network access to services or pods.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data or services.
    *   Lateral movement within the cluster.
    *   Exfiltration of data.
    *   Compromise of other pods or services.
*   **Affected Component:** Cilium Agent (policy enforcement engine), Cilium Operator (if it's involved in policy management).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Policy Validation:**  Use `cilium policy validate` and other validation tools to check policy syntax and semantics.
    *   **Policy Testing:**  Implement a robust testing strategy for network policies, including both positive and negative tests.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Adhere to the principle of least privilege, allowing only the minimum necessary network communication.
    *   **Default Deny:**  Start with a "default deny" policy and explicitly allow required traffic.
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Periodically review and audit all network policies.
    *   **RBAC:**  Use Kubernetes RBAC to restrict who can create, modify, or delete network policies.
    *   **Policy as Code:**  Manage network policies as code (e.g., YAML files in Git) for version control, review, and automated deployment.

## Threat: [Cilium Operator Compromise](./threats/cilium_operator_compromise.md)

*   **Threat:**  Compromise of the Cilium Operator.
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Cilium Operator or gains unauthorized access to its credentials.  This allows the attacker to manipulate Cilium's configuration, potentially deploying malicious network policies, disabling security features, or gaining control over Cilium agents.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Widespread disruption of network connectivity.
    *   Bypass of all network policies.
    *   Potential compromise of all Cilium agents.
    *   Loss of control over the Cilium deployment.
*   **Affected Component:** Cilium Operator.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Run the Cilium Operator with the minimum necessary Kubernetes permissions.
    *   **RBAC:**  Strictly control access to the Cilium Operator's resources using Kubernetes RBAC.
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep the Cilium Operator updated to the latest stable version.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Scan the Cilium Operator container image for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Monitoring:**  Monitor the Cilium Operator's logs and resource usage for suspicious activity.
    *   **Image Provenance:** Use signed container images to ensure the integrity of the operator.

## Threat: [Encryption Key Compromise (IPsec/WireGuard)](./threats/encryption_key_compromise__ipsecwireguard_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Compromise of encryption keys used for Cilium's IPsec or WireGuard encryption.
*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the encryption keys used to secure node-to-node communication. This could be through a vulnerability in the key management system or a compromised node.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks on encrypted traffic.
    *   Decryption of sensitive data in transit.
    *   Loss of confidentiality for inter-node communication.
*   **Affected Component:** Cilium Agent (encryption/decryption modules), Key Management System (if used, and managed by Cilium).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Key Management:**  Use a robust and secure key management system (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, or a dedicated KMS).  *Crucially*, if Cilium is managing the key material (e.g., through its automated key rotation), ensure *that* mechanism is properly secured.
    *   **Key Rotation:**  Implement regular and automated key rotation. Cilium provides built-in support for this; ensure it's enabled and configured correctly.
    *   **Access Control:**  Strictly control access to encryption keys.
    *   **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):**  Consider using HSMs to protect encryption keys.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor for any unauthorized access attempts to key management systems.

## Threat: [BGP Route Hijacking (If using Cilium's BGP features)](./threats/bgp_route_hijacking__if_using_cilium's_bgp_features_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Injection of malicious BGP routes.
*   **Description:** An attacker, either external or internal, injects false BGP routing information into the network, causing traffic to be redirected to the attacker's control. This *directly* impacts Cilium's BGP functionality.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Traffic interception (MitM attacks).
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Data exfiltration.
*   **Affected Component:** Cilium Agent (BGP control plane components).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Route Filtering:**  Implement strict BGP route filters to accept only expected routes from trusted peers.
    *   **BGP Authentication:**  Use BGP authentication (e.g., MD5 passwords, TCP-AO) to secure BGP sessions.
    *   **RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure):**  Deploy RPKI to validate the origin of BGP routes.
    *   **Maximum Prefix Limits:** Configure maximum prefix limits to prevent route table exhaustion.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor BGP routing tables for unexpected changes.
