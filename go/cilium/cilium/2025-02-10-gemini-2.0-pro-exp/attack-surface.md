# Attack Surface Analysis for cilium/cilium

## Attack Surface: [1. eBPF Program Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/1__ebpf_program_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of flaws in Cilium's *own* eBPF programs running in the kernel. This excludes vulnerabilities in the kernel itself, focusing solely on Cilium's code.
    *   **Cilium Contribution:** Cilium's core functionality relies on loading and executing *its own* eBPF programs for networking and security.
    *   **Example:** A crafted network packet triggers a buffer overflow in a Cilium-written eBPF program responsible for L7 HTTP filtering, leading to kernel panic.
    *   **Impact:** Kernel crash (DoS), privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution in kernel context, bypass of security policies, data exfiltration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Rigorous code review, fuzz testing, static analysis, and formal verification (where feasible) of *Cilium's* eBPF code. Adhere to secure coding practices for eBPF.
        *   **Users:** Keep Cilium updated. Monitor eBPF program behavior (Hubble). Consider using seccomp/AppArmor/SELinux to restrict Cilium agent capabilities (reducing the impact of a compromised agent loading malicious eBPF).

## Attack Surface: [2. Cilium Agent Compromise](./attack_surfaces/2__cilium_agent_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the `cilium-agent` process. This focuses on vulnerabilities *within* the Cilium agent's code, not general container escapes.
    *   **Cilium Contribution:** The `cilium-agent` is Cilium's core component on each node.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *in the Cilium agent's code* (e.g., a buffer overflow in its API handling) to gain control of the agent process.
    *   **Impact:** Disabling/modification of network policies, loading of malicious eBPF programs (authored by Cilium or the attacker), disruption of node networking. Access to Kubernetes API credentials is a *consequence* of agent compromise, but the vulnerability is *within* the agent.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Minimize the attack surface of the agent's code. Use secure coding practices. Implement robust input validation.
        *   **Users:** Run the agent with least privileges (RBAC). Use network policies to restrict *the agent's* network access. Employ container security best practices (minimal base images, read-only root filesystem). Monitor the agent.

## Attack Surface: [3. Cilium Operator Compromise](./attack_surfaces/3__cilium_operator_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the `cilium-operator` process, focusing on vulnerabilities *within* the operator's code.
    *   **Cilium Contribution:** The `cilium-operator` is Cilium's management component.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *in the Cilium operator's code* to gain control.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of malicious Cilium configurations, downgrading Cilium, disruption of Cilium across the cluster.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Minimize attack surface, secure coding practices.
        *   **Users:** Least Privilege/RBAC, update regularly, monitor, container security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [4. Malicious/Misconfigured Cilium Network Policies](./attack_surfaces/4__maliciousmisconfigured_cilium_network_policies.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of overly permissive or incorrectly configured `CiliumNetworkPolicy` resources, or injection of malicious policies. This focuses on the *Cilium-specific* policy features and enforcement.
    *   **Cilium Contribution:** Cilium *extends* Kubernetes Network Policies with its own `CiliumNetworkPolicy` CRD and advanced features (L7, FQDN).
    *   **Example:** A `CiliumNetworkPolicy` using L7 filtering has a flawed regular expression that allows an attacker to bypass intended restrictions. Or, an attacker with write access to `CiliumNetworkPolicy` objects creates a policy that allows them to bypass existing *Cilium-enforced* restrictions.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to services, bypassing *Cilium's* security controls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Provide tools/documentation for policy creation/validation. Robust policy validation in Cilium.
        *   **Users:** Review/test policies. Policy-as-code, version control, peer review. Validation checks. RBAC on `CiliumNetworkPolicy` resources.

## Attack Surface: [5. Cluster Mesh Misconfiguration/Compromise (Cilium-Specific Aspects)](./attack_surfaces/5__cluster_mesh_misconfigurationcompromise__cilium-specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Description:** Security issues arising from *Cilium's* implementation of Cluster Mesh, focusing on vulnerabilities in Cilium's inter-cluster communication mechanisms.
    *   **Cilium Contribution:** Cluster Mesh is a *Cilium feature* for connecting clusters.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in Cilium's Cluster Mesh implementation allows an attacker to bypass mTLS authentication between clusters. Or, a misconfiguration in Cilium's service routing across clusters exposes services unintentionally.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-cluster attacks, unauthorized access to services in connected clusters.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Secure design and implementation of Cluster Mesh components.
        *   **Users:** Strong security in *each* cluster. Carefully configure peering/policies. Use mTLS. Audit Cluster Mesh configuration.
