## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Policy Enforcement with Least Privilege (CiliumNetworkPolicy)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_policy_enforcement_with_least_privilege__ciliumnetworkpolicy_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Strict Policy Enforcement with Least Privilege (CiliumNetworkPolicy)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Default Deny with Cilium:** Create a `ClusterwideCiliumNetworkPolicy` that sets `spec: {}` (empty spec). This acts as a global default-deny, blocking *all* traffic unless explicitly allowed by other Cilium policies.
    2.  **Precise `CiliumNetworkPolicy` Definitions:** For *every* allowed communication path, create a `CiliumNetworkPolicy` (namespaced) or `ClusterwideCiliumNetworkPolicy` (cluster-wide) that uses highly specific selectors:
        *   **`endpointSelector`:** Target specific pods using labels.  Avoid broad matches.  Use label combinations for precision (e.g., `app: my-app, tier: frontend`).
        *   **`ingress` and `egress` Rules:** Define separate rules for inbound and outbound traffic.
        *   **`fromEndpoints` / `toEndpoints`:** Use these within `ingress`/`egress` rules to specify source and destination *pods* as precisely as possible, again using label selectors.
        *   **`fromCIDRs` / `toCIDRs` (Use with Extreme Caution):** If CIDR-based rules are *unavoidable*, use the *smallest* possible CIDR blocks.  Document the justification for each CIDR rule.  Prefer endpoint selectors whenever possible.
        *   **`fromEntities` / `toEntities` (Use Sparingly):** Use entities like `world`, `cluster`, `host`, `remote-node`, `init` only when absolutely necessary and with a full understanding of their scope.  Document the rationale.
        *   **`ports`:**  Within each `ingress`/`egress` rule, specify the allowed `protocol` (TCP, UDP, ICMP) and `port` (or port range).  *Never* use an empty `ports` array (which allows all ports).
    3.  **Policy Layering:** Understand how `CiliumNetworkPolicy` (namespaced) and `ClusterwideCiliumNetworkPolicy` interact.  Namespaced policies take precedence within their namespace.
    4.  **Regular Review:**  Schedule periodic reviews (e.g., monthly, quarterly) of *all* Cilium policies.  Involve security and application teams.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Network Access (Severity: Critical):** Directly prevents unauthorized communication between pods and external entities.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Severity: High):**  Limits an attacker's ability to move between compromised pods.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):**  Controls outbound traffic, hindering data theft.
    *   **Policy Bypass (Severity: High):**  Reduces the attack surface for exploiting policy errors.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Network Access:** Risk significantly reduced (Critical to Low/Medium).
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Medium/Low).
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Medium/Low).
    *   **Policy Bypass:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Medium).
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "Default-deny `ClusterwideCiliumNetworkPolicy` named `default-deny-all` is in place.  `CiliumNetworkPolicy` files in the `policies/` directory define specific allow rules for each application, using `endpointSelector` and `ports` extensively."
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "The `database-policy` still uses a `toCIDRs` rule with `0.0.0.0/0`, which needs to be replaced with specific endpoint selectors or a much smaller CIDR." or "We lack a formal review process for Cilium policies."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Automated Policy Validation and Testing (using `cilium` CLI)](./mitigation_strategies/automated_policy_validation_and_testing__using__cilium__cli_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Automated Policy Validation and Testing (using `cilium` CLI)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`cilium policy get`:**  Use this command to retrieve the *currently applied* policies.  Integrate this into scripts to capture the baseline policy state.
    2.  **`cilium policy trace`:** This is the *core* testing tool.  Create scripts that use `cilium policy trace` to:
        *   **Simulate Traffic:**  Define source and destination endpoints (using labels or IPs) and ports.
        *   **Verify Allowed Traffic:**  Run `cilium policy trace` for *expected* communication paths and assert that the output shows "Allowed".
        *   **Verify Blocked Traffic:**  Run `cilium policy trace` for *forbidden* communication paths and assert that the output shows "Denied".  This is *critical* for catching bypasses.
        *   **Test Policy Interactions:**  Simulate traffic that might be affected by multiple policies to ensure the combined effect is as intended.
    3.  **Scripting and Automation:**  Write scripts (Bash, Python, etc.) to automate the execution of `cilium policy get` and `cilium policy trace` with various inputs.
    4.  **CI/CD Integration:**  Incorporate these scripts into your CI/CD pipeline.  Run the tests whenever Cilium policy files are changed.  Fail the pipeline if any test fails.
    5.  **Regular Test Updates:**  As your application and policies evolve, update the test scripts to reflect the changes.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Policy Misconfiguration (Severity: Critical):**  Detects errors in policy syntax, logic, and unintended consequences.
    *   **Policy Bypass (Severity: High):**  Identifies scenarios where traffic is allowed that should be blocked.
    *   **Regression Errors (Severity: Medium):**  Ensures that policy changes don't introduce new vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Policy Misconfiguration:** Risk significantly reduced (Critical to Low/Medium).
    *   **Policy Bypass:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Medium).
    *   **Regression Errors:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "We have a Python script (`test_cilium_policies.py`) that uses `cilium policy trace` to test a set of predefined allowed and denied traffic flows.  This script is executed as part of our Jenkins CI pipeline."
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "The test script only covers positive tests (allowed traffic).  We need to add negative tests (blocked traffic)." or "The tests are not automatically run on every policy change."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Hubble Relay/UI Access (using Cilium Config)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_hubble_relayui_access__using_cilium_config_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Hubble Relay/UI Access (using Cilium Config)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Authentication (Cilium Config):** Configure authentication for the Hubble Relay *directly within Cilium's configuration*. This often involves setting up mTLS:
        *   **Generate Certificates:** Create client and server certificates for the Hubble Relay and UI.
        *   **Cilium Agent Configuration:** Configure the Cilium agent (usually via a ConfigMap in Kubernetes) to use these certificates for mTLS authentication.  Specify the paths to the certificate files.
        *   **Hubble Relay Configuration:** Configure the Hubble Relay to require client certificates.
        *   **Hubble UI Configuration:** Configure the Hubble UI to present its client certificate when connecting to the Relay.
    2.  **TLS Encryption (Cilium Config):** Ensure TLS is enabled for *all* Hubble communication. This is typically configured alongside mTLS.
    3.  **Network Segmentation (CiliumNetworkPolicy):** Use `CiliumNetworkPolicy` to restrict network access to the Hubble Relay.  Allow access *only* from authorized pods (e.g., the Hubble UI pod, specific monitoring tools).  Block all other traffic.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Hubble Data (Severity: High):** Prevents unauthorized access to network flow information.
    *   **Data Leakage (Severity: High):** Protects sensitive network data from exposure.
    *   **Reconnaissance (Severity: Medium):** Hinders attackers from gathering network topology information.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Hubble Data:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Medium).
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Medium).
    *   **Reconnaissance:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "mTLS is enabled for Hubble Relay and UI.  Certificate paths are configured in the `cilium-config` ConfigMap.  A `CiliumNetworkPolicy` named `hubble-access` restricts access to the Relay to only the `hubble-ui` pod."
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "Hubble is currently using plain HTTP (no TLS). We need to configure mTLS and update the Cilium agent and Relay configurations." or "There's no `CiliumNetworkPolicy` restricting access to the Hubble Relay; it's accessible from any pod in the cluster."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits for Cilium Agent (via Cilium DaemonSet)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_for_cilium_agent__via_cilium_daemonset_.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Resource Limits for Cilium Agent (via Cilium DaemonSet)**

* **Description:**
    1.  **Edit Cilium DaemonSet:** Modify the Cilium DaemonSet definition (usually a YAML file).
    2.  **Set Resource Requests and Limits:** Within the Cilium agent container specification, set `resources.requests` and `resources.limits` for CPU and memory.
        *   **`requests`:** The minimum resources guaranteed to the Cilium agent.
        *   **`limits`:** The maximum resources the Cilium agent is allowed to consume.
    3.  **Performance Testing:** Base the resource values on performance testing under realistic load conditions.  Start with conservative limits and adjust as needed.
    4.  **Monitor Cilium Metrics:** Use Cilium's Prometheus metrics (or other monitoring tools) to track the agent's resource usage and identify potential bottlenecks or overconsumption.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) against Cilium (Severity: Medium):** Prevents the Cilium agent from consuming excessive resources and impacting other applications or the node itself.
    *   **Cilium Agent Failure (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of the agent crashing due to resource exhaustion.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) against Cilium:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
    *   **Cilium Agent Failure:** Risk reduced (High to Medium).
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "The Cilium DaemonSet (`cilium.yaml`) has `resources.requests` and `resources.limits` set for CPU and memory for the `cilium-agent` container, based on our performance testing results."
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "The Cilium DaemonSet currently has no resource limits defined for the `cilium-agent` container." or "We need to conduct more thorough performance testing to determine appropriate resource limits."
