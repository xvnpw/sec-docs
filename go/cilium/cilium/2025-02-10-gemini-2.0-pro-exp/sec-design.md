# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC): Cilium follows a secure development lifecycle, including code reviews, static analysis, and fuzzing. This is evident in their contribution guidelines, CI/CD pipelines, and security documentation.
*   security control: Regular Security Audits: Cilium undergoes regular security audits by third-party firms. Audit reports are publicly available.
*   security control: Vulnerability Management Process: Cilium has a documented vulnerability management process, including a security mailing list and a bug bounty program.
*   security control: Network Policies: Cilium enforces Kubernetes Network Policies and provides extended network policy capabilities (e.g., L7 policies, FQDN policies). Implemented within Cilium's core functionality.
*   security control: Encryption: Cilium supports encryption of network traffic using IPsec or WireGuard. Described in Cilium's documentation and configurable via Cilium CLI and Kubernetes manifests.
*   security control: Observability: Cilium provides deep observability into network traffic and security events through Hubble. Hubble UI, CLI, and API provide visibility.
*   security control: eBPF: Cilium leverages eBPF for efficient and secure packet processing and policy enforcement. This is fundamental to Cilium's architecture.
*   security control: Least Privilege: Cilium operates on the principle of least privilege, minimizing the permissions required for its components. Reflected in the RBAC configurations and deployment manifests.
*   security control: Runtime Security: Cilium integrates with Tetragon for runtime security enforcement and observability.
*   security control: Image signing: Cilium signs released container images.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Complexity of eBPF: While eBPF provides significant benefits, it also introduces complexity and potential security risks if not carefully managed. Cilium mitigates this through rigorous testing and code review.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on the Linux Kernel: Cilium's functionality depends on the security and stability of the underlying Linux kernel. Cilium tracks kernel vulnerabilities and recommends specific kernel versions.
*   accepted risk: Potential for Misconfiguration: Like any powerful tool, Cilium can be misconfigured, leading to security vulnerabilities. Cilium provides documentation and best practices to minimize this risk.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   high priority: Implement a comprehensive supply chain security solution, including software bill of materials (SBOM) generation and vulnerability scanning of all dependencies.
*   high priority: Enhance fuzzing efforts to cover a wider range of Cilium's components and features.
*   high priority: Develop and publish a detailed threat model for Cilium.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Cilium components must authenticate with each other using strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., mutual TLS).
    *   Integration with Kubernetes service accounts for pod-level authentication.
    *   Support for external authentication providers (e.g., SPIFFE/SPIRE) for workload identity.

*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained authorization controls for accessing Cilium API and Hubble.
    *   Integration with Kubernetes RBAC for managing access to Cilium resources.
    *   Least privilege principle for all Cilium components and agents.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all inputs to Cilium API and CLI.
    *   Validation of network policy configurations to prevent misconfigurations.
    *   Sanitization of data received from external sources.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols for encryption (e.g., AES-GCM, WireGuard).
    *   Secure key management practices for storing and managing encryption keys.
    *   Regular review of cryptographic implementations to ensure they are up-to-date with industry best practices.
