# Threat Model Analysis for cilium/cilium

## Threat: [Network Policy Bypass due to Policy Conflict](./threats/network_policy_bypass_due_to_policy_conflict.md)

**Description:** An attacker might craft network policies that, when combined with existing policies, create unintended permissive rules, allowing unauthorized traffic to bypass intended restrictions. This could involve exploiting the order of policy evaluation or using complex selectors that inadvertently overlap.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to services, data breaches, lateral movement within the network.

**Affected Component:** Cilium Network Policy Engine (specifically the policy resolution logic).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement thorough testing and validation of network policies, especially when combining multiple policies. Utilize policy validation tools and linters. Employ a "deny-all by default" approach and explicitly allow necessary traffic. Regularly review and simplify policy sets.

## Threat: [Service Spoofing via Compromised Service Identity](./threats/service_spoofing_via_compromised_service_identity.md)

**Description:** An attacker who compromises the identity (e.g., private key of an mTLS certificate) of a service can impersonate that service. They can then establish unauthorized connections to other services, potentially exfiltrating data or injecting malicious requests.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive resources, man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Affected Component:** Cilium Service Mesh (specifically the identity management and mTLS enforcement).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Enforce strict mutual TLS (mTLS) for all inter-service communication. Implement robust key management and rotation practices. Secure the storage and distribution of service certificates. Utilize secure enclaves or hardware security modules (HSMs) for key protection.

## Threat: [Malicious BPF Program Injection via Compromised Node](./threats/malicious_bpf_program_injection_via_compromised_node.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains root access to a node running the Cilium Agent could inject malicious BPF programs. These programs could bypass network policies, intercept traffic, exfiltrate data, or even cause kernel panics, disrupting the node and potentially the entire cluster.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the node, network disruption, data breaches, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Cilium Agent (specifically the BPF program loading and execution mechanism).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong node security measures, including regular patching and vulnerability scanning. Restrict access to nodes and limit the ability to load BPF programs. Implement security monitoring for unexpected BPF program loading. Utilize kernel module signing and verification.

## Threat: [Cilium Agent API Exploitation](./threats/cilium_agent_api_exploitation.md)

**Description:** If the Cilium Agent's API is exposed without proper authentication or authorization, an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the API to manipulate network policies, retrieve sensitive information about the network configuration, or even disrupt the agent's operation.

**Impact:** Network disruption, unauthorized policy changes, information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** Cilium Agent (specifically its API endpoints).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Secure the Cilium Agent's API with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., TLS client certificates, RBAC). Ensure the API is not publicly accessible. Keep the Cilium Agent updated to patch known API vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Traffic Interception via Sidecar Proxy Vulnerability](./threats/traffic_interception_via_sidecar_proxy_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** If the Envoy proxy used as a sidecar by Cilium has vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities to intercept and potentially modify traffic flowing through the proxy. This could lead to data breaches or the injection of malicious content.

**Impact:** Data breaches, man-in-the-middle attacks, injection of malicious payloads.

**Affected Component:** Cilium Service Mesh (specifically the Envoy proxy sidecar).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Keep Cilium and its dependencies, including the Envoy proxy, up-to-date with the latest security patches. Implement security best practices for container image hardening. Utilize security contexts and resource limits for sidecar containers.

## Threat: [Cilium Operator Compromise leading to Cluster-Wide Impact](./threats/cilium_operator_compromise_leading_to_cluster-wide_impact.md)

**Description:** If the Cilium Operator, responsible for managing Cilium deployments, is compromised, an attacker could potentially manipulate the Cilium configuration, deploy malicious components, or disrupt the entire Cilium infrastructure across the Kubernetes cluster.

**Impact:** Widespread network disruption, potential for complete control over network communication within the cluster.

**Affected Component:** Cilium Operator.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Secure the environment where the Cilium Operator is running. Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the Operator's API. Follow the principle of least privilege for Operator permissions. Regularly audit Operator configurations and deployments.

## Threat: [IPsec/WireGuard Key Compromise](./threats/ipsecwireguard_key_compromise.md)

**Description:** If the encryption keys used by Cilium for IPsec or WireGuard are compromised (e.g., due to weak key generation, insecure storage, or lack of rotation), an attacker could decrypt network traffic protected by these protocols.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the network.

**Affected Component:** Cilium Encryption (IPsec/WireGuard implementation).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust key management practices, including secure generation, storage, and rotation of encryption keys. Follow best practices for key exchange protocols. Utilize hardware security modules (HSMs) for key protection.
