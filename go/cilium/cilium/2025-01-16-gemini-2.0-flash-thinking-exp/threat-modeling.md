# Threat Model Analysis for cilium/cilium

## Threat: [Policy Bypass due to Misconfigured L3/L4 Rules](./threats/policy_bypass_due_to_misconfigured_l3l4_rules.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit incorrectly configured Cilium network policies (L3/L4) to bypass intended restrictions and gain unauthorized network access to pods or services. This might involve crafting packets that match overly permissive rules or exploiting gaps in policy definitions.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, lateral movement within the cluster, potential compromise of workloads.
*   **Affected Component:** Cilium Agent (Policy Enforcement Module)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a "default deny" policy approach.
    *   Thoroughly test and validate network policies before deployment.
    *   Use policy linters and validation tools.
    *   Regularly audit and review network policy configurations.
    *   Employ network policy logging and monitoring to detect anomalies.

## Threat: [Identity Spoofing Leading to Policy Bypass](./threats/identity_spoofing_leading_to_policy_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could compromise the identity of a pod (e.g., Kubernetes Service Account) and use this spoofed identity to bypass network policies that are based on pod selectors or namespaces. This might involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how Cilium maps Kubernetes identities to its own.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources intended for the spoofed identity, potential data breaches, privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:** Cilium Agent (Identity Management, Policy Enforcement)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Kubernetes Service Account tokens.
    *   Implement workload identity solutions (e.g., Azure AD Workload Identity, AWS IAM Roles for Service Accounts) to strengthen identity binding.
    *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization for accessing Kubernetes APIs.
    *   Regularly rotate service account credentials.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Cilium's Encryption Implementation](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_cilium's_encryption_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could leverage known or zero-day vulnerabilities in Cilium's encryption mechanisms (e.g., IPsec, WireGuard, Transparent Encryption) to decrypt network traffic, potentially intercepting sensitive data in transit.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive application data, potential regulatory compliance violations.
*   **Affected Component:** Cilium Agent (Encryption Modules - IPsec, WireGuard, Transparent Encryption)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Cilium updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
    *   Monitor Cilium security advisories and apply recommended updates promptly.
    *   Use strong and recommended encryption algorithms and key lengths.
    *   Ensure proper key management and rotation practices.

## Threat: [Compromise of Cilium Operator Leading to Control Plane Manipulation](./threats/compromise_of_cilium_operator_leading_to_control_plane_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the Cilium Operator could manipulate Cilium's configuration, deploy malicious policies, or disrupt the control plane, potentially affecting the entire cluster's network security.
*   **Impact:** Widespread network disruptions, complete bypass of network policies, potential for cluster-wide compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Cilium Operator
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the Kubernetes namespace where the Cilium Operator is deployed.
    *   Implement strong RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for accessing the Cilium Operator.
    *   Limit access to the Operator's deployment and configuration.
    *   Monitor the Operator's logs and activities for suspicious actions.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Cilium BPF Programs](./threats/manipulation_of_cilium_bpf_programs.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges on a node running the Cilium Agent could potentially manipulate the eBPF programs used by Cilium for network filtering and monitoring. This could lead to policy bypass, data injection, or kernel-level exploits.
*   **Impact:** Complete bypass of network security, potential kernel compromise, data manipulation.
*   **Affected Component:** Cilium Agent (eBPF Programs)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict access to the nodes running Cilium Agents.
    *   Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized modification of files on the node.
    *   Utilize signed and verified eBPF programs.
    *   Monitor eBPF program loading and behavior.

## Threat: [Sidecar Injection Vulnerabilities (If Using Cilium Service Mesh)](./threats/sidecar_injection_vulnerabilities__if_using_cilium_service_mesh_.md)

*   **Description:** If the process of injecting Envoy sidecar proxies by Cilium is vulnerable, an attacker could potentially inject malicious sidecars into pods, gaining control over the pod's network traffic and potentially the pod itself.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of individual pods, interception and manipulation of service-to-service communication.
*   **Affected Component:** Cilium Agent (Sidecar Injection Mechanism)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the Kubernetes admission controllers used by Cilium for sidecar injection.
    *   Implement strong validation and verification of injected sidecar images.
    *   Use a secure and trusted sidecar injector.
